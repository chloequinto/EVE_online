blaster brutix is fail it will die fast once locked  active tank is pretty crap unless you solo 1v1   a cane will orbit a brutix even when scrammed   a harb will simply demolish the brutix no need to move around it can kill it before it flies away   if you solo in a brutix you failed use a myrmidon with acspulse next time so yes blasters sucks ass they have hard time tracking an orbiting bs in optimalrailguns or failguns will prolly hit for 366 damage something moving at 4050km again a pulse can do the same with just more damagemake blaster shotgun like weapon ofc not aoe just massive damage thats whats supposed to be also railguns is lame to deal thermal damage explosive is more likely since railguns use projectile ammo in reallity that is

this thread can really take off if everybody in support of it makes an active effort to get the word outlinking the thread in alliance or corp chat and asking your best buddies to vote support it they dont have to legitimately support it as long as you can coach them and their alts to blank reply support the thread then its worth it if the only thing we succeed in is getting the csm to mention futanaridescribe it then this thread will be well worth it if somebody can figure out an htlm link that causes the user to make a blank post with support ticked then link it here that way you can get anybody who is logged in to vote support it with a single click
this is a worthy cause

supporting the idea that destroyers need to be serious ships that can actually do what the description says cormorant is an exception in the pattern of descriptions one idea to help the rebalancing would be to switch the role bonus from optimal to tracking this then allows the skill bonuses to be better tailored to the individual races needs
not supportedthis is what separates the great minds from the common masses the 2 year old player with no learning skills and the month old noob able to learn anything fast to do this would harm eve in the wors way possible by making it safer easier brighter it would be unevelike
what about possibly rearranging learning skills instead of a  to attributes maybe it instead gives a boost to train a specific skill group of your choice and instead of a actively earned skill make it a passively gained bonus given to people after a certain subscription age with a max of 5 groups with a bonusthis way instead of rewarding you for spending time else ware it rewards you for staying with the gamewhat i mean is after a character has been subscribed for 1 month 6 months 1 year 15 years and finally 2 years gets a bonus to train a skill group it rewards those who stay with the game and this does not include unsubscribed time ie have the account for 2 years with no subscription nor would a break in the time affect it example you subscribe for 6 months take off 3 months and then subscribe again for 9 months would mean you get the 1 month 6 month  and 1 year bonusi doubt i was clear enough for others to understand but what of that as a possibility although im probably crazy and that is ok to
it is the best idea yet

propose 2 wardec mechanics change1 current 5 mil dec cost bounty from 5 bs rats is a joke rise it to at least 100 mil per corp 2 hours of carebearing by 1 person2 abolish cost increase for additional decs in favor of a flat feecurrently empire wardecs consist of countless 3man front corps supported by tons of neut rrs grieving noob corps with noob corps disbanding and reforming to avoid dec the whole mechanics is broken and easily manipulated by both sideschanges would encourage formation of more large merc alliances deccing many large corps and fighting real wars the higher fee floor would make noob corps not worth deccing the flat fee would make large merc corpsalliances worth forming
1 yes2 no in fact the scale should be maintained at the new prices paying to avoid concord intervention and fighting in lowsecnullsec should come at a price its too easy to grief and abuse the system as it iswar decs should be expensive and even your proposed prices just arent enough in my bookto easy to get that kind of moneythis doesnt even come close to wholly fixing wardecs but its a startconclusion  not supported
no too expensiveyes alsoyesliang
all you people that belive this should put pass it over already its puff puff pass not puff puff and puff some moreno one that is not already willing to go to low sec will go they will always find ways around going though low sec even if that means having multable ships and gear in each empire they wish to do bussness with and seting up jump clones
i support this but only if the boundaries are expanded ie more bottleneck systems
we clearly need to screw up eve economy for the sole purpose of giving a handful of ppl more kms
yes please
i highly doubt this would occur if people went to caldari space then the value of caldari faction items would tank and the other empires faction items would greatly increase sooner or later even the most die hard carebear would muster up the courage to get in an empty pod and shuttle through low sec to get the better lp rewards
there is one quick fix to help low sec missioning given the current mechanics of the game stronger station defenseseasier undocking or remote mission completionyou can make certain ships very hard to impossible to scan down easiest on the t3 ships the problem is having to dock and undock to complete missions the station becomes a choke pint where player pirates can lock you down while only having to face a couple of pitiful station gunsif you had a fighting chance to get out of a station to do a mission more people would do them i think
that 8 is made up of various alts while their mains that they spend most of the time on are in highnull its misleadinglowsec missions are no go if your big fat pve fit bs can be scanned down in seconds rewards wont help if there is no means of collecting it before mission scanning carebears were in lowsec then it got implemented and they all left the new population balancing feature that made lowsec missioners go through more gatecamps is one more nail in the coffin you can come up with whatever solution you want only one will work there was a time when lowsec wasnt barren before mission scanning and load balancing got implemented we already know what works all thats left is to restore things back to its last known working state
supporting this low sec needs helpanother option is to move all l4 agents with quality higher than 0 to low sec
i like this idea betterthis thread should cost you 50m
the solution for the nap train issue will have to come from ccp no matter how good an idea and in no way am i saying this is a good one sorry to change how it nap works the current players that are involved in naps will do everything in their power to make sure it does not changei mean think about it if your in the huge nap train making isk hand over fist would you want that to change and your income to drop would you want to have to work at actually making isk of course notthe only ones that have a problem with the nap train are those who prefer pvp and the good fights everyone else wants it to stay the sameonly thing we can do is wait for ccp to save the game from itself before the entire game is 95 blue with each otheri of course expect everyone part of the nap train to smack me with npc alts claiming there is nothing wrong with the current situation anyone that is part of the nap train that actually speaks out openly about wanting less blues is immediatly silenced by being kicked or threatenednow it is getting to the point where i dont blame alliances for signing up on the nap train list to have a chance in 00 the idea of an alliancecorp trying to carve out a piece of 00 without blueing up a bunch of other alliances is simply not possiblethere are nothing in the game that discourages this having dozens upon dozens of blues is simply saferbut like i said above if you want in 00 then you have no choice in the matter
with my ideaand using your aliance as an example i believe you have 3000 members in ur alliancesay you want to blue corp a 70 members alliance a 700 members and alliance b 1500 membersyou will be paying approx 13b per month corp a will be paying 307b a month alliance a will pay 37b a month and alliance b will pay 45b a monththat is costly and would definetley fix the nap trains and we wouldnt have north vrs south wed have more like tribal wars in a way maybe 2 alliances controls region a and 2 alliances controls region b and we get smaller more server capable fights
what makes you think it needs fixing ppl blue other ppl because they want to maybe they dont want to fight just because you want them to youre always free to fight everyone else stop trying to force other ppl do what you want theyll just find another way and it wont work in the end
lets check your thought processnap train are bad for 00  we should change them  add a blue chargeyou are missing a piece high sec and low sec allinces corporations and individuals have people set to blue so your idea will not change much for 00 alliances that will keep the blue to lue standing up and still make plenty of isk from 00 resources but will screw up low sechigh sec alliances and corp and that are making way lessso instead of curing 00 you infect low sec and high sec smart
unsupportedyou cant put a fee on people agreeing not to shoot each other all that will happen with your proposal is people will go back to the old days of keeping a writtendown list of friendly corps and theyll consult that before deciding to fireit improves nothing
this would make things worse i do not support this
or they can ignore that mechanism and use other means say forums voice chats irc hell even xfire to make those naps happen without having to pay and the only people that got affected are the high sec corpalliances who have real life friends in other corpsalliances that have nothing to do with blab warfareyou cant stop human natureand i personnaly dont think that it will ever get to all 00 blue again its human nature what happens when a power becomes to powerfull and too big think of what hapened to the roman empire
um no
this idea has no redeeming qualities
maybe but lowhi sec alliances and corps are much smaller and would require a much smaller feemaybe make this fee for sov holding alliances only thenthey could do that yes but now they dont have access to each others jump bridges docking rights etcthe fact that you can rarely ever get good fights anymore its always massive blobs and server lag its no fun its a huge deterrent for most people to go to 00some alliances have allies they dont even see ever cuz their too far away or a blue that does nothing for them in real life most countries that are allied do trades with each other but in this game thats not true you just buy from jita there should be some limit to how much blue you can havei dont believe all of 00 will go blue but my idea will bring more pvp and it wont make it impossible to make isk either alliances would probably also start weeding out there inactives and we would have more accurate numbers on how many people they actually have i also think this idea would effectively get rid of pet alliances because their would be no profit for them you know the people who have 00 but dont deserve it at all also a big reason that big alliances can afford so many super capitals
what if corp a in this big bad sov holding 00 alliance wants to set a particular high sec care bear indy hauling corp as blue so they can haul their stuff up to jita for themdoes corp a have to pay billions of isk to set care bears anon wonder if thats really a corp out there to blue
no because you dont need standings to do a courier contract and if your referring to a carebear hauling corp that goes to sov holding alliance as outpost and hauls to jita im pretty sure that sort of corp doesnt exist but if they do want standings then yes they would have to pay not like you need standings in hi sec anyway
yes i mean if care bears anon flew through gates camped by corp a theyd set them blue so they wouldnt get toastedso youre saying they would have to pay
yes but that doesnt mean much because this is an unlikely scenario most big bad sov holding alliances have their own jump freighters  t2 hauler alts the ones that dont would be small enuff to afford the standings or maybe neutral carebear corp could join the alliancehowever if carebear corp anon wants to blue hisec pvp corp anon they would not have to pay because neither hold any sov
we have one other smallish alliance set blue and i still think your idea has no redeeming qualities whatsoever eve is a sandbox stop imposing artificial limits on emergent gameplaywhat needs fixing isnt really how many people are blue its that the actual fights are too biased by sheer numbers
not supported but i do agree that the napfests are ghey
ittwe should tax people for having friends
in the past it was risky to jump in titans without a support fleet because you cant kill the hics  dics in time by now the titan is that kind of uber ship wow kiddys are asking about so my suggestion is give the hic a new role bonus wich reduces the dd damage done by titans to the old values
whaaaaaa my cruiser cant hold a 50 billion isk ship so i must try the nerfhammereither your fleet wasnt ready to back you up or they kill off your hics and logoffskiedjumped
whaaaaa my cruiser cant do what it is designed for think before post dude
hic isnt a counter titan ship
your doing it wrong kidcant take the heat get the  out of the kitchennot supportedps hics have notoriously strong tanks for a reason obviously your not ready to fly them or you dont fly them properly they are fleet ships as well not solowtfpwnmobilesunless your that goodps2 and if your cryingemoraging over getting ddd by a titan not even a carrier is supposed to survive that duhhh answer  have more than one hic in the group do some histroy reading on titan take downs not that hard to figure out
i have a terrific mental image of the millennium falcon getting shot in the face by the death star superlaser except when the dust settles han and chewie are standing there grinningespecially since titan dd is now targeted why would you ever imagine that anything as small as a cruiser hull could withstand a hit
sounds cool anything to kill some capscromo stop posting in bold you look like a moron
good idealess insurance  donenow more sc deaths
i support anything that kills caps faster
i support anything that will kill caps
really they are id love to see the proof of that fact is when one side fields 20 supers the other side isnt likely to field 21 and say ok lets have a go at it theyre too expensive to risk losing half your fleet to kill the full other fleet for supers do not fit the role that the dreadcarrier proliferation of old fill simply put they dont have a role they just do it all well to a point where the only risk involved in using supers is your own pilots stupidity the idea has failed horribly and sadly it doesnt even seem to be on the radar of ccp to rebalance again even most reasonable people will admit theyre overpowered see shc then you have the doom pilots who think that there is such a thing as end game and they all want to be in it hence theyre constant refusal for changes like this one i dont particularly think it should be disruptors but the 75km scrams im cool with easy to out range on top of being easy for a super to kill so not much added risk but a bit
i really dont see why people are so upset at this suggestion if the pos is unmanned then you can clear any and all tackle and offensive mods on you in about 20 seconds its p easy
this  10if this is implemented it may make the above moaners to the idea think twice about dropping an avatar and a nyx on a lone drake which they do with regularity they want to keep the status quo of their risk free pvp so supportedalsoas this is their preferred mohow can a normal alliance member tell the difference between an questionable blue and a non questionable blue
maybe we want people to play the game tackle things and not stupid possesthis whole change would just make it safer for idiots who dont scout we dont need to support those darwin handles them nicely
yes supers need to die more no vuks proposal is not the way to do itthe problem with supers is not that pos batteries dont scramble them its because they can log off when tackled and in trouble and usually live that wayvuks proposal is simply a way of preventingmaking harder the hotdropping of stuff on a pos effectively making 00 safer for carebears it does not by any means ensure the dying of more supers the net result is probably that they will get used less again and carebears can use jump bridgesbeacons with less chance of getting their stuff ganked again no thank you i saynow the proliferation of supers without them dying is a serious issue so yes they need to die instead of vuks proposal which doesnt serve to solve the problem mentioned i would rather propose to change log off mechanics so that any ship that is tackled will not disappear from space when it logs off effectively eliminating the use of logging off to gtfo while in combat
oh hell yeah
yes because its hugely challenging to log an alt into a system each day with a cloak and a cyno go to work come back go to the store come back and just wait until you feel like being activethats real fair for the guys doing the proper scouting to know 1 is it a legit alt 2 is it active 3 does it have a cyno ready how is shutting down a system of travel afking all day fair or in any way actively playing as you just phrased it tell ya what fix cloaks fix hp fix a few other things about moms and we can forget the point on the tower although i kinda like it too
interesting idea but i dont think it is a good one  the whole point of these ships is that they have immunity apart from to hicsdics it isnt all that easy to get one and so the benefits should be great if it was a manned gunner device it may work better but the simple fact is that if you are patient enough to camp for a capital gank for hours then you should be able to get a reward either way i think that people really should just be more careful when moving caps through bridges and gensmost large alliances are awful at scouting and i do agree with whoever said this seems like a boost to the lazy and carebears of 00
see that kind of attitude is the exact reason why ccp should not implement that idealet me give you one small hint a dual web rapier gets your cap shipsfreighter away from a pos in no time
actually its that kind of stupidity that is why ccp should not listen to a person of your intelligence first your asking for a dual accouter now your asking for a dual accounter with the 2nd account specifically trained for a particular race and a particular ship and finally youre leaving out the fact that a hic or dic can bubble instantly and  or cloak removing the ability to beat it with the system load working in the attackers advantage over the defender  sake already shut up and allow average gamers to play the game already wo you wanting to epeen over everything with your overpowered toys you seem to not mention that you can go in at any time of day with your supers and incap those mods forcing them to be repped constantly for multiple times the amount of time
although you have a point this is not the solutionif a ship is tackled without aggression they emergency warp to safety after 1 minute this is a good safety measure atm it should not change although some one may deliberately log off to save their ship there is also legitimate disconnectsatm if a ship aggresses then logs you have 15 minutes to kill it plenty of time you say which it is if you are trying to kill an aeon with 2 rifters and a thorax you are doing it wrongthe tackling isnt the problem the problem is to catch a sc you need the right ships in the right places at all times now expecting someone to man hics and dictors 24 hrs a day on jb poss and cyno poss is ridiculous who wants to spend their game time doing thatvuks suggestion is a middle ground the pos will tackle the sc the home defense force will mobilise if quick enough to mobolise they will catch the sc still tackled by the pos disruptor most of the time they will not get there in time and the sc will be in a safe spot cloaked waiting out its aggression the amount of alliances that could muster up such a fleet to snare that sc in time before the mods are destroyed are very fewalso take into account scs get tackled quite frequently killing them is the hard part
a long while ago i logged in one day and saw a notification that stated i 2 days left for my subscription thanks i thought to myself as i quickly went to my eve account page and canceled my sub so my card would not be overdrawnenter today with so many people living paycheck to paycheck it would be an excellent idea to reimplement this notification as to save time lost waiting for a paycheck as of this writing i have a character inactive because i did not have the cash to pay for the account and now my bank account is overdrawn because it attempted to take cash out not to mention now i must wait for ccp to temporarily reenable my account so that i may apply a plex card all of this hassle and headache could be avoided by added a simple 5 days remain before autopaymentplex end whatever the wording happens to bei saw this once right after dominion was released where has this notification gone trial accounts still get the 14 days left notification why dont paying customers get a similar notification
i agree with saithe on this one
theres a lot of talk on this subjectapparently that warning only applies for a select few playersi think you have to set up monthly payments using a major credit card during a full moon between the hours of noon and 2 pm on alternating thursdaysotherwise it doesnt show up for you sorry
great idea this saves a lot of hassle on player and ccp side 1 for supportered
saithe speaks the truthi support this
1nothing is more annoying when undocking from a station knowing there is an enemy waiting outside and you have to sort and start the right drones in the few valuable seconds when you got 1000 other things to do
im not wanting free kills i never said make them easily scannable either but when someone has a prover who has trained to the top of their skills and alls w implants its an imbalance in mechanics if someone is cloaked they cant fight most ships cant even warp pro vs con balance obtained and we can move on running in an unprobable tengu ok u lose some dps but your cant be probed you get higher payouts and you shed some dps not much of a balance the prober in our corp is topped out on skills he can only hit a 50 on a t3 meaning no chance of sucess so whay should a pilot be able to roam freely in a ship thats unscannable isnt that part of the reason lowsec missions are more lucrative in the first place allowing for the extra danger of doing it are you saying that its unreasonable to watch local and check for probes every so often to cover your back again no one said it had to be easy to scan one out but atleast make it possable to do it not impossable
wall of text ftwok so you want ships that cant be made 100 undetectablewellhow about we also reduce the effects on reppers why should ships be able to mount enough regen to be impossible to killhow about we also reduce the effects of tracking and speed on weapon systems why should ships be impossible to hithow about we also reduce the amount of sp on toons who make bullsht whiny threads on the forums why should it be impossible to browse the forums without seeing tearsmost agree cloaks are the counter to probes but these forums are jam packed with threads whining and btching about how cloaks should be nerfed so here comes unprobeable ships which arent cloaked but are still making everyone dock up and hide from the boogeyman in localrestricting game mechanics so they can be probed down no matter what means its impossible to avoid combatso do they live with the impossible or do you
most ships that people complain about as unprobeable end up being cloaked ships ive never understood this complain about t3 ships as they can be fit with cloaks that will have the same effect someone in system warp cloak and doesnt gimp the fit
lol if you cant break the tank change ships no ship has an impossable tank that cannot be broken if you think thats true then you need to think outside the box no tank is unbreakableno ship is impossable to hit either they can be hard to hit or even catch but not impossable it simply takes a diffrent setup like webs tracking computer drones or missles no such this is impossable to hitsp  time in game training w paid subas you can see there are counters to evereything you said or in the case of sp the trade off is you pay ccp money for several years to make 50 mill sp timemoney vs high spas for the cloak again the balance is they are not in combat or doing anything but cloaked unprobable has little to no trade off and the ability to defeat simple game mechanics explain how this is such a horrable concept for you to grasp
shall i also explain what spell check does tooto make a ship unprobeable they have to boost the sensor res significantly that involved using a combination of implants rigs modules all of which means theyre missing out using something else for the sake of avoiding being tracked down and ganked theyre giving up being better at their jobsrisk vs reward is chanted in here daily well they want to avoid risks so theyre missing out on some of the rewards they could have had with a better fit
you mean it takes them 5 min more to do their mission cry some more why dont ya if you canthack it in low sec and 00 maybe you should find a diffrent agent i hear motsu has great agent will never have to set foot in low sec as far as setting up your ship it didnt look all that complicated to me alot less complicated than trying to rig implant train equipment to scann effecently last i checked eve was one of the most unforgiving pvp games out there maybe you should try warcraft im told you simply respawn over there and have no repercussions from a loss
mmmmpizzacomment is as relevant as thread
it is terrible when someone takes a dump in your cheerios your cheerios being the ability to scan down someone youve made into your white whale oh the humanity

good point it should also cost 5 billion isk to leave a corp if its war decedliang
you call the thread rebalance of power but fail to mention which powers exactly you want to rebalance mind clarifying thathighsec declarations should be expensive very expensive one has to assume rp pov they are allowed to give corporations the option of physically dismantling a competitor when softer measures failskyrocket the price and a majority of the griefing will subsidegatestationguns are a joke all they are capable of is preventing the lone frigate hull from pirating once 2 pirates with drones are present they become a nuisance at best remove or enhanceincrease damage by a huge margin add extreme tracking to swat frigsdrones and bs class signature resolution  make them pack a wallop so that being hit does more than tickle when in plate cruiser and upremove security hits when not on grid with anything that can report it ie gates guns stations  out of sight out of mind
i like it
not needed if you want agility fit nanos or whatever maybe drop a strip and fit a cloak instead gimps volume but can keep you alive 23 is better than a wreckeven if it were a good idea i dont think situational ship bonuses like that based on standings would be good to introduce on principleto give it as you said people would set up an alt corp just to get a massive agility boost
this make sense1
supporting sokratesz oh well she has some good idea sometime
reporting to you live from pure blind where a 550 fleet battle is going on and i cant do what will it cost ccp to install one of these nodes on all nullsec systems or highfrequented ones
true ccp stop introducing new features till you dont solve lag issues
i dont really see the point in playing this game any more id rather play chess via email than this
we can do our fights in jita then
1 system vs how many null sec systemssome how i seriously doubt they will be able to pull that offthat and they arent going to do jack  for over a year with there obsession over spacebook and incarana oh and dust as welldont get me wrong i want it fixed as well but lets be realistic herethis wasnt an issue back in the days of apoc from what i recall what changed thats the kicker there
sure just bribe concord i mean war dec each other
i agree ccp should fix lag we dont need beautiful graphics
haha yea we need the new jita node over herei just hope someone anounced this fleet if not managment is to blame beside ccp
its not even playable this is silly i cant even shootccp buy a jita size node for every system or do something clever to make the load shiftable during some other time than downtime
ive been waiting to warp for 2 mins
this is insanely ridiculous it takes 10x times too long to lock a target just to be able to sling 3 missiles every 5 minutes my suggestion all 300k active members boycott ccp for one month and not resub see if losing 45m opens their eyes to fix this travesty that they call a game
how many plex are sitting on the market all across the universeevery one of those is a months sub already paid upi dont think theyd notice
does that include the rest of us that dont do blobs
honestly 500 people in a system needed to be reinforced predominion as well if this wasnt a reinforced node than your leadership is to blame not ccp
use all the derogatory remarks and smilies you want  see i know how to use them too but the fact is that ccp should have the hardware in place and the software optimized in the event that a fight of any substantial size is going to take place this is not something that just started happening its something that has been ongoing for a very long time now and ccp is doing nothing more than throwing a few token developers on it having them write the occasional blog entry and run a mass testing event every other week and saying theyre working on it but theyre not they have pushed it to the side in favor of their more ambitious plans and expansions which if sov warfare is any indication will be total  as well ruining game play for many causing them to quit and eventually eve will no longer be self sufficientyour implied solution of no blob warfare just simply isnt feasible and would end up castrating one if not both or all participating sides in an engagement eve has touted that its the largest mmorpg universe where you dont have to play on individual shards and this in itself infers that you have more players available in your universe as more players are introduced into an environment the greater your chance of combat becomes and more fights leads the greater chance of more people being involved furthermore these conflicts not only affect the system in which the spacial anomalies occuer i love how ccp colors lag to sound like its a feature of game mechanics maybe theyre closet microsoft fanbois but it also affects other systems throughout new eden for the last 10 minutes ive been trying to load the station in the system next door to where a fight is currently raging with 500 pilots and i still havent seen the local nor any of my chat windows i am unable to bring up my ship or items hangars so i can reship and get back in the fight i am unable to undock i am unable to do anything the game is currently completely useless to meffs i have to be a sick masochist to keep coming back for this  every day if the concept of eve wasnt the greatest id ever heard and ive been playing video games on the computer since the early 80s i wouldnt still be here but i guess the truth is that since i am still here ccp has no incentive to fix the problem knowing that if i havent left now that i probably wont be leaving anytime soon
i seem to recall ccp having a way to schedule a fight so they could set up extra resources for big fleet battlesof course that would mean that the cloaked recon with the cyno waiting for orders before lighting it up and bringing in the 500 ships would have to file the proper request first
you wanna help fixing lag then i guess see you tomorrow on singularity to help with testing that would be way more productive than crying on the forums
youre right there is one 
its just as well that all 00 alliances are true gentlemen and do this properlyagreeing a location then a time and expected numbersshiptypes in advance before relaying all this information to ccp if only everybody else could get their heads around the concept of either prearranging a gentlemans dual to decide sov youre a moron
you now realize the jita node is being tested which means theyre seeing if it works if it does theyll put it on all of eve

nope still the most op gun in the gamealthough it is fun sneaking up on them as scout and using fan to send them to the other side of the map
anyone else here think it would be a good idea to actually be able to trade shares of corporations that deal mainly in industry and trading through an in game stock exchange
you know when a corps stocks are about to drop when you dec it
no too easy to abuse does not add valueassets are too easy to take from a corp or transfer to a new altcorpwhatever and the stock exchange as you know it only works due to federal regulation large threats not unlike the sword of damocles and other issues not relevant to eve and apparently beyond your feeble understanding of economics
i first replied thinking it was eanm but this well they are hardly used anyway i think there are more regeratives added to ship because of misclicks then out of intentalso cdfe look somewhat similar to trimarks what with 15 more shield this also adds recharge with the shields and 50 calibration
i do not support this
no people already abuse them by ditching them at stations gates etc why make it easier for them
his idea isnt to get another rookie ship every time you press the button his idea is to make the system work so you wont get one at all until you do it would work like it does now with only one given whenever you dock at a station with no ships and in a pod only it wouldnt be automatic his proposal is simply i dont want it give me the option to not receive it
he didnt say that nor did he say the free tritanium should be removed because i dont doubt some people will request a free rookie ship take the tritanium then trash it push the button repeat alternatively there would be a time limit on how often one would be permitted to request a free rookie ship instead of removing the gift of 1 unit of tritanium but again he nor you his interpreter said that
 i dont think players want to lose their excel in spacesome one tell me this is a joke
look from everything i have read the csm is a paper tigerno teeth no claws and has to have every meal prechewed for it hell it cant even roar convincinglycsm  meowcough coughsorry thats how i feel

i linked the raw logs from meeting 006 in that thread but here they are again  wiki  csm database
we requested devblog related to pi and all shiny numbers about it hopefully there will be blue graphs as well hopefully it will see the light of the day soontm
fool that i am i will cut against the grain of this very popular thread i think the op does make some good points i will just post a bit of my own perspective i think ccp has done an excellent job and a very reasonable job of balancing new features versus fixing old featureswormholes are a relatively new feature if ccp were to continue to only work on fw and sovereignty until it was perfect this may not have been developed i really dont go in wh myself but i recognize that ccp did a good thing by adding this new featurethey have done several minor fixesnew features to faction war in apoc 15 they also added new rig changes which i think they did an excellent job on the new faction ships are well balanced sure some complain about the dramiel being overpowered however considering the numbers of ships that ccp updated or created the fact that only one of the ships is even controversial shows that they did an excellent job they created or upgraded over a dozen ships to make them playable and yet the players are just hung up on why they cant fly a hawk or a corm personally i agree with ccps decision about what made the game more enjoyable keep in mind it does take time to fully evaluate what exactly should be done to make fw or any other feature better although there have been many threads on fw the recommendations of the players are often contradictory accordingly i think ccps limited and cautious actions with respect to fw is reasonable sure certain bugs could be fixed regarding occupancy plexing but lets face it very few in faction war really do plexing correcting the bugs will not lead to many more people doing occupancy plexing more needs to be done than that how much more and what exactly i have my own ideas but suffice it to say this is a very controversial topic there is no obvious fix that would make everyone thrilled to do occupancy plexing that goes for fw are the other things more clear cut do we know exactly how treaties should work do we know exactly how sovereignty should work i really dont play in that area of the game but i would guess that is still somewhat controversial the focus on incarna is disappointing to me 18 months to develop this feature is not really what i would like to see but in a way they are taking the ops advice they are saying we are going to an excellent job with incarna and so we will lengthen the cycle to 18 months personally i wish they would just spit something out there that would take a team of 4 devs 6 months to work on
my absolute biggest issue fix it
this issue is far older and almost as important as the lagplease fix this how much input do you need before you take action
this is an excellent writeup im taking this to our next csm meeting
chicks with dividens is now a meme
i honestly dont knowi would say yes but its not because my mind is corrupted by dirty images of women yknow makin some love i would say yes because if youre going to make eve as realistic as possible then go ahead and show something revealingim edging towards no though first off even though this is a game for those mature enough to understand it and not die of boredom some kids do play it and enjoy it like any person out there showing exotic dancers while theres a pos just gets em banned from the game by their parents and ruins the fun im pretty young myself but i dont mind since ill run into nudity somehow besides i dont see the point in putting revealing features in eve if the main point is to fly a ship mine shoot people and dominate the sandbox but opinions are opinions and i dont support itits not a bad topic though some people do enjoy inappropriate things and nothing can stop them from watching it maybe you should make a petition for ccp to agree to this or not
i fixed that for you also there is nothing inappropriate about transgendered individuals or futanari for that matter ccp has shown through storyline and chronicles that futa is a regular fixture in gallente society although i have to admit your post was way way more intelligent then i expected it to be considering i found you in couster

are you implying that people dont use rr on stations in nulllow sechell no that would make it completely unreasonable for individualssmall groups to carry on decs by the way thats not the base dec cost you obviously have no experience with decs why are you proposing changes
dec cost is 2 mil not 5 its been quite a while since they changed it not that the difference matters they are both pocket change100 mil is still too little if its to be a flat fee its nothing for any individual more than a few weeks old not to mention large merc corps or those that hire them if you cant afford so little isk you shouldnt be deccing wars
fix risk vs reward in highsec and lownullsec and therell suddenly be less grieferextortionist corps problem solved a lot of griefing corps are expirates who got sick of hunting other pirates and noobs killing other pirates isnt really piracy so when they figured that out they became highsec griefersbut yeah wardecced corps should be able to let one merc corpalliance join for free
wardec cost should depend on the target corp player count standing to concord faction standing average securty status average player sp and so onthat way to wardec a small pvp corp costs pocket changemaybe even free if sec status totally screwed but deccing some newbie carebear mission runners would cost alot like 250mil

really simplemake your drones in space work like the watch list in fleets ie if drones are being shot at they will flash redits fairly easy to keep an eye on them at the minute but often if your drone is being shot at you wont know until they start taking propper damage and by the time they get back to your drone bay are into half armorhaving them flash red would be give you a couple extra seconds to recall them
no i have no interest in dealing with lowsec at this time id appreciate not being herded there for other players benefit
oh god yesif certain asteroids would only spawn in certain empires then you would have to haul minerals from all the 4 empires to build a ship prices would change and you could actually make money on trading please for the love of all that is eve make it happen
you dont have to thats just where the highest profit would be
well no if the only way to build ships is to get 4 different types of minerals and if these 4 different types of minerals can only be found in large enough quantities in the 4 different empires then every ship that is build will need to have come from all the 4 empires the local mineral would be worthless as everyone would be mining it but to build something you would still need to get minerals from the other three empires and prices for those mineral will be highsomeone could then haul these minerals through lowsec for loads of profitif people want to stay in highsec fine nobody is forcing them they can run lvl4s all they want but i dont see why they need to get ed at the idea of there being another way of making more isk for those willing to risk more
not supported because mara rinn said it bestforcing trades to go through lowsec will in the long run move highsec dwellers to caldari spaceempire dwellers choose the path of least resistance they wont go through lowsec
low and null is already where the highest profits are planets moon mining mineral deposits lots of people dont go there because of many of the people posting here in support of this idea are waiting at gate camps to destroy themi dont have anything against piracy but the pirates who whine endlessly on these forums about low sec and the lack of players are getting tiresome they spend hours and hours at gate camps and roaming low sec to make it a dangerous place for people and then cry when no one wants to go therethe low sec dwelling eve pirate a bigger group of self defeating forum cry babies you will never seei have much more respect for groups like tears who bring it to high sec instead of moaning about a lack of targets and trying to force people where they dont want to go
none of those will help they all focus on either buff lowsec rewards or nerf highsec rewards to make lowsec look better in comparison bottom line is it will still require a bs staying at lowsec mission site for a long time more than enough to scan it down and kill it if youre lucky and warp off you abandon the mission and take standing hit pretty soon you wont be able to use the agent anymorethe solution is not to buff rewards but increase safety to a point where missioners can complete enough missions to make up for the standing hits when missions fail as result of being ganked in order to keep running lowsec missions otherwise all the rewards in the world wont make a difference rewards have to cover ship replacements tooa way to do this is making all lowsec missions similar to fw missions
so er this means  red is the new bluegood way to get rid of nbsi itll be nrsi then
i think you dont get what i whant i dont whant the hic to be a pwn mobile i whant it to do what it is designed for pin down a titan if you have ever taken place in a big fleet fight i guess not since your post shows me you havent any idea about whats going on there you would know atm there isnt any chance of pinning down a cuple of titans because they will blow up all hics you got in a couple of seconds my idea of fixing that problem is giving the hic a role bonus which reduce the dd damge to the old aoe value this means you can still blow up hics with a titan but you will need more dd for a hic btw the reason why the hic got this insane resist bonus is that it is able to survive a dd so stop  posting
hics were brought in to counter ewar immune mother ships terrorizing low sec they were not introduced to counter titans edit the main point of a hic is to pin down an ewar immune ship focused script and hold it there as long as it can big tank thats all
moms and other titans are the titan counter get over the fact that your cruiser died to a superior weapon platform this is eve htfu
ive never lost a ship to a titan so stfu with such comments nearly no one of you has ever been part of a big fleet fight so why are you posting about things you dont know about i guess no one of you has ever seen a titan you are taking about game mechanics you dont understand so please stop posting on things you dont know
use a light dictor to hold super caps warp in drop bubble mwd out rinse and repeat titans cant dd light dictors cos they move too fast
if youve never lost a ship to a titan why did you make a thread to complain about italso if you want to tackle a titan bring 2 hics if a carrier cant take a dd why should your cruiser be able to and dont bring that bull that it was meant to tackle titans because it can also tackle every other ship in the game
dds dont take transversal or sig radius into account you could hit a dramiel moving 10ks perpendicular to the titan with the dd
thread  stfu  op  epic win
logging off super caps to avoid destruction mid fight has been a much used tactic for a while now both in ganking and fleet fight situations the lag associated with fleet fights makes the 15 minute timer a joke
true with tyrannis level of lag it is impossible it is a delicate situation because without lag it is totally possible maybe you are right and aggressed ships should not disappear after logging but then you will have lots of tears from other people it may be possible to have differing timers for ship class but that sounds like overly complicated codingshrugs
ask and you shall receivefrom evekillnet click on capital kills then click previous month on the right and shift through the kill mails heres a hel kill from today
all titan kills in 201008all mothership kills in 201008
thats terrific mm alone could probably cover all those losses with their own csaas 2 fold that is not a steady or high rate thats a pathetic rate which is leading to the explosion of numbers were seeing supers are at the point where until you start seeing battles where sides take losses similar to dreads circa 2007 its not going to matter
maybe you should use all your supercaps to kill the hotdroppers once in a whileand to answer your rant about alts from a few posts back i didnt want to imply that you should use alts this is an mmo multiplayer people playing together i am quite sure you could get one of your corp mates to give you status on a system before jumping in
to quote everyone from ncjust because you cant handle something and are crying you expect ccp to change itsorry kim lau you may be the queen bee who gets all his puppets to blindly agree but double standards and hypocrisy will get you no where this request is obviously in favour for nc aloneare you really telling us that you need a pos to stop a supercap or more so that you guys have been incredebly slow forming fleets recently that by the time you get a bubble  hic close the supercap is gone p
there was a supercapital death about once every two days id call that a good rate you cant mass produce supercaps like you can any other ship that being said like i stated before having a system that only allows for only having 1 supercap construction facility per x number of controlled systems would be the best way to prevent proliferation and thus blobs of supercaps the only balance change that i would support is perhaps reducing their remote repping bonuses so blobs of supercarriers arent nearinvincible in on themselves but the hp and fighter damages of the ships individually are balanced and to go back to the op a major capability of the ships are the invulnerability to ew including jamming so that change goes against a key role of the ship and shouldnt be looked at

ive never paid my account with a recurring payment so i dont know how things used to be so what kind of notification is this is it by emaili will pick this one up i think ccp should give more notification so people can have better control of their subscription

yea if you create a trial account youll see where the trial status pops up i know it can be annoying seeing how many days are left especially if you pay by the year however if there was a notification for say 10 days in advance on each log in that would be perfectedit thanks maz

i support thiswith my axe
that would be great
yes please
actually you can change overview settings in stationopen overview settings shortcut in the escmenu
white whale implies obsession that destroys you in the end this is neither i just like things balanced so i can frag things if we work for it i watch my back doing missions after all i suppose i could buy a t3 for missions but seems kinda boring to me
you do realise that fitting to be unprobeable totally gimps the ships ability to do anything else all they can do is hide doesnt seem like much of an issue to me
being unprobeable does not make the ship usless  most unprobeable lokis have packing ganglinks giving there fleets insane bonuses with no risk which is one of the main reason people use them 
i like being unprobable mostly in a jaguar id like being unprobable in other ships but cant afford them atmwhat can you do while being unprobableyou cant belt rat the belt is warpable you cant explore these are scannable this leaves missions for which you need to get back to station quite oftenfor this you need 2 slots at minimum jaguar note that a frig does not have a whole lot of slots or 2 slots and a subsystem for a t3 you cant do this with angels tp and might be a bit risky with bloods active modules you cant use drones and you should steer away from buffer shield tanking and some t2 missilesthis sounds like a trade off
only if cloaked ships can also be located by the owners of said spaceanticipating a lot of qq from the pvpers now that like to go to a system cloak up and just afk forever what happened to your no risk no reward now dont get me wrong i dont think that this should change because cloaked ships just like unprobable ships avoid certain risks at a cost you can still catch them on gates outside of stations in lowsec or with bubbles around similar locations in null they still take risks in doing what they do but they limit their exposure and thus the window of opportunity for pvpers

hi not long ago ccp created a new mechanics for mission hubs agents now give missionrunners missions that are located outside the agents system if the system is too crowded this was made to spread the people a bit around and reduce the lag in the mission hubs it makes perfect sense to send people to do the guristas extravaganza in a neighbour system instead of doing it together with 150 other missionrunners in the agents home system in 00 mission hubs this seems to create undesirable side effects in hubs that have like 40 people over 90 of the missions are suddenly in the empty neighbour systems i dont think ccp intended that nerf to 00 missionrunners everyone who does them knows about the dangers of using stargates in 00 with a ship fitted for level 4 missions there is no need to do that because of lag issues at least not when there are less than 50 people in system tldrplea to ccp please limit that mechanics to systems with 50 people in local or whatever number that is critical for lag or at least give people who have high standing with the agents more mission in their home system
this is also a pain in low sec

still doesnt explain why you think im galvantinei didnt ignore your arguments you didnt really have an argument you just flamed the op and said it was stupid without actually giving reasons for why it would not work current mechanic is broken and i think a system that was based around going to a bounty office and being handed a bounty to collect would solve most of the current issues granted the finer details of my op are not perfectremoved a trolling comment that was evading the profanity filter  adida
i already told u why its stupid only u dont wanna admit or even pretend to notice it like i said before if ure trying to ignore your way into passing this it aint gonna happen
due to no combat in northern 00 i urge ccp to change the name of nullsec no longer calling it 00  nullsec but call it no combat highseci understand people will get confused at first but based on current politics i think naming it no combat highsec would be quite fittingthis will be great for newer players who wish to explore mine and plant seeds in safe space

1 im inclined to agree with this wardec is essentially a bribe to concord to look the other way towards agression why shouldnt the defender be able to pay concord for protection at this point the corp with the greater amount of resources wins without a fight i dont think that the amount of ppl in the respective corps should be taken into account this is how i believe it should gocorp a wardecs corp bcorp b has 24 hrs to outbid corp a on the wardec bidding is public like in an auctionif corp a wins the bid war is declaredif corp b wins the bid war isnt declaredso essentially larger corps have more resources to fend off wardecsalso i believe that a single fee should be available to shoot certain members of a npc corp but those members are notified and have 24 hrs to prepare just like a wardec the fees should increase based on how many youve had in the last week and such but if the character joins a player corp they need to be wardecd normally2 sec status and gate guns i have no opinion onac
completely ridiculous wars are good for the eve economy and should be encouraged furthermore its ludicrous that even medium sized industrial corps should be effectively immune to war decingliang
i pinned you for having more imagination declare a wardec every 24 hours from mulitple corps if you lose the bid you dont pay one corp will eventually get thru and move all pvp toons to that corp this way you deplete there resources before the wardec starts pirates will always find a way oh shoot i just gave my plans away ac
i often play eve on different machines and many times have gone through the burdensome process of rebuilding the entire gui againi understand why this information is stored client side for certain speed and storage optimizations however when a player needs to switch computers or reinstall it presents an unnecessary barrier to entry for consistent game playover many years i must have rebuilt my overview dozens possibly hundreds of times in the exact same wayi would greatly appreciate if ccp could figure out a way to preserve these settings on the server sideideally this would include all client settings including overview bookmark folders ship fittings joined channels window locations etc

youve missed the point i did quite well the point is that i recognize the sophomoric there is a reason why sophomore was chosen as the adjective tricks that you tend to use to sell your point of view like inventing new meanings for words which simply dont apply a cosmos is any pvp game that lets you do things other than pvp a pvp fundamentalist is anybody who realizes that a game where the devs explicitly said it was a pvp game is a pvp game you cant have a pvp game if cooperation is allowed please ignore all team pvp games like team fortress ii counter strike call of duty and so on all of anks own words are smears because even though its proven that she said them some of them she said in response to someone else so it totally doesnt count and youre trolling her sure they want to nerf pirates but really i think it would be a good change so lets not say nerf pirates instead lets say improve eve for everybody except pirates  sure ank was confirmed by several independent people to have thrown a spoon at someone else but she didnt hit her andor didnt throw it to cause injury so all those who claim that ank threw a spoon at someone are liars etc its sophomoric wordgaming its semantic tapdancing if you stopped arguing in such a manner i wouldnt feel that you were using such tactics in order to argue dishonestly if you stop with the wordgaming thatd be a good first step the second is to stop making claims that are to put it mildly a hard sell like claiming that you love pvp when your last posted kill was more than a year ago if false then youre lying if true then youre using an account that is not your main in order to hide your true identity which does not foster confidence
well there is no harm in tryingdelilah

it is pretty clear based on the backstory and the books that futanaritype body modifications are on the tamer end of the spectrum in gallente and that body modifications in general are a common pastime in the federation even if futa isnt going to be in incarna i would be disappointed if the races dont have clear distinctions between the entertainment they have available body modifications and liberal attitude towards sex and sexual themes are actually a good way to differentiate gallente from the other races
who is catering for the manlove section in eve i am all for cameltoe but i want rentboysdancers also for the love of god
not supporting there are people ingame that had to wait and proof patience  what is a big part about eve in general from my point of view  to train them all up to level 5  it would be really unfair to those who did that and no just reassigning the sp to other skills is not a solution for this for one good reason some people trained them to level 5 to have a bonus in long term other did not train them up but other skills instead and will now recieve the same bonus  these are the wishes of people that just dont have the patience to wait training skills no plz dont do this
quoted for truth
wood for the trees perhaps the player who trained to level v receives more of a bonus than the person that only trained them to iv firstly they would get more reimbursed sp than the latter pilot which you state isnt enough however they have also received the benefit of faster training time over that level iv pilot since they trained their skills to vthe only people i see objecting to this are the i had to eat gruel as a child so you should too bunch learning skills provide nothing but a divider between the old and the new players if the learning skills are taken away you lose nothing what you are upset about is that other people are getting something that you already have
i dont see the problem of learning skillsi have all learning at 5 my best friend didnt train more than lvl 3 for advancednoob that join our corpo use evemon to see when they can gain some training time on skill plans to see when they sould train some lvl of learning this way they play faster and they dont go for 2 month of stupid only learning trainingthere are plenty ways to improve the skill rating and plenty of ways to loose sp and time how many time i cant skill at higher rate cause beeing poded and have no implants  lolso let the learning as the way it is please best regards

sure1st point  overhaul the system which i place orderscurrently to place an order i have to a find an item b click a button c the important part navigate another open window d change the price which is automatically set to the lowest sell at the particular station or the regional average both of which are usually not what traders want e set specifics then f confirm the orderce can perhaps be made a bit better especially the default price maybe the window could have more info or be integrated with the market tab which leads me to my next pointi feel like the market window can hold the orders section of the wallet it sort of does but its clunky because you cant see the orders and the market for a particular item at the same time if there was an easier way to put these side by side and maybe a oneclick viewmarket orders from the personal or corporders section instead of rightclick on your order  view market orders that would make things a lot easier plus itd be nice to have available funds like the total currently in personal and if you have access corp wallet visible on the market windowthese are just a few thoughts i dont like the experience and the tediousness of things in the market if pi taught us anything its the less clicks the better
yeah like when you see the market orders of an item have yours highlighted and then just right click your order and be able to change it
blending the market window and orders windowno thanks corporation orders are in the market window and it is a pain to switch between the tabs and stuff id much rather keep them separate windowswhat about being able to modify corporation orders would that be op
i always wondered why this was not possible
lownull mission running is a separate issue before mission scanning carebears were in lownull then it got implemented and they all left before load balancing there were still a handful of mission runners in lownull when they had to pass through many camps the last of them leftthe real problem is mission runners fail missions as result of mission scanning or gate camps so often that they soon lose enough standings and can no longer use the agent thus forced to move to highsec it doesnt matter if youre willing to pit pve fit against pvp fits if agents dont give you missions you cant do them even if you want to no matter how high the reward is it wont help safety must be boosted at least to the point where its possible to make up for lost standings in order to keep getting those rewards
im mining for a very short time but in the short time i have been doing it i got bored fast enough to be left at all i love your proposal seems quite reasonable but dont think how could be convenient for the new players the exploration system but hey if that so and having so many millions of isk hidden in these new fields that i think all we ever been atracted by mining would return to give it a try
funny thing is there is already a macro for scaning stuff down in wormholes haha ya humans are lazy man you cant fix that with anything
good idea in general but youve to think about the new players as said beforefor the manual aiming getting more yield idea that wont stop any macrominer yes theyll be slower but theyll still have a steady incomei would rather see a special reward for miners that are actually sitting infront of the game like some half destroyed modules inside of roids from battles long ago that can only be extracted by some complicated not macroable procedure those modules can be reverse engineered and rebuilt or something like that throw in your ideasor just give manual miners the chance to find a high end vein in the roidyou cant really kill the macroers but can only try to cripple them as much as possible
i like the idea of spreading out trade a bit more but i dont like the idea of feed us more n00bs by forcing players through lowsec systems theres already a wide enough gap between the earnings potential of more experienced players vs the newer ones and this would simply be exacerbating the situation more experienced players would find ways around it but newer players would find themselves trapped within a given empires space meaning where are the mission agents in highsec so i wont get killed what empire has which types of ore so i pick that one which has the better trade hubs for me to work in etc i dont like the pick your race based upon game play style and with the removal of many of the subracial differences it appears ccp didnt like that eitherthe only ways i can see to address something like this would be to get rid of the ability to gate camp and station camp lowsec systems but not the ability for pirates to operate there this would take a hell of a lot more changes than just setting up more lowsec so the pirate types can chew up more newer playersthe only fix for the gate camp gig i could come up with is an extreme rework to say the least change how warp works and allow bubbles in lowsec allow a ship to be pulled out of warp but make the gates and stations 1 shot wonders against any aggressive combat ships that get within range of them  250km out or your pirate will end up deadallow probes to find ships that are warping and provide a ship id that can be locked onto and allow for intercepting that ship in warp to pull it outground it no more in warp so im safe until i come out  someone can pull you from warp and nail you no more gate camps so getting into the systems is safe and easy its getting across systems that holds the risks vs just entering a this gate is camped spotsomething that adds to the risk of flying there but removes the entrance blockade effect we currently haveif such changes were done id support lowsec systems between empires but the way it sits no thanks i think the game has enough blocks for newer players without crippling their ability to shop and sell even farther
i like the idea having low security systems between empires gives a sense of more realism to the game opens up many possibilities with the market missions courier piracy production pvp etcrevitalize low sec will put it on the map again and not only would the backyard of high sec and 00 front
so now you want to nerf 00 and wh space so the only way to operate is acquire resources from all 4 empires wouldnt the empires just setup trade agreements if they each are worthless without the other 3 makes no sense theyd let crappy lowsec separate them if they need resources from the other 3 empiresthere are loads of ways to make loads of isk why do we need to create yet another method where the primary beneficiaries will be those who already have loads of isk with the stupid idea of screwing players by cutting them off from opting out of lowsec or facing isolationism in a single empire if people love lowsec fine no one forces them to stay there they can stare at gates and each other all they want i dont see why they and these elite traders feel the need to screw other players and their play style to benefit themselves oh wait yes i do see why they feel that way
if i did not know better i would think this is yet another low sec blues cry post just pucker up grow something o somewere between your legs and bring it to high sec lots of targets here lots of corps doing it just wardec a nice looking corps and take them out
the actual bounty system can be improved in a very simple way and it will make it very effective   when a guy with a bounty on his head is kill just redraw from the total ammount of the bounty the ammount of ship loss and give it to the hunterexample a pirate have a 150m bounty on his head  hes killed by a bounty hunter and the ship loss is 50m he dont gain any isk for insurance1 he now have a bounty of 100m on his head2 the hunter gain 50msimple efficient easy to implementramon wilco
i like it itll give less incentive to kill your own alt for the bounty1
it looks like the entire thread might be on my side just hope you dont get nuked first next time or just hope your side can pop the titan before you die or just dont fly a hicedit youll only get my support for this if your ship is nerfed to only have the bubbles work on sctitans
oh my god ideaheavy heavy interdictortier 3 tech 2 battleshipcan only pin down caps and can fit a mean tankim joking stupid idea
so i take it you have a sc your proposals are utter bs and only extend themselves to sc protection an aeon with a correct fit has 70 million hps without help from any remote repspl and wn have shown how sc blobs can destroy alliances the only reason we have as many titan and sc deaths over the last couple of weeks is due to the pl and wn sc and titan blob that has destroyed any atlas sc that has had the balls to try and jump out to safety so if you take them deaths out of the equation not many scs dieeverybody and their dog now wants a sc why because it is an iwin button the log out mechanics dont help in the least 70 million hps is enough to last the 15 minutes especially when they are used to drop a lone drake rattingat least let pos mods be able to hold them for the amount of time it takes to get a hic into system to take over tackle now sc pilots just log off in system and when a juicy target appears they destroy them within seconds and just cloak up with no repercussions
did you notice that most of those 5070m ehp ships die with like 56m dmgrumors say that one of the titan losses from pl was less than 60sand this idea wouldnt help against such supercap blobs like plwn in detoridthe only people it would help is protecting idiots jumping capsjumpfreighters into hostile space
its effective hit points you moron real hp show on killmails not effective meaning resistances that take away damage do not show on kill mailsffs you just made your credibility tank completely
you need vacation maybe
what is the point of swapping one scrambling battery for another that is exactly the same unless you can comeup with a valid idea of how to make it any different your point is invalid poses are starbases that can build super capitals they have guns just as big as dread does see no reason why they should not be able to tackle a sc and potentially kill it the pilot is dumb enough scsshould not be flattening pos modules with no consequences thats one reasonsecond is the fact that sc is a ship with same tank as that of a titan but enormous flexebility which is the reaon to ther popularity its nearinvulnerability makes them anobvious choies now when thescisstuck their for thetime it takes the carrier to kill the scrambling battery which is not thatlong you have some risk factor added and that is goodi usually dont call people names or anything but what the  is that are you drunk eve is not a singleplayer game sometimes you can ask your friend to light a cyno and your frined to web you yes friends some people actually have them
confirming that the motivation behind this thread is not the desire to kill super carriers but to discourage them from hot dropping on capital ships who think they should be 100 outside the pos shieldstart scouting and escorting your capitals instead of blindly jumping it is not that hard just requires effort which you guys apparently dont want to have to do
with the increase of dps which has came in from ever larger fleets with ever more damage per ship special note for the fleets of supercarriers with near 10k dps per shipno structure in the game can stand upto the damages put out for a useful amount of timei am proposing a number of changesachange it so pos batteries at least small ones and missile batteries will target drones or fightersfighter bombers automaticallythis will make it so supercarriers can no longer incapacitate poss out of their owners timezone without any difficulty at all it will also combat the practice of assigning fighters to interceptors and running round out tracking the guns while killing the pos batteriesbincrease the ehp on tcus ihubs or give them the same 50 resist bonus that the sbu hassov warfare is too easily based on the attacker especially sbus its too easy to take out a tcu or ihub even with reinforce timerscposs at the moment pos gunnery seems to be a useless skill by the time you arrive to control the guns at a pos theyre incapacitated or the pos is dead alliances in 00 can easily come up with large fleets that can make the millions of hp of a pos look like nothingsotriple or more the hit points on pos shields change reinforcement to 125 and make it so you can add more stront at 25 also have the pos shields start off at 25 when the pos comes online giving attackers an advantage when the pos is being set up but defenders the advantage once the pos is online and fully running this would still put them way behind ihubs that have 192m hp a pos would have about 160m ehp considering a titan under optimal conditions can have 825m ehp avatar and a pos currently has under 60m the poss need the boost it would also give a real advantage to faction towers that have better shield buffersjump bridges cyno generatorsjammers  triple the hp on all levels so that they dont incapacitate at the first sign of an enemy roaming fleetturrets  the damage on pos guns is sufficient with gunners to kill a dread in siege while not being threatening to supercaps this is acceptable since the fighter bombers could be eliminated from a sc and a titan will unlikly be attacking a pos solodouble the shield hp of all external batteriesincrease the armor hp of all external batteries by 10x giving lms guns 15m75m375m armor and increase all hull values to 500000 hpalternativly make a bonus of larger towers so they provide these hp boosts automaticallythis means attackers have to risk losing more when attacking large poss or being deployed longer when using dreads etc to take out poss it will also make a quick response to a new pos essential to avoid the new hp levels and means there will be lots of repping carrierssupercarrierslogistics ships outside the shield available as targets to anyone able to catch them
uhm  what ever you smoke dont do it again  reallythe last thing we need is more hp grinds neither for tcuihub and especially not pos towersif you want to keep your structures go and defend them dont relay on reinforcement timers so much
sounds like you just want to setup a pos and bore your enemies to death while you hide in station and wait for them to leaveguess what if a large fleet shows up to your home in 00 you need a large fleet to fight them or you better pack your bags and go back to hiseci dont know what game you are playing but the dominion sov system is way too advantageous to the defender there is nothing more boring than shooting pos mods and tcusihubs while your enemy just does nothing you should be active to mount an effective defense and your ideas would make it so you can be passive and not do anything and show up whenever you want and require the attacker to bring an even bigger blob to do anything nonononono
it definitely requires some revision and balancing im a relative noob when it comes to static structures and capitalsupercapital sieges i would say that if there arent systems already designed to increase the defensive options in a system to counter a supercapital siege of structures there should be improvements that can be made on tcus and the like to increase ehp etci would add that in the 1st published book of the eve experience the caldari and gallente have early warning and preventative systems in place to combat large scale forces something that should possibly be rolled out across eve and its empiresit makes sense tho that in the same way as building a station in a system rather than transport it in a ships cargohold unlike a pos you should be able to improve other structures that are already positioned the idea of only being able to improve anchored items by replacing them totally is extremely uneconomical and very wastefullthat kind of policy is something a highly advanced civilisation should not be able to survive living byas eve is an immersive experience living in the distant future something like this does break the continuity of such an experience
i like pie 1
ive heard there used to be or still is a notification that some players see but ive never seen it all players should have an x days remaining thing on their login page
if hes missionning there should be another way to find his location no ho and just wait for him at station or gate in 00 you cant just win for every situation when he finish missionning he warp somewhere just have to find where 
yes i know they already can as part of a contract how pointless is it that a freighter pilot has to contract his own ships to an alt who then courier contracts them back to the freighter pilot who delivers them for the alt who then contracts them back to the freighter pilotcomplete unnecessary nonsensejust let us put the rigged ships in the frighter surely thats not unreasonableplease
even in a blue hub missioning in lowsec and nullsec is already dangerous enough there is already too much risk pirates red blobs etc and too many consequences bad empire and irreversibly bad concord assembly standings for too little reward compared to highsec missioningccp should limit the mechanic so that it doesnt apply to any nullsec or lowsec systems even ones with 50 or more people but the ops proposal is close enough
not supporteda game mechanics should be the same for all players both nulllowhigh secand by the way if youre afraid of jumping to a stargate in 00 you shouldnt be there there are more risk in low and far more risks in 00 its the way eve isand speaking or rewards i used to mission in low sec and nullsec  low sec is very profitable due to the improved lp for mission and 00 lvl4 missionning too missionning in 00 is generally for lps to buy factoin ships you gain 12k to 20k lp in a single mission in nullsec with good standing and skillsso for all these reason i dont support this threadbest regards ramon wilco
this game mechanics doesnt change anything for highsec players except a 23 minutes time loss per mission but is a significant risk increase for lowsec and 00 so its not the same for everyone i now get a lot of missions in a deadend 00 with no stations for example all that missions are lost ccp made this for the purpose to fix lag thats how it was described in the blog it was not made to balance 00lowsec against highsec missions but even if you want to compare the riskvsreward of 00 vs highsec missions the vast majority of missionrunners apparently wont agree with you or why do they stay in highsec but again thats not the question here as this mechanics has a lag fixing purpose in 00 or lowsec hubs there is no need for that as they dont grow as big as the highsec hubs and the side effects are graveif you insist i dont mind if the game mechanics are equal anywhere just make them kick in when there are more than 50 or 60 pilots in system and it wont matter for the very most nonhighsechubsfake edit supporting own thread
you should give me a thumbs up
not supportedby the way the only way to really improve bounty system is very simple instead of taking the bounty if u kill the guy you should receive an amount of the bounty equal to the ship lossthis way a people who have a bounty cant be shooted by a friend to get the bounty cause hell just gain the amount of isk hes loosingand the other good thing of this is that if someone have a 200m bounty he cant just be killed once and bounty is erased bounty is effective until he loss 200m in ship with possible loose of modulerig and implant he loose really a lot of isk far more than the bounty on his headthis is the only way to fix bounty and make this system effectiveand everyone should be able like now to chase someone for a bounty people saying that the chased should be informed of the people who chased him propose a nonsense you cant know whos chasing you this is the purpose of a bounty but some bounty hunters in beeing celebs by killing lot of guys will certainly be known at terms by piratesbest regards ramon wilco
lol at continuous whiny threads
i support allowing 00 to become highsec through upgrades allow npc faction policenavies to deal with the sovereign owners enemies or not blues upgrades could open the door for gate guns policenavy forces that sit at the gates and a number of reinforcement waves that arrive to back them up the higher the artificial highsec the more waves and the stronger they get
i will go with that
thread locked please note that frivolous threads in assembly hall are not permitted
yet again you have misunderstood you claimed that you wanted some sort of truce i pointed out that your habitual dishonesty and trolling would get in the way and asked you to stop rather than agreeing to you tried to change the subject with still more obfuscatory nonsense and vague pablum about how myohmy youd tried and ah well and arent you the longsuffering peacemaker and blah blah blah so i called your bluff and pointed out again despite you talking about how much you love pvp when the account you post with is obvious not now and has never been at any point in the past ever a pvp account  and so i gave you one more chance to show this civil discussion that youre pretending to be about and asked you to either post with this supposed pvp main that you have or admit you were trolling you can talk a good game about civil discourse but as long as youre trolling and arguing dishonestly then all your talk about civility is just another troll you know full well that as long as you are dedicated to trolling constantly only an idiot would give you a charitable interpretation just like i knew when i asked you to post with this supposed pvp main that chances are youd never do any such thing because you almost definitely made it up its hard to post with an account that doesnt actually exist
hear hear the only thing i might add is if this is not the perspective of the whole csm it should be delilah
friendly bump  support this
more range larger fuel baysagreed that the gallente t2 bs are ass backwardsgive the drones to the pve marauder and the guns to the black ops
unfortunately that would make it ugly for ccp because blackops  tier 1 tech 2 and marauders  tier 2 tech 2 and hulls of t2 ships share many attributes with their t1s however your suggestion would be nice only thing i could think of is if they gave the marauder a 100 drone damage role bonus and nerfed the turret highslotsbumpfix the ing blackops this is now my crusadejihaaaaad
heres my 2 isk againchange the cloaked velocity bonus to or in addition to a 20 per level reduction of scan resolution penalty of cloaking devicesincrease jump and bridge range by 50 should be enough to get some of those regional jumps that are just out of reach currentlychange the sins agility bonus to a 75 tracking bonus per levelchange the panthers speed bonus to 10 falloff per level bonus imo the other 2 ships should be fine with the top 2 bullets i made and the other aspects of the whole ship class is balanced in terms of tankgank
ya there pure crap for a tech 2 ship just becouse you can jump with alittle clocking abitly wtf sorry ars of a bs if you ask me not so great of the fighting is there main problemo i can jump a little or alot and even if you inc jump range by 2000 there still crap in a fighta stealth bomber group is way more usefulltakes less time to trainand cost less
yes please fix the font size and how about ui scaling as well this games ui disappoints at 2560x1600 on a 30inch lcd and it shouldnt
a couple of hours online and ive got a splitting headache tiny and terrible 12 point font on a 2600x1440 monitor is just cruel punishmenti cant believe this issue has actually been left to fester so long
i had to buy a t3 just to use blasters it gets better dps and tracking do to subsystem layout to fix blastersmore damage same range much better tracking make hybrid guns reload in 5 seconds not 10 a blaster or rail gun has to use ammo thats just how they work the ablity to change damage types should be possable too they are infact half way between normal guns and lazers t2 ammo is pointless right now so that could use a look into as well maybe make a ammo that does good damage 80 max but has  to optmal and falloff nerf scorch so its got the end all of ammo to shut people up not much but just enough to bring the range down a little bit the above changes would make me happy my t3 would shoot for over 1000dps be able to shot anything that flys at it and really be able to dish out the dps not just say it canfor once
i posted a similar solution in another threadincrease medium  large rail damage by 10increase medium  large blaster damage by 15reduce reload to 5 secondsreduce charge size to 12 that of projectiles reducing gun cap accordinglydevide the ammo into two types at each rangegal ammo one 41 thermal to kinetic damage  tracking  tracking bonus starts around 10 and increases as the ammo range increasescaldari ammo one 41 kinetic to thermal damage  cap use  cap bonus starts around 15 and increases as the ammo range increases that puts hybrids inbetween projectiles and rails they get their own unqiue identity without being worst of both and they take a little more thought to use
supportedive read some really good ideas in here not sure im even picky about which ideas to go withhybrids just need help period
yes
thank you very much for your post it is rare to find posters that have the backround i do when it comes to evegallente are the race i chose because the best represent me as a person they refuse to let gender biases or cultural sterotypes prevent them from having fun and experimenting with things i would love to see this thread get spamed with approval icons by people with plenty of alts just so that the csm is forced to mention and possibly even define futanari that in and of itself will be a huge step forward for the movement
i say this would be a fine addition towards the game if such huhm futa was implemented into incarna but you also have too consider a filter option for our younger pilots that of course are prestent too and would like to make use of the said barbut i think this should be the responsibility of the parents or guardians too set a passworded safeswitch too disable the well boobies he healtough a micro bikini would be a option too if all other things failps post belongs too hesphos i messed up the character selection
yes but if there isnt a modest bulge in that bikini then i am sorry that aint a gallente station i want a girl that will spray me when i have finished her epic arc
supported but trying to find a pizza chain that takes mmo money will be hard 
offer them the chance to run their adds exclusively at all the billboards at gates in evethat and let them sell quafe with it
yesquafe and a medium pizza for 1 plexfitting service window for the menurigs with penalties and bonusesoh my god
oh man that is going to take me a couple months to train up the skills to fit that pizza it seems you are going for a tier 2 fitting i would go for a tier three as the extra high slot would be worth it also drop a peperoni ii for a sausage ii and drop the yellow and red peppers in favor of the green as yellow and red are overrated and is just to make it look nice
signed anyone noticed that that while this topic exists for over a year there is still not a single response from a ccp dev
god please dont take anymore gunboats from the caldari the cormorant is awesome if you know how to fit it and fly itif you want a pve boat get a drake dont put those  weapons on a perfectly good shipalso not supporting dessies are fine the way they are you just have to know how to use them
well with the whole mechanic of you having to be docked to send an application to a corp supercapital pilots cannot do it unless they have holding characters now some pilots just have alts designed especifically to fly the ship at all times which means they cant join a corp this is a bit game breaking if you ask me please support to bring this issue up with the csm and lets try to come up with some solutions
maybe create some sort of a petition system especially designed for this maybe it takes too many resources hmm
leave ship for 2 seconds at a pos dock quit put in app go get back in shiptbh i dont see why we just dont let supercaps dock other than ya know theyre bigger than stations which will probably spark some flaminganyway supported because uhh
lthis and you also sometimes have teammates and friends ya knownot supported
dock it in your pos seeing as you are flying a super capital ship you have that infrastructure in place right sorry if life is too hard in a supercap i know it must be tough knowing that if you do get caught 99 of the time you can loggoffski and disappear before anything but a large capital fleet can break your buffernot supporting
this is basic common sense pilots need to be able to join a corp and its not safe to leave the ship at any time given the risks of theftetc supported
poss are meant to be corp owned structures not for personal use plus unless you give special rights to that pilot anyone can steal the ship from the capital sma stop being dogmatic and hating on supercaps because you cant have one were talking about a game breaking feature here and ccp will not help you apply to a corp so you are required to trust another person if you dont have a holding character im a pretty trusting person but i dont really fancy lending a 30 billion isk worth supercarrier to someone i met over internet pixels especially when ccp actively supports stealing supercaps say whatever you want about them being overpowered but if you were in one you would think the same way i doagain this is a generic situation im not the subject of this post
hells yes supported
but in your mind supercapitals ships that can only be built in sovereign space mind you are designed for the individualnot supported the more pebbles in the supercapital pilots shoes the better as far as i am concerned
ya this is just stupid and needs to be fixedeasly answer just let them dock for the love of god its a game not every last thing needs to be realother easly answer add in a pos mod that holds one suppercap even call it a supercap hanger omg so hard yes i know
holy crap i was reading the final results and the bits of explanation about the processso you have people vote then you rearrange the results and bump your own favorites up the list a few positionsjust like real life politicans quit serving your own interests and start playing fairly or is that too much to ask
perhaps i missed it even though i read over it several times but i didnt see a single number referring to a hybrid fix 
pi is awesome for countless reasons but its user interface and interaction are simply ed in particular when you train the skills dont even chime in if you dont have the skills trained problem you cant upgrade a colony fix dropping a bigger command center of the same type on a colony will upgrade its cpu and power tweak by increasing upgrade cost problem you need to survey and route each extractor its unnecessary and mindboggling annoying fix add multi selection to extractors with modifier key like ctrl or shift and while surveying the time becomes the addition of surveying time of each tweak by adding extra time to decrease productivity if necessary problem you cant clearly see routes links in crowded outposts fix add vivid color lines for active routes make facilities blink in a special color if theyre not routed suggestion add activity counters idle facilities vs active facilities in industry panel you dont know if your outpost is idle or extracting from orbit good ideas about this inthread
anything ccp does to make pi better i want it a mess right now its almost not worth doing to avoid all the clicks you have to do to do anything with pi i have two planets with cc on them and its almost not worth it

then remove load balancing from nulllowsec and make less pipe areas within lowsec and more connections to highsec to reduce gatecamps dont nerf highsec extortion a lot of griefer corps are former pirates the ransoming kind not the ones that call themselves pirates but are really pure pvpers that figured out that there arent that many targets in lowsecmake lowsec safer and highsec less profitable so that targets actually leave highsec and suddenly therell be less griefer corps because theyll follow the targets again l4 missions in highsec and t2 exhumers brought a lot of carebears from lowsec to highsec but that was years ago prior to that a lot of people ninjamined etc
4 make pve ships  pvp ships cause we all know that pve already stand a chance chance against pvp that the fail pilots ninjing in highsec with scannign frigs and come back with a bc are just padding their killboardor sockfluffing their egonot going to happen anytime soon like after 7 years wasnt soon enough when the vast majority of the player base always return to the highsec mission hubs for a few weeks at a time before heading back out pvp and loose it all5 change the eve community as a whole so that there is less griefers and douchebags ect just because they can do it after getting screwed over your last ship was blow up your wallet is empty from that ransom they didnt honor you are podded and now stuck in a 900k clone with 50 million you cannot afford and zero implants where else are you going to go to get away to start over again but npc corps because some can feck you over because ou have been wardecced for several weeks already in a pc corp never going to happen you might as well try to make ccp admit that sandbox for everyone is in your sandbox makes you wonder why 42k active accounts at one time is considered successful for a niche game after 7 years and wow is still pulling strong and i have never played that game because of its crappy comical graphics i honestly think eve could of been a lot more successful like 2 or 3 independent server clusters running 40k each in my opinion if they had a more defined sandbox that didnt have a portion of the player base giving golden showers and mentally getting off on it resulting other player leaving the game in frustration just because you can do it sure its a sandbox but its also a game and ccp could do with more  from from a larger loyal player base instead of a small cadre of long time vets and a business model that relies on a fast turn over of new accounts that leave after six months
because its late and im tired im bumping my own proposal this proposal would go a long way to improving creative use of space just think of the possibilities if someone goes on a long winded rant about whatever topic you just ganked them stole their stuff escaped their perfect camp whatever you could now tell them to drop it in a can son or you drop a can 100km off a gate and mr super pro dram pilot speeds over to take a look see because the can is now labeled secret coordinates only to open it a read the note therein saying did you know that cloaked disco ships have no targeting delayinternet space pilots need to express their creative sides as well
id like to use this thread to collect various complaints about the new sovereignty system that was implemented at the beginning of this year including supercaps id like to keep the complaints in this thread as general and high level as possible so dont make posts for example about the capacitor level of some capital ship also please dont ask for new features i want to focus on things the csm has a sliver of a chance of getting to ccp aboutalso if you know about existing threads on the forums here that are relevant please link them here so that everything can be looked athere are some complaints that ive received to get you started1 everything has too much hp and killing the things is soul destroying for example sbus and stations etc timers also make it really hard to take a system2 supercap jammer capital ship inflation these structures that are supposed to be bigdeal centerpieces of an alliance is becoming a dimeadozen and perhaps the ship balancing ought to reflect that3 outpost inflation perhaps the balancing of outposts should reflect that eve will eventually have one in every single 00 system and there is no way to destroy outposts and probably never will be4 poses remain completely unchanged for years and still remain a vital part of claiming sov this is stupid
too much blue ballingi will elaborate most battles if people actually fight are already decided the game has reached a point for a good while now where it is just about numbers and ehp sure there is the once in a while skirmish where the ship bonuses pilot skill and fc tactic all came together to get the victory95 of the time two forces wont engage if they are outnumbered or if the odds are even between the two sides they simply chose to not fight and run i am in now way saying they are a coward it is the way the game mechanics are why take a chance on heavy casualties when you can just avoid the fight and lose nothingso unless you are doing something that is a real threat like attacking an important pos or contesting sov there is no motivation to fight when there is a vast amount of reasons to simply ignore themthere is only three things an attacker can do to motivate a fight1 drop sbus to mess with the enemy sov which some people do not because they want that space but to draw out a fight2 siege a high end moon pos again knowing that if they put a tower there it will just get ultra bobbed and taken back3 take out the station services which is like seizing a tower anyways and unless you plan on camping them in 237 they will simply wait till you are gone and rep it back upthats it all of those can only be done as major operations and require ctas which the enemy will most like have a spy and know about it anyways in which case brings us back to the blue balling if they cant get superior numbers they wont fight same goes for if you cant get the numbers eitherthe only time you have to fight is if you jump into a camp any decent camp has a scout so if they are there when you load it means your about to get ganked if they are gone it means they didnt like what they saw and bailed again avoiding pvpthis post is getting really long and im sure people will flame me but i dont care and they can go  themselves for all i care so i will do a todr for the reading impairedtldr game rely too heavily on who has superior numbers and leaves no room for ship bonus and tactics involving them thus causing fleets to opt out of a fight and run also there is no small to medium objectives to make fleets want to fight each otherfake edit i dont know why i bothered to reply to this maybe deep down i still hope that the csm actually has some form of power with ccp and is not just some facade
re 3 one suggestion ive made is that a means of outpost destruction should be implemented which is just like construction but in reverse  ie selfdestruct timer is set outpost is no longer there after downtime all assets within it are destroyed and anyone docked or with a clone there is podded and clone contracts are transferred back to corp hq which is required to be in empire
last yearccp stated that you will not be able to kill a station but might put it into a state of disrepair that would take considerable resources to fix unfortunately they then decided there are more important things to do and i can only assume that the idea of a damaged station have gone the road of 6 months past  18 months future super capitals have too many hp carriers should not be able to get range bonuses to repairs without triaging because it promotes blobbing ms shouldnt have them at all it promotes more and more capital blobbing when you can spider tank theres absolutely no senses to the 9 hr tcu timers and 3 hr sbu timers they do not encourage fights it also doesnt make sense that sbus go invulnerable wo any means for the defender to kill them before a stationsystem comes out of reinforced it just centralizes the time both sides have to be in a system there needs to be a way to promote more fighting also reinforcement timers are way too long theres no excuse that the hub timers are more than 18 hrs and the station timers are more than 24 hrs it should not take 6 days to take stations make it take 23 days tops there was an almost identical problem with the old sov system and pos timers that approached 45 days hence the reason and logic that they shortened it so wtf did we go backwards there for titans need to have a natural enemy thats not so clear cut and dry as bring motherships dreads have totally lost a role in 00 now the answer is one ive promoted for a while siege protects dreads from full dd damage if that happens then dreads have a role in general capital combat again mix it with a nerf to mothership hp and rr and a fix to carrier rr out of triage and all the sudden you have roles for all the capitals wo making it capitals online blue standings dont make sense there is no excuse why you can immediately blue an entity or red an entity and make fleet combat so simple as shoot the red side there needs to be an element of confusion about who are friends and who are foes in big battles having blue and red tags removes a lot of the coordination that should be needed im not saying get rid of blue standings i do think it needs to be a function of something that would actually be a terrific role to associate with a command ship or flagship make it an element of fleet warfare that you could actually disrupt for the other side
in the current state of sov warfare an alliance should be esentially dead for a medium sized group of alliances to actually take its space its a compilation of serious flaws that make the sov system the root of all that is bad currently in the game first of all  cyno jammers were brought in the game with the thought of preventing enemy dreads from entering the system while the defender is free to use carriers to support its subcapital fleetok maybe they had something to do with the aoedd too not to force subcapital ships to fight 50 supercaps each one with 50 million hp and remote repping eachotherin its current state the game will soon be filled up with supercaps weve already seen 100 supercaps on field you could fight dreads with subcaps before but you cant fight 50 supercaps with subcaps with motherships raping your battleships and titans doomsdaying your hics as a basic ideaihub is anchored at a pos jammer is installed on ihub you set up a heavily defended pos to protect both the jammer and ihub  enemy reinforces ihub  jammer is down till ihub is outtitans shouldnt be able to doomsday hics t3s logistics etc fighterbombers should be less effective against battleshipsaka not oneshotting them dread siege cycle should be cut by halfsame as triageihubs should be easy to reinforce and a lot harder to kill ie  reinforce with subcaps but bring 100 dreads or tons of supers to kill same with control towers want to abort a supercap rf the ihub while reinforcing the csaa pos insure 30 dreads  come nuke the pos while your subcaps are fighting the defenders or hotdrop their carrierssupercarriers trying to save ittoo radical
ok first before i get into the sov featureseveryone saying nerf supercaps is treating the symptom instead of the disease the problem w supercaps isnt their hp or damage its that they can be produced somewhat easily by the bigger alliances that have the resources how long would a supercarrier last against 20 dreads a couple minutes max thats balanced and its where they should be if you nerf their hp suddenly 5 dreads take out a supercarrier in 30 seconds and were back to predominion where theyre worthless piles of junk the problem is the blob and that comes from too many of the ships in circulation so fix the disease and nerf production not the ship its only 30mmonth to pay for the upgrade that allows the capital construction facilities and you can have as many as u want basically make it to where its 1020 billion a month to pay for the upgrade and you can only have one production facility per system thatll slow things down and make it harder for players to get one in addition to making each ship cost significantly more or my other suggestion has been you can only have a supercap facility if you control x systems such as 1 facility per full region of control other things wrong with dominionalliance sprawl has not been reduced making system costs more expensive might help with thistreaties need to be introduced it will help in getting new blood into 00 and could represent a new income stream for alliances this will also help reduce alliance sprawl there needs to be a reason to fight it used to be moons but not as much now whether that means new types of resources added into different regions access to different things from different regions etc there needs to be something that motivates players to go out and conquer systems other than just for the heck of it or good fights the sov system needs to be tweaked its a bit over the top to try and take a system now not that im saying it should be easy because it shouldnt be but it needs to be straightforeword and shouldnt require players to sit there for 3 hours shooting at an ihub or station or tcu 3x a week assuming there was a successful defense mounted just to take over one system then once u capture that system go kill the tcuihubstnposs for the 20 systems surrounding it its a bit much all combined
my problems with dominion sov are close to the op1 everything has too much hp and killing the things is soul destroying for example sbus and stations etc timers also make it really hard to take a systemsove warfare is boring huge hitpoints on structures equals huge blobs and bigger lag sov warfare is about as entertaining as operating a triple beam balance sadly it is also about that complexthe new system is designed so that you can have a huge climactic battle over a system with these timers only the game is incapable of doing this lag on supercapswelcome to nyx and aeon online
i think one of the major issues is its just too much of a war of the timers the defender isnt going to bother to show up to lose a bunch of ships against a superior force because its just easier to show up and rep everything later at the same time you cant just get rid of them all because then the timezone problem only gets worsethe timers should be adjusted but sbuing a system should do some kind of other damage such as suspending all station services and infrastructure hub effects except dock and cancelling market orders make sbus unable to be unanchored so attackers have to commit and defenders have a reason to get rid of them make certain outpost upgrades destroyable to allow for economic harassment and provide another impetus to defend a system can you already do this im not surei think the biggest issue sov aside is that really nobody has to fight for resources any more anyone can upgrade their ihub and run plexes all day now so why bother throwing away supercaps to take another system
i dislike two things about the sov system currently in place1 no small gang objectives mainly a gripe with 00 itself but you need a blob 100 to do anything in sov warfare i dont want to take over stations with a 20 man gang but shouldnt i be able to damage the enemy a little bit right now the defenders either dock up and laugh because you dont have enough to invade or they evac and run away because you do have enough people to invade2 only a small amount of time determines the fate of sov so if you dont control a system for 22 hrs of the day and then show up with a massive blob for the last 2 hrs and save everything you get the system massive fleet battles are awesome but if you dont play during the timezone when timers come out of reinforced you might as well not bother i would like it to be a constant battle for control of the system culminating in a final massive battle instead of everyone sleeping and then alarm clocking for the reinforcement timerbut im also in the small camp that wants the mechanics to change to split up the blob ie multiple objectives for the defender so you cannot just blob defend one objective at a time too much advantage goes to the defender atma good thread by mazzilliu oh my i bow you your womanly efforts madam o7o7o7
this is a csm proposal that asks the gms to automatically reimburse game time if a character is banned due to an investigation and then later unbanned after being found not guilty this is the most easily fixable complaint ive gotten about the gms so far although i dont know how widespread the issue is there doesnt seem to be any systematic reimbursement of losses due to gm investigation at no fault to the player
do they really not do this already
they do it but i believe you have to pester them about it and it takes a long time that is really unacceptable from a customer service standpoint i know if i was any other company and i wasted the customers time at no fault of their own i would automatically make things right this really can be automated too anytime a gm uses their little foamy unban hammer their gm tools could automatically reimburse game time based on how much time has passed since the ban
sounds good to me
right now the self destruct mechanics are majorly flawed motherships facing a handful of titans accompanied by motherships carriers and a small support fleet can self destruct in 2 minutessupercap caught by a bs fleet no problem self destructsupercap caught by a sc fleet no problem self destructwhat i propose is that the standard 2 minute timer will still apply but only when unagressed when agressed the timer goes from 2 minutes to something a bit higher like 15 minutessomething similar for logging where if you get shot while logged out in space you get the regular agression timer which gives fleets with low dps the chance to give logoffskistldr  if agressed self destruct timer is 15 minutes if shot while logged out in space you get 15 minute aggression timeri am terrible at writing be nice
this
i like the difference between agressed and non agressed sd timer tbh
yarrrr
how about no if you suck so bad you cant kill them in 2 minutes you dont deserve that kill simple as that
 agree completely
supported when dealing with drones you have to alwas keep an eye on the drone window the flash would make your eyes key to it when they start getting shot at would help out in whs very muchno cons that i can see and it would make since that your drone would radio back to the ship saying it was getting hurt
supportedpretty much the entire drone ui needs some loving
supported the current kill your alt to get isk is a poor game mechanic
if you spend the time to track someone down running locators and coordinating a trap with others you dont want the reward to be the price of a shuttle you get whatevers on his head for the pod kill thats what bounty means and once killed theres no more bounty on that personyour suggestion only removes any incentive for bounty hunters and maintains the bounty on the target after hes been killed doesnt help bounty hunting as a profession and unfair to the outlaw whos paid his debt to society by being squished
including cost of implants into payment for bounty hunter solves problem of killing someone in shuttle and it still solves kill your alt issue
i dont have a carrier or want to get one at the moment but an idea came accross to me when told that carriers and higher can only jump to diffrent sytems by using cynos and are not allowed to use jumpgateswell heres my idea why not let carriers supercaps and titans use jumpgates to make it easier for them to move around more and so cynos are not made useless they could be used to move ships accross a bunch of sytems at once as they allready can this would make pvp battles a bit easier as carriers and titans can get to the rally points quicker using stargates without the organization needed for cynos in diffrent sytems only 1 jump away
also why dont we have caps in highsec why dont we run missions with carriers no
so why does half of the csm not care about getting rockets fixed i was told by one of them that its not a priority and theyre trying to talk the other half of the csm into dropping it wth obviously the csm member who was going on about how rockets are fine doesnt fly any rocket boats why would he have such a strong opinion on something he obviously knows nothing about ill tell you why he has other issues that he wants to push and he sees ccp devoting resources to balancing rockets as something that will get in the way he even said so himself he wants to recommend that ccp not fool with rockets at all but just leave them the way they are come on csm half of you are there only to serve your own interests not to take care of the people who elected you i know the delegate from my alliance argues with the rest of us on the forums we have a forum to give him input but he shoots it down and does what he wants to instead even if its the direct opposite of what the majority of our players say they want ive seen threads where not one single person agress with him but he stil wont back down self service typical politician and this is why the csm is failthis rocket thing is a big deal hams actually have a considerably higher explosion velocity than rockets at the moment this seems like an intentional nerf of rockets there is obviously some prejudice going on here why else would this have been done caldaris best small ship pvp was with rockets now its gone same with med and large ships regarding hams and torps to be honest hams and torps have been nerfed all to hell torps repeatedly over the years rockets have been nerfed and then renerfed ships designed to use short range missiles dont work any more khanid and some caldari boats are seriously hamstrung when i see killmail after killmail of vengeances and maledictions with autocannons on them ships with rocket bonuses something is terribly wrong you just dont see the sacrilige in space any more crows can no longer fit rockets ham cerbs are a thing of the past torp raven in your gate camp maybe maybewe need to get more people into the csm who are there to be fair not merely to advance their own interests we need more people like vuk lau and ccp needs to quit procrastinating and fix those damned rockets if they ever intend tobtwdont tell me that caldari arent meant to pvp or that theyre the pve only race too many of us have specialized in only caldari and heavily in missiles and now were screwed i need to train another race or buy another character if i want to pvp in anything other than a large fleet bah
caldari can pvp but they have the disadvantage of using the two worst offensive weapon systems in the game missiles and hybridsmissiles have been nerfed repeatedlyhybrids have become obsolete with the rebalancing that has been done with projectiles and energy weapons over the yearsas far as rockets yes they are broken i dont understand why fixing the explosion radius is so difficult how many man hours would it take to fix rockets in ccps eyes too many
yes fix rockets yes fix blasters supported
can we have the ability to repackage stuff in a pos corp hanger please can i have your stuff has morphed into wheres my stuff its one of those little things that has gotten a bit too annoying
as it currently stands now in order to make a p3 or p4 commodity youre forced to micromanage multiple planets by freighting one commodity to the next planet then the next unless you are lucky enough to get a planet that can provide all you need for a p3 ie plasmatake robotics for example the only planet currently that you can make robotics on just by itself is a plasma planet if you cannot find one of these you are forced to manage a lava planet and a barren planet to produce the two separate commodities you need to form the p3 this is easily enough done however in order to make the final product you have to export one lets say consumer electronics from one planet to the next the steps in doing so are belowcurrent route ce to launch pad export ce from launch pad to customs office gather material at customs office and transport it to the other customs office on the main production planet import ce from that customs office down to the planet route ce to robotics production facilitiesnot all of us ie pvpers have the ability to sit in system and micromanage pi like this some use alts to do so but then again some people dont have alts or spare alts to use for something like this my proposal is to automate the exportimport process and add one small feature the ability to export and import between customs offices themselves this would allow you to take the ce from one planet export it to the customs office and then export ce from that office to the other automatically so it takes the current steps and does thisproposed route ce to launch pad specify how much to be exportedimported ce is exported off planet to customs office and then exported to another customs office in system where it is then imported to that planets launch padmain points1 input how much to be moved from launch pad to customs office provided you had the room pad 10000m3 customs office 25000m3 you would need enough room to move between all four steps ie input you want to move 5000m3 of consumer electronics to x planet you have enough room in both planets offices as well as the launch pad so there is no problem doing so2 can only work for customs offices in the same solar system so you couldnt import something from one system to another thats one jump over3 allows simplistic and time efficient ways to do pi without having to have specific alts to do so enables pvpers who dont have the time to micromanage multiple planets to do so without having to transport goods or jc down to the set up system to do so4 other than extractors running out and initial setup of colony completely hands free
i can support this but i do belive a transportation fee should be payed for it i also belive that shiping contracts to transport goods from one customs office to the next would be nice too much the same way players pay other players to move goods for them from one station to another only for pi and leting you ship them fromto customs office this would be a very good thing for transport peoplebut its probly on the bottom of problems with pi right now
eve recently got a huge problem with spies and thiefs who enter corporation and can by default access ship maintenance arrays security system in eve for corporation management became a big issue ccp should develop some kind of mechanism of security with more options to make a restriction to poss and structures including possibility to specify namely who can access structure or who cannot think it over csm members and bring it to ccp
while ccp should not be designing the security for yu i does need to give corp leaders more tools to manage security curren system is not good
only if they fit in the cargo hold

the coolest thing to happen to eve online since i started plaingwell done ccp we love you for thiswhy is the csm so upset over it if you dont like it just dont play itjust want to put in my two cents that a lot of us are anxiously awaiting incarna and are very very happy that ccp decided to create walking in stations no matter what the vocal minority says elsewhere on this forumccp really hit the nail on the head with this one it was needed well wait as long as it takes for them to get it right too no rush make it nice guys and thank you
maybe its because ccp boldfaced flat out told the csm frak off when it came to fixing major issues in the game that have been there since its inceptionno major fixes or patches for 18 months to 2 years its right there in the minutes in black and whiteno offense but anyone who misses that has no business making statements like yours
i am also looking forward to walking in station but i believe that there are a lot of things that could be fixed with the game the way it is today once wis happens that will open up an even bigger can of worms that is going to need even more patches to get working i want wis too but a also what blasters  rockets not to suck anymore no more lag and a whole list of other known problems fixed before more content is added eve needs more quality not quantity at this point yes i know itsa topic thats been beat to death but i dont care it still needs to be said in eve terms ccp wants fly a bs without having the back up skills to fit one out properly theres going to have all this stuff for us to do but its all going to be half done and in need of work support skills at lvl 1 as it were never mind all the patches that wis is going to need lets just keep pushing that backlog stuff back even further yes wis will be cool should it be put off till other problems are taken care of yes
fixed for you
last i checked it was bad business sense to not fix a product youve already released into the wild especially when you take too long to fix problems that are still not fixedbut since your too blind and narrow minded to even think like that i suppose your incapable of understanding such concepts
this is what ccp is doing using a rl analogy here from my work that we deal with everydayim an auto mechanic i fix cars for money if you bring your car in to the dealership i work at and pay me to fix something when you drop off your car you expect the problems to get fixed if i charge you and the problem is not fixed you get ed and bring your car back and we then work on it for free till the problem goes away with in reason work on it for free not a good way to do business not only are you not making money for working on the car the second time you have ed off the customer and might not get there business after there car has been fixed right this time add to this the loss of income from what else you could get work on when youre in fact still working on the car you never fixed right the first time so youre losing money two different ways this scenario is called a comeback and happens all the time in any shop shops that have a lot of comebacks often go out of business because there now ex costumers are ed and they go to another dealership from then on ccp mechanicdealership is working on a car eve for a customer us and adding things to the car we dont need wis pi instead of fixing the problem we asked fixed in the first place anything posted in this hall  at this point ccp is handing back the still broken car to us with the new addon pi wis  so on not only is the car still broken but the new unwanted addon is also faulty because its affected by the problem the car had in the first place we might have been interested in the extra addons called up selling if given an option we never got the option and instead of having the problem we wanted fixed in the first place we now have the extra now unwanted addons and the problems they cause bugs in new expansionsso to continue the analogy buy not fixing the problems that eve has now ccp is just ing us off to the point that we might go else were i would rather have the problem with the engine fixed then a new shinny stereo and an engine that still runs like crap a new stereo is nice but if the car game doesent work whats the point if your mechanic did that to you what do you think you would do take it back right we cant take eve back to some dealership all we can do is type stuff like this and hope ccp takes note arnold predatorpsask me if im ed blasters are almost useless for pvp  but there is this new pi system that only kind of works
there are no problems with incarna for the csm to raisefirstly because it isnt out yet and wont be for a whilebut mostly because the csm should be focusing on gameplay and theres no suggestion incarna will actually contain any
i would be enthused about incarna if ccp didnt have a track record of releasing unpolished features and then leaving them without any improvementsif incarna is anything like the ultimate result of planetary interaction or faction warfare or the new evemail system and its lag problem or eve gate then i am not enthused about incarnaincarna is a bit different because the software is going to ultimately end up being used in their world of darkness game and eve is sort of getting it for free in exchange for being the testing ground for it so it might turn out different because ccp have a lot riding on itthat being an entire mmo whereas these above mentioned features seemed to be released just to get a spike in subscribers for an already successful mmo

bring em on cant waitwhy does the csm oppose this i cant fathom it are they afraid of crazed enemy pvpers flying around their space in uncatchable pvpcapable cloaky frigates well that is a frightening thought to be honest butwhat a blast cant wait for them
i cant speak for csm but having a frig that could do cruiser or even battle cruiser type damage would be a bit much anything t3 will be much better then anything t2 and a stupid about better then t1 we all know this im finding out first hand as i just got my proteus last week i knew it would be better before hand but i had no idea how much better there is quite the gap between t3 over t2 never mind t1 its meant to be that way but at some point you got to ask is it too much for examplemy proteus does the same damage as my hyperion but is half the size and twice as fast and thats with low skills in subsystems to scale that down to a t3 frig would mean that you would have cruiser dps from something flying at 3000ms and still have the tracking of small gunslaserswhat have you t1 frigs would pop just looking at a t3 t2 frigs might have enough time to worp outmaybe destroyers would no longer be flown as they would be one shotted by a t3 frig a t1 cruiser or bc would be a joke to a t3 frig as well do to dps out put and speed tankinghow would you fight against that all ships would have to fit duel webs just to see the t3 frig much less hit it i think a t3 frig would be too fast and too strong yes they would be fun to fly but they would also make flying anything else ed as a t3 frig would gank anything in space if too many t3 ship classes are out there you will get full t3 gangs that are invincible to anything other then other t3 here is a scary thought a t3 frig getting repaired by a t3 sc that gets a bonus per lvl to rr amount the t3 frig would be doing cruiser amounts of damage and the sc would be doing bs amount on top of it get two or more of these teams together and you have a scary gang by anyones standards everyone would run away at the sight of such a gang or die very quickly the only way to counter a gang like that would be other t3 ships or massive amounts of t1t2 bs or bc it would be fun for the t3 blob im not saying that it wont be but as a game designer ccp has to think about both sides of the battle keep people from emo quitting from being tanked from super gangs of t3 i think that t3 sc are all the t3 we need right now they maybe even a little over powered in some cases proteus with 34 million ehpbut given the huge investment of iskrisk of sp loss i think they should be head and shoulders above other ships im working on factiondeadspace fitting my t3 right now when its done i will have over a billion invested that i risk every time i undock even without the faction fitting my ship cost 500 million to buy the ship itself and subsystems a t2 costs what 15th the price for the hull and your done you also never risk loosing sp when you fly a t2 ship either so i guess my stance on this is keep a very limited number of t3 ships make them super expensive and risky to fly so they dont overpower every other ship in the game if ccp made a t3 of every class of ship no one would ever fly anything else ever i do not support the op in his wish for t3 frigs in case that was not clear all ready 
interesting reply thanks guess even though theyd obviously be expensive for frig sized hulls theyd still be what battleship prices itd undoubtedly be pretty affordable by the standards of 00 playersgood points
now that folks is a theorist or really a practical personfun  off we goconfusion  nah i think i will spin in the hanger
long time lurker first time posterlet me preface this by saying that i am not against suicide ganking and think that it should at least be an option for playerswhat i would like to see is some form of kill rights for the ganked individual against the ganker as it currently stands there is little to no chance of getting some payback as the ganker already has a 15 min global criminal flag hes going to stay docked for that period and youre not getting a shot at him how long the kill rights should stay active for is up for debate but i like the idea of 1 or 2 daysthe mechanics of these kill rights should be something similar to being flagged for stealing someones loot it should not be a free ticket to attack without the ganker being able to retaliate if he brings neutral friends too bad for you go find some help as wellthe second upside of this idea is that it actually creates more oportunity for pvp for people who choose not to leave highsecdons flame ant suit
wtf are you talking about you know that you get kill rights on a person for killing you in low sec or high sec if it is not concord sanctioned

the fact is the majority of the players base i would bet dont even know who the csms are nor care it was a pr ploy and marketing tool i just dont really care if they fly them over their 20 times a year means nothing i dont care if they disband them or hire them fulltime none of it matters csms dont matter get over it they can stay or go and to many of us we could give a ratsass one way or the otherif i had to vote to disband i would just for the simple fact that i dont trust anyone of them this is eve not wow i dont trust anyone in this game you know damn well they will use any information to their advantage i liked the cheetos thing but i prefer cornchips myself now that is something worth debating not self important csms or ccp because in the end ccp is going to do what they think best on a business level just as i would it is a business to them people they will judge what is best for their business so if csms are ignored maybe because some issue is bad for business most likely they regret creating it was worth a few shots on the game forums around the internet and some marketing but only a fool would think csm was going to change ccp business model which has been successful for good or badi think ccp is a good gaming company and cant always listen to people wanting pew pew things they also try to cater to the customer of course they do all the talk they dont care is nonsense they just have linear way of devloping as do all companies in this business

im going to use a common pvp scenario 1v1 hybrids vs lasers the combatants this time are neutron blasters vs pulse lasers both tech 2 d x h  f  oa  wd  dmg mod h  highest dmg ammo f  fire rate in seconds o  optimal and a  falloff w weapon scoreheavy neutron blaster ii 42 x 24  52518005000w 1800 because thats half of the guns normal optimal have to take into account the 50 optimal you get with antimatter1008525 6800  w1926800w130560 weapon score tracking of 1with null m t2 ammo the weapon score goes to 167200 for those who like math thats 42 x 22  52545005000heavy pulse laser ii36 x 24  525 60004000 again 6000 not 12000 due to the 50 you get from multi864  525 1000016410000164000 weapon scoretracking of 008125with scorch m t2 ammo the weapon score goes up too 332200for those who like math thats 36 x 22  525180004000so in this match up the guy flying the pulse laser would be 256 better of then the guy flying the heavy neutron blaster 164000130560 lasers are 98 better when both pulse lasers and blasters are shooting t2 ammo does that seem right to you 332200167200according to these numbers taken from 
k so we determined that blasters are a joke for pvp as you will never be able to make it to optimal before youre blown up well i want to pvp and all i have is hybrid weapons left lets see how railguns fare in pvp as its our only other option 250mm railgun ii33 x 24  6375 14400120007926375 26400124226400327888 weapon scoretracking 0023heavy beam laser ii36 x 24  6001200080008646002000014420000288000 weapons scoretracking 0033so again the lasers are a better choice then blasters all around shorter optimal less damage and worse tracking no wonder railguns are called failguns

nanite repair paste strontium clatherates liquid ozone etc it could all be used but this is in my eyes up to ccp to decide
this sounds awesome supported
upon reading this thread i noticed that my pants started to bulge in a matter of moments my pants ripped at the seams and i watched as the bean stock grew larger and larger i knew i should stop reading the thread but it felt so good after about a minute or so i must have reached some sort of climax as it shot out happy juice and blew a hole in the hole my neighbor is staring at me right nowthanks a lot op there goes my deposit3
this is an awesome ideai dont think the exchange rate will be great just to make it work economically speaking but i think this is awesome and lots of great publicity for pretty much everybody
can i get a dominx shaped ccpizza and quaf plz and thx u

its called a capital ship maintance array if i remember right csma it cost a billion isk and takes up 40k m3 of space and holds 1 super still need sov to use it though which means no low sec or 00 that you dont own and if you are flipping corps your ship gets locked in when you get accepted
if you have the isk to own a supercap you should have the isk to start an alt corp anchor a safe tower and have a place to log offemergency cynopark it for a trip to the  barthen again planing to own a supercap correctly takes an iq of at least 10 which is far above the average eve player
them new fangled alt chars would really help with this problem
i would enjoy spending the 4mil sp i have there in the same way we were allowed to after the 31 hour downtime i would love to see this happen as soon as possible
yes but only if the sps are reimbursedold chars wont mind small percentage in learnersnew char with no learners wont mindsmall percentage in learnersnew char with learners doesnt get screwed over for 50 of his sps

pi has simply caused me to quit the game let the pos run out of fuel let my skill ques run dry and not give a damn any more im just waiting for my submission cycles to end nowit was a fun seven years but with the release of things like pi and the upcoming secondlife in space i no longer find the game to be the least bit engagingslong all my stuff has been locked away on a holding alt if i come back for whatever reason itll be there if not count two dozen t2 bpos removed from the gamebai

i have been playing off and on for several years with different characters none the less and i have yet to see ccp even make an attempt to officially support multiple monitors despite many users calls for itsee these threads
medium shader setting was removed because the minority of players used it and ccp claimed it would be too difficult to maintain such a feature for only a handful of subscribers what makes you think that more players are going to use dual monitors than medium shaders exmedium shader user here
so for us 00 mongers one of my corp mates had an ideabattleship sized exhumer 200 bonus to survey scanner and strip miner range can mount 3 strip miners but has 1 or 2 extra high slots lowsmids to fit a roughly drakesized tank prohibition against fitting more than 2 mining laser upgrades on a single ship larger drone bay comments stat proposalsi was kinda thinking 4 highs 6 mids 4 lows 3 rigs would work well give it roughly a drakes cpu and cap maybe halftwothirds the pg 125mbit bandwidth 300m3 drone bay 2k cargo 20k mineral bay
seem too overpowered 300m3 drone bay 125mb bandwidth 20k mineral bay plus you are talking about a drake like tank i think there needs to be more balancing a tougher 00 miner is fine but i think youre adding too much all around
well true that is a touch op on the drone bay 125mbit w 150m3 would be more than plenty
i will raise this issue at the 11 sept 2010 meeting the wiki page for it is here
yet another ui usability fix supported for goodness

great idea1
ok you want highlevel issues1 timezone warfare this is unfortunately a big problem where my corp operates  most of my alliance are us time most of our enemies are eu this way everyone can just set the timers as necessary so that the important fights happen when the enemy is either sleeping or workingstudying of course i know this cant be automagically fixed  there is just no good time when everyone can fight recruit people in all timezones is currently an invalid solution too  why have 1000 people spread across timezones with say 400 on call at any time when we can have all 1000 in the same timezone and just set all the timers so that it is good for usi propose two approaches to this problem but by no means they are to be taken as final solutions just tossing some ideas aroundapproach a currently two or three engagements are needed to destroy a structure the attacker chooses the terms of the first engagement the defender chooses the terms of the second potentially third the catch  the defender needs to win any one of the engagements to succesfully defend the attacker has no choice but to fight and try to win on the defenders terms while the defender is free to just ignore the attack happening on the attackers termsyou could try to change the mechanics around propose more or less fights but you wont change the fundamental point what is to happen if both parties win every battle on their terms and lose all the battles on the enemys terms if status quo is maintained as now the defender has an advantage if the structure is lost the attacker does in either case the advantaged party can simply choose to ignore the unfavorable fightsmy proposal continue the engagements until one of the parties wins on the enemys terms for example a is attacker d is defendera attacks first this is on as terms if attack is succesful the structure is reinforced and will come out at a time of ds choiced has to defend on their terms if the defense fails the structure is destroyed  taken over by a if the defense succeeds another reinforcement timer begins set by aa has to try and attack again and d has to defend on as terms if d wins the structure is succesfuly defended and resumes normal operation if a wins another reinforcement timer starts on ds conditionsduring the reinforcement timer the structure has to be rendered inactive thus making d fight to reclaim it not just maintain a draw poses do that already deactivating reactions labs etc perhaps ihub upgrades should cease functioning while the ihub is reinforcedone issue i see with this is that it slightly favors the attackers if a stalemate is maintained they do not gain anything but the defenders infrastructure is hurting and by the very nature of eve there will be groups that will reinforce stuff for no real good reason other than to f with the othersapproach b shorter and maybe wiser make sov warfare dependant not only on several key battles although those could still be crucial but on overal performance for a period of time create temporary minor objectives for both patries to achieve from the moment the structure is reinforced to the time it comes out and make completion of these objectives favor the better side in the final fight or even get rid of that altogether and simply proclaim whichever side accomplishes a predetermined number of objectives first the winner possible strategies could be to lock the system down with a massive fleet for hours to complete all the objectives to bring the fleet in at a time more favorable than the beginning and complete all the spawned objectives at once or even run small gangs to complete the objectives behind the enemys backs
2 hard for small alliances to step up first i have to say that i have nothing against large alliances nothing against applying sufficient force to prevent a fight before even happening nothing against massive coalitions controling several regions if you can handle the politics the military the organization and the multiple industrial backbones needed all the power to you and i also agree that not every john doe should have a sovholding alliance however there should be some way for startup alliances a hundred to several hundred of players to compete and i of course dont mean taking over a region only a system or twocurrently the only option such alliances have is to join one of the preexisting power blocks new powers no longer arise they are only formed when the old coalitions are broken up there should be a small league for alliances to start on their owntwo notes first the amount of assets  space owned should most definitely not scale linearly with the strength of an alliance or a larger entity if a coalition of 2500 people holds an entire region that doesnt mean a 250 man alliance should hold a constellation if it isnt clear i propose a scaling way faster than linear second the dominion upkeep mechanics were a step in this direction making unused systems unprofitable and in my opinion they are already showing results  it might have taken longer than some anticipated but look at the influence map especially in the southeast and northwest the space is becoming more and more diversified although as i said before  this is mostly a result of larger blocks splitting upone possible approach make the edge systems and regions much more valuable than the ones directly connected to empire space the inner 00 should require constant maintenance and work to break even on the costs while the edge should provide more than enough resources  if you can utilize them smaller alliances could occupy the inner worlds which would be too unprofitable for the large power blocks to care about note am i proposing a restricted version of sovereignty in lowsec now3 little to no assets on alliance level none at higher levels maybe a little away from the topic of sovereignty but this is another thing i think needs to be looked at there are currently no assets that truly belong to an alliance itself and no ingame authority everything from poses to outposts always belongs to an individual corp and the alliance authority is the executor corp many of the existing assets even dont allow alliance usage  see smas chas industrial arrays cycling cynojammers fueling jump bridges etc etc this makes for quite unnecessary leadership problems where alts are necessary for even very simple actions just because you need to be in a particular corpsecond in the current political situation blocks larger than alliances are forming up see the influence map again apart from blue icons fleets and several outpost settings there is absolutely no way to accomodate these pacts all of the assets could use a allow for positive standing option example  pos forcefields jump bridges passwords to these should be only used to allow foreign entities access everyone who is already considered friendly should have access by default
first itt to mention lag i mean dev blogs about how they ran windows update on the server and it updated successfully are incredible and all but lets see some actual resultsthe role that lag has played in every sov fight since dominion is absolutely pivotal and simply cannot be overstated if you want to defeat your enemy blow up his ships and take his outposts or moons if you want to utterly destroy him and ruin his will to fight kill him before he loads grid while hes blackscreened give him 3 minute traffic delays when using a gate and bore him to death with module activation and targetting delays that make chess by mail look actionpacked by comparison once not enough people show up for your cta you have no choice but to give up and let the other side spend hours wailing on your ihubs lucky themyes theyre working on it and taking our concerns seriously great this still has to be said because its true and its extremely relevant i like this except i think timer 3 should be rand i too am sick of getting jabber pings for good fights from russians when im waking up in san franciscosov structures have way too much hp there are too many timers i dont fly caps so i dont consider myself qualified to comment on the balance suggestions except to say that they sound very well reasonedrelatedly amarr ships have a huge advantage in shootinggiantstructure warfare because you can afk with them drones are okay for this too but railsprojmissiles all suck note that this would be fixed by one of the csm proposals to make ships resume firing at last target after autoreloadingwhen sov structures get hit why not automatically reinforce the node how many systems are in serious danger of changing hands in a given daymost of all though its just straight up not fun i think theres too much of a sense at ccp that tedium and monotony are valid tools for game balance well sovereignty is really important so lets make it a huge pain in the ass to fight over we dont need to worry about whether or not the fighting itself is actually fun because people will do it anyway to increase their internet spaceship wealth and power see also pi can anyone point to a recent sov change that was a result of a hardfought battle i cant afaik in the south hta failcascaded and disbanded and the russians waltzed in atlas was defending cj in insmother thru 7 or 8 rf timers and then failcascaded when they got hit in their home systems which they didnt put up a fight over calculating the odds were against them anyways ive been in geminate taking stuff from the russianspets that they dont seem to care about now that they have insmother back no fights to speak of just hours of shooting 22m hp ihubs its entirely possible im mistaken about this so someone please correct me if i ami am very concerned however that devoting any resources to this might slow down the development of the wod alpha or even god forbid dust
fixed for you
the legitimacy of this argument depends entirely on your goalif your goal is to destroy the ship in question congratulations you succeeded quit yer ingif on the other hand your goal is to collect kill mails and stroke your epeen with them bring more guns next time  or shoot something smaller
eve is its own world part of that is being able to track accomplishments for that reason supported
agree completely discourage the blob change the timer
i dunnoleave the timer at 2 minutesbut produce a killmail have the selfdestructor as a damagedealer on the killmail but ensure that someone other than the selfdestructor and npc dealers like gateguns etc gets the killmail
sounds like something that would be very useful might cause extra lag in large pvp fights tho
fix blastwait wrong thread
if you spend the time to track someone down running locators and coordinating a trap with others you dont want the reward to be the price of a shuttle you get whatevers on his head for the pod kill thats what bounty means and once killed theres no more bounty on that personyour suggestion only removes any incentive for bounty hunters and maintains the bounty on the target after hes been killed doesnt help bounty hunting as a profession and unfair to the outlaw whos paid his debt to society by being squishedi dont agree when someone set a bounty on a pirate its not to have him pod kill once especially if its a clone with no implantthe idea to make bounty efficient and dissuasive is exactly to keep bounty until the ammount on his head is nullby the way i just read a lot of super idea to improve bounty system but they are really complexmy proposal is to implement something really simple to fix the actual systemany other argument against this or support
i like pvp unfortunatly at the moment by the time you get to a tower thats under attack its reinforced or the enemy brings enough people to make it so the server is stressed to the point where you cant jump reinforcementsposs arent vital to taking sov anymore except maybe for the pos that they anchored the tcu at buffing them would just make them last long enough for people to mount a defence of them if they were successfully attacked the increased hp on the batteries would make it harder to repair them if theres more chance of being able to defend a structure then theres probably more chance of the enemy actually showing up to fight when you siege the tower
i can agree with making pos batteries attack dronesbut the rest of your proposal is just complete and utter 
supportedits an obvious usability fixof course if the give money dialog box wasnt modal then we could cumbersomely check wallet balance independent of the give money dialog but thats another problem this proposed solution is simple and the most directly useful
supported for goodness
fyp for you no charge
the proposal was prioritized by the csm and passed 90
out of the top10 alliances only 1 one thats 10 has got a custom logo after that it gets a bit better and the ratio climbs for the top20 to 45so in the light of the promises by ccp supportedand please for the sake of god put in the possibility to say why a logo was rejected by ccp i mean with turnaround times of half a year a bit more feedback is needed here ya know that communication thingy that lets us work together and not waste everyones time by resubmitting and resubmitting and resubmitting a freaking logo in a computer game
notice how ccp engineering alliance has their logogrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
at present clickinganddragging a bookmark from people  places to your cargohold will move the bookmark erasing it from people  places in the process while shiftclickinganddragging will copy the bookmark to your cargohold leaving a copy in place in people  placesthis causes problems because sometimes the keyboard or the game wont detect the shift key and will move bookmarks when you intended to copy them insteadproposal eliminate the only move bookmarks functionality clickinganddragging a bookmark from people  places to cargohold should copy the bookmark anywayreasoning in the vast majority of cases we want to copy the bookmark leaving a copy for ourselves not destroy our copy of the bookmark if we want to destroy our copy of the bookmark we can easily shiftclickandclick to select however many bookmarks we have in people  places and then rightclick to remove location
supported i mean its standard business practice for many subscriptionbased services and considering they already have our email addresses cannot be that difficult to implement i suggest a 7day notice with variable messages based on your type of subscription so you have a clue what action to take or not without logging into the eve o account management page to review account details would be helpful for those of us with multiple accounts
and my bow
id like to point out i just got my first ever mail in 5 years notifing me that my account will end in 6 days because i used a plex a few days ago before i made this post i received a mail stating that my resub failed due to lack of fundswhile email notifications are helpful i am not going to log in to my email to see if my sub is about to end nor should i have to view my account status via account management especially when i run multiple accountsi should be able to see that my sub will end in 710 days every time i log in during that time frame until the game time is greater than 710 days across all of my accountsps thank you for the support csms hopefully this can become priority 1 for ccp asap
perhaps ccp assumes you know you have too keep paying they may even assume you realize its due every 30 daysthey probly dont realize some people need a mommy daddy andor someone too hold their hand through life
or maybe some people carry nothing but cash on them and when it is time to pay for eve they need to get cash to a prepaid credit card to pay for their accountjust sayin though
for about 1000 years of programming no wonder nothing gets done according to the csm fanboys
didnt you just make a proposal about not having any more proposals if you make a proposal about not having any more proposals then your proposal is invalid if your proposal is invalid then people can still make proposals which in turn means your proposal is acceptable but if your proposal is acceptable youre still proposing that there be no more proposals well were talking in circles interesting paradox but no support 
if people yelling they fix nothing have played the same game i have since beta will know that is just bull they have fixed googles of things in this game yes there are some problems but the game is very stable and i have ran into no game stopping bugs ccp has worked hard to make this a great game and i for one get tired of hearing my pet issue isnt fixed yesterdayi have after reading these forums for 2 days find csm system to be rather sillywalking in station is bad wtf people have waited 4 or 5 years for such a thing many people yet all we hear is csm and thier groupies cussing ccp sure ccp needs a proding sometimes but this csm system is sillyyou dont speak for the player base you speak for a minorityget over yourselvesthe devs have fixed tons of things all we hear from the csm groupies and csm is that they fix nothing i call bullone thing off the top of my head lag manticore stability markets
only in your mind put down the bottlepeople can make endless proposals but thankfully ccp ignores most of them
in that casetake your own advicei call bull on you pal
id like to see an end to proposals which are actually feature or idea suggestions with no supporting thread in the fi forum
if i show support to a no more proposals proposal does that make me a bad person will that rip a hole in timespace or both
back at you
well i didnt know about that thanks for the tip but you cant change your speciffic overview tabs and with possible lag when you undock  well you know what can happen  and you still have your drones that you just bought in station to put in the right group of drones
ughh not again
sadly ccp has forgotten all about poses a long time ago they dont care about small corporations that just got into 00 and they dont care about people living in wspaceits all good and shiny for megaalliances holding whole regions and multiple stations thoughgive poses some love please
i wholeheartedly support having a fee attached to the transportation its the needed micromanaging crap that means you need to be in that system that bugs me
corp theft is a cool and almost unique game mechanic nerfing it would make eve less of a harsh universe and more of a candyland where everybody holds hands sings and makes isk together in highsec
correct but there should be a setting between you are on your own and go ahead and take one of each free of charge especially in pos hangars and arrays its an allornothing deal infiltrating a corp and causing major damage should be something that takes effort and time invested to get to the highranked positions not equal to gaining lowest level accessif someone works their way to director status without anyone noticing and one day rides off with the contents of the corp wallet blueprint hangar and several faction towers congratz to him if a new recruit who wants to store his ratting drake automatically gets access to the entire tii fleet thats bad game design
no its not recent deal with it like the rest of usbienvenidos a eve online
i see many t3s running missions in low sec as well as plexes they are far from useless which is my point tbh if i could scan wrecks id not complain but most know not to use drones even because they are scannable
i love pirate tears

2 days till the orignal thread is 4 years old its growing up so fast
i have to correct myself the transversal is the absolute value of the difference between the two speed vectorsplease visit your user settings to reenable imagesgiven this maybe showing both the speed vector and the trasnversal would clutter things a bit too much actually im not even sure i want to have the option of the transversal vector

yes

this should be 30 pages by now
i am definitely in the wrong thread while im here you all know what a futanari is right
in general fix the whole lowsec
didnt they make it possible to join a corp from space a few patches ago
the fact that a workaround exists is not a valid argument against streamlining it it should not take a disproportionate amount of effort and more significantly risk just to do something as mundane as joining a corp
search for the corp of interest do show info on the search result on the info window theres a button to apply to join nownot sure if you can use it from space though or if youll get an error telling you to be in a station like so many other things but its worth a try
supported im much more interested in newer players being able to get into the game fully more quickly than the effectively abstract concept of lvl55s characters fractionally catching up with older players with only lvl44s over an x years timeline of strict focused training regimes id rather play eve than evemon
short nolong answer nnnnnnnnnnnnnnoooooooooooooooothis discussion has been going on for years alsways with the same arguments new players hate it old players forgot about it players that have maxed it dont carefirst of all the new players that dont like to skill weeks and weeks for the rest of their eve life for a certrain purpose  this is not your game move alongthis game is all about having to train weeks and weeks and weeks for certrain shipsmodsstatsaspects learnings are a part of this very concept you cant grind it and you cant get a premium account so as i said move along nothing to see here eve is the only mmo that has this concept and if you dont like it there is something else for you out therealso these are pretty much the only skill that will help your throughout your whole eve existance other skills might be helpfull to but learning in general will always be helpfulas in my times as a recruiter and mentor for newer players i told new ppl that it would be smart to have learning from the start up  but not everything we do in life is smart so i told them get to a ship that will be handy for a few days and then train your learnings also learnings are a good time to sort out where you wanna go in eve there are tons of possible ways and finding the right one for you will take some timein general eve training from time to time is pain in the ass depending on how long you are in the game the pain differs at the beginning a few days are a pain then two weeks are a pain then you get to the point that you dont care how long it takes cause its waht you want to learnnew players dont need to train learnings at some point it might become handy but before that you can easily train your first cruiser and do whatever you like you probally lag the money to but one but you can train one lose it and be frustrated about it and leave the game after 2 days

theyre kinda unnecessary the less time spent preparing to prepare to play the game the betteri support attribute implants though because they provide a carrotandstick to get enough money or lp for them and such however i would happily compromise and get rid of those if it meant we could axe learning skills
keep in mind that the csm is a representative body not a blind conduit for direct democracy as such several csms felt that an extra step was needed to insert csm input into the prioritization process you will note that i made sure that the results before and after the csm input were made public to ensure transparencyas this was the first time we had done crowdsourcing we were experimenting with the process in the second crowdsourcing ui low hanging fruit just passed we used a different method we just subdivided the list based on how many csms 1d each idea but within each sublist the items are in player priorityalso remember that csm often has extra ndasealed information about certain issues that factor into our decisionsthis backlog prioritization only covered items that had previously been passed by csm i am sure a good proposal about fixing hybrids more than fix hybrids would be an interesting one if ive missed one please point me to itthe csm is also currently in the early stages of developing an actionlist of game balance issues more on that will be made public sometime soon i hope

getting into t2 small autocannons also gives you the prereqs for t2 small artilleries getting into t2 rockets does not give you the prereqs for t2 light missiles youll still have to go spend several more days training standard missiles skill to 5 if you want the t2 longrange counterpart so training t2 guns of any race in general is faster than t2 issiles if youre talking both long and short range variants which people who specialize in this weapon type will want to train
rocket ships not sucking would be a very nice christmas present ccp p
i support this proposal ive supported this proposal for a very very long time this is a good idea it doesnt affect the mineral markets and it gives a higher end goal for miners beyond hulks mining is not a miniprofession it deserves more end game content like combat currently has even if its just bigger ships that dont mine any faster
why hulk mines good and tanks good as wellno need for a bs sized miner
the main incentive for me would be longer range comes with larger ship and increased cargo bay drone capabilities are nice ill never turn down extra hitpoints eithersince i want longer range and extra cargo storage that implies a bigger ship the rest just kind of falls out as an appeasement to the masses to not upset the mineral markets down cries would be the lack of empire ganking capabilities against them but again the same argument would hold for why you cant gank level 4 mission runners in empire when theyre in bss
from my point of view it looks like the op wants a miner that can tank and repel most rat spawns in 00the only downside i see to this is suicide ganking miners becomes harder oh noes pirates lament i see nothing wrong with giving miners a shiny new toy hell if you want to do the most boring thing in eve there have to be some perks to it
despite my aversion to mining i see no reason why t3s shouldnt get mining subsystems
i like the idea of a heavytanking exhumer with an ore bay for nulllow but there needs to a tradeoff between survivability and mining yield limit it to two strips and in return give it 2 warp strength like the skiff add strip gas miners and gas bonus if the devs are feeling generousedit this ship might be a bit overtanked in highsec  its an i win button against hulkageddon it might be wise to restrict activation of its strip miners to lownullsec
but there are already battleships in game and most of them can use 7 or 8 miner 2s and you can use drones to defend yourselfincreasing efficiency of mining wont improve gametime but can only lead to minimizing dependency on others as everyone would be able to mine most of minerals they needin my opinion adding mining barges and exhumers in the game was bad decision as it pretty much eliminated frigate cruiser and bs miningwhat is the point of having nice mining bonuses of frigates like navitas tormentor and others if pretty much nobody is using them
perhaps variants one that has 2 warp strength and 5 shield resistances per level 3 highs can only mount 2 strips 10k ore bay 2k cargo 75m3 drone bay 5 mids 3 lowsone that has 4 highs 3 strips mountable 20k ore bay 2k cargo 150m3 drone bay 6 mids 4 lows 200 strip miner and survey scanner rangeone that has 3 highs 3 strips mountable 40k ore bay 500m3 cargo 50m3 drone bay 5 mids 3 lows mackinaw bonusestheyre for people who cannot fly exhumers etc yeti made my first million in eve jetcan mining in a navitas
it sounds like were talking t3 mining subsystems d
just for my understanding1 a proper fit hulk can already tank 00 belt rats2 you got 5 hammerhead iis for your own defensethat sounds plenty for meso the only reason i can see why you want a drake like tank that you might survive pvpers that come along long enough so reinforcements can arrivebut imho  some guards should be on grid all the time teamwork and such
i went down the miners path for a while myself tis true a bssized ship with strips would have been such a joy at the timewhat i see in the here and now is a ahem slightly overpowered frankensteining of the hulk dominix and a marauderorcarokh apoc hyperion done right theyll get closeish to the hulk yield but with much better tank yes the cargo hold is lacking but thats the tradeoff
im well aware of this i have a hulk that can tank 3x guristas bses and the tank costs less than the hullyeah but the existing t3 miner proposal i saw quite frankly sucks
and you could shoot them at other races to coat them in duct tape also at which point theyd be effectively morphed into minmatar ships as well
coating other ships in ductape would be the offensive use of these launchers it would act as a permanent webifier until the ship was repaired at a station station only as no actual damage would be done the signature size would remain unaffected but there would be a chance for fire as ducctape glue if i recall is flamable when heated duh this fire would cause thermal damage reduced by normal resistances over time and would burn off the ductape eventually removing the web effectfull support sir

like spiderman 3 blasters observe how quick it was to give us the 100k sp when the servers were down that time this time you just set it so that each sisi mirror gives the pilot 5m instead of 100k its hardly incarnai support this thread would be very nice to trybeforeyoubuy alot quicker would give fairly new people such as myself 9 month old toon more scope to see what they should train for first and would let me have alot more fun when i head to fdmlj dalso third page snipeedit  hellyeah
100 support behind this idea it would be nice to swap out subsystems from a orca parked in a wh safe spot
as i understand it one of the awkward parts from ccps side is how to change the model while in spaceone solution is to have the t3 surrounded by an opaque cylinder silver or whatever during the subsystem swapping may require clicking on a different fitting screen to activate access subsystem maintenance field or something when finished cylinder disappears and new shape t3 is visiblefairly crude method but it would worki wonder what the new motherships can do as theyre supposed to live up to their name more than the ex ones did
title says it all its unique and super cool it should also be updated for the trinity graphicsas the argument for removal was lag leave it a setting to be turned on and off like turren effects etc  off reverts back to current animationplease support bringing back one of the cooler effects of eve
totally agree the older effect looked so much cooler
agreed capitals should have some stronger effect when they jump in not like all of the other ships in the game
i think my biggest issue with this whole this jump portalsits a portal generator not a blup jumper make it open a portal make it cool make it real please fix this the old animation was well worth the clientlag which as i posted earlier could easily be turned off if you made it a setting if needed and actually would be quite nice have a whole new tab in settings labeled misc settings  move the turret effects camera shake  everything misc setting related to this tab
at the moment logistics pilots are a bit on the downside when it comes to killboard stats those stats are a bit superificial but one wants to see what he has done in his endeavours currently logistics need to killmail either via failfittings eg one cannon instead of a remote repairer or by drones which easily fail and need extra concentration and attention since logistics pilots are an integral backbone of most fleets i think it could be a nice thing if they got on killmails of people they repaired during a fight eg gustav guardian repairs bob battleship bob battleship then kills a scorpion on the killmail of the scorpion our logi pilot gustav guardian would appear under the participants who killed the scorpion this would probably get them on relatively many killmails but i dont see a problem with that logistics pilots are often primaried cant really insure their ships and have a less laid back job than the casual grunt who only shoots at a primary this can of course be modified to lessen the amount of killmails they would get on passively for example by adding a certain timeframe in which the repaired ship needs to do a kill before the logistics isnt added onto the killmail anymore for example the 15 minutes of the aggro timer which probably covers a normal fleet fight if there are downtimes with waiting at pos or gates every engagement would probably be its own fighti think this would make the job of the hardly sought after logistics pilots more comfortable and reward them a bit more for allowing the whole fleet to move out and have fun summary logistics pilot should get on killmails by repairing friendlies not by shooting with one useless gun
this would make the pilots strife to be good logistics not km therefore i like my idea and support it
not supported at alli fly logistics and definatly do not need to be on killmails because i repaired someonejust live with the fact u cant km  and using drones doesnt require any attention just assign them to someone
the logistics pilots that can maintain concentration while repairign and whoring on kms successfilly is the better pilot lets not try to make people lazy now either you use drones or a small gun on your ship whatever its not an issue i dont recall letting anyone die because i was too busy assigning my drones to a cepter or shooting someone else while repping a broadcast its fine as it is
i would support this idea if logistics get aggression counter just as the shooting ships at the same timeand then ask yourself if you want to loose your can always dockjump out capability for killmails
this
hmmm sounds suspiciously like my reply in a similar thread from a while ago  you plagiarising me darius op interdictors asked for bubbles to get them on mails and ccp traded the mails for aggression read what darius asked and consider your answer very carefully  price may be very steep indeed
i am bringing this thread up again in hopes it will get csm attention maybe we can even get a section on 00 in the next csm meeting minutes i do not think nullsec is broken right now  it is fine it just could use a few improvements to make it awesome i am not supporting for any of the concrete ideas in particular just supporting holding this discussioni strongly disagree this means that the deciding battle assuming the attacker wins the first on their terms and the defender wins the second on theirs is decided by pure chance this should never be the casedepends for smaller alliances i agree it can take hours but for the current forces the structures are gone so fast that mounting any counteroffensive when you get attacked is futile i can not think of a way to change this so that 50 man fleets could destroy the structure in a reasonable time and yet 250 capital fleets wouldnt just blast through it and i am not sure this would even be beneficialeverybody is different for some people mining is fun for some people running missions or higsec anomalies is fun i cant stand either of these but for me holding 00 space and fighting for it is the best fun ive had in any mmo so far in the end there is no way to create a single mechanic that would be fun for everybody but if sov warfare is not fun for you nobody is forcing you to do it eve has a crapton of other content  empire missions trading wormholes exploration piracy and much more and if you cant find anything of this that would be fun for you  why do you play evewe had a fight in rorzh a few days ago i believe there has been a report on this on evenews or whats the site ignoring the epic lagfest it was we the nc have had about 15 times the enemy numbers but we were overcome by superior fleet composition and tactics good fights to everyone involvedthat being said hovewer i think few people realize that in eve most fights arent won or lost on the battlefield many times they are won long before the fight even starts by the alliance which can produce a better fleet recruit more skilled and experienced pilots or infiltrate the enemy and know how to counter their attack before it happens if the enemy fields 100 ships we dont have to field our own 100 and defeat them risking huge losses if we are large enough we can simply bring 200 of our people making the enemy not attack at all and winning with no casualtiesthis is one of the things i love about eve  even if you are not any good in direct combat you can still significantly affect the outcome
historically speaking every time ccp nerf hp or makes something easier to kill you just see already obese coalitions grow to cover the hpthe problem is and will always be the diplomacy if people are so intent on comparing rl to eve then the diplomacy should be identical too
proposal as it says in the title move all supercapitals to nullsec do not allow them to jump into lowsec give carriers another type of jump portal useable in lowsec because they have the capacity to help with actual logisticsor just move all capitals to nullsec either way it would give lowsec a chance at being populated because people dont like being hotdropped by eight titans in a battlecruiser or some such stupid overkilledit look at the population of wormhole space look at what is lacking in wormhole space supercapitals and hotdrops theres a reason it thrives
seriously
catiously supporting moving supercaps  true is that moms are overkill to anything u can field in lowsec other option is to allow bombs low sps can fight back the supercaps or dd in low but then it will turn hell on eve 
not supported and will never get supported by me eitheronly because you lost a battleship or something to a super carrier in low sec doesnt mean you have to cry like a kid because of ithtfu and live with it i have been killed by a mothership when it was called that earlier and i lost a tempest to that mothership super carrierbut did i whine about it nah i just moved on and bought a new tempest
supported provided the belowstrip sc bonuses similar to the dd strip make scs only able to launch 1 drone per level  like a carrier 10x fighters and no bombers this would still allow super caps into lowsec for logistical purposes but render lowsec combat of super caps uselesspointless as it should be
8 of eve population in less than 7 of the systems low sec against 7 in 30 or so of the systems whstrange definition of thriveqen 22010
cannot support a blanket ban of supercapitals in lowsec but will support making it so ludicrously expensive fuel intensive to jump in that getting out requires cachesif it was the one or two being dropped once in a blue moon there would be no issue  but we are seeing 1020 being dropped on single carriers or subcap gangsfleets several times a week guess null is really boring these dayskilling them is nigh impossible without being able to spam dictors the infinipoint hic simply does not cut it against supercapital blobs being dropped into predominately subcap environments  not as if lowsec denizens can pull a gazillion dps out of their asses even if a hic manages to survive 200 drones
dread is not a supercapand im guessing youre either just butthurt because you got sucar blobbed your l5 carrier got popped by a titan or your towers got siegedtough break this is eve its unfair get over it
1 to the topic
any change is a good change
also make it so you cant cancel the self destruct
hell yea
i eve castorpe think there should be a skill points give away of 200000 points every 2 months for players who have accounts older than 3 months this way skill training wont be such a dread for people who dont have alot of time on their handsand the overall expierience will be more productive for players
interesting1i think
nearly everyone will settle down in caldari space a few in amarr and the rest will end like solitudenot a good idea at all it looks sexy at first but wonUFFFDt work
the font ingame needs an update why dose the 0 and the o have to look exactly the same cant ccp just make the 0 zero have a slash through it another problem is the b and the 8 6 and the g or the 5 and the s changing fonts ingame is really an easy fix this should have been done yesterdayplease sign for an easy and quick fix
the bounty is for killing the pod not the ship you dont get a bounty when you kill the ship and the pod gets awayto pick up on your idea though having a payout based on medical clone cost  implant value could be an idea and has been discussed already iirc
im sure the op understands that thats how it currently works he was getting at is the fact that the existing mechanic is woefully flawed and is proposing that it be changed
support this topic
not supportedi can use 6 planets and all my clicking is done in 3045 minutes depending how distracted i am by tvit really is not that much effort for goods that are free of any other effort
utterly fails to address the issue causing the proposers angst checkneedlessly complicated checkno thought about what the unintended consequences might be checkim throwing my weight behind it
short explaination the ability to set up pi for corp or for personal much like how you can anchor secure cans personally or for corp
ive been told that titans were orginally a lot bigger so much so that the amarr one would hang out of pos shields at both ends then they shrank them to the relief of titan pilotsalso kind of off topic but the same titan pilot told me that titan wrecks were originally intended to be permament structures in the game back when it was expected that thered only be a handful ever built
carriers and super carriers need size boost esp super carriersplease reference eve ship comparisontechnically speaking the dreadnought should be roughly the same size as a super carrieredit hehe surrendermonkey beat me to the link p
i think the point is that the dictor can get in drop the bubble and get out faster than the titan can target it since he never gets to fire the weapon at it tracking or lack of it doesnt matter
didnt read the whole thread but i wonder how easy this would be to implement with your warp computer working on a point system the way it does it seems like the easy solution would be to give these batteries a really big number like focused warp disruption scripts give infinite is actually 900 pts or something like that the side effect of that is that these batteries would then successfully scramble everything in the game no matter how many stabs are fitstill the intent of the op sounds like a good idea and it sounds fair his version not mineit would require supercaps fleets to use a little more strategy to mitigate their risks thats for sure it seems like thatd be a good thing in the current game1 here
i guess you could link in the boosts into the current sov mechanics so the more sov you have in any category the more ehp your structures have up to no more than about 50 more than the base
i actually just noticed thatneeds improvement
id like to filter out people that write contracts in local not by blocking but by only ignoring messages with contracts in textperhaps id also like to filter out people that are in npc corpsbasically i propose that we get some customizable filters for local chat
wouldnt mind carriers being able to jump through 00 gates though anything bigger shouldnt be allowed to and they shouldnt be able to jump around in lowsec systems and high sec of cause
100 support for a fantastic idea
dont want to train for this type of ships anymore after reading what these ships are currently capable of so i agree with the need for changes at least jump range
hate to say but i agree didnt get the thread at all until we had a bomber gang and had to take a covert ops hauler along i kept wondering what it was for until we ran out of fuel
supported hybrids really need some love and perhaps gallente ship bonuses as well but thats another topic
im relatively new to the game and even ive given up on hybrids already i support a change

you dont really need a battleship sized exhumera tier 3 battleship fitted with 8 t2 miners can mine a bit less than a hulk but has way more tank cargo ofcourse is smaller but you can put quite some shield bufferrokh minermining laser upgrade iimining laser upgrade iimining laser upgrade iicoprocessor iicoprocessor iilarge shield extender iilarge shield extender iiinvulnerability field iiinvulnerability field iisurvey scanner iimedium shield extender iiminer iiminer iiminer iiminer iiminer iiminer iiminer iiminer iilarge core defence field extender ilarge core defence field extender ilarge core defence field extender i122k ehp mines 971 per minute while a hulk has 915k ehp depends on faction modsfit and can mine 1341 per minute sacrifice some yeld for tank you cant have both or hell dunno try to mine with an orca
ccp wont do anything that makes it easier for you to play eve as a single player game cooperation is rewarded stop victimising yourself by playing alone and youll figure out that youll do a lot better
next time try actually you know talking about the subject at hand instead of a making mind blowingly incorrect assumptions about the op ones easily dispelled just below the characters nameb talking out your posterior because your mouth knows betterc acting like cowardly jita campers are l33t players
im gussing here that your comparing tech 2 mining lazers to tech 1 stripers i use tech 2 stripers and crystals and i get around 1500 per minute i use to bs mine becouse there was little differnts in high sec with the small rocks but now i mine alot more with the hulk then the bs do to the rocks not poping every cycle of my stripers
my hulk pilot only with exhumers iv gets around 1800minute but thats with t2 mining drones deployed as well and a 3 implant
t3 mining barge where you can activally make the tradeoffs based on the subsystems it in my opinion makes the t3 crusiers very fair so do the same here
there is orca and rorqual for long range mining in 00 yes you need some organisation but beeing able to do large mining op without cap industrial will just encourage 00 miners to not use them
i didnt apply implantsbonuses on the hulk or the bs my point is you can have 122k ehp and mine acording to your values 12 of what a hulk does with 15k ehpdont you think its a nice tradeoff 122k15k 9711500 no drones or whatevert3 barge no onjections but you cant have bs tank and hulk efficiency thats damn op like combat ships cant have omfg tank and uber high dps simple t2 fits dont link a crazy xtypecommander tengu
a t3 hulk should out strip a t2 hulk have storage tank and drone bandwidth for sure  if its not in a fleet its m3 output should be less than the a hulk if youre in a fleet obtaining fleet bonuses then the t3 hulk would see a x compared to the hulk it cannot be utilized in empire space after all who wants to see empire minerals crash even moreif you incorporate these 3 points youre also playing well into what the objectives for what ccp wants in the game more people wanting to take their chances in null sec  wh corpsmining is profession and there should be a progression
first i proposed a battlecruiser sized tank battleship sizesecond how is tanking ability with no appreciable offensive ability ophow would it not make sense for ore to build ships that can store more and be more survivable
pointless idea and would not be productive people would just use it to test ships out in whatever scenarios they envisage them being used not to test lagdo whatever it is that ccp wants them to participate in
maybe ccp wants to test bombs but i cant fly a stealth bomber or they want to test carriers and fighters but i cant fly a carrier but im not that far away it can be used to actually help with testing or when they were testing pi i remember i didnt test it for a while because i didnt have the pi skills and had to wait for them to trainedit or yes people could just train random things the op didnt say this but i proposed that sp be rewarded for participating in a test in which case its a good incentive to show up ive heard rumors its happened
wow 2 million sp after the big fight is already over thats almost as much sp as i lose from not maintaining my skill queue on sisi between mirrors i cant wait to log in and see what its like to fly around with the same amount of sp that i have on tq when theres nobody to shoot atseriously ccp your players give you great ideas and you water them down and twist them until theyre completely ineffectual and lameare all european companies this stupid
supported but if this is a pos module youll have a great advantage when defending a pos against agressor so need to think about this first
when you entered this thread you entered the twilight zone  a place where time or threads repeats itself in an infinite spiral of doomor in other words not againedit
well dont give the logistics pilot credit for the kill give them an assist for repping someone that was on the km
while as a logistics pilot myself i sympathize with the ops desire to be credited for his contribution to the success of a battle i fear that his suggestion would impose too much of a bookkeeping load on the servers since now in addition to keeping track of who is hitting who it has to keep track of who is repairing the guy who is hitting the targetalas i rather fear that we longsuffering logistics pilots will have to find other motivations for our altruistic contributions to interstellar death and destruction than killmails
that little thanks logi in fleet chat is all i need not supported
as logistics pilot myself better dont do it then we get more km  morons in logistics which means smaller chance your circle jerk buddies are semi capablethat and it isnt needed to make it even a better solution would be just removing kms from eve

waste of pixels preaching to the choir
read the minutes i have to say im rather disappointed in those csms who prefer to obfuscate and hide things from the playerbase rather than present them with the unvarnished truth disregarding the forum trolls do you really think so little of the players that you believe them to be incapable of determining where the csms abilities and responsibilities end and ccps begin

ive been reviewing the thread and giving this a bit of thought i am starting to wonder if what is needed is not so much an actual vector but some sort of overlay display that intuitively gives you the gestalt of what you need to know in a very compact form anyone who has watched sf anime will know what im getting atso what data do we want to be able to grok just by looking at a ship direction and speed relative to the celestial sphere centered on my ship radial velocity heading towards and away from me transversal  or more particularly are my guns able to hit himanything elsei am thinking maybe a circle around each ship with 2 180degree arcs the top arc is transversal the bottom one is radial and a small triangle moves around the outside of the circle to indicate transversal directionarc size would indicate magnitude arc colors would indicate things like towardsaway and how well your guns might trackthoughts
up
cool ideas but they could work less clearly than a simple vector in messy situations where you have to zoom out those indicators would overlap if two vectors overlap it should still be clear enough given that they start from the ship but circles and triangles not so much and one of my objectives is to be able to see what nearby ships are doing when zooming outmaybe the current columns of the overview could be selected in order to add to your tactical overlay either speed or trasnversal or radial and so on as vectors im also trying here to minimize programmers workedit your ideas would however be awesome if one could mouseselect a blob and see the average or median speedtransversal

overall i agree with what you have stated
supported  nice would be to save your settings for each character
absolutely i absolutely hate having to go through changing all the settings it would be amazing to be able to simply set everything up then never have to worry about it again unless ccp has a massive hard drive failure and the data is lost
it is pain when you finish training for something on tq then switch to sisi to work on testing it only to discover youre 2 weeks behind in your training there i guess we could log in every day just in case they mirrored it in the last 24 hours
this bending over backwards to griefers that drives away your customers isnt good business practice
removing kms would achieve the same results plus cure kmwhoring altogether
no i dont want to be listed on a goddam killboard dammit
i have no complaints about the new sov system the problem is people still are fighting over poss because thats where the money for the alliances come from if ccp were to find a different income source for alliances would require a decrease in the passive income from moon gold that is tied to holding sov it would be a different storyim supporting mazzs fourth point
i helped ccp with the new sov mechanics when i was in the csm and they used a few of my ideas i do have a few complaints about the current mechanics though as follows1 missions cant be run in sov space the idea for an outpost upgrade which broadcast to an agent of a given level equal to the sov level of the system the outpost is in was a good idea and would allow mission runners to have an interest in alliance sovereignty as well as supporting the alliance in question2 theres no reason to hold intervening space if an alliance holds a few valuable systems they can just hold those without worrying about the systems between my ideas were to have local be delayed except for the controlling alliance making intel far easier in your sovereign systems and to increase the price per jump from your core systemnearest outposti had all these mechanics and more worked out in a massive document but the data is somewhat antiquated with the advent of dominion and tyrranis ill try to revise the document and post a link to it when i get the opportunity and the muse until then supported
please explain how pilots are supposed to move them from one side of the map to the other then do you realize how much longer the route is around empire space rather than straight through it rest assured the north and south would never have a real fight ever again
lowsec population is made up of almost entirely inactive alts who dont do anything other than logging in once in a while plus a handful of fw alts while wh population is real people who actually plays while making a lot of iskwhenever someone brings caps to a lowsec fw fight fights over everyone just leaves its pointless without bubbles all its good for is hotdropping the random noob dessie which is pointless and not worth the fuel costs having killmails like that under your name is a liability people think less of you and youre better off without it
uhmm focused scripts
i support banning supercapsdreads  supercaps to 00 i think its kind of game breaking for smaller lowsec corps and alliances and probably a total drag for fwbut im only guessing there as i dont particiapte i think lowsec should be a kind of stepping stone or at least alternative to 00 and i think it would be a lot better if supercaps were banned
this ill support it if km is abolished
i will update proscons based on feedbackccp with dominion ask us to pay for the system upgrades why not applying tyrannis roleplay logic to dominion and remove isk for sovfeed the tcu and infrastructurehub with tyrannis fuel rather then paying isk it can add up to 23 more items to fuel per systemideascrazy ksk  introduce specific fuel for tcu and other sov itemsarklan1  large bay to ensure a long play time between refueling this critical assets for sovdarveses  pos refueling is annoying and can be reviewed there is an other proposal on this pointpros  sov will really means that you can afford one by organization not only by having fixed pve incomes can concord really can trust us when we kill a npc in 00  in a region where concord dont change our security status when we podkill sounds strange in a rpg way crazy ksk  add more fun and alternative way to conquer a systemcons ccp will sell less gtc ccp will need to code it and it will cost them time in bug fixing mass of people impacted but no more than with the tyrannis expansion fuel the sov blocker too  bagehi  fueling can be a nightmare for large organization
no diaf fueling dozens of systems would be a nightmare i would rather do faction warfare than be faced with something like that
yes bring the fueling back but introduce fuel cells that are made from ice products and from planetary ones1 having to fuel tcu and ihub would make it much harder for even big alliances to hold large amounts of systems 2 it would make it possible isolate a system preventing it from getting refueled and thus the tcu going off linealso harassing a alliance by attacking its transports could lead to the alliance giving up on some systems3 it would lead to alliances having chains of system rather than some spread out single ones and all that would lead to less systems occupied and better chances for small groups to get into 00to make it fair though i would say ihub and tcu can both hold a week worth of fuel which should be one whole freighter of fuel cells for one system with hub and tcu
stacking rr is pretty dumb most of the time the rr is split between different targets fcs think people actually pay attention to them when they call targets lol smartbombs i can see those are usually an all or none thing
its not just rr smartbombs should stay ungrouped too for extra poddingstill just because it shouldnt be grouped in our opinion doesnt mean others shouldnt have the option to if they want to group it let them
just propose that we can group any active module that we have more than one of
this salvagers mining lasers strip miners smartbombs everything please
wouldnt say every active module shield boosters armor repairs sensor booster etc dont need to be groupednow smartbombs would be very usefull just clik one time and bushhhh  it takes alot work doing f1  f8 or even worst clicking module 1 by 1about remote repairs when you have like 4 rr fitted could be usefull put them in groups of two or stack 3 rr to rep primary target and 1 rr for secondary target for example
why not every active module what does it really matter if it doesnt need to be grouped i vote just give people the option if you dont like it dont use it
yeah group any module that can be activated i am thinking be able to group all the active armor or shield hardeners in one group so you dont have to click all of them on and miss

so the story goes something like this i was looking into capitol ships and thinking of getting a carrier and came to the realization that one silly little interceptor can pin your multibillion isk capitol ship with no chance of warping or jumping away now this offends me on a couple levels but the obvious isk based ones aside the main thing that bugs me is that ccp has gone to great lengths to prove just how different these two modes of travel are warping and jumping and then plop down one modual that disables bothso what i am going to propose is to grant all jump capable ships a resistance to warp scrambling moduals but to be applied only to the actual act of jumping once scrammed or disrupted or bubbled they cannot warp just jump then tie this resistance to the jump drive calibration skill granting a 1 at level 2 and 2 at level 3 ect so that at level 5 you could still jump if you were warp scrammed by up to 4 people but the 5 one would nail you now before the waling about unbalancing begins i believe that due to recent ccp changes to jump drives you can only jump out of a system to a another system no insystem jumping is allowed any more so there would be no easy escapes for stupid pilots you would still need to be smart and have friends also as i mentioned before ccp has gone to great lengths to state how different these two drives arejump drive back story

and learn how to write capital capitol ships are where the gallente senate has meetings they can be stopped by motions and vetos
youre an idioti was going to write something far more clever and witty perhaps even helpful to guide you on your way to capital ship goodnessthen i realized that even i who dont yet possess the skills to fly a capital ship understand that one of the basics of operating a carrier is ahembring friends to cover your assthat said i was forced to conclude that no amount of helpful advice would actually be of any use to you and i would be wasting both my time and energythus my opening statement

less dps comes with more range if you want to trade range for dps fly a proteus and why are we comparing cov op fits for ehp and dps
youre forgetting that the medium neut also creates some kind of damage
why do i get the feeling yall think the maller is a fantastic gank ship look they both have an ew bonus when configured like this the legion gets neuts the proteus gets tackle its basically equal although different just like the arazu vs pilgrim both are equipped so as to dictate the range of a fight the fact that blasters are shorter ranged isnt really relevant since the legion lacks a weapon bonus a cap bonus is not a weapon bonus you could throw blasters or acs on with no penaltyif you throw neutrons onto said legion the dps goes up at the expense of range if you throw acs on the dps goes down slightly but you get selectable damage type similar range better tracking no cap usage what im really arguing here is the 10 cap usage bonus should be removed from the game but ive thrown that idea out before and its typically shot down by 2 month old characters flying bss in lvl4s who are worried about cap stability so i limited it to the legionas is the legion with the cov ops subsystem lacks the dps to kill anything even with neuts if you make proper usage of the neut bonus and turn it into a gunboat pilgrim it does about 150 dps with 3 medium neuts a pilgrim with 3 neuts does 240 dps hammerheads for comparison and can select damage type the proteus on the other hand is a great solo gank ship with that setup it may not have neuts but it actually has enough dps to break something and that 20km scrambler is pretty handy too of course getting it into optimal is no problemhopefully that fully explains it everyone i know who is amarr specd thinks the cov ops subsystem for it is crap compared to the other races and thats why i really didnt bother to explain initially i thought we were in unanimous agreement that it needed to be changed
because some of us like to decloak and shoot something
grow a pair and fly without cloak
they run away when i show up on scan they also fit warp core stabs im of course referring to the minmatar militia
i am a max skilled legion and tengu pilot but from the dps side the legion cant really keep up with the tengu even when both use 3 dmg mods and 5 launchers for me it seems the legion has a dps problem in general not just with the covert ops subsystem
this is a duplicate thread on the same subject you may further your discussion on this in this threadissue the eve font
omg why isnt this woman in jail and not just banned from an online game its a travesty of justice i tell you
there are several csms for whom this is an area of deep interest meissa and i had a wonderful argument about possible ways to break up the blobs over a dinner at the summit for examplein the shortterm however ccp is currently focused on beating back the lagmonster and getting it locked back in its cage but i think they realize that longerterm gamedesign changes are the only way to prevent fleet sizes from ballooning as i put it in my election manifesto fleets grow to fit the lag availablewhen ccp starts feeling more comfortable with the progress they are making on technical lagfighting i hope they will be amenable to some serious discussions about gamedesign especially sov changes and in particular that they will reconsider a suggestion i made at the summit  that they endorse the creation of a csmrun focus group of experienced nullsec strategists and fcs charged with coming up with some serious gamedesign change proposals
any news on a release date
the current draft of the report of on the august planning meetings was discussed during the sep05 csm meeting you can read the raw logs of the meeting for the details of the discussiona vote on whether to release the report was called it failed 36at present we are working on a revised draft which will be discussed at the next meeting which is this weekend
i find this voting result to be really saddeningit makes me wonder why you go all the way to create such a list ask players for input and cycle it through ccp when the reason for not releasing the result is because it might change before releasethat is always the case and can never be excludedfollowing that reasoning you should never release any information of any kind until it is released by ccp themselvesyou werent afraid to show that ccp was unwilling to commit any resources to your suggestions during the summit but now you are afraid to show what ccp was willing to consider from this list because it might look badwhat has changed
trebor daehdoowthank you for your jobdont you think that ccp is now using this point to discredit your work we all wait from this report if we cant have ccp view its not a problem but we want to know your view even if there is blank line where stated  ccp dont give informationccp is now a fat real life isk company we cant expect them to listen to their customer anymorebut more csm meeting notice i see without meeting minutes less i trust in your workeven if just point please 1 meeting  1 minutesyeay
more likely then ccp getting in the way is other csm members not getting the bigger picture at this point it doesnt matter how much detail or content what matters is that we see progress if yall want to wait for big stuff or deliverables you can wait 18 months this still is ccp they are improving tho but yeah those two interviews from mr ward and mr carriers really bleeds that at that level they just dont get the troubles i still cant see ccp getting in the way tho but yeah if some csm vote against because they want to see stuff complete they are delusional this is step by step and you cant leave gapsmaybe some csm members are just wanting to put the pieces in order for their campaigning that will probably start to begin again at the end of the fall that is more likely combined with at least a few of them being caught in awareness of omg but this isnt fun there is no drama just put it on a blog or something do like hilmar does sidestep chokepoints you know he wants you to
first of all when i said we are working in my previous post i should have made it more clear that we  the csm several of the delegates who voted against the release of the current draft are contributing to a revisionso while i totally understand the concerns being expressed here i would counsel patience until after our meeting this sunday i am hopeful that this will all be resolved by theni recognize that sometimes the pace of events is frustratingly slow but this is in part a consequence of the fact that csm is an evolving institution and in particular now that we have stakeholder status because of the hard work of csm 14 there are process issues we are having to work through  which is a good thing if you think about it in a longterm perspectivewith respect to the minutes doing edited minutes for these biweekly meetings was a fairly big undertaking i did the first pass on several of them and its multiple hours of work given that relatively few people read the edited minutes and instead prefer to just browse the raw logs teadaze decided that it wasnt worth the effort and tbh i agree with him i for one would rather spend the time researching ah proposal threads and massaging them into shape for discussion at a future meetingif there is a particular thing in the raw minutes that you need clarification on i am sure that i or another csm will be happy to oblige
thank youpersonally a meeting minutes like this would be good for me point topic summary decision summary csm next action  date ccp next action  datethe points i feel the ones im interested are the harder ones  ccp official answer on the backlog priority and a planning of bug resolution is ccp confirming after your prioritisation exercice that they dont resolve any bug or focus on quality prior 18 month  means the forum voice is not judged relevantyeay

dear csmi would like to propose you this onetyrannis and dominion togetherthank youyeay
no need to be so hard on them they are after all going through the same transformation of character that anyone else in such a situation will face turning in to real politicians

if you trust the group enough to want to apply then you should be able to meet a ceo or director in space and have an option apply  be accepted in space right by themand it isnt always about it being a personal asset or corp asset sometimes we personally pay for the equipment we want and if i pay the fuel  materials  time of usage  i have the char to build it  i buy and anchor the structure to build it then it is mine and not the corps i may lend it to the corp but it is still mine
those saying store it at a pos clearly do not understand the situation if one could store his super cap at a pos then he is probably in the corp he wants to be inwhat if someone was in an npc corp kicked and petitioned by kicker what would you have him do thenobviously there are workarounds to these issues but none of them are very appropriate i see no nontechnical reason a super cap pilot or anyone for that matter should have to be docked to join a corporation
you should be able to join any corp if you are within 2500m of a station same as jump range and just about every other environment controlled transfer
due to the above issue you cant join that corp yourself and when leaving ships at towers that belong to alt corps of ours using the password ive had those ships ejected the next time i enter space since they still belong to me and i didnt have time to enter the pw before the pos reacted
yes
one final time around for posterity then i think ill let this die weve made our point
after reading only the op i must say i really like this idea as long as the ship costs is significant somewhere between t2 bs and tier 3 bs more juicy targets

war decs as they are are unfair some industrials like myself dont want to be wardecced though it is okay to be wardecced 5 million isk is an hours work for me so in theory i could war dec someone for a week in less than a day the price should be something that youre corporation cant maintain so the war doesnt keep going forevercompletely supported
then hire mercs or pay the griefers to cancel the war a lot of newer merc corps who are trying to build a reputation will even do it for free if you pay the dec fee
an hour an hour youre doing it wrong if it takes an hour to make 5 million isk war decs could be priced based on the difference in average character age people should be able to toss war decs at corps with older characters or characters as old as their own easily im okay with making it significantly harder for old characters to grief noob corpscomplaints might be raised about people stuffing their corp with noob alts to bring down their average character age sure it may decrease the war dec price a bit but it would take a lot of noob alts to drive down the average age in a corp with a single 3 yo character to make it comparable to a corp with a handful of characters a few months old
you mean the at least 2 scanning alts always present in a inhabitated wh systemthose you use only to scan your way in and out and btw that percentage is based on activity not number of logged and unlogged people present in systemso it is 8 of all logged accounts
excellent question and it would be perfectly valid if the ships they were supposed to hold down were as rare as was originally intendedunfortunately that solution became obsolete when supercapital drops grew to contain 10 supercarriers plus an assortment of smaller ships usually carriers since ccp knowingly let super capital proliferation get out of hand i think it only prudent that they take steps to insure that the rest of eve are not made to pay for their ineptitude
drop your own capital fleet on them problem fixed
you know how you fix that let the alliances join fw there are a few alliances that are faction specific and had been formed eons ago with anticipation of fw they are usually the ones doing those cap drops if they are in the militia each militia will have a relatively healthy cap fleet and you will see that drop off or end in even cap battles it wont be on the scale of 00 by any means still baffled why ccp hasnt allowed this as it seems to be the easiest fix to the problem
i was unaware that ch it a hydra et al the usual suspects when it comes to lowsec drops were created to participate in fw the purpose of this exercise is to have less capitals in lowsec not more so i dont really see how allowing alliances into fw would further that goalbut sure let them join just leave all sovereignty at the door on the way in
 but i thought you lowsecers keep complaining about a lack of people coming into lowseccant eat your cake and have it too ya know
having super caps in low sec is more a deterrent to the newer players which low sec needs than it is for the older bored alliance players who would be kept out by the super cap ban supported as long as dreads and carriers get to stay in low sec
lowsec alliances cannot produce supercaps therefor they shouldnt be allowed in lowsec it makes perfect senseyes im sure people always complain about a lack of nyx traffic in their system i mean who doesnt love to see a half dozen carriers with a supporting fleet get driven off by one or two bored nullbears
super caps need to be allowed to jump in to and exist in low sec space for the purpose of traveling to an another area so i dont support banning them completely however supercarriers should loose the ability to deploy bombers just like titans cant use ddslow sec should be the middle ground between the no capitals low stake pvp in high sec and the high stake super capital warfare in 00
i am just looking for a simple change a little checkbox in the survey scanner window to use overview settingswhen mining with crystals  you only care about certain types of ore  not all of them would be a nice to have option if this is a very simple change for ccp to implement for us minerscheers
supportedidea worth considering would also be to directly integrate the survey scan into the overview eg as a new column labeled yield or we
sounds good
sounds sound
agreed  not least due to the fact that for several classes of t2 ship there are no bpos most notably jump freighters also if you want to build one of those at a pos youre currently forced to build the t1 freighter there as well because theres no other way to get a packaged freighter into a pos array
supporting the op but this also sounds like a reason to finally add in repackaging at pos hangars

a shy proposal on how to get logistic ships more in line with other ships and game mechanicatleast i is a bit sad over that me as a logistic pilot dont get the glory to brag over how many kills i have made my role in a battle might have been what tipped the win in our favor1 a logistic pilot do never get any kind of aggression timer he can in high low and 00 sec space always dockjump after he have repped anyone around him2 a logistic pilot in high sec that rep someone that is at war with another corp will be flagged to that specific corp and therefor be a target for the hostiles in that specific war3 a logistic pilot can rep and take part in a big fight but do not get the credit of being logged about hes actions therefor not shown on a killmail my proposal is to make logistic pilot 1 get aggression when repping a aggressor ff guardian pilot put reps on geddon pilot that is shooting a raven pilot the guardian pilot will be logged as aiding a aggressor he will get the aggression timer and need stop repping to be able to dock or jump2 when a logistic pilot is logged as aiding a aggressor and therefor get a aggression timer he will be shown on the killmail as support to aggressorexampel pilot a get tackled in a belt by pilot b a fight starts pilot a screams for help pilot c undocks in a logistic ship and warp to the belt and starts repping pilot a they manage to kill pilot b and on the killmail shows that pilot a have shot pilot b with xxx ship xxx weapon etc and also it shows that he had the support of pilot c in a logistic shipthis is to aply in all kinds of spacehigh sec  a logistic pilot will get aggression timer if he put reps on someone but he wont get concorded but he will be flagged if the person is at warlow sec  logistic pilot will get the aggression timer that prevent him from dockjump but he wont get shot by sentrys and be public flagged but he will be flagged to everyone if he reps and outlaw if he reps someone that already got a aggression timer to someone he will be flagged to that corpalliance like in high sec with war deccs00 space  same rules as in low sec but there are no sentrys or outlaws so just plain aggression timer that prevent you from dock and jumpthis is a rather old topic to speak about so i bet some similar ideas are out there i dident even look at page 1 if there was a thread about it already 
if he gets an aggression counter he should get sentry aggro no special caseand you really shouldnt be that lazy from page two linkage
im lazy and that wont changeimo i should be able to rep my gang members my allies without getting sentry firelogistic pilots should not need to flag in low sec just becouse we rep
good idea

never before in the field of human conflict have so many nubsso completelly missed the pointweapon grouping was introduced to reduce lagso we need everything groupable for maximum lag reductionturrets and launchers were just meant to be the first items tackled iircbut like every other feature of eve  it is forgotten about after the first releasegrouping is optionalso if you posted blah blah blah i want to be able to rep different targets yes you missed the point
every mod should be groupable with similar mods

throw a bone to those poor suffering souls in their gallente ships this benefits almost everyone anyway
the reason it takes over 45 years to learn every skill is so that no single pilot can use everything what your suggesting is wrong on so many levels and could seriously help to endanger specialization i suggest you find contentment with the fact that your character advances even while you are not playing
big no
signedon one hand traders and pirates would reap the direct benefits the indirect losses however would be dispersed among the mission runners and the miners it would either force them to go to good markets for their intended merchandise either lowpriced ammo or highpriced ores or buysell them in safety near their farming location i approvehowever i also feel that multiple currencies while an interesting change would be overkill and annoying
noob flys carrier and fail fits it noob gets taken down by interceptori sayed i was thinking of getting a carrier i do not own one and have never used a ship with jump drives so no loss to report  whine about read the post noob emoragewhines on forums to give all capitals epic buff that ruins combat mechanics to epic levelsi was trying to present it in a way that would not ruin the combat mechanics if you bleave it does then explane why dont just rant about it pro tip ever hear of smart bombs fighters drones support fleet derp derpbplease for the love of all things good take the time to talk to actual cap pilots who know what the  they are doing before you come here bloody helli have taken the time to talk to other pilots and some think it is a good idea and the idea is not about killing the people that warp scram you it is the act of warp scraming that disables jumping that im talking about
so your making ideas up on the spot on something you dont own or flysmartnot
no this has been descused before
your missing the pointyou do not know how to fly this ship nor do you understand it yet you claim to speak on such matters with some sort of authority or experiencenot a good ideaeven if your repeating it from someone else this is your original ideapost you didnt point at anyone else until nowi rest my case
as far as cannon goes both warp drives and jump drives are the same thing and operate on pretty much the same principle they create miniwormholes and tunnel through spacetime the latter is simply bigger and uses different graphicsmethods of presentation ie jumping is simply a long range warp that bypasses stargatesthrow even a small a monkey wrench into either a big machine or a small one and youll get pretty much the same resultnot supportededit just remembered that supercaps are immune to normal warp disruption you need a hic to pin them down i assume that is the a gameplay mechanic so you can rationalize it any way you want it
originally i was spending about 56 hours a meeting editing the minutes though with later meetings of csm4 the number of issues under discussion dropped and so there was less to edit officially only the raw logs are required to be published but i aimed to provide a meeting summary as well as tldr type results due to changes at work ive had far less free time to spend on csm and what time i have has been taken up with the increase in communication with ccp since the summit robert has helped prepare some of the minutes but he is currently busy editing our csm dev blog which is taking shape nicely thanks to the time he has put inbut enough of my excuses because the raw logs alone are not a very quick overview of the meetings i provide voting results on the csm database as a replacement to the old tldr minutes i plan to backfill the missing summary minutes in december when ill be unemployed and thus have lots of time to spend on this stuff but for now the priority is voting summary and raw logs for context
inappropriate posts removed constructive comments will be appreciated
if you dont fight back you get a month of killrights the only problem is that people recycle the ganking alts even if in theory it is an exploit and you rarely get to get your revengethe few that dont recycle alts generally gank for 12 days and then go to 00 for a week to recover their standing in high sec you rarely get them in something kill worthy
and the characters that arent recycled usually spend most of their days in 00 or low sec anyway
issues must have been in the assembly hall forum for at least 7 days prior to a csm meeting for them to be added to the agenda however if you can get enough supports it could be considered for a future meeting
please do not say that there actually are csm members who resist such things or are constrained by silly motivations like politics or exposure management or god forbid some of you are stuck in crap like omg but what if people take it as promiseswhy is that even a vote things like that are key elements of this csm concept come on
 mynxee  csm blogscsm will we get a chance to look at the balance list before csm goes to ccp with it

i have started a discussion thread to collate lowhanging fruit pos fix ideas it is pretty clear at this point that a big redesign like the dead horse isnt in the cards in the short or medium term so i am wondering if there are some simpler things that can be proposed that will ease the paini look forward to everyones input
reasonable pointssomething else just occurred to me what if the display was limited to the currently selected ship plus all the ships you have locked both in space and with the additional info in a halo around a smaller ship badge in the list of locked shipsthere has to be a way to limit the amount of information to prevent clutter and in the heat of battle doing a lot of display selection isnt going to be optimal anywaylets work on clarifying various approaches over the next two weeks so that i can raise it in the csm meeting at the end of the month
to avoid clutter instead of graphics and icons use a simple segment i dont want to see where the locked ships go  in a frig once i lock them everything is decided anyway i want to understand at a glance what the whole enemy blob is doing speed vectors are perfect why do you not like the idea is it too simple the simple ideas are the best onesmoreover it blends well into the currently existing tactical overlay and is a lot less onerous a work for the devs
the display selection bit is done before battle exactly like you twiddle with your overview settings you probably dont want to see this for your fleet for neutrals if youre in highsec and pods you want to see it for warfw targets and neutrals in lowsec and highsec woot o
man look at this commitment to excellence
i honestly dont remember if this has been raised yet by a csm but i raised this anyways for the next meeting and if its a duplicate i can just cancel it
could you change potential solution increasing range for blasters brake its tactical distinction please add second potential solution increasing dps and trackingpulse lasers  good dps at insane rangeac  good dps using adjustable damage type at medium range good trackingblasters  should have extreme dps with extreme tracking at very close range leave range as isincreasing range for blasters is creating second pulse blaserps as for now blasters does not have extreme dps lasers do 85 blaster damage at 300 range and extreme tracking ac have almost the same

best if they bring pictures and videos too just to make sure the devs fully grasp the conceptin fact csm should just bring real life undercover futas lots of alchohol and once the devs are intoxicated enough send them into private rooms together

i dont know who we are talking aboutbut
im sorry but it is hard to take you seriously and others like you with a name like that especially on the issue of maturity
because letting you drag parts of the game to a different screen would be all that hard just have an option that extends the game window over both screens one is the space view and the other is empty and can hold what ever sub screen you want yes it would take a little work but not all that much
while i support what you want and multiscreen features are and have always been part of my csm agenda i believe anti is also right in saying that theres no reason why we cant bring this up again and again and againplease visit your user settings to reenable imagescome to daddyif i ever meet apple she gunna kill metamber
because allot of people have dual screens and those that dont might go out of there way to pick up another screen to take advantage of eve adding this functionality ccp will have some kind of reporting software built into eve which will tell them what hardware and settings people are using so the medium shaders decision was probably researched and justified not sure if they can do the same with dual screens but that information can be found out from the steam hardware reports which is used extensivly by allot of developerspublshers to follow trendsbesides dual screens in eve would be fricken awesome and the single best addition to eve in a long while better than walking in stations anyway
ok ok if it makes you happy ill votefake edit i saw a vid from 2009 fan fest showing that ccp is working on multimonitor support
edited 09252010 to include playercontributed suggestionsit has been a long standing wish of many eve players that the design of player owned stations be revisited however it should be clear to everyone who is not actually a dead horse that this is unlikely to happen sooni would therefore like to kick off a discussion with the goal of identifying small hopefully easy to implement tweaks to pos mechanics aka low hanging fruit that will at least ease the pain this should include not only new items but also gather in existing csm proposalsmy current cunning plan is to finalize the list in the first half of october then crowdsource priorities in time to propose to the csm at the endofoctober meetingcurrent list of suggestions relax range restrictions inside pos shields if youre in the pos you can interact with all the pos modules move stuff between them etc if possible this would include onlining and offlining pos fuel warning evemails should tell you how many hours of each fuel component you are running out of fuel pellets  perhaps as a new output of pi but requiring some components that cannot be produced on planets remote refuel  grabs stuff from corp hangars limit to regional range or system in whspace all pos modules should be nameable or at least a damn code number on them so we can tell corp hangars apart manufacturing modules should be able to accept inputs from and deliver outputs to other modules even something as simple as if there are insufficient materials in my hangar grab them from this module would permit simpler pipelines and easier remote management or more simply some sort of remotemovebetweenmodules interface anchoringunanchoring queue fix ship hangar bug that sometimes leaves original ship in space view blueprints that are in structures in space via corp assets and science  industry interfaces review and revamp pos permissions please jump bridge tolls reduced time for anchoring onlining and offlining update reaction linking interface to be more pilike repackaging in corp and ship hangars personal divisions in corp and ship hangars corp divisions in ship hangars access controls at towergranularity access and use controls based on standings improved anchoring ui courier contracts to and from pos locations menu and ui improvements to make dangerous actions harder to do by accident aka ooops i offlined it again improved reactions ui show timers what silo stores etc show pos cycle timer list of ammo in all guns make refining arrays and t2 ship arrays useful dont show items in fuel screen that the pos doesnt use allow csmas to be anchored without sov or at least in wh space note that csma  csaa cache passwords on client allow multiple players to anchor and online at a pos at the same time aka wham bam thankyou gang
supported couple of nice ideaswhat might also come very in handy would be an anchoringonlining queue andor onlininganchoring modules without sitting within 2500m of themalso purely aesthetic though id suggest more variability with module anchoring spots and orientations currently its rather difficult to build an even remotely pretty pos as all modules are pointed in a different direction and the distances between the mods need to be rather big to avoid clipping even if thered actually be none in the current spot so a more advanced collision control would be nice
great ideas to streamline pos managementsupported
yeah anchoringunanchoring queue is a must we lost way too much time waiting for the previous thing to be ready to be ready to activate the next oneallowing things to be done at more than 2500m would also be very welcomedunno what would be fair be having to move an orca 500m because he got bumped while wanting to fuel the pos and putting items on the corp hangar is a painat least give us 5000metersalso theres still the strange bug with the ship hangar  you can take a ship at 3000m but if youre more than 2500m and sometimes you even need to be 2000 your current ships wont be storeda 5000m range here would be a good thing were on the bubble anyway so no risk from outside its just to save time and painfor the name something allowing us to see what modules it is when were clicking on the manage tab would be welcomeit can be useful for example when onlining things as if you have more than 1 of the same module you dont really know which one it issame for pos guns without name we dunno which one is it and even to make a name we need to know xdgive us an effect on the target our mouse is on some more infos like for example distance of the module may be usefulalso i may simply dont anchor things at the good place but the bumping  stuck problems when our ship is near some modules is a real paini suppose im not the only one having my ships stucked on a module while launching warp as im on wspace i may need to warp in any direction as the new sign can be anywhere so i cant think about that while anchoring modules because the random position of sign will make any position a potential target for the warpbtw talking with pos and wh think about a word for refitting of tech3 ships 
automating parts of posbased industry is a good idea in principle  i think its reasonable that people should have access to the same sort of flow control as they already do for moon mining this reduces the amount of work people have to do but increases their risk exposure because they have more stuff floating in space at once however when there are so many possible configurations theres the potential for all sorts of interesting bugs to spring up eg the one that resulted in vast quantities of advanced materials being produced out of nowheredont we already have renameable structures last time i checked its possible to name labs but are other structures not so flexibleadditional request let people view blueprints that are in structures in space via the corp assets  si window so that jobs can be started remotely otherwise all the other remote management features become much less useful for people who dont have access to blueprints in an outpost  station in the same system
i would not support the remote refuelingi want some poss to run out of fuel when im in a whthe fact that someone can auto refuel them from a far i would not like
i think we need total pos reweiv including modules rules etcsee pos dead horse treadas for changes supported
i agree make it regional you can interact with the pos if you are in the same region the pos is
well it would be a tech 2 ship so id make it more expensive than a hulk probably another 2550 of the price of a hulk naturally this means there would be a much weaker t1 variant as well that would have to be made
would rather see a t3 ship that can fulfill multiple industrial roles if current proposals arent good improve them i dont think we need any more static subcapital ships t3 ftw
yes

eve is a game not work if you see yourself spending a large amount of your playtime workinggrinding then youre playing the wrong game change your playstyle so that youre not doing something that feels like work so dont mine anymore and dont mission unless you actually enjoy missioning itself
its unavoidable you need some kind of income to keep pvping in anything better than t1 ships with crap fits
grinding is the main focus of his game not a means to allow him to be able to afford to pvpalso if you hunt juicy targets extort carebears etc then pvp is profitable its just that some l33t pvpers look for goodfights instead of piracy
bumpop updated please bugreport it whenever this issue occurs to get it to ccps attention
before i state the desired changes lets look at the issues with the oneiros compaired to its only competitor for armor logis the gaurdian351 lower base armor1 less low slot2 less high slots3 more mid slotsa bonus in tracking enhancers that has no relevance to logistical effects at all143 higher base signatureabout equal base capacitorhigher base speed by 5 ms20 lower scan resolutionthe most noticeable problems are the lack of tank slots for what the ship is designed to tank its an armor logistic thats got a higher base shield than armor and a higer count on mids than lows it also suffers from a much larger sig in addition to its other defensive weaknessadditionally the guardian gets 2 bonuses that directly affect the role of the ship armor and capacitor the oneiros relies heavily on wasting its extra mids just to support its capacitor requirements again a waste of its bonus to tracing enhancers since you wont have the slots for themso the proposed changesreduce the mid slot count by 1 increase the low slot count by 1reduce the sig radius by 5change the tracking links bonus to a 5 per level effective boost to remote repair amount add 5 base speedby limiting the changes to those proposed the guardian still has a much larger base armor lower sig same low slot count higher capacitor potentialoneiros gets a choice with the additional low of more tank or more capacitor repairpotentially the oneiros gains effectively 1 repairer worth of remote assistance with max skills while not costing it any more capacitor in regular combatfitting situations this makes it a better repair shipthe additional 5 base speed gives it a better possibly of speed tank while continuing to have the higher base sig and lower base armor
i support this change
support of courseif you think making those changes makes it at all the same ship as a guardian then youre fing nuts learn about ship and fleet mechanics and fly the different ships before making silly statements if youre going to be so negative against ccps use of this forum then quit ing up my thread as much as i have issues with ah at least i put in the effort to help ccp help the game even if not all ideas are liked
i support this change
i support this change
fly a guardian then whats keeping you it should be easier than proposing changes towards the effect of pushing ships of different races together making them the same ship with different names its not as if ccp even bother reading those things
the problem is not trying to make everything the same because its not but it should be on the same level as other logys
yeah right now the onieros sucks the cap transfer bonus on basiguardians is pretty out of controlthis would be finealternately they could rework the ship to be more of a general purpose utility ship amp up tracking link bonus maybe add a projected eccm bonus or something ill think about that more in 18 months meanwhile this would save me from having to crosstrain amarr cruiser 5 so supported
not supportedscimitar and oneiros got their roles
not empty quotingthe only change i would consider supporting is switching the tracking links bonus to another beneficial module to differentiate it a bit from the scimitar
after some of your previous wonderfully misinformed post on things you thought were actual facts why dont you toss up some defined examples of oneiros roles so that we can be sure youre upholding your wonderful intellect
i was going to call him out but you beat me to it nice job op
id rather have a 5 cap recharge bonus so you dont have to fill all the mids with cap rechargesbut im happy with it as long it makes it better
on the other hand try dualboxing a kronosmega with an oneiros running two or three tracking links and enjoy the insane tracking of your big gunsthe oneiros does seem to have a fairly gimped amount of armorgrid and of course the lack of a cap transfer bonus does make it less viable than a basilisk or a guardian but those tracking bonuses can be very handy if used correctly ideally id just like to see the oneiros get more survivable and a little less tight on the fittings for its intended purpose
and that is why i do not own oneit needs to be fixed
gtfoshield tanking armor logistics is fine okay for me if you do all the other stuff but stay away from its mid slots
the oneiros can be unscannable unlike the guardian it still doesnt mean that its not the worst logisticthe scimitar works because the scimitar is fast and small the basiliskguardian can have a buffer tank with circle energy transfersif the oneiros had less mass and were more agile it might gain more acceptance in hac gangs
thisjust because a ships perks doesnt fit your needs and youre among the majority doesnt mean it needs to be changed into a copy of another ship that does fit your needs if the guardian fits your needs then fly it how are you entitled to mess up the onieros for the people that do take advantage of its perks just so you can get a guardian with a different name and save a few days of training
supportedits bloody annoying to get kicked out of a fleet if they have asked for armor logis because your in an oneiros
if they kick any logi at all then the fc needs his head examined its an ominous sign you wouldnt want to be in that fleet anyway
thison topici fly an oneiros i must say that its not the best logi tracking links are never fitted or shouldnt be  and its a pain to get fair cap stability with mwd  3 large reps  1 med good luck fitting 4 large reps and have them running for more than 2 cycles unlike the guardianneeds to be buffed and get rid of the useless tracking links
as already pointed out carebears use tracking links as well as unscannable fit and shield tanking armor rep ship so theyre not never fitted just rarely a minority of people depend on oneiros being what it is its not fair that they get screwed just because the majority want it to be more like a guardian if you want guardian then fly a guardian if you change oneiros into a guardian youll have 2 guardians and those who want oneiros will have nothing
all logistics are unprobable depending on fit this in no way changes the oneiros into a guardian it just refocuses its effort on what its used for 99 of the time anywayoneiros still sufferes against neuts still has a higher sig a lower armor no cap xfer and a totally different use for its slots you can still get insane tracking buffs even wo the boosted tracking link effects from normal tracking links yes a lot of fcs turn down oneiros in fleets because they are a weak link any competent enemy will immediately take them down just like we experienced tonight lost our oneiros immediately guardians survived just because you dont like the facts doesnt mean the ship doesnt needs the change you want tracking links in your own words train for the scimitar fix the oneiros
why do we want to relax the term limits sure its good for the csm members its good for giving them time to push the game in a direction thats beneficial to their own particular interests and playstyles but is it good for evethere are what 300000 accounts now im not sure how many individual players that is but its a lot why do we need the same 7 or 8 people over and over why would we want itthe big alliances already have the obvious advantage at election time and thus on pushing game changes that favor pushing more people into 00i say 2 terms period and youre done thats my suggestion 2 terms in office is plenty for anyone ohi know mm was upset when vuk couldnt run they had to find someone else to run because they had to have a member on the csm which underlines my point exactlyrelaxed term limits are in the best interests of a few im certainly not one of them 2 terms
maybe that sounded a bit too harsh but point being that having a strict rule of 2 term limits is a very good idea imo unless the playerbase is happy with two or three select people having longterm influence because theyre in positions of power in some of the largest alliances in the gamethat could pretty much become a legal public version of the type of influence bob was accused of in the past true or not that got everyone in such an uproardiversity is healthier besides itd be nice to see things get mixed up a bit
i was never in favor of unlimited termssupportedps at best should be at most 4 but no more than that
not supportedfor one reason the time it takes for ccp to get their act together and the hazzle of new people to understand the process it takes more than 2 terms for issues to be resolved which means too many frequent changes disrupt workflow
not supportedi dont see how limiting them to two terms will have any positive impact on csm representation if theyre doing a good job representing the eve players or at least a sub section of them theyll get voted in again if not someone new can replace them let the player base decideas for the alliance comment limiting players to two terms will have no impact on the influence of big alliances theyre big they can put someone else up to vote for and represent their interests
not supported we have term limits already theyre called elections everyone is going to get a political powerbase from somewhere those big alliances you fear will simply field someone else if their motives are so cynical by proxy if need be alliances and players come and go
fixed your post
fit a target painter or use dronesno kill mail with no agreshion timerthink of hiseck
actually thats more than correct i dont see the problem with aggression it would bring logistics more in line with the rest of the game if you rep someone you get on the same aggression counter as he is therefore you can jump gate after 60 seconds of the last guy you repped ceased firing fleets with bad discipline would suffer but i can live with that it is still more than worthwhile to encourage more people to fly logistics and to add some reconition to the important lifesavers that are logistics to adress some comments my guardian will never have a gun nor a target painter it has reps energy transfers and eccmafterburner drones will not get me on most killmails because the bigger fleets in my alliance simply kill primaries off before the drones even reach it most capital killmails are doomed to fail due to smartbombs not to forget that i dont have the time to lock up friendlies and enemy primariessecondaries at the same time in a big fleet battle so target painter wouldnt work anyway except for one random targetserverload long shipnames probably create more serverload than a truefalse state of a logistic as a supporter then again we are here to tell ccp what we would find cool they will think about the technical side of it and decide whether or not it is doableirrelevancy of killmails actually they are at least a bit important because if you want to get into pvp corporations people usually check your killboard it would be really nice to actually have prove to be a dedicated logistic pilot except the fact that you probably have mostly logistic losses the people who care about killboard stats get satisfied and the people who dont care still dont killboards will never cease to exist thats probably for sure
i would also support it if they got aggression for it this would also help solve neutral repping two birds one stone
how about adding warp to and dock to the right click menu for research agents in the journal
why stop with only research agents this should be done with all agents whether in the journal or in people and placesotherwise supported
raising this for the next csm meeting now if bunyip links his document later on ill see if there are points in there i can include with the discussionsi read all the points and included the ones which are the most common complaints that i hear the vast majority of these statements in this thread i agree with wholeheartedly i rewrote them to emphasize the complaint aspect and not request specific new features
one of my complaints is that ccp seems to have either forgotten this thread or chosen to disregard it there is a lot of constructive feedback and suggestions yet the last post by a ccp devemployee was regarding the deployment of dominion 103 see post 185 by ccp incognito on jan 7 2010 page 7while complaints regarding fighting for sovereignty come up often especially points 2 and 3 in your op i would also like to bring up the upgrades mechanics  they should allow more people to live off the same fully upgraded solar system while ccps original hundreds estimate is too much of an utopia the current amount is little on the low sideedited for support
why is sov needed to be something that is based on system to systemwhy can constellations and regions play a bigger roleeverything fails with sov just because the numbers that fight over them at one place is to much it should be pointless to bring 300 vs 300 dont allow that since the server cant rly handle it at this moment there are no real individual skills in taking part of those fights sure a fc can do a great job and take the right decisions but pilots need to have a bigger say in performance how the battle is to progressso fight over a constellation and several sites at the same timewell that wont work since some alliances can field 300 ppl and will still blob the whole area instead of one system tho it will spread things out and create a different type of battle attack a constellation and you need to have active presence in every system or key systems for a period of time this means that defenders can concentrate on disturbing thatwell wont that be unfair if xx alliance spread out 300 ppl in one const and the defenders can go to only one place with 300 and wipe out a small fleet probably yes but how about forcing the defenders to split up to gain the control of the constellation againa constellation that is taken give out xx bonuses have xx stations and when it gets attacked all of those disappears while being in siege the owners dont get any mining ratting bla bla bonuses from owning the constellation the owners stationsoutposts loses the fuel to run bonus and maybe even some station services depending on how the sieges state so to get those back the defenders need to clear the majority of the constellation of hostiles no afk cloakers cant be used to siege a constellation lolnot rly into detail just an lose ide i had since i dont like the system fightssomething in this way would allow a smaller force to be able to mess with hostiles homes more and force a response with a actual plan behind and not just blob them and go back to ratting big alliance will still fight each other and bring large numbers but now split out and forced to have fleets that can work on several locations this will be very hard for ppl to adapt to
there should be restrictions an outright ban is ludicrous but the full capability of the supercarrier should not be available in low security
neat idea
forgot to vote for myself
im bringing this up in the next csm meeting 
4 features to add to assembly halla check box to show disapproval of a op so that replys are no longer the only link to an ops merit how many hot topic issues are really 5 people constantly replying driving up the count making it appear like an unsuccessful post with an actual count of approval of a large a pop up box before a 1st reply goes through that ask whether you support or do not support the idea forcing repliers to make clear their stance lots of people type support but fail to click the box and it gets incredibly annoyingsticky post at a csm members request to help reduce hot topic issue reposting and to show which post have been recognized easily by the csma  tracker to see what  of replys to a topic supportfail to support the topic based on the  of different posters within the thread
sure
unsupporting this topic
suppoerted
yes please
good idea
sure why not
supoprted but what happens to their spdoes it keep accumulating while they are banned assuming they have a long skill in or does their queue stopassuming it doesnt stop what happens if they have a 2 day skill in and are banned for a week  should they get the 5 days of sp reimbursedi recently had a case where i clone jumped restarted the queue and when the skill that was currently training finished the next one in the queue failed to start only was to unjam the queue apply was not working was to remove the skill from the queue put another one in and then put original one back ini lost 18 hours of training time luckily i provided enough info to get a gm to pump up a skill i wanted to l3 which corresponded the the 8 or so hours they were prepared to reimburseand yes it is a cool story
supported on top of that dont pause skill queues for people who are under investigation for being banned spend 5 minutes to reprogram eve gate so that those people can log in to change skills but not do anything else with eve gate
supported because it should have been in place since day one
fypsupported once again cant believe they dont already do this
yeh
sounds reasonable
i support pant wearingmazzilliu we should have an ingame weddingyou can wear the pants
agree
never had this issue but still1
yeskill mails for doing damage to self destructers would be good to
thisalso you guys make it sound like you are trying to go out and hunt sc and titans apparently no one in the game ever attacks you with it when they dun suspect you can hold them or something jowan from co2 would be a good example he picked the 15 minute ill just disappear and laugh timer over the 2 minute ill lose my ship timermy math is prolly way off but corpmates say that after resists scs and titans can sit at around 40 million health 40m12k per nyx  3333 seconds3333119 seconds  28008so if im right on that it takes 28008 nyxes to dish 40 million damage in 2min  1 second self destruct only requires 4 nyxes to beat 37 to be exacti watched pl dump five or so supercarriers ontop of six dreads and they could only kill five of them before the 2 minutes ran out so for those of you saying bring more firepower i think you need to reconsider what you are up against
sounds good what hows about if you self destruct while someone is shooting you the timer is still 2 minutes but the highest damager gets the kill mail and the mail lists that he was killed by self destructing
agreed remove killmails and ill support this
 the op how many towers do you currently fuel im guessing 01 there are a lot of problems with this game but a lack of chores to do isnt one of themthis is a terrible idea not to mention an almost totally incoherent post
sorryi dont understand your pointsnot talking about pos but about tcu and hubcan you please develop yeay
fueling poses is a drag fueling sov structures would be another one so no thanks
this is a bad idea  the whole point of simply paying for sov upkeep instead of fueling poses the old system was because everyone hates having to fuel all those structures
for my point of view paying sov upkeep to a system force concord not present in region is irrelevantno fuel is not a problem for me it can be a good roleplay way toobut paying for sov in 00 to an not present authority is not
here is a weird i admit proposal but i think it really could be usefull  a will servicesometime for security reason sometime one person in a corpo  alliance hold some important stuff for the whole alliance  corpo hes in filling fee managing rights managing wallet assets etc etc if this person some real life trouble  jail big time in hospital or even worst the alliance  corpo he was in is ed i know that 100 billions is nothing of importance if you run over somebody with your car and got 2 years of jail butthen a will service would be that you could ask this service to give some account infos andor transfer money assets or whatever action if your account subscription stop for x full month or such trigger
its not a bad ideai think that people wouldnt particularly trust the will stuff imagine i simply dont have enough money to renew my account i log back in after getting enough money to renew the account and wtf all my stuff is gone the only thing i think that should include in the wills should be corporate sharesive been in a situation where the ceo and majority shareholder of a corp had more shares than anyone else and so it was very difficult to pay out dividends and the corp basically folded because he got perma bannedin this situation i dont think the shares should be removed but they should be nullified from dividend payouts etcprobably will never happen though if people can just transfer everyhing to an alt if they forget to renew their su then they might not reactivate quite so quickly and ccp would lose a bit of money
supported as long as killmails also show when the repairing started and how much caparmorshieldsetc were repaired since i know that people will sit in rr ships just to  kms in high sec which is lulzy but i still dont want killmails to be ruined also make kms show when eccm tracking links etc were initiated
ruin kms kms ruined pvp due to its existence abolish kms and all those epeen related whines will go away
you are making a good point and i think that will never happend since it will be to much data needed to be coordinated in a big fight that will just not work in eve at this moment i believe and you are right that there is a problem with whoring on kmUFFFDs by sitting in a guardian and just put reps on ppl randomly to get on killmails in high sec tho remember that you still do get aggro timer and can not dockundock and you get flagged to the hostiles high sec  war low sec  aggressors or outlawshow rep amount on km and when it started cool but as said above to much to ask for imo start with getting logistic pilots on the mails and give them aggro timer like everyone els dont allow logistic pilots to jump out or dock when they like and dont make them invisiblei do support thisi would like to get rid of killmails all togetheror atleast make them into something less personal like corp km and alliance kmpilot km is just meh and ruins allotbut for the game i think something is needed like have logs of what happend at xx place at xx time so a killmail where it stats that 4 geddons from xx corp attacked a myrmidon and harbinger from xx corp in xx system etcthat would still give the generall credit to the corp or alliance you can brag about how cool you are but it wont be on a pilot vs pilot lvl rather a corpally vs each others
yes please
goes to show what a joke this forum and by extension the csm has become
make advanced assembly arrays useful
well we do require tons of threads about every little thing and lots about nothing
dont be so sure the logical time to do this would be before incarna is expanded to poses which we know is planned prob on the release after incarna
so in 18 months you know me the perfect is the enemy of the good and if ccps response to this proposal assuming it gets raised is we dont want to because were going to do the dead horse then i shall be able to ask some pointed questions about timetables
consider yourself flogged dead horse
as a new player who just lost everything they had to a suicide ganker who ganked my frigate in jita im for this i sort of think the game should make some kind of sense in its universe i cant imagine a culture or society would last very long if thieves were allowed to hang around freeway exits and carjack everyone that came by with little or no negative consequences there is no real death in eve as in real life id like to see how many suicide gankers there would be if when concorde popped you your character died forever hah id laugh a lot at that but removing insurance payments for bushwhackers seems obvious and im for itid have no issue with this if i were in lowsec but this is like getting held up in front of a police station with 50 cops standing therethen the guy gets paid for the loss of his ship huh this seems more like an exploit than a valid career i cant see the point of having every place in the game be a danger spot it may be fun for some types but it has completely removed the fun for me and im seriously thinking of quitting after 1 month there are parts of the game i really like but losing everything youve worked for when you are in a place called high sec doesnt make a lot of sense to meterb
a way to fix medium blasters by arnold predatorvery long but has a fix i hope people can agree onin a previous post i worked some numbers that scored weapons based on damage output and range in this post im going to expand on that a little more and include projectile weapons as well as try to find a way to balance all three turret types we each otherhere are the best of the medium sized turrets each is using there highest damage type ammo 425mm autocannon ii3465 x 24  562512009600w 1200 not 2400 due to the 50 optimal you get with phased plasma ammo14784 10800  w 8316525 10800  w14784 10800  1596672tracking of 1056heavy neutron blaster ii 42 x 24  52518005000w 1800 not 3600 due to the 50 optimal you get with antimatter ammo1008525 6800  w1926800 130560 weapon score tracking of 1heavy pulse laser ii36 x 24  525 60004000 again 6000 not 12000 due to the 50 you get from multispectral ammo864  525 1000016410000  164000 weapon scoretracking of 008125dps 192 164 and 14784 blasters have more dps over pulse lasers by 17 and 31 over auto cannons blasters should have much more damage over any other weapon typerange optimal  falloff auto cannons have the best range over all but its not by much the range advantage is only 800m longer then lasers and a whopping 4000m longer then blastersoptimal pulse lasers have a huge advantage on optimal pulse lasers have a 6000m optimal apposed to the 1800m of blasters and the 1200m of auto cannons optimal pulse lasers have a huge advantage on optimal pulse lasers have a 6000m optimal apposed to the 1800m of blasters and the 1200m of auto cannons fall off no surprise here as auto cannons have the best fall with 9600m thats 4600m better then blasters and 5600 better then lasers tracking right now projectiles have the longest range with the best tracking nerf blasters have the lest range but place second in tracking blasters need as much tracking as they can get due to there extremely limited range lasers have almost the same range as projectiles but the worst tracking bump blasters to have better tracking then all there better ranged counterparts to make up for there low range as range goes down tracking should go up not the other way round like projectiles have now tech 2 ammo right now scorch is the king of tech two ammo a medium pulse laser with scorch ammo has a weapons score of 331885 the closest any other turret can get to that score using tech two ammo is the 425mm auto cannon loaded with barrage even with barrage the autocannon is only at 196504 for a score the best blasters can do is 184800 all tech two turret ammo makes you take a hit on tracking but that hit effects lasers the worst and blasters the most scorch gives a 50 bonus to range the longer the range the less you need to track things do to there slower transverse velocity tech two ammo in blasters make not since what so ever as you will never hit anything up close there up close weapons i have some ideas to fix this but i dont want to do the maths so hybrids have the worst score when compared with tech 1 or tech 2 ammo here are a few examples of why blasters need a buff the optimal of lasers is almost longer then the optimal fall off of blasters the 425mm guns have the longest range over all and the best tracking of the entire group there for will almost always hit in pvp all other weapon types would be able to hit a blaster boat for at least 4k before it was in range then once it is finaly in range the blaster boat might not be able to hit anything as its tracking is bad this makes for a ship that cant hit what it shots at even after its flown though being shot at for 89k 
here is my solution to bring medium blasters in line with the other turret types this is just some thoughts i have had on the subject and the maths i have used in order to find out whats needed to fix blasters lets look at the numbers blasters have the worst score of 130560 pulse lasers the best of 164000 a hybrid turret is a mix of laser all power and projectile only bullet weapon a laser weapon is more advanced then a hybrid turret and much more advanced then a projectile one it would make since to me at least that lasers would have the most advantages over the other two so it makes since that it have the highest over all score a projectile weapon should have the lowest score due to its simplistic nature there for a hybrid weapon should be right between both right now it stands that projectiles have a weapons score of 1596672 hybrids have a score of 130560 and lasers are at 164000 i see a problem with that hybrid hole so if my logic is right the new numbers should be more along the lines of 1596672 for projectiles 162000 for hybrids and 164000 for lasers in order to bring hybrids in this case blasters up to the that new number lets work the equations a little bit in order to get a score of 162000 we need to decide what we want to change in order to bring that number up seeing as most of the people on the forums say that the range needs to stay the same and damage just needs to go up so lets us that the damage out put needs to be adjusted so to find the new damage a neutron blaster needs to have to reach our goal we need to take that goal and divide it by the range so 1620006800 23823529411 so lets call it 23825 because everyone likes round numbers now 23825 is the new base dps a neutron blaster does after the buff that 145 more then the 164dps of lasers not the 117 it was before this is more inline with there lack of range and fixes the problem of lasers giving most of the benefit of blasters but with 3 times the optimal  extra range to boot blasters would now be extremely deadly at there extremely close range as they were intended how does that extra dps turn into an easy buff for ccp to implement well there are a few options to pick from either buff the ammo so that it hurts more or buff the guns themselves a buff to ammo would have to include all the ammo types and not just one that would mean changing each ammo type to do more damage this makes more work then needed a better easier way would be to buff the guns themselves change the damage modifier on blasters to give them the extra damage they need and all you have to do is adjust the numbers in there description to find out how much of a change needs to happen lets do some more maths we have the dps we want them to shot for pun not intended of 23825 we know that dps is damage modifier times d by highest ammo damage h then divided by rate of fire r so d x h  r  dpsso that turns into d x 24525  23825 or to rework that to what we need it for 23825 x 525 24  d1250812524d521171875 d or to round that 52114 i worked the numbers and 52114 works best if you round so we now have all the numbers to rerun the weapons score equation 52114x24525 x 18005000  weapons score238246800 wthe new weapons score would be 1620032 not bad for all the rounding i did what needs to happen to fix blasters is the damage modifier gets adjusted from 42 to 52114 and add a little bit to tracking say 25 more to go with the 25ish more damage blasters would now be useful again as they would have the best damage the shortest range and the tracking to for once hit something how hard was that as i type this as my character is cross training for lasers and amarr ships to fit them too untill blasters get fixed i dont have much choice if i want to pvp
i think we need to be careful about giving blasters a massive damage boost although this may work and balance out the disparity between the weapons systems the problem of fights becoming very short due to massive dps is likely to occurthere needs to be a rebalance of effective dps amongst the weapons systems this may mean a slight nerf to the effective dps of both lasers and projectiles along with a slight buff to blaster dps also the fix probably needs to have something more than just damage and tracking how about a rework of the current ammothe current ammo for hybrids offers little choice you either have lots of damage at close range or not much damage at long range all the ammo inbetween offers is slight changes in range and the odd bonus to capacitor usage meaning they have no real value and is the reason why almost everyone just uses antimatter and iron what if like projectiles we give hybrids some variation in ammo i dont mean changing damage types but i mean to give hybrids some real options for ammo types to use for example a damage type that offers a tracking bonus but has a drawback of range reduction and low damage output one type of high damage ammo that does massive shield damage but low armour damage and a one that does the opposite base shieldarmour damage ill set some examples up in another post so that this doesnt become a wall of text

my concern is that blasters would just feel like auto cannons but with even less range if you could switch damage types thats a very big projectile trait to be giving to hybrids fail guns would just be faster firing artillery canons yes the idea is sound that it would re balance hybrids and make them better but to me it sounds like i would be trading my hybrid weapons for projectile ones that now require cap to use no thanks by giving a dps and tracking bump the ranges stay the same as b4 and hybrids can now hit other people the trick that keeps the balance is the range of both lasers and auto cannons yes a blaster boat will have way more damage then the other two types but the other two types will be able to shot said blaster boat way before he can shoot back if your dumb enough to get in close to a blaster boat your dead end of story you also have to take into account that most other ships are faster then gellente ships so not only do they have longer firing range but they can also keep there target at that range better look at the numbers for scorch ammo they get a 50 range bonus a blaster boat would get hit from way way beyond he range and would have to burn though the incoming fire just to get to range i think that once he gets there he should get to face for all the work he did just to get there dont youlets say i have to micro at 1000ms for 15k to a target to get him in my range optimalfalloff if the other guy is shooting me for 500 dps during that 15 seconds that means i get hit for 7500 dps before i get in range and can even start to fight back thats 7500 dps advantage over when i start shooting back thats huge thats also assuming the other guy is at a stand still if he is flying away from me even a little bit the dps advantage just gets bigger if he is faster then me i can never get him unless i get help to slow him down fixed my math by giving blasters such a huge boost in dmg and tracking they become great in a fleet they are the guys that keep frigs at bay when there not being used as the big in your face damage dealer of the gang once they get tackle on the target if you ran into a blaster boat all by him self it would still be easy to kill him as all you would have to do is pound him from beyond his range
i wasnt suggesting a change in damage types i was suggesting a change in how the ammo could give very different bonuses hybrids would still only deal thermal and kinetic damage but for example antimatter would deal alot more damage to shields and plutonium a lot more damage to armour a different ammo type can offer very high tracking and another very high rof or high alpha with low rof one could offer very high falloff where another could offer very high optimal
while i agree with the sentiment that hybrids needs a boost i have to point out that your weapon score formula have some major flaws1dps have the same weight as optimal  falloff2optimal have the same weight as falloff3tracking speed is not a part of the formula4other utilities of the turrets such as reload time and capdrainage are not accounted forwhen the highest tier medium railgun scores 150 higher than the medium blaster perhaps that should give you a hint that your formula is not a very accurate tool to evaluate weapons or could we perhaps just give railgunstats to blasters and all of a sudden they are very goodposting stuff like this to try to promote a hybrids buff will likely just be contra productive
you would have been hit for 7500 damage not 15000 dps

it makes no sense to force pilots to risk theft just to get into a corpmaking things harder by not providing utility features in an effort to preserve the sandbox is stupid why do you think we have the market should we just make everyone rely on undocking jettisoning items and gifting money to each other too
either allow corp joining from space  or  let us passwordprotect our ships if we eject
cry my a river  waaah waaah  there should be no inconvenience related to owning a super cap if you have to do something to make it vulnerable while you change corps  well tough frankly
what is funny is ccp lets you petition to boot people from a corp if they stay in space and dont dock so the game will let you boot themshould be a two way street so either let super capital pilots petition to get in a corp or allow people to leave and get in corps while still in spaceyou could even make it where that mechanic only works if the game detects your in a super capital to prevent abuse
you can put in your app from anywhere in space just look at corp info and hit the apply buttonas far as actually being accepted it should work by just logging out get accepted while offline works with leaving corps in space at least

i had a few ideas on this if we could link corp hangar arrays with the manufacturing arrayscontrol towers we might be able to accomplish the remote move a lot easier with little programmingalso since we now have manufacturing pi structures to higher degrees why not just have the towers need one more advanced fuel such as organic mortar applicators alone instead of the different components or pellets this would make the reactions a lot easier and create a strong demand for the oxides and make the gas planets a lot more valuable since theyre so plentiful right now and still keep the oooh factor of plasma planets this seems like the best combination from the chartsoverall i like some of the ideas and think this could really improve the headache of poses without adding too much overhead supported
supportedand for the love of all things goodredo the damned pos permissions pleaseits utterly stupid and fail
biggest thing for me would be the fuel pellets i think ccp was kicking that ideal around already too so they mite even have some work done on that one too
the error lies in that when you store and eject from your ship within 2500m of the sma but your pod then pops out to a position farther away from the sma than 2500m the ship stays in space happens often especially with big ships
drake can you post something about how these might be changed i am concerned that this might be outside the scope of this proposal i want to focus on microtweaks that will make life easierbtw does anyone know if you can interact with pos modules from outside the shield if they are close to the edge for example or is there already a must be inside the shield conditional
no more passwords your not in the alliance you dont get the luxury of hiding in the pos shield or using the jump bridgeyeah i know rage on nap train coalitions but i dont care
providing you have the permissions roles or rights to access a module inside a pos you can access any of them as long as your within the arrays operational range it doesnt matter if your in the shield or not list of things in no order1 anchoring and onlining queue2pos gunners get pos under attack mails 3 fuel pellets 4 centralized storage  remove the storage for each array that requires storage and make a central storage unit or allow us to use chas5 increase operational range of arrays or allow access to all arrays while inside the bubble6 tolls for jump bridges7 access to pos and pos arrays via standings8 improve pos array placement during anchoring9 reduce times on anchoring and onlining offlining10 move the offline option away from the manage option on the context menuin addition the pos ui could use a lot of work adding the pi linking system to reaction linking would be a step in the right direction oh and of course talking ccp into doing the most of the things in this thread would be great but we know thats not low hanging fruit

nope  you should log back in with what you logged out with logofskis should not be encouraged  especially when cap is the limiting factor in capital jumping you should have to stay in system and potentially vulnerable while your cap builds
i will push sok to raise this before the change you could just relog your supercap to instantly recharge your capacitor but ofcourse ccp while fixing this exploit went to completely opposite direction your capacitor should be fully recharged if you log in and the time between your last logging off was longer then your capacitor would recharge if you are onlineits ed that if fe i jump and log off and log in after 2 weeks i still miss 70 of capacitor
its easier to make unprobable again fly guardian if you like it so much instead of making onieros a 2nd guardian with different name just because you want to save a few days of training doesnt change the fact that other people use onieros for what it is you always have guardian once you messed up their onieros youll have 2 guardiansalso your oneiros died because your guardian pilot is incompetent didnt rep it in time and because enemy choose to shoot oneiros first guardian has more armor hp but the difference isnt day and night assuming both pilots are equally incompetent had the enemy choose to shoot the guardian first it would likely have gone down as well just a few seconds laterand yes any fc who turns down any logi still needs his head examined

current skills 216 skill points 56987444i agree but im 1 to the slot switching im 1 to the slot switching but 1 to some of the changes imo the ony should be focused on things that emphasize it being the only logistics in a fast moving fleet because frankly if theres multiple logistics around you should be in a guardianbasilisk id like to see it made faster and more agile and the tracking link bonus turned into an ab velocity bonusand yes i have logistics 5 and fly logistics frequentlyliang

with this suggestion i aim to kill 2 birds with 1 stone i seem to recall a survey or statistic that said electronic attack frigates were the least flown ship in all of eve with the ecm changes and the blob warfare styles in eve as it stands my idea ties in with how cloaks are a pain to counter since the only counter for a cloak is to hit it within 2km of the target and the majority of the time unless you are very good at this the target cloaky ship will escapemy idea will bring a balance to the cloak and an increased popularity to the eafa new module for the high slot of eafs called the electronic phased distruption pulse i a 20km pulse weapon that decloaks anything in the field ofcourse it would need some hefty skill requirements my personal choice would be science velectronics velectronic upgrades velectromagnetic physics ivenergy pulse weapons vprojected electronic countermeasures ifor balance reasons the cooldown of this module is 100 seconds with projected electronic countermeasures reducing it by 5 a leveli would apprciate any feedback on my idea in terms of balancing and impact on the game worldfly safejack mortivore

pretty much spot on there but in much the same way pirates keep misisoners out of lowsec supercaps are keeping lowsec pvp extremely limited aswell my corp has several cap pilots but we almost never have a use for them aside from the odd l5 mission when things are really quiet we either roam in subcaps until we get bored or we break out a few caps to hit a harder target and almost always come up against a sc hotdrop the risks of operating on either extreme of carebear and pvp are so severe that the middle ground of cheap roaming blobs are all that remainsi think a number of things could revitalize lowsec1 supercaps  fighter bombers have no place in lowsec period without the ubiquitous sc issue lowsec politics would get a niche of their own cap warfare would be more prevalent and if 00 entities wanted to weigh in they would need to come on even footing even if they had many more numbers2 securing a system note secure is very relative here since there will be no warp bubbles with positive sec status should be possible but at a price id like to see the ability for corpsalliances friendly with an empire to pay for the right to shoot first against anyone with negative sec ofc that leaves the opening for players with positive sec to invade eachother creates a pseudosov system without the upgrades basically a place where pve players could try to keep pirates out if they so desired for the chance at more lucrative missions or sites3 create a real dynamic between pirates and mercenaries by reforming the bounty system i see it being something a bit like faciton warfare but it could be done in some other way aswell there could even be a countermerc system setup by local pirate npc agents for those with negative sec status this way both white knights and selfprofessed yarrbears would have a compelling iskbacked reason to hunt one another and competethere are other mostly fw related suggestions but i think this covers most of the nonfw issues

it is very difficult to count all factorsfor example how can we consider damage type in a formula projectiles can adjust damage according a target it means that real dps is much higherhow can we consider fitting requirements in a formula for example ac has tiny pg requirements it gives big advantage in fittingthe formula does not consider all factors it is simplified model but it illustrates common blaster problems very clearlyps 1
1 herein general i miss the old days and ways to engage in blaster combat where working with a platform that forces a target to point blank pvp did mean something else than flying a slow brick and running into tracking issues just to perform as bad as 
signed more damage better tracking to hit at least as reliably as other races do in their optimal and that will still leave our slow asses struggling to get near enough to actually apply dps while the other slow asses amarr enjoy uber optimal to plink away without having to even try to apply failwebs if something could be done about that which wasnt instant death for smaller targetstacklers 90 webs again or impeding on other races a speed boost it would be great but idk what it could be shrugs

omg we all agree on something the universe is going to implodeps supported
yesthey look small and silly asis
ships go from being like 2km long to being 17km long with nothing inbetween supported
its a freaking mothership change the name back and make the ship fit the freaking name
right now i believe the limit is one per system i would like that cap taken off or at least raised to 35 depending on the size of the solar system we have hundreds of systems in eve with more than 2 or 3 stations in empire and low sec so we should expect to have the same in null sec if an alliance is willing and wants to do it
what for
taking away the time sink but shifting productity to active playtime i like itsignedhowever 5 minutes is a lil over the top think of the huge advantage people using bots get the numbers could be adjusted a bit like 25 min 55 min 1hr 30 min 2 hrs 10 min
i agree with this they didnt make pos a visit daily and reset all the production lines thing so theres no reason this shouldnt be the same
lol only one reply i wonder how many people actually use planet interactionor is it that everybodys just ok with how it works
sure supporing all ui improvements since 2008
signed for boosting rockets only they desperately need do not boost hms hams or any other missiles which are absolutely fine as alica said drake already awesome in fact its joint best bc in game with cane
support
repackage of ships and items in corp hangarsship maint would be nice
i would be happy if there was a 3rd bay just for mining crystals its pain in but to have that and the ore in 1
definetely supportedsimilar idea to the t3 industrial barge
this gets my support but with one conditioni should only be able to operate in 00 and maybe low sec this would then make it the idea candiate to encourage low and 00 mining
fine so long as it is not allowed in hisec because this is just an afkers dream ppl should be playing this game not fapping while making isk id even support 1 warp strength if the former condition was met as the above poster stated could be a much needed encouragement to get ppl into lonull sec
let me set this straight it is not useless is do use it it is good its worse then that of its counterparts let the numbers speak for me blasters effective range faloff  optimal is improved by 25 since its a bonus to optimal and fallofflaser optimal range is improved by 375 only optimal is improved but thats the majority of their rangethe autocanon range is improved by 40 only faloff is improved but thats whre most of autocanons range is inas you can see not only are blasters an underpowered weapon system they also recieve an underpowered t2 ammunition which renders them redundant even further because someone decided that 25 boost to faloff and optimal for blasters is same as 50 boots to optimal on lasers obviously its not if someone does not believe te numbers listed above i will be happy to provide full calculations solution increase the range bonus to 375 percent that of lasers seems fair to me it is not advised to buff one of them by 50 because blasters range is half in optimal and half in faloff
primaeis a sueless ship because it cannot hold daily yield of one planet at the moment and a t1 hauler can primae looks cool in my hangar but thats all its good for if a t1 hauler is superior to it with no mods primae is rendered useless i propose changing its planetary goods cargohold capacity from 1k to 10k meters cubed which coupled with primaes defencive capabilities willl make this ship a valid alternative to a t1 hauler ps and we can also give it a high slot andor warp strengthbut themain point of  proposal is to increase cargoholdto usefull capacity
ill support this it does seem rather useless in its present form
i really like the look of primae its a cool ship but its useless i cant be bothered to transport it to 00 space where i live because honestly an industrial ship has much bigger cargoholdif it had a bigger hold for pi materials like the size of the customs office for example then i would fly it its now sitting in a highsec system doing nothing
get rid of en remote reaps and stop thinking of you en back pockets ccp sick if this  you cant shoot at people but you can rr peoples wt or people that have an aggression timer and i know the only reason why yous allow this is because yous make money from this because of useless s that cant pvp with out help but they dont want to stay in the same corp coz they dont want to get shot at freely and reaping should have a timer for docking as well or just let every one shoot at each other coz they may as wellplease do not evade the profanity filter zymurgist
support neutral remote repping should be considered an exploit
dont worry about itmate i know where your coming from and ccp wont change it coz they would lose to much money because eve is built on alts i would all so like to see that you pay for a dec then other people stick there noses in where they do not belong
agreedi can understand sensor boosting and things like that but rr should have a timer also its clearly a fn exploit used by so many puies
supported
i support buying the op a dictionarythesaurus
privateers and orphanage would disband if neutral remote modules had the mechanics changed careful
not supported youre confusing the issue of neutral remote reps in high sec with the overall remote rep strategythe way agression works with neutral reppers in high security space involving themselves in combat does need looking at but this isnt a good way to deal with it
yeah neutral rr sucks get rid of it or give me ability to shoot the rring person for the next 15 years because i hate them if you whant rr be a man and participate in the war i am sick of guardian alts
u mad brooh and i found all the punctuation you forgot in the opinsert as needed
lots of clueless andor unimaginative people itt including op and yaay
lack reading skills much
theres plenty of ships that need tweaks like this time to get working on them ccp
your problem comes from assuming that the oneiros has to get its cap from cap recharge have a look at the very large cargo hold for its class fill it up with cap boostersoneiros ab cap boosterdamage control ii800mm reinforced rolled tungsten plates ienergized adaptive nano membrane iienergized adaptive nano membrane ii10mn afterburner iiempty med slotconjunctive magnetometric eccm scanning array iconjunctive magnetometric eccm scanning array imedium electrochemical capacitor booster i navy cap booster 800large remote armor repair system iilarge solace i remote bulwark reconstructionlarge solace i remote bulwark reconstructionlarge solace i remote bulwark reconstructionmedium ancillary current router imedium ancillary current router imedium armor maintenance bot ii x5can boost permanently for about 10 minutes and doing so is not even needed in order to maintain cap stability the guardian has better tank a slightly higher rep output if fitted with a 5 repper1 cap transfer configuration the extra rep drones can partially make up for that with the bonus but the oneiros is way more resitant to ewar if a guardian gets jammed both it and its cap transfer partner shuts down if an oneiros gets jammed its partner can keep on repping and with all the mid slots and higher base sensor strength it is much harder to jam the fit above has almost twice the sensor strength of a guardian with 1 eccm and still has 1 more mid slot that can be used for more eccm either local or remote sensor booster if youre worried about damps putting you out of lock range or you think you need the extra scan res to lock in time tracking link if you want to help a friendly bs hit that hostile logistics orbiting him a bit betterput that falcon right in the optimal of an amarr bs with scorch or you can drop a large repper down to a medium and put a mwd in the last slot so you have both the range control and mobility of a mwd in addition to the damage reduction of a ab for fighting gangs with lots of ecm or gangs where you need the extra mobility of a mwd bring the oneiros i wouldnt mind having the tracking link bonus swapped for a bonus to remote eccm strength though with that guardians and oneiroses could work together guardians providing cap for eachother and possibly also for the oneiroses while the oneiroses add almost as much to the repping in addition to covering the guardian weakness of low sensor strength it is not neccecery in order to make the oneiros useful though
why isnt the oneiros most important disadvantage listed  the fact it has 200 less powergrid the guardian can easily run four reps 2 large energy transfers and a 1600mm plate while the oneiros is extremely pressed to fit 3 reps and a 1600mm plateimho the slot layout is sufficient the tracking link bonus i agree is pretty useless a repair drone bonus would be far more logical for a drone specializing race more powergrid is the most essential problem
although i disagree that the onieros needs a boost maybe a smidge more speed i do think that tracking enhancers are useless with their current bonus the bonus needs to be stronger to be effective and worth while usingi also think that the schimi is slightly off too ive always thought that the schimi should drop its tracking enhancer bonus and be given a bonus to remote armour reps being as minnie ships do both shield and armour tanks effectively ive also thought that there should be two classes of logis for each race one similar to the onieros and one similar to the guardian the amarr onieros needs a real name class logi could have a very similar slot layout as the onieros but with a bonus to remote eccm the caldari would have a bonus to remote sensor boosters then the gallente and minnie 2nd class logis could have the energy transfer bonuses to let them pair up for larger fleet work
the oneiros is fine just fly it like a scimitar but with armor reps
both armor logis should be viable for fleets at the moment guardian is vastly superior at it an oneiros that worked as well as the scimi does in shield fleets would be lovely
if i whant to be unprobably i fly a recon or covops not a logi ship how about we take away all geddont armor rantk and make it unprobably or give it some other random bonus that has nohing to o with itpurposei see no connectio between being a logi ship and benig unprobable gallente should be second most manuverable race theirfore onieros should have mroe speed nd mch smaler sig radius all gallente ships should always be faster then their amarr counterparts which is the case with pretty much everything in tirn amarr get more tank how much more is a different question and i have a feeling guardian gets much moreif you want to give it a drone repair bonus then give it a good dronebayracking bonus is useless indeed you dont have the slots to waiste on tracking enhancer cap bonus or amror effishiency bonus would be usefull a defense bonus would also be niceoniers must be broung close to guardian or schimatar at te momen its neither capable of tancking nor avoiding the damage
i will say this one more time i have asked and been treated like an idiot make the whs able to have sov but only 6 whs can be claimed and joined via jump bridge i will explain a little for the thick people hope this helpsok wh level 1 joins to wh level 23456 wh level 2 can be joined to wh level 13456 and so onbut it is restricted to the amount of moons so if 1 wh onl has 2 moons then it can only link to 2 other whs and a alliance can only joinclaim level 1 through to level 6 wh so a alliance cant join 50 whs they can only join 6 1 of each level and by doing this they should be able to put a station up in either a wh of there choice or have it made so a station can only be put up in a class 6 or something now i hope for the thick people this shows that this idea can help young alliance grow and will not make the big alliance take it over because if they did they would only have 6 systems joined and would be a waste of time for them0 i hope this can become possible it would help alot of young alliance say 100 member alliances
maybe if you took the time to read and to pay attention as to why we oppose this youd stop being called an idiotbut once again you are an idiotnot supportingand seriously epic fail on necroing a thread
ok ccp did not intend many things they did not intend ninja salvagers to exist theydid not intend peole to fit smartbombs on titansthey did not intend people to use destroyers as salvagers they did not intend carriers to be used forhauling they did not intend orca to be a mini freighter they did not intend blasters to suckthey did not intend hyperion to be next to uselss they did not intend station dockgamesthere are tons of things that they did not inted but you need to look at situation ytou have on your hands now and worck wit it so what have we got womholes became a place where a small and mediumorpcan place their assets and live in they can call it home they can exploit it they can pvp in it and they cannot be hotdropped easelly theonly prblem is when a wormhole goes on dry spell the wholecorphas nothing to do so while mecanic currently used in 00 would be unsuitable certain improvements can be madeidont see why they would hurt anyone so lets use those few improvementswe dont need caps in wormholeswe dont need outpostswe dont need cynoswedont need tcuswe dont need gateswe would like more spawns or more connecting wormholes or something of that nature that would prevent a wormhole from going on a dry spelland sto calling eachother idiots it does not make any of you look any better
some of us have playd this along time and some like the person under my first post havnt if a small alliance wants to become big explain to me some good ways to go from 100 in a small alliance to 1000 with out being someones  and paying for space if 6 whs could be joined  via jump bridge not gate then a small alliance could grow to probably 3400 wich would be sufficient to go to 00 for there own space 100 is a rediculas number to try and take and hold your own 00maybe if you took the time to read and to pay attention as to why we oppose this youd stop being called an idiotmaby if some people would consider an idea instead of no no no all the time just because some people love to live in high sec all the time or be pirates doesnt mean small alliance that want to play against npc instead of wrecking other peoples experiance the only reason for sov in a wh from my oppinion is so u could join 6 whs together if some people read what i had written thaey would c that i asked for class 1 class 6 to be joined  not 6x class 3 whs  wich would give newer players a chance to make isk in the lower classes and build an alliancebefore some smart a post a reply atleast tell me why this basic set up of joining 6 whs is so bad

maybe they should nerf rifters and their t2 counterparts because they are too fast also because you get your ass kicked by something doesnt mean it is unfair i hate warp scam but you dont hear me crying they should nerf it
wow brilliant argument there too good compared to what if it costs 150m to lose it should be more effective than a bs that costs 20m to lose
news flash a bs costs 100m isk to lose and thats assuming you insured it not sure where you got 20m from maybe if you get a tier one dont fit it and self destruct that said im sticking with my original point of wts t2 web an ab hac is stupidly easy to kill its the ones with mwds that can be tricky
20m is on the low end for t2 fit but not by much 100 mil is way off unless youre buying ships at twice market value
3x trimarks cost 4050m isk megapulse iis cost around 3m a pop 8 of them is 24m youll want a warp disruptor ii thats about 800k you probably want a dcii as well thats 600k youre definitely going to want some ammo so thats 8m for 8x in mf and lets say another 8m for 8x scorch crystals you might also want to throw a few plates on 1600mm rts are 35m each lets say 2 of them 20m isk my ass
the zealotguardian blob is extremely potent but has lots of effective and lowcost counters it was born out of the ashes of the smouldering bs wrecks that died to the swarm of bombs and is far more vulnerable than the last hac fetish ever was nanoagehacs

though it sounds like a good idea i am kinda of neutral about it the problem is that i like how the current scan window works even though i hate the screen space it takes up i like how it groups the ores by type making it easier to findmine and make bms even with this you would have to expand the overview window to include all the detailsbut it would still save space to me the scanner window is a necessary evil that provides more convenience than it provides inconvenience
i can read sarcasm i could care less if shes a member of the pirate party or not they are recognized as a real world political party and its not my place to question thatit is however quite possible that it may have had a part in her nda breach and that is where my curiosity stems from
it has been confirmed the alleged nda breach had nothing to do with any of her recent activities but with her earlier seats on the csm
no it wasnt confirmed there was some fairly wellsubstantiated speculation but we didnt ever find out exactly what happened or what timeframe it happened in even if it wasnt information from this aborted term on the csm it could have been old information that she recently released or whatever we simply dont know and probably never will since evas ill tell you all tomorrow blog post was something like two months ago now
true on all countsive been surprised about the dead silence on takecare as well especially considering how over the top she was when defending her position in the past

i like excellence
this is the best eveo thread of all timefor what its worth nearly all mmorpgs suffer from this problem older content that needs fixing tweaking andor polishing gets pushed to the wayside indefinitely or for long periods of time meanwhile the developers are busy creating new content three years later the old content remains broken as the developers continue to create new featuresits a tough nut to crack and i know it but i trust that ccp can do it if they want to
but ccp dont wantstrange csm position
amazing that this hasnt been fixed with all the bad word of mouth advertising because of the fontif only they would fix this my friends might actually like the way this game looksas it is all they see is the 1024x768 stretched out on my 24 widescreen with no aa and all because i cant read the font on post1999 resolutionsfor crimonies sake how hard can this be to do
i have spent some more time working the numbers on the other weapons sizes i know the weapon score ws number is not all inclusive but it does give a good indication of the problem i use them if you dont want to dont if you know a better way to rate weapons please post it as this is the best way i know i added tracking just so people can see it for each weapon type keep in mine the further the target is away from you the less tracking you will need one thing i have not touched on before is that lasers dont require ammo in the since of per shot consumable ammo add to that that reloading is instant were the other two types require a 10 second reload time these are yet 2 more advantages to a weapon system that is all ready over powered here are the numbers for small tech two weapons small neutron blaster iidps 144 optimal 900 falloff 2500 range 3500 tracking 3165 ws 48960 medium pulse laser iidps 1234 optimal 3000 falloff 2000 range 5000 tracking 24525 ws 61714200mm autocannon iidps 1101 optimal 600 falloff 4800 range 5400 tracking 315 ws 59875again the numbers show that blasters are lacking something most people say damage in one of my last posts i worked out that if the damage modifier on medium blasters was upped from 42 to around the 52 mark the guns would be much more balanced across the board as far as weapons score goes lets see if that change would also work on small blasters as well 52x1235x900250060622that works out to 1783 dps the same range as before and a new weapons score of 60622 that would put the buffed neutron blaster right between the score of the 200mm autocannon and medium pulse laser the blaster would still be the in your face weapon it was meant to be but would now have the dps to make up for its short range so its the same easy fix just bump up the damage modifier of hybrid weapons 1 point to 52tech two ammo is still unbalanced as a medium pulse laser ii with scorch ammo has a weapons score of 124457 the other long range tech 2 ammo for both hybrid and projectile weapons only have a weapons score of 70950 and 85377 respectably maybe nurf scorch ammo to bring it back in line to what the other weapons can do right now it seems a bit over powered due to the 50 optimal bonus it gives this needs to be looked at and rebalanced
here are the numbers for the large short range weaponsneutron blaster cannon iidps 256 optimal 3600 falloff 10000 range 13600 tracking 0433 ws 348160mega pulse laser iidps 2194 optimal 12000 falloff 8000 range 20000 tracking 03375 ws 438857800mm repeating artillery iidps 19712 optimal 2400 falloff 19200 range 21600 tracking 0432 ws 425779 the weapons scores are just as unbalanced here as they are in the other sizes not only that but there are other problems as well first lets take a look at the weapons score of blasters and try to fix that so again lets see if the new damage modifier of 52 would bring blasters more inline to the other weapons 52x487875x360010000 431055 what do you know same problem same solution so not only would changing the damage modifier up one point fix blasters it would fix three sizes of them second problem tracking speeda blaster should have much higher tracking to any other gun due to its low over all range it makes since then that tracking on blasters should be adjusted so that they have the same chance to hit at there close range as the other weapons that shoot at there longer ranges the problem i see is that the 800mm repeating artillery has 9977 the tracking speed of the neutron blaster but 58 more range does that stick out as a problem to anyone elsetech ii ammo is still unbalanced here as well scorch is still heads and shoulders better then any other tech 2 ammo when it comes to long range ammo scorch has a weapons score of 888480 barrage 607152 and null at a very depressing 483276 the high damage ammo scores are also in favor of lasers conflagration 512000 void 283670 and hail at 276000 the long range ammo has 75 normal tracking speed the high dps ammo takes a 50 tracking hit so not only do blaster need a buff when it comes to normal ammo but tech 2 ammo as well this is just another example why ccp needs to shelf wis and get back to work on the core elements to there flagship game too bad walking in space stations is more important to a mmo about flying space ships then you know flying space ships
i wish you be heard by csm or ccp
what really makes this scream to the heavens is that gallente has been left between a rock and a hard place both rail blasters and t2 ammo is in need of a rebalance ive been thinking of offering a few billion in lottery to people who spam ccp with honest complaints commit to excellence recommit to gallente
needs more bigger
bigger is betterdoes anyone have any vitoc
for the possibility of having every outpost type in 1 system instead of 4 systems
i completely agree with this idea theres no reason we shouldnt be allowed to create refineries in the same system as a factory the game mechanics obviously already exist its a completely arbitrary limit that holds us to one station per system and it doesnt make sense although people are always opposed to change for no reason this change would only improve the game and increase the value of certain systems if your alliance is willing to lay more cards on the table then why should they be held back from doing so
supporting my own topic
but how would more than 1 structure fit in an entire star system there just isnt enough space
right because all star systems only have 1 moon or planet in eve right
it will mess up with sovereign takeovers more stations to reinforce  more timers to go off  more time to take a system  more lag fights  more rageqqingdrama  worse evei hope you got my point if they manage to find a way to reinforce systems and not stations then we could perhaps work something outlast thing we need is more things to destroy in order to capture a system

i think the current overview settings are pretty crappy they are hard to understand unintuitive hard to get right requires a lot of work and are buggy also they cant be shared amongst the corp or alliancei dont know how many times ive changed something thought i had it saved and when im done its back to the way it was again or if im lucky it works the current session but when i start the game again its back to the way it was alternatively all the tabs have changedmaybe im just too stupid to set it up right or maybe its bugs but its not intuitive and well workingso i came up with my own suggestion of how i would want it to work i put this together in visual basic so just imagine the eve ui instead of windows xp overview1to the left is the settings window here are all the settings stored there are 4 categories templates  provided by ccp read only personal  your own settings corporation  settings from your corp alliance  settings from your alliancethere are some indicators next to the entriesr  read only  a number means this setting is applied to the corresponding overview tab  asterisk means this setting has changes in it that needs to be savedto the right is the actual settings its important to note that all the data in the tabs belongs to a single setting ie when you select a setting all data in all tabs belong only to that setting something that does not hold for the current overview settings and therefore makes them hard to understandoverview2by right clicking a setting you select in which tab you want to show it in or if you want to hide it templates can be used as is but cant be modified templates are of course good starters for new settings by right clicking and choosing use as template we can create a new personal corp or alliance settingwe can see that the one currently using the interface has the corp roles necessary to modify corp overview settings but not alliance overview settings they show as read only he can of course always modify his own personal settingswe can also see that he has modified but not yet saved the personal setting exploration as it has an asteriskover to the actual settings on the rightoverview3the first tab is visibility roughly what is called filters todayit contians two children static items and pilots roughly what is called types and states todaystatic items as you can see is almost exactly like types is today with one important exception you can now not only choose what should be shown on your overview but which brackets should be shown in space as welloverview4pilots is what is called states today but instead of the very unintuitive and buggy mess that is currently used this one is a lot easier to understandthe current selection for example will hide your fleetcorpalliance typical nullsec setup by for example changing the not to equals and the and to or you will instead only show your fleetcorpalliance useful for carriers and logisticsthis is of course very easily modifiable all the criterias that exists today will also exist here as can be seen in the dropdown boxby clicking the corresponding remove button that critera is removed and by clicking the add new criteria button a new row is addedthe four remaining tabs appearance columns ship brackets and misc is exactly the same as today ship brackets is called ships today the overview tabs tab is removed as it is served elsewere in the right click menu
hybrid weapons as a whole need to be looked over and fixed this argument is nothing new just more specific than most this is already a widelyknown problem
theyre meant to be used in rails for sniping not blasters the fact that rails suck is a separate issue
rails with nulls awesome i want those supported btw
yay
marconus orion in this post in a recent devblog thread makes an interesting pointi would like opinions procon to such a change as well as other potential modules that could be made passive modules with no cap cost such as drone link augmentor come to mindthe obvious con argument is that it makes cap warfare slightly less effective but given the tiny cost of a dc 1 gj vs a hardener 30 gj is it really all that significantif there is reasonable consensus on this i will raise it at an upcoming meeting
i agree with this change i see no need for these modules to be active whatsoever ill update this post if i think of any other modules that should definitely be made passive
in a old thread 2 years or more in the fi section of the forum there was a discussion about this apparently the developers original idea for the damage control was a that of a passive module but there was some problem with the stacking with other modules or somesuch and it was made active with trinity the original problem was resolved so the op was arguing for making it a passive module if i recall exactly there was even a post by a dev in that thread tentatively agreeing that it would not be a bad change but in the end nothing was done so supported unless someone can prove that it will really have a significant impact on pvp
supported
disagree neuted damage control on a supercapital can be very importantuse an eanm if you want passive resists
1 on the damage control at leastim not familiar with dcus in practice it never shuts off anyway since the duration is so long and you always have the one point of cap it takes a bloody miracle to shut the thing off with neuts even for a second so 
are you ing stupid or somethingthe odds that you have a super capital at 0 cap when it cycles is astronomical i for one will be content on not winning the lottery and deactivating a super capitals damage control for one second before he turns it back on and having less lag and that annoying button you have to push every time you jumping idiot
astronomical but existant
so you want more kill mail but more lag as well yeah no thanksif its any help at all in the fight against lag turn em passive
i think that the downside to this is that as a passive module you would not be able to overload it
you cant overload it anyway and yes im against this too i remember at least 2 supercap kills that only happened because their dcu got neuted off
good idea
epic idea
sounds like a reasonable change and a good way to avoid too much info being sent through the pipe these modules either use no cap or marginal amountssupported

im offended you didnt read my post one above hissupported but disgruntled and butthurt
yes
supported
1 mw every 30 seconds the likelihood of keeping anyones cap drained to absolutely 0 at the right time for a dcu to continue running is pretty low in the lagfest that is a super cap takedown it is likely that the module will be stuck on without using any cap anyway most smaller ships will be dead inside 30 seconds so even trying to keep their cap at 0 at the right time is just plain silly no reason to have this an active module instead of a passive one
my apologies so many posts so little timein light of todays devblog about the recent lagfix on cycling modules your comment is particularly prescienti will have fellow csm vuk lau send you some of his famous soothing lube to ease your pain wrt to the posters concerned about the possible missed kills due to dc not being incappable i would like some more data on how frequently this kind of event really occurs ie it makes the kill possible vs just delaying the inevitable also assuming it is a real factor what changes to the module attributes might balance the changeif i do bring this up to csm it will definitely include this concern in the cons section
dear ccpu did it worng u need to give tranqility sp
indeed
they did it right sisi is voluntary and it doesnt effect the game as i posted before it isnt right to give out free sp for any reason except extreme circumstances that ccp has caused intentionally or otherwise and even then i am very weary of them giving sp out yeah it is a pain to wait for skills to finish but never should we expect that after all there is a reason it is supposed to take over 45 years to train everything and that is so no one character can specialize in everythingwill not supported nor do i ever intend to support such a proposal because of its nature
 mynxee  yif mynxee wasnt the chairman the list should never been release to players

i cant understsand what the op said lolbut if he said that rring needs to have timers added then i support
suggested addition to the mechanicyou must have a membership count equal to 5 of the membership count of the corp you are declaring war on or the cost is increased by a specified factor ie tripled or based upon the missing percentage while not having this cost requirement for declaring war on an alliance the increased cost is already presentthis is to discourage 2 man corps declaring war on those with 300 members for the meager cost of a current corp to corp wardec adding in the increased cost penalty is to ensure mercenary institutions are still able to perform their duties
agreed you should not be able to simply jump log off during your invulnerability timer and then log back in with full cap ready to jump out nomatter how long you stay offline both capacitor and shield level should be at whatever it was when you last logged out
that is up for debate but the point is that it doesnt even do that  quite often it spawns you with a lower cap level than what you logged out with
how about mining maybe not as much of a troll as it sounds like it could solve a number of issues ccp could deliver that 5th subsystem in a way that would not totally overpower t3 ships im sure thats a consideration with any new subsystembalancing all the possible combinations of the new type and the old onesit could present a mining option that is more resiliant than the current crop of mining barges for players who want that and what miner wouldnt you might even end up with gasp a mining barge with spare highslots
t3 is pretty skill unintensive how do you plan to account for that make it worth using for mining and not make it worth training over the hulk in the first place due to the lower amount of time needed if it were trained isk cannot be the answer nor can specialized training so while i actually like the idea i cant see a practical implementation based on what t3 is designed for
the same thing t3 ganglinks did to command ships you mean that worked out okstill though mehive had nightmares of the next set of subsystems including a hictor or dictor effect
the current set of introduction to the game missions are woefully inadequate to teach new players the basics of the game you are basically throwing them into the deep end and seeing if they sink or swim1 the advanced tutorial agents do not provide adequate information on how to actually complete them especially those tutorials which give you skill books which you need to learn to do the mission but do not give you the prerequisite skillbook for itie mountains of molehills chain you are provided the refining skillbook but you dont actually get the industry skillbook anywhere which must be trained to rank 1 before refining can be learned nor is it explained on where to actually get skillbook or how to find items you need or where to go to get new skills2 the introduction to the game training missions can expireget started on a mission chain come back after a week and the mission chain that teaches you the basics of the game has expired and you cannot continue the chain by talking to your agent againboth of these 2 issues are relatively simple to fix from a gameplay point of view with just a little bit more care and attention to detail and actually running through those mission chains in a random order or all at once does not matter and finally assuming the player knows absolutely nothing about the game1 ensure that either all the skills neccesary to do the chain are issued to the player when they run them or indicate to the player that there may be prerequisite skills needed to learn and where they can go to get them ie point them at the skills section in the market place2 either dont let the advanced career agent missions expire or if they do just put them back with the agent and say something like oy you let this expire dont do that ill let you off but other agents are not as nice as me2c
makes sense ive posted a different thread about giving players industry 1 automatically since manufacturing is also based on thissupported as it will help the newer players to this game
i had my friend try an eve trial once the tutorial missions were confusing for him and insufficient even with me helping him he failed to swim and sank to the bottomwhen i first started playing things like this confused me to no end i figured it out before long but its still unnecessary confusion
i dont have a problem with a change but honestly it isnt that hard or challenging to see a skillbook has a prerequisite and then wonder where it ishow do i get it then make a logical leap to checking wherehow you can buy ityou are incorrect refining is for waste reducing it by 2 you dont need it or industry trained at all to use the refining service at stations yes missions do expire and they tell you how much time you have left in the mission details window as well as in your journal i dont see a real need for this but extending it to the trial length 2 or 3 weeks i think is fair if it is deemed really necessary the bigger issue here is once you start with an agent you have 7 days to accept the whole 10 part etc arc ie mission 1 shows as 7 days mission 2 shows as 7 days but missions 310 will have 7 however long you took doing the other missions left before you cant accept them anymore meaning if you take 5 days to complete mission 2 then 3 days to do mission 3 you cant accept mission 4 because the whole arc ran out of time 7 days to accept all the missions or you cant complete the ones that expired if you do the missions in agent order military busindus iirc the game is better explained perhaps ccp should urge players to do them in a specific order as using the market is covered either in a mission or perhaps under the many tutorials in the listing or just move the guiding missions into a separate tutorial like the first dayscrash course thing that is made mandatory but that you can still say i dont need to do this if you so choosei support having another look at this but i dont think it is that hard to figure out if youve ever played a game before or think

think fo something better then camping the hub for 10 minutes someting more active but i like the basic idea
wont everything that encourages people to group up end up as a blob
is there anything better in this game than a blob 1000 enraged ravens trying to defend their isk i dont think so so supporting this
sounds cool  ill support
creates unneeded work for the servers and clients and friendly alliances will wind up friendly camping neighboring ihubs and creating a situation similar to the current bounty system not supported
similar how
i dont like the slot changes nor the nerfing of the tracking link bonus but i do like the reduction of sig radius and bump up of base speedtwold be nice to see more oneiros flying around its always guardians and basis and scimis because the oneiros doesnt fit into most decent gangs well enough to be useful
i dont support this change except for maybe small sigvelocity tweaks oneiros is fine especially for dualboxing
i think its better too replace missile bombardement lvl5 skill with the rapid launch lvl5 skillwhy  both are equally long in training but more dps on target is more preferable than abit of extra rangeusually in pvp and pve dps is more important right and too have an certificate that proves that for missiles would be kewlhope you give your thoughts about what i missed plz
does anyone actually care about those certificates
the op apparentlyi mostly use them to wall paper the inside of my pod
gee i laminate them and tile my pool with them
i live in a wh and even i dont support this turning wh space into null sec is such a bad idea yes it would be nice to get more sites to run more often the disadvange would be that all the 00 corps would invade all the wh and the rest of us would never be able to kick them out ever not supported due to it being a dumb idea that would breke the game
the big alliances would do it as at least one of the systems they string together would have a wh into friendly space sort of making a permanent connection to their space these plus an outpost or two would also become the jump off point for wh roams which is what you dont wantim sorry but the more structure you allow to be laid in wh space the more likely you make it that the coalitionsalliances like the one im in will oust the little guys and move some people ini have given lengthy explanations why this is a bad idea more than once read them before you claim people are making unthinking no responses in this thread
when exactly are you planning to actually do smth about those cheaters that destroy the economy and also take away profits from honest minersuphene as we speak right now is wrecked by them the place is infested with themseek all those hulk pilot drones that mine in large belted near low sec systems that dont reply tour convos and have 1 mil isk spa and never say anything or do anything else than mine for 23 hours per day and totally destroy this gamewe have at least 10 of them ruining uphene daily do smth before yous tart losing players ffs
use macro yourself problem solved
i actually enjoy mining ok plus i am no f cheater r will ever be i aint going to be one of those that ruin the economy and the fun of gamers that play fairly the game and i hope that they are the majority
the answer to your problem is simple if you would like to know more evemail me ingamegerrick palivorn
mail sent but i reaaaaly want to hear smth from someone from ccp here telling wtf they are going to do about this problem they are riiiight there they see them they know them and dont f ban them
i predict that if i were to keep bumping this thread itd get more replies from anonymous csm alts than any other thread in the history of the csm right up to the point where they have it deleted
supported just look at how bad the us congress works with unlimited terms they said experience was a benefit i say it just let them further their own agendas
i support 2 x 1 year term limitkb
they said it caused too much lag i have a pretty awesome pc so that was never too much of a problem but it must have sucked for the people who dontthat said i miss it it was way cooler and i wish theyd bring it backalso the nos and neut animations we had for a short while that looked like fine red lightning bolts or crackling electricitythose rocked bring those back toothe new eccm as mentioned elsewhere is too dramatic it detracts from gameplay in a big way 1 on revamping that one i know theres a thread on it around here somewherethe old web animations were cooler too never have gotten used to the new one it just doesnt grab your attention in the same way its too hard to see pseudoscience explanations of the graphic take a back seat to actual usability in the game as far as im concerned im afraid give us the old web graphic back toolots of awesome graphics in eve lots its just that a very few of the upgrades in recent monthsyears feel more like downgrades new shield effects for instance are awesome and a huge improvment

it was the drone regions not level 4 mission runners who destroyed the value of mining everyone makes mistakes the problem is ccp like most game designers will make a mistake then try to fix it with more mistakes messing up all kinds of seemingly unrelated stuff in the process instead of just rolling back the original mistakeget rid of the drones put regular rats in the drone regionsultimately this will hurt ccps income by costing subscriptions of scads of former soviet block players who make a real life living in the those regions and some of who will undoubtably migrate to another game but they should just suck it up and do it anyway
you know that there is no bounty on drones no 11 mill or even more isk on each bs which spawns no officers loot or those hauler spawns which gives you huge amount of minerals in one go and you know that all the drone loot isnt worth anything if you cant haul it to highsec or build something from it which also means initial high investments its not a mistake its good as it is still drone region sucks you dont know that 
right lol ever been to a 10 drone systemthe quantity of minerals you can haul out of there by killing drones is ridiculous ive never made so much isk anywhere else in eve
but why am i arguing with xdeath about it lol of course youre right drone regions suck your secret is safe with me dont worry
do you realise that they reduced the amount of minerals that drones drop
hi obsidian herei was there when the drone regions first opened up helped build some of those original stations out thereop  you are full of crap because of the drone regions mexaloon prices jumped up and so did pyerite while the drone regions are plentiful in minerals they are really lacking in 2 mexallon and megacytethis of course makes stuff like plag and kernite a great mining money maker plus if you havent noticed since tyrannis nocxium went up in price 50 isogen is up 10 also
i think blah was attempting to slide a hidden russian nerf through i still have to laugh at the xdeath guy who responded if you dont like drone space why not move into the south and give the drone regions to your pets instead of the other way aroundi think drone regions need more variability in their drones you shouldnt be able to rat for an hour and know almost exactly how much you will make in the rest of 00 space people are faced with killing a battleship rat and getting a crap laser crystal as loot then killing the next and getting a pith xtype drone regions simply dont have that variability
so basicly its a human drone shooting computer drones and droning on while his isk ticks up slowly in minerals

noooo i havent finished minmatar cruiser 5 yet i would be stuck with 3 bad long range hacs then until i can sit in a muninn give me at least another 12 days please that or they could fix the hybrid ships
while the vast majority of our population remains quite mature it seems that there are some people just have a problem ignoring those that cause problems and the phrase out of sight out of mind comes to mindso my suggestion is simple create a mechanic that allows us to put people on an ignore list and we never see a post from that person again i have seen this feature in several other forums  communities i have no knowledge about how complicated this would be for programmingwhile not ideal it is a possible way to allow those of us who cannot help but reply to the consistant troublemakers also because there is a user number unique to each account this would allow us to not only ignore that specific person but any alt created on the same account admittedly this does not prevent them from creating temporary accounts but i dont have an answer for thatjust a thought take it for what it is worth
right now there are only two options when it comes to tech two pulse lasers one is weak the other strong my proposal then is that ccp make a third option medium option there is no medium option for pulse lasers in both medium and large sizes reasons both hybrid and projectile turrets have three tech two turret options why do pulse lasers only have twoallows more fitting choices with three options as apposed to the two we have now more choice in fitting is never a bad thingdrawbacks ccp might make them over powered and make these new lasers are more powerfall then there blastersautocannons counterparts make sure all weapons are balanced to each other granted that all ready needs to be looked at anywayi know ccp is busy working on incarna so i took the liberty of coming up with some possible specs for the new pulse lasers for them downgrade the tech 1 version accordingly i quote some dps numbers from other turrets i get these numbers like thisd x h  f dps d  dmg mod h  highest dmg ammo f  fire rate in seconds name intense pulse laser ii medium activation 10665 gj power grid 1815 mw cpu 32 tf rate of fire 49s damage modifier 3 accuracy falloff 35 km optimal 115km tracking 085625 radsecthe dps of the new medium pulse laser is 1469 this fits nicely between the heavy pulse laser 1646 and the duel heavy pulse laser 142 the power grid cpu and tracking are all half way between the two existing turretsname duel intense pulse laser ii large activation 325 gj power grid 2200 mw cpu 475 tf rate of fire 7 s damage modifier 2875 charge size large accuracy falloff 7 km optimal 22 km tracking 03575 radsecthe dps of the new large pulse laser is 1971 this fits nicely between the mega pulse laser 2194 and the duel heavy pulse laser 1896 the power grid cpu and tracking are all half way between the two existing turrets there i think if built to around those specs the new pulse lasers would give a nice medium option between low fitting costdps and high dpsfitting costs just dont make them more powerfall then there counterparts from the blasterautocannon groups and you should be goodnote i used
while youre at it add a 3rd option for artillery too 4008001600mm for sml pleaseand for crying out loud increase the tempest powergrid alreadythanks in advance
i for one would like to see it balanced arounddread  anti capsuper capsupercarriercarrier  logistics and drone boatingtitan  completely repurposed including rebalance of doomsday into a station siege cannon
they just moved supercarriers from a more logistic focused role to an anti cap ship role
move it back slap them for being silly
capital smartbombs anyone
ooh and we should call it a doomsday device how awesome is that no

this
are you fing kidding me what a load of bs im sure itd be a huge additional bookkeeping load percentagewise not you dont sympathize with anyone itd be better not to post than to post this garbage it makes you look bad
blah nm
yep also on the ship fitting export panel how about select all and deselect all buttons in the browse window for ship fittings let us select multiple entries at one time both of these would make managing fittings a lot faster and easier
that would be great
ah i would prefer to see eafs be able to fit cloaks
maybe not decloak but make a ghost item on your overview you are the pilot of the eaf of where the cloaked ship was when you activated the module and the ghost would only last for a few seconds that you can try to approach to see if you can decloak it
a few points regarding the evelopedia articleand fricken long to repair if you kill one i dont really want my fitting down half of the timeone doomsday takes down one hictor you cant field as many 50m ships as the enemy can field 50b ones you deserve to lose imo this is not an issuenever the goal in itself why are there so many alliances holding sov then there is very little to be gained from owning an entire region that you cant get from a few systems yet alliances continue in their conquest if someone doesnt want to hold space there is some 2000 highsec systems availablei am against small gangs having too much say in sov warfare they have their purpose and that is disrupting the infrastructure killing ratters miners people movind through gates or undocking  that kind of stuff but i dont want to call upon alliance fleets to defend sovereignty every time some randoms decide to put a 20 man gang togetherdont take me wrong  i agree with all the other points in the proposal i have only quoted those i think need to be worked on more
my thoughts exactly
but to do that youd have to leave jitai smell shenanigans
ever tried doubleclicking any other window in eve i mean the actual window background not any active parts
pleasecan you link here the content of the nondisclosure agreement nda im interested to see what the csm can do or not if the nda is under an nda then csm cant do anything for usccp rules allyeay
csm cant publish internal ccp documents or discussions without prior agreement with ccp this is pretty much standard operating practice for any development companycsm can and do publish csm meetings except for sections covered by the aboveincorrect because csm are under nda we can discuss and get feedback on items which ccp dont wish to make public yet though this doesnt happen very oftenalso csm can and do raise player issues and get items into the eve backlog for future development which doesnt touch the nda at allcan you please pick one thread and stick to it instead of cross posting the same questions in different places
csm sorry to say but i will come back in 18 months to get the csm5 information feedbackenjoy your meeting pontifications but players except informationnot just reading you meeting planing agendaat least just the facts but i see nothing except that you will give them to ussounds like ccp thnen as ccp player will expect results in 18 mothsyeay
im slightly unsure what your complaint is here we publish our meeting discussions and we make available information from ccp when we get it providing they are not under ndawe have something in progress which will provide some additional information watch this space
helloim complaining about a clear answers a list of point where can see rapidly whats on the table between csm and ccp who hold the point and who needs to act in a list csm not publishing cause csm does not agree internally csm not publishing cause ccp does not allow to ccp does not answer you but engaged to do it why does it take so long just to have a clear view about dates who needs to act does the csm have answer of ccp which subject ccp does not give you dateanswers on for an issue where can i have a date of resolution where can i see a list state which point is under nda nda means no information from us please state them too i find some elements but please make a list link on the forum about the relevant wikipage may be a thread just for us to follow thank you for publishing the log but do you think we can follow you by reading a discussion we arent aware of the exact details just by the logs csm is too much a black box concerning whats on the table with ccp im sure you have the information but make it clearly on a page where we can go and clearly see whats on the table pleaseyeay
i dont have time to respond in detail but these two wiki categories are a good place to startissues raised by csm waiting responses from ccpcsm issues resolved by ccp  not 100 accurate because tracking of csm issues by ccp wont be in place till the next summit meeting in december csm publishes all meeting logs except sections where there is discussion of nda items this doesnt happen very often maybe 5 times in the last year also csm maintains the wiki what else are you expectingonly items under nda are not published most of this would come under ccps development schedules which are decided after considering all the issues raised by the eve stakeholders which the csm is one of csm can request information from ccp and frequently does see the other business sections of most meetings where status updates are discussedi cant tell you what items are under nda sorry all i can say there is very little under nda right now and one thing should be published this weekyes the exact details of issues under discussion are in the wiki and in the meeting logs the logs and voting results are public and the issues are on the wiki which links to the original assembly hall threads it is all thereincorrect all player issues raised by csm to ccp are clearly displayed on the wiki if you want to know the date when things are going to be resolved then i have to say that nobody not even ccp can say that for the majority of the issues
thank you
csmplease read this thread title and think about it if it would not be more useful act you can do for the players in the current state of the csm meetingsmay be you will do it and we will trust back in youpersonal point of view is that if you continue like that you are just as useful as ccp 18 monthsyeay
helloi like the energy you set in the csm postsbut seems to me now we are waiting information from you too and get nothing cause some dont accept a point on a list on your sidelooks good to do meeting but better do to less and get back informations to the playerscsm works can be good but without real feedback to the community eg the backlog thread the csm is just as ccp we post we wait and we waitsorry but its this situation you put yourself ini dont trust anymore the csm to get any relevant valueadded for players requestsforum can do the same if ccp read themyeay
thanks for the list if ccp would sticky this and if you would be kind enough to keep this list updated it could help cut down on the double topic crap in assembly halledit happy day oh happy day it got a sticky
supported so i dont have to bump 10 different threads per hour
i really think all these should eb addressed before next expansion
the underlying problem here is that while ah is a great place to discuss proposals and debate their validity it is a poor venue due to lack of features for being able to easily find vote up or down and assess the status of various proposals if a more appropriate tool were being used for managing proposals the desire for a stickied hot topics thread would probably not existbutsince we dont have such a tool such a stickied thread seems useful however a bunch of potential problems come to mind how committed is the op to keeping the original post updated as proposals are addressed by ccp or as the status of items on the list otherwise changes now sure but what about in a year two years keeping track of a proposals supportnonsupport ratio is a challengegiven that would have to be reviewed regularly to be sure of the actual support count you know how people express support but forget to click the support checkbox what happens if the ops account goes inactive for some reason all kinds of things happen in rl that take players away from the game if the op cant or no longer wants to log in to update the post then what that is why in other forums ccp staff tend to be the authors of the stickied nonstatic threadsthat way there is a guarantee of access to keep the thread updated who decides what is hot enough to go on the list everyone will believe their pet proposal is hot enough to be on the list and many will express annoyance at topics being included that dont relate to their interests or which they perceive as being pushed by a null sec voting block the selection of topics is a big can of worms  when do items lose the hot status such that they should be removed from the list supportsnonsupports can change a lot over timeespecially if something happens in game to affect the validity of an ah proposal who makes the decision to take an item off the hot listive got this thread bookmarked so i can watch it and will bring it up with the other csm members but i think there are too many potential problems to make a stickied hot topics thread advisable depending on responses from others i might be convinced otherwise
this is a temporary halfsolution mynxee it isnt perfect but it is better than the current system
mynxee  yes there are several problems that can occur as i am not a player and stuff can happenbut at least this is a good temp solution until something more permanent can be worked out as for what is on the list currently i tried to weigh out hot issues as ones that would affect eve as a whole rather than just a select minorityyes i will admit mothershps model size only affects a minority but anyone who has seen them test server or regular server will realize hey my battle ship is almost just as big so this one was more for a aesthetic feel for eve plus it was requested however i am willing to work with the csm to change the links and post which ones are hot and people should look at
a nice idea till we get hopefully better forumsanother possible way to handle this would be as a most frequently asked for wiki page with links to the issues here at least that way we could get it stickied while allowing players to edit as needed

i share your frustrations and goals but i have some problems with this how exactly could a typical player not a forum regular  find some of these topics im not arguing or criticizing but without keywords and such like i find free text search using evesearchgoogle has some limitations starting with the missing forum search from ccp  if searching historical forums were important and to be encouraged then why does not ccp provide itbtw i am not quite sure why there is a fi and a ah forum i also see a disconnect as to the feedback forum goals is this where paying customers provide feedback to a corporation ie if i write toyota that i do not think their cars should accelerate on their own i do not expect a response of what a noob  its already been suggested and it matters to mcdonalds whether 15 or 1500000 think their new sandwich tastes bad its not just the topics number of responders mattera lot of companies use nonemployee ie unpaid forum members to help police organize things in particular if there were a way a forum member could do a quick drop down and have a post moved to the suicideinsurance threadtopickeyword probably much more likely to be successful than training 350000 people to behave differently using forum software that has many opportunities for improvement this is not just ah it would be nice if a click could move the topics into the raven or tengu subforum  and in the redundant posters defense seeing their are 27000 evesearch entries for raven fit or 10000 for raven fitting does not put you that much closer to an answer for a common question  and how many posts about jump clones or mining could be answered with a single link but i strongly believe that if the choices are between changing fundamental human behavior or changing the forum software it would be easier to change the software to make it easier to coalesce the common questions and suggestionsi also think the new forums are very important going forward and the csm should push very strongly for their features in advance rather than letting ccp pull their usual ship it first and then respond with the well that is a limitation of our microoft tool or well polish this later and of course prevent the we do not support the androidiphoneipadfirefoxsafarichrome browser or we require flash or nyet or activexperhaps the process is someone csm forum maven did an official quarterly top 25 or 50 sticky not as some volunteer who may be unmotivated or unsubscribed in 3 months but a commitment to the process from ccpcsm i would mimic the qen and call it the qwn  quarterly whine newsletter but suggestion or feedback would be more politically correct way too much to hope for is a quarterly poll on the top 25  where people chose a few small med and large features because these days for nonlag features the question is not whether it is good but rather where it is good enough

i have decided to put eve down for a bit the length of time it takes to get decent pvp fights in eve is the main reason even after you do all the grinding for isk and buying and moving ships and mods you still dont have a way to find decent fights much faster than an hour of jumping around or waiting around for a fleet to form i cant commit that much time to a video game rvb was good but it was a bit too arranged fw should imo be the way for more casual players to find decent pvp fast i dont think an hour of down time is really fast others may disagree no im not giving away my stuff because im not quitting eve  its still the best video game ever i will likely check back from time to time to see if they do anything to improve this the suggestions in this thread would definitely dramatically improve the situation but there are other options
tldr but the 4th bonus on assault ships was resistances since you have to have a racial frigate skill to 5 to fly that races assault frigs meaning the bonus would always be the same and for other reasons i dont recall at one point ccp decided to quit listing it as a bonus in the description and just add the calculated amount to the ships base resists in the info windows second tabthe fourth bonus is still there just displayed differently now oh yesit lets you look up a ship in the market and see what the actual resists would be rather than having to either board it or eft quickfit it or get out your calculator
perhaps even an agility increase as well i think afs should be the most agile ship period
what about interceptors
1assault frigates the ships everyone only flies for fun because they dont properly fill any role certainly not well enough to justify their cost
speed  agilityintys should be the fastest ships yes but afs should be the best at making smooth 180 turns for dogfighting at close range i wouldnt mind if the 4th bonus was nearwebimmunity 75 reduction at level v
assault ships are supposed to be stronger more resilient versions of frigates interceptors are supposed to be faster more agile versions this is their role

having had to deal with this a few times i have my own opinions this should have never been a reality its risk is minimal oh god its targeting me dockdockdockdockdockdock with the reward being extremely high lol look at my 6k shield tank on my sleipnir yeah its that dumb trust me its a broken and abused mechanic that i am surprised ccp hasnt completely fixed if ccp didnt think it was even remotely broken they would not have bothered adding timers to rrers a year or so agoyes because there are absolutely no mercs operating in high sec for 00 alliances obviously sarcasmemopandafacethere was nothing more painful than getting a contract only to get countercontracted and have the biggest out of corp rr slugfest you have ever seenus ok guys they have 12 out of corp rrers do we still have our 5 out of corp guardians and 6 out of corp oineros on standbythem were undocking 15 more logis midfight lol glhfus fffffffffffffffffffffuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuthere is a lot of pvp that happens in highsec there would be even more fun pvp if ccp could find a way to fix mechanics like docking wars and out of corp rr even the large 00 alliances have to deal with potential high sec problems due to always being war decd by other alliancesmercs
of course you are going to say that it is the only way your alliance gets killsthere is an easier way than all this baloney to fix this broken mechanicrepping should not aggress the logistics pilot jumping through a gate is a valid tactic for us 00 pilots if it goes pear shapedto rep someone in the first place you have to be in the same fleet not in fleet no reps can be givenall members of that fleet acquire the same status as the war target once they join the fleet they are also war targetsproblem solved
supportedpersonally i think neutral repping should be there with a couple of difference from the current wayfirst off repping an agressed target should incurr an aggression timer andrepping an agressed target should incurr a one way personal wardec meaning that anyone in the opposing corp get a week where the repper is free game but the other corp is still as untouchable as beforewith this scenario neutral reppers would still occurr but after that they would not be safe flying around it should in effect work as a war dec meaning that during this time the opposing force can kill them as many times as they likeif the repper reps again during this personal wardec then the wardec is prolonged the personal wardec is not connected to the original so if the war ends the very next day the personal wardec is still in affect for a week

so i can now use the warfare link it would be nice if i could use the ship for pvp fleet boosting as opposed to just pvefix it already
not to necro a post but i just want to say i agree
what exactly would make this harm eve if anything it would help eve by creating a lower dropout rate of new players this means a larger population base over time which means a healthier mmo which means more development which means i could add an almost infinite amount of which means to this sentence this topic has been brought up numerous times throughout the years and getting rid of learning skills completely always has more benefits than disadvantagessupported

pi is garbage and everyone hates it except the noobs who make 400m a month with 5 days of training per toon and macroersnobody enjoys clicking on 1520 extractors on 5 different planet every 5 or 23 hours personally i think ccp is just testing their users how much painful bs will people do for ingame currency they already do this with missions to some extent but now theyve introduced another point onto their drudgerysalary scatterplot soon they will be able to launch more garbage features and predict how many people will damage their hands and strain their eyes for a given level of isk rewardthis next expansion is going to be even more awesome than the last

i have never posted on the forums in the 4 years ive played this gamei recently came back to it after a 6 month break this is the most perplexing change and step back i have ever seen of a fuctionality of the ui take this makes non sense why they would remove it on top of that i cant even find documentation stated by ccp why this was even a good idea besides the change over to eve gate bull its been what now 2 going on 3 months of this bstldrthis is is ing ed

in eve youre never truly safe unless docked in a station thats a core part of the game love it or hate it it adds some excitement to your dull carebear lives
no sane insurance company in the real world would insure any activeduty war machine and eve ships blow up far more often than their realworld counterparts therefore while it seems logical to say that ships destroyed by concord should not be covered by insurance policies eve insurance is completely illogical to begin with you might as well say remove all insurance from eve which i actually agree with but thats purely personal preferenceon a side note i am lulz at this classic carebear whine thread no matter how many years pass since ye olde days of stacked microwarpdrives carebears keep on making these threads

hi there spaceships friend could you if its not too much bother kindly add me to your list at your earliest convenienceop not supported although i wouldnt cry any tears for the removal of insurance for ships lost to concord but thats where my sympathy stops any restrictions on where people can and cannot attack if theyre willing to take the hit for it would be at odds with the core design of the game
problem so your corp alliance decides to move halfway across the universe for an opcampaignshenanigans  cool you load up your cangscfreight containerskiffs oh wait full of everything you will need and quickly take off in a shuttleibis7x plated abaddon for your final destination since there are not any of the logistics pilots online to move your stuff you perk up with joy as one of the logistics pilots with a orcafreighterjfcarrier logs on and is willing to move your stuff you attempt to setup a contract and get an error stating you have damaged crystalsmining crystals and you are now 59 jumps out from your original destination with everything in a cans you then rage logpunch your deskcry and contemplate life and why you cant have nice thingsin all seriousness though what is the reasoning behind the damaged crystals and not being able to contract them is it something that would take a lot of development changes to fixif its really that big of an issue can we at least get a warning telling us that we are putting damaged crystals in a container some of us have multiple freight containers worth of modulesitems that we need to move whenever we are going halfway across the galaxy this can get a little frustrating at times when that one little crystal we missed slips in between all the other ammo it usually leads into a hilarious ventts discussion but it still suckssolution allow contracts to be setup with damaged crystals or give a warning stating that you are putting damaged crystals into a can and it will divide by 0 if you attempt to contract it
i agree as a work around though you can set up a courier contract to whoever it is you want to move the stuff and the person can then accept it and break the container to get the stuff that way instead
making the dcu a passive module really benefits two groups of people 1 people who die because they forget to turn their dcu on and 2 people who like to autopilot through highsec with expensive stuff in their cargo holdi know itd be great for afk hauling in my orca with the huge structure on that thingsupported not sure itd make my life easier if it was passive but im not sure being easy is what eve is all aboutdont know enough about the drone mods to comment on those one way or the other
sounds good less server load less having to activate mods that behave just like passive ones anyway tbh thinking about it couldnt all hardeners be passive instead of making the server deal with thousands of mods cycling34 per ship x the blob and we all know how little tq likes things cycling just give the active hardeners an equivalent passive cap penaltymwd style i cant think of a ship i use with active hardeners that dont just get them activated after every session change and left running til the next one targeted modsguns smarties reps et al probes and prop mods are the only thing that really need player interaction imo if the only time you interact with something is when the game turns it off you restart it it doesnt really add anything to the experience other than lag no actual change in cap use or functionality therefore balance only 2 potential problems i see are overheating but frankly not having to wait for cycles to end to switch heat on and off would be welcomed by me and possibly some of the slightly higher cap use mods like drone controls which tend to be run in burstsduring combat in my experience rather than constantly from undocking like hardeners and dcs but i dont think them having a smaller cap usepenalty than currently would be game breaking end of the day theyre just another damage mod and none of the others use any cap in of themselveswaits for angry post about how this will break some niche ship but honestly if it reduces lag i can live with you having to refit adapt or die and all that
supportedwill also make high sec ganking a little more interesting
its actually pretty likely if theres a significant number of neuts on youliang
drone control unit needs to be passivedamage control unit could go either way but passive would be nice
if you disagree with dcu being passive because neuting a dcu into quiescence was essential for you getting a supercap kill perhaps you want to discourage ccp from fixing lag since so many nullsec fights depend on lag in order for one side or the other to get a free win just because the situation exists in the game and benefits you in some situations doesnt mean it was designed to be that waydcu was supposed to be a passive module the devs couldnt make it passive at the time due to limitations in the game engine the game engine has changed since then to allow it to be passive but the change was simply never madefor what its worth i think a dcu would work better as a rig with a drawback of 510 on pgcpucapedit while being excessively verbose i neglected to indicate my support for the idea at the focus of this discussion
supported
im going to have to disagree with this statementone issue that will arise for certain is the bonuses boniiwhatever that will occur from passive boosting skills such as armor and shield compensation you will essentially take an already extremely useful module and make it even that much more powerful this could get completely out of hand on ships with high resist bonusesbonii now before diminishing returns gets brought updiminishing returns they will eat dcs alive on purely passive tanked ships this could make them essentially useless for certain fits on the other hand
it should be pretty trivial to make sure those skills wont affect itchances a dc is deactivated by neuts are very small and most likely reactivated again immediatly by the pilot
without having a direct answer from ccpcsm about that it is actually a really bad idea to give a yay agreement towards this issueedit i think the idea is noble and is a great start but the solution put forward is not complete it really needs to be addressed whether armor andor shield compensation skills will have any effect on a passive dcu if they do not i would be in full support of passive dcus
i disagree with this personally i think your time can be spent on more important issues like dual monitor support or the creation of an assault class destroyerafter reading the other link i say bring it up at your next meeting to run a mass test on the test server if it can be shown that dcu produce noticable lag then ill vote yes to making it passive otherwise its still a no
while i support this i feel that there are more important issues that the csm should be dealing with
it would be nice to have it passive as ccp finally figured out how to implement module limitations on ships without using the stupid 99 cpu penalty workaround this shouldnt be hard to implement
damage controls and drone control units should be passive yes
very strongly supported
i cant think of a more important issue than fixing lag maybe i have different priorities remember thats the whole reason for this change reduce lag improving the tank of foolish people autopiloting orcas is an unfortunate side effect
hmm this just turned me from yeah make them passive to hmm it would be a big boost for any afk haulersno active hardeners can most definitely be neuted off unlike dcs and there are several ships i use that doesnt turn on the invul until its needed to save cap additionally passive mods cant be overheatedno that shouldnt be a problem active mods are also supposed to get a 3level bonus when they are not turned on so if that had to be the case an offline dc should already give 15 armor and 15 shield resist when turned offnot really considering how fast you will get back 1 unit of cap and even if you manage it it will be back on about a second later it may affect the chance of killing a super cap that tried saving itself by logging off but that is a separate issue that should be fixed some other way by either automatically turning off all hardeners when logging out or increased log off time for ships with extreme buffers or somethingthis should be a very easy tweak id be surprised if it took more then 15 minutes for a single programmer to make the change
while i would welcome my 250k ehp afk hauling orca structure tank ftw i still think the dcu should be active so you can neut it off
confirming that my dcu is neuted off quite often in pvp and its been when using a bc against two or three other opponents max not even with capital warfare not that id object to not having to worry about this but it has made a significant difference in the fights where it has occurred including one painful 1v1
i think people are underestimating how common it is for a dcu to be neuted off theres a couple of reasons the way your cap recharge works when its nailed to 0 youre getting way less capsecond than you do at your peak in practise getting that 1 cap back in any subcap ship often doesnt happen ive sure been in that situation quite a few times in a supercap i dont know but im sure its not inevitable with dozens of neuts properly staggered on you when dcu is neuted off i at least often dont notice immediately its not the kind of thing im expecting result is its definetely not going back on 1 second later more like 2030 seconds or never watch fraps back later  oh  my dcu was off that whole timeid rather see the code fixed and optimised so it can handle the game asdesigned before dumbing down gameplay in the name of lag that said this is a very minor aspect of gameplay if it turns out it helps significantly then thats probably a sign of a deeper performanc issue but nor is it exactly going to ruin gameplay to make em passivethe other thing it would help mitigate is people dying while blackscreened on jumplogin before they can activate dcuhardeners but again id rather see those cases reimbursed properly in the interim until blackscreening is 100 fixedany dumbing down to fix lag that approaches anything like thisneeds to be avoided
could they also fix this by somehow groupingsynchronizingbatching module cycleswhat about letting us group more kinds of modules sensor boosters invulns hardeners reppers or even grouping different kinds of modules into units different kinds of hardeners hardeners and reppers invuln  damage control or whateversurely you can do some sort of optimizations to reduce the backandforth and calculations when dealing with grouped modules if that comes at the expense of some granularity so be itthis would have the advantage of making the ui better bonus points if you figure out a way to make the overheating interface not terrible while youre at italso this would be way more fruitful than taking a couple of kinds of modules and making them passive granted dcu is on almost every ship in a fleet fight if you could reduce the effective number of active modules to 3 or 4 per ship guns grouped a tank group propulsion module and theoretically an active tank group but nobody uses those in fleet fights anyways i think thatd be more effective and would yknow make the game better while you were at it
modules with identical cycle times tend to selfsyncronise over time already i guess its just a quirk of the system but it could perhaps be taken advantage of
i like to think of the primae as more of a collectors itembut it should be a useful one supported for the sake of actually having a reason for people to use it

they could do it with klingon academy in 1997 because they had full control of how many ships would be on screen at any given time therefore needing 2d billboard effects lag in large scale scale fleet fights is not just a network problem  try fighting in even a 40v40 fleet and see how the lag goes with brackets a 2d client side effect and missileturret effects oni dont see this as with any eye candy really adding much to the deep game content so not really worth much in the way of dev time

transparency in whatwhat is there to be transparent intheir epic failure in the inability to convince ccp to fix there damn product before they release new productthe only party that needs to be transparent is ccp not the csm
i believe hes referring to the latest two csm meetings wherein the issue of whether to release the results of the ccp release planning ie the meeting where ccp decided which if any of the csm proposals to implement for the next expansionapparently this meeting went so badly that several csm members objected to the publication of the list of granted and rejected feature requests and voted to never release it csm members were so embarassed by ccps apparent wholesale rejection of feature requests that several of them voted to tell us nothing about it also how did korvins answer to a yesno question manage to contain an nda violation weirdfrom
even if this proposal gets over 9000 thumbs up csm will never release anything that shows how useless they they will continue to act like the csm is helping so they can keep getting free subscriptions and free trips to iceland
ive been trying to work out what this guy was complaining about as far as the planning meeting outcomes that is ccps information and we couldnt pass it on till we had agreement from them once we had permission to make it public we well most of us wanted to roll it into a csm publication already in progress it is due to be released this week but feel free to jump on the csm hate bandwagon i think there is a little more space left incorrect the vote to release the list as part of the in progress publication passed and the list will be public this weekkorvin made direct reference to something due to be made public this week that ccp expressly told us they didnt want leaked till thenif youd followed the argument in the previous two meetings youd note that the reason some csm were not willing to push the list as part of this publication is that they felt it wasnt a good enough response from ccp they wanted ccp to put out the list instead of it going out with a csm stamp of approval at no point was it going to be permanently suppressed from the playersyou back up my point above the inclusion of the list in the publication later this week passed mynxee had the controlling vote and passed ita bit further along in the minutes youll note the 8 votes agreeing to release the publication this week watch this space
the final edit of the csm blog was sent to ccp yesterday monday4 sections 2500 words but alas no blue graphs
trebor daehdoowthank you for your workdear other csm members voting no reading this i can just say you hide information to players information that isnt under nda from ccp you know about something we want to know about you were elected to be the information point between ccp and the community please have a look in your mandateyeay
calling it like i saw it spare me the martyrdomyes it passed on a tie vote several people at the last meeting and this one voted against it i didnt say the vote failed less pedantry please if you talked down to people less you might find yourself more infrequently the target of hate bandwagons this wasnt clear from the chatlogs the only discussion i saw on the issue was meissa saying no thisll make us look bad and someone else saying hey maybe we should push back more against ccp first at the previous meeting i didnt see anyone say no we should make ccp release it themselves on what kind of timetable when the patch notes hit for the new expansionanyways yes we did ascertain that the vote passed were not illiterate were annoyed that several people voted against releasing the minutes if the alternative was ccp will release them in their own dev blog on the same timetable then that was not made clear but i dont think anyone made such a representation the only discussion i saw of the issue was people whining about how it might make them look bad and then it barely passed on a tie voteif you cant stand the heat get out of the kitchen and keep your self pity to yourselves
quite right i misinterpreted your post a bit and should have been a less defensive in my replythats what i get for quickly replying before work
im not talking about the overall quality of the posting i mean the forums themselves and the software that runs itwhy does it never remember whether or not i want to see signatures and images why does it never remember my default posting characterwhy does that search box to the right suck so badly and search the entire website instead of the forums why do i have to go to evesearchcom to search these forums someone else has to build another website to search the forumswhy do they not have an automated dev finder instead every week or so some intern posts the blue posts in their dev finder section with datetime stamps that reflect when the intern posts the link instead of when the dev actually made the post could no one at ccp think of a stupider way to aggregate blue posts let alone the inability to send private messages or integrate with evegateingame mailthese forums basically appear to have come from some angelfire page circa 1997 take your php twits away from spacebook and have them bring this  into the current century please

the issue with this is the ability for the vargur to use long range adaptations as it stands the other marauders can use both a long range and short range weapons system without sacrificing slots to adapt to a long range fix eg using power grid mods to increase the power gridfor the varger to use a long range fit tech 2 fitted you must use ancillary current router and reactor control units to make the long range fitting workso my proposal is increase the vargurs power grid to a base of 9000 this will allow the use of long range wo having to sacrifice other fittings to keep in line with long range fits of other maraudersopinion i mean come on you have to put on rigs and reactor controls to put some 1400s on the thing where as on a paladin you can slap on 4 tachyons and run off and play also i know its a ac boat for teh most part but it would be nice to have the option available
the vargur is already one of the best and most flexible marauders due to its ammo versatility and it has excellent range even with short range weapons there is no reason to buff it apart from that many ships have trouble fitting the largest possible guns of their class unless they fit rigs or modules to make it possible the vargur is not at any disadvantage here
why are you trying to put 1400 on the vargurit has a 10 falloff bonus for a reason with some range mods the autocannons can have a falloff of 80 km which gives you the ability to hit targets at 40 kms with the majority of dps and the autocannons can also track cruisersized targets orbiting at 2030km the majority of lvl4 missions contains bs that orbits at 3050km and cruisers orbiting at 2030km and the vargur can deal very good damage to them all so it does its job of a ac lvl4 mission runner very well putting arties on it and you actually decrease your efficiency as arty has less dps and youll have to rely on drones to take out the orbiting cruisers if you want a highend pvp sniping boat try the mach
oh right because that stasis webbing bonus on the kronos is so useful
have fun hitting angel ships without it especially with rails
have fun using rails period bleh
well  thats the other issue i would rather bring a golem with torps and ab than a kronos speed tanking golem is fun to fly though blaster kronos can be fun in angel missions or damsel
who ever said the vargur was to just be used for missions i think people seem offended that a marauder can be used outside of pve i think op wants some sort of pvp option on it using arts which i am all for i made an art vargur on the test server for lulz got some omgwtfbbq resultsoh and inb4 all the carebears that say marauders are only good for pve seriously set it up right and you have a beastly pvp gank ship with them
and the only really viable option for pvp in a marauder is small gang for fleet battle what normally happens is this not to mention it was fail fitso lets assume you want to make your vargur a sniper who cares about tank then dmg mods some mods for speedagility some fitting mods a bit shield buffer similar to the maelstromtempest but iirc the alpha from the vargur isnt really impressive compared to the tech 1 minmatar battleshipsand for the 800mm ac small gang fit you have no issues at all fitting the shipso your argument falls pretty short
not to mention that if one ecm ship sneezes next to a marauder it loses lock
ive been playing eve for some time now and one thing ive noticed is standings take even longer to draw back than sec status and are even longer to go up than skills what i propose is though is something like the remap feature for attributes but for skillsbut instead of being able to change the standings youd reset them all of them the good and the bad meaning you could enter any empire again but would lose the ability for your jump clone creation at the same timethis would be only available once a year like a remap and may or may not include a sec status reset and lp removal tooi thought of this as new players tend to be thrown in at the deep end with everything to learn about skills and fits and earning isk its not often people learn about the standings and how they can be of benefit or can hinder your ability to play
bloodstained stars aka a way to dramatically improve your standings with a faction that even a new player can accomplish there are skills that help as well just need to get your effective standings to 0 to run some factionspecific epic missions anyway add to that agents that you can turn in tags for standing with and i really dont see what the problem is it is pretty easy to improve standings
there is a reason some people put in so much effort to balance their standings choices and consequences working as intended

so as any of you who have misdouble clicked on a structure in pi have no doubt figured out if you double click on the planets surface it takes you directly to your command center  do not pass go do not collect 200 iskthis isnt really that annoying  unless of course you are managing a dozen extractors on the opposite side of the planet from your command center which results in you having to waste time spinning the planet around into the proper position again only to have it do it again when the cat decides to bump your mouse mid click cue the jeopardy theme while i look for my extractors for the secondmake that third timemy proposal is actually pretty simple and consists of two options either of which provides a solution to the annoyanceoption 1 turn off the double click and make the go to command center an option on the planets right click menu if its not there already  honestly i never look at my command centers so i dont know if its there or notoption 2 leave the double click as is and add the ability to right click on the planets surface and get a go to menu that would group your buildings by categories and then by name so i could right click choose go to starports fed897 and have it swivel the planet around to that particular location on the surface it might be nice if we could name our planetary structures but im not holding my breaththanks
forget all thathow aboutrightclick command center  reschedule all extractors  select cycle  submitinstead of having to click click click click click click click and click some more
i am definitely not opposed to that as an alternative solution it solves my problem by default
i am one of those players that left after six months actually 3 i have to say though that war decs were thoroughly enjoyable and one of the better experiences i had simply learning to survive was fun the real problem with 36 month players leaving is that you gain a great understanding of the game after three months but realize it will take nearly 2 years to become a valuable asset to any serious corp thats why people leave why should i spend nearly 21 months being useless when i can play another gameediti only came back because im so drawn to the theory and excitement and economic realism of the game through the news of the community and am willing to put some time into the game to get this satisfaction however most players are not going to come back or keep up with the newscommunity of a game that they abandoned
ccp is hoping youd spend real money sell plex and buy an old char

my corp moved to nullsec when i was a one month old character and it was the best thing to ever happen to methe concept that it takes two years to be useful is just plain wrong ive only just hit one year now and flying hacs and recons for two races t1 frigs and cruisers help in any engagement  sure you may not be as useful as those in t2 frigs and cruisers but every bit of support helps and theres more to being useful than pvp  newer players can scout for freighters or cyno capitals or any number of useful thingsperhaps its perceptions that need to be changed cause i sure saw the value i could get and provide to a 00 corpalliance very quicklyback to the main topic from my perspective having spent most of my time in the game in 00 wardecs are just an extension of 00 into empire in limited amounts i see it as a mechanism for 00 entities to cancel out any safe haven for those who attack their space but one that can be used by people to get cheap killsquite frankly empire griefers are pansies often called bullies who like being able to get the upper hand whether they warrant it or not if you want pvp action go to low00 instead of wardeccing if you have a purpose for being able to attack people in empire then fine kb stats puffed up with noob kills are pretty much worthlessso i see limiting the ability to wardec random noobs as a good thing exactly how to do that however is the sticking point
i would support fixing that so that you do not loose cap but this quote from the op means i cant support this thread despite that
i think that is in reference to how characters usually sit in super caps and they cant dock so you always logout in the ship if you log out go to bed go to work come back home log back in and your cap is lower than when you logged off something is wrong it should cap back up i wouldnt worry about caps recharging with the exception of a jump freighter inside the 30 sec invuln time it might be possible for some but the fits to do such a thing would be ridiculousi just eftd it a chimera with a full rack of t2 cap rechargers and a full rack of cap power relays and all lvl5 skills still would take 35 minutes to recharge the cap from dead so even that would take around a minute to go from a jump to being ready to jump again t2 cccs get it to 1m45s so that would possibly be able to accomplish this feat again ridiculous fitting

supportedim not suggesting the new players have their hand held for them but this game is quite complex and overwhelming for a beginner so tweaks here would alleviate this and hopefull keep hold of more of the players who come to give this game a go

you have not provided any indication of why sovereignty in wspace would be necessary or at the very least not gamebreakingnullsec is highly connected sovereignty is required in order to prevent certain things from happening such as cynoing in fleets of capital ships since you cannot jump into wspace systems there is no need for cyno jammers cyno beacons or jump bridges thus there is no need for sovereignty to defend from hostile fleetssleeper wrecks are already more valuable than kspace npc wrecks the process for getting more of them is explorationheavy wspace is about exploration in dangerous space the process for getting more kspace npc wrecks involves having more people in pewpew ships in your sovereign space nullsec is about feet on the ground so the kspace npc system along with the ihub upgrades works well for kspaceyou have the tools to prevent roaming gangs of caps landing in your lap in fact you have better tools than most people in nullsec since you have the ability to shut down any entrance the invaders might findif you want more than wspace offers go where the experience you want is on offer if you want to claim sovereignty and have your alliance name in orange up in the top left corner of the screen head out to nullsecif you have problems with big fleets invading your space now what makes you think that having sovereignty will make things any easier for you

so i am a fairly new player to eve online i have been active for approximately 5 months now i have found the gameplay to be engaging and the level of player interaction to be far beyond that of any game out there even world of warcraft cannot compete with the amount of player based interaction however with all of these accolades behind them and so much emphasis on a system where players become the good or bad guys and run the economy how could ccp leave out what is possibly the most powerful player tool available what tool could that be player generated mods wow allows players to create mods for huds and much more ccp should allow us as players to at least create simple hud mods so we can customize our displays i understand the need for security in eve and how modding could jeopardize that but with strict rules and players supporting these rules mods could help fill in some what may be missing or could allow us to streamline our displays and make our gameplay more efficient in short the pros of allowing player created mods far outweight the cons security risks can be mitigated by players being involved and ever vigilant for those who are abusing the ability to create mods and last gamers would have one more element of control in new eden and isnt that what eve is about player control and interaction on an unheard of scale
you clearly dont understand eve or ccp yet from the 5 months youve been playing

yeah i deffinately didnt make a comparison i made a refference there is a big difference between the two in a comparison i would have linked similarities between the two games seeing as how i never linked any similarities i only made a refference to a dynamic and active part of their player base and said that it would be a great tool for this game what would make you think that you have any sense of understanding now a comparison would be me comparing your childish and immature response to that of a typical wower see what i did there that was a comparison as for you other guys mods dont change the game only the visuals and interface in the computer that the mod is downloaded on so new players wouldnt have to use mods until they personally felt they were ready and when more experienced ppl used them it wouldnt give them any real advantage over newbs or miners and yes i do understand eve and ccp because if i didnt would i have made a proposal in this forum

thank youmay i please ask a csm confirmation about the vote point stated in this post i think its best to link it with the meeting pointstrange csm positionwhen do you release us something  fix date possible yeay
quite the name you have there
wouldnt it make more sense to have this kind of vote before making the effort to gather and process the informationit looks like half of the csm are completely against releasing the list in any shape or formi find that quite confusingi understand that the csm is a group of individuals and thus have individual opinions but starting the list really created some expectations and now seeing this rather large reluctance to publish the result is disappointing for mea more consistent approach would be an improvement imo
the disagreement regarding publication of the list began after it had been draftedwhile the csm is full wonderful people with exceptional skills none of us alas is gifted with precognitionmy own superpower for example is the unerring ability to drive straight to the best currently available parking space unfortunately i have not yet figured out how i can use this power to fight crime
trebor daehdoowthank you for your workmay be the no people that dont want the csm to communicate with the players that voted can tell us why sounds csm was the player representativedo the csm turn own member political cheersyeay
are you saying the list is now something quite unexpectedhow does it deviate from the expected result or the result everyone thought would be good to publishim sure you will get thereone good idea would be to teach that to your local law enforcement and help them reach the crime site earlier because of vehicular locomotion and less stressed because of nearly effortless parking
i was against releasing the blog after meeting 007 because i thought another week was needed for it to be excellent we have to lead ccp by example  the inclusion of the list of ccp selected items from our raised issues was something i was happy with but some of the csm didnt want in their opinion to be the bearer of bad news ill leave you to make up your minds on the outcome once the list is out personally i feel good progress has been made since the summitjust to state clearly the argument was never between publishing the list or not it was purely between csm including the list in the blog already being worked on or ccp publishing it themselvesin the end csm decided to include the list in the blog which is due out sometime this week
your pedantry is to me as kryptonite is to superman alas
im intending to run for csm next term and im gathering a little information for my campaign if youd take the time to answer these five questions id appreciate it1 what is the biggest problem you experience in daytoday life in eve why2 what was your favourite eve expansion why3 what should the primary purpose of an expansion be why4 if ccp released expansions less frequently would it bother you why5 have you or your corporation ever been significantly impacted by an expansion either positively or negatively howthank you for your time
finding the time to undock but that comes with the ceo job it would seem the amount of clicking that pi needs as well as eves ui just being in need of an overhaul would be a more serious answerapocrypha for the skill queue and wormholes closely followed by dominion for its pirate epic arcs and igb fixes i believe apocrypha was also the one with a ton of bugfixes so that really takes the lead we could use another round of thosea good mix of new content and  or overhauls of old systems like sov in dominion but also the improvement of existing features and bugfixesyes if more time is needed id rather see miniexpansions like two or three releases where each time one expansion feature is rolled outi cant really recall anything negative weve always embraced new features and made them work for us one way or anothergood luck on running for csm im curious to see what your campaign will be
1 the capacity to solodual roam or lack thereof 2 apocrwhatsit because wormholes were fun3 expansions would be designed to add features to the game while all patched between the expansions should focus heavily on bug fixescontent fixes4 not too badly5 wormholes yeah that was probably the most significant effect any expac has had on my corpthank you for your time
1 living in 00 i have to say that people have just began to use supercaps as win buttons2 dominion 3 an expansion should add new and fun content to the game while improving the existing content4 if an expansion a year meant more teams dedicated to overhaulingrenovating aging functionality and content then i would fully support this 5 no i cant thing of one
other players did say revelations part 1 it gave us probes replaced the old escrow system with contracts tier 2 battlecruiserstech 2 invention as opposed to the lottery rigs and the current gangfleet system and skill bonusesi think they should be an even mix of new stuff and improved old stuff the latter is important but without the former people inevitably get bored i dont think bother is the right word id be a little disappointed because i think one of the things that keeps the game vibrant and alive is the two expansions per year schedule big megaexpansions are nice but a year is a long time to waitgoing back to revelations 1 again  its all about the invention ive never even seen a tech 2 bpo but i make a very healthy living off selling tech 2 modules because i can build them anyway as a roleplayer i also found that empyrean age had a big effect too but not as pronounced i dont think ive ever been negatively affected by any expansion
1 a lack of lownullsec pvp that doesnt involve getting dropped on by at least a nyx this should not be supercaps online2 apocrypha wormholes rock3 making eve a better game that may involve releasing new content or improving old content but the end result is to make eve better4 it would bother me if the expansions held the same level of contentimprovements as before but if the expansions increased in quality as they increased in rarity that would be fine by me5 dominion really made eve go back to suckville the sovereignty changes utterly failed and of course the lag which had been rather nicely reduced by apocrypha mysteriously found its way back into the game i used to look forward to being part of a nullsec empire now the idea just sorta makes me want to crysome thoughts and ideas on sov changestcus should be automatically onlined no more ninjasov holding with offlined tcus classic example of a good idea with idiotic implementation by ccp definitely ruining things for small alliances rather than helping them also make sov bills scale with the size of the empire being controlled and make tcusihubs cheaper so smaller alliances can afford themgravimetric upgrades and anomaly upgrades need rebalancingadjusting things should not be a choice between mining spodumain and running sanctums in the same system 247alliances need to have some kind of delayvote before being disbanded its quite possibly the stupidest reasoning ever to allow them to be instantly disbanded while kicking a single corp member can take upwards of 24 hours it is a sad commentary on ccps alliance design that 94 of all alliance disintegrations are caused at the click of a single button rather than through actual combat it is even sadder when they use this as a marketing ployalliances need to have reasons to fight each other besides boredom and epeen stroking scarcer abc ores and changes in anomaly spawning come to mind capital ships supercaps and titans need to have the logoffskying survival tactic fixedoutposts should be destroyable they are the one playerconstructed thing in eve that is not that is stupidthats all that i can think of off the top of my head right now kudoes to ccp for changing the titan aoe doomsday to a focused beam sometimes theyre bound to get something right even if its by accident

this logic doesnt make any sense this is like saying we shouldnt allow more than 1 pos per system because destroying them all could take time stations dont need to be conquered to conquer a system regardless the fact is if more stations exist in a system the system is worth more and should take more time to conquerid like to reiterate my point that arbitrarily limiting nulsec system counts to 0 doesnt make sense
or only one of these stations would be tied to sov as designated by the sov holders you would of course be unable to change the station once sbus have been anchored would need a way to flag it on the system view though so the attacker knew which was tied to sovsupporting the  out of this
sounds like a good idea as long as only 1 can affect sov and it has a big sign saying this station controls sov for this system painted on it somewhere all can see it
if only one was tied to sov i would agreed the problem i had raised the last time this was proposed was that dumping 10 stations each tied to sov into one system could make that system an impenetrable fortress
not supporting until ccp allows destruction of said outposts to be possibleits bad enough that they can never be removed but allowing them to exponentially increase is just not a good idea in my bookdont get me wrong im all in favor of such an idea due to the obvious fact there are multiple stations in various high sec systems throughout the clusterbut theres gotta be a balancing mechanism here

without reading anything at all that was posted above mei am in favor of removing insurance reimbursement for any engagement involving concord officials also we want prostitutes to start dropping again they cant all be exotic dancers
firstly two points1 when you log in you consent to the eula you do not consent to pvp or indeed any other specific activity of which there are many the you consent to pvp by playing the game is a fabricated excuse there are some reasonable expectations you should bring into the game but nothing so specific anyway in my experience criminals run away screaming from people who explicitely consent to fighting them pvp2 ccp does not in fact support griefing under any guise and does not intend the game to be used as such see here for exampleit amuses me that many use the justification of its only a game for griefing behaviour it appears in fact to be for precisely this reason that ccp regards it as unacceptable it also amuses me that many say they grief as a form of protest against the existance of high security space and the people who hide behind it as a minimalrisk mechanic whilst themselves hiding behind the minimal risk mechanic of insurance to effectively pay for their habitok on the subjects the op raised i do think it ridiculous that concord effectively subsidises criminal activity whether done for ingame reasons or griefing i dont think that people who suicide gank purely for ingame profit should be prevented from such activities though they are the bandits of eve scum but characterful scum and who wants to live in a fascist utopia anyway i also think it wrong that people who make a genuine mistake particularly new players and get concorded should be denied insurance indeed this has been stated by ccp as exactly the reason they havent already changed insurance to reflect this in itself presenting another firm line against the legitimacy of pure griefingone solution to this dilemma could be to say you have a 3 strikes and youre out policy on concord insurance per account important that it be so rather than per character if antigriefing is indeed the goal yes it is still possible to work around but more difficult and less worth the effort probably not possible on per account basis though due to codingotoh it does impact against forprofit suicide gankers who ccp evidently regard as legitimate users of game mechanics me too but that doesnt matter whilst this can be reduced by sticking to genuinly profitable targets as they should be anyway for thieving professions one might consider a mechanic such as slightly more generous cargo drops for criminal kills within hisec only easily justified as a bandit taking extra care to minimise cargo loss as opposed to the more hectic and hostile enviroments of losecnullsec where they wouldnt have the chance to take so much care note that this mechanic should only be given if it is to balance out a mechanic against it not as an excuse to just make a more profitable sideline for griefingi also dont support the argument that concord should safeguard wrecks as above i dont see genuine banditry as a practice to be stamped outhowever the elephant in the room is for any of this to all be truly effective there needs to be an improvement of losec as an enviroment nullsec needs some polishing too thatll not only more obviously seperate out the pathetic little scumbag griefers wholl continue to hide in hisec whilst whining about it from the big manly pirates who took to griefing because losec sucks worse and will rush back for some proper pvp itll enrich the game experience as a whole and better yet tempt a few of the good citizen hisec players out of their reasonably safe home to indulge in some righteous carnage too

after 2 years of pvping ive never ever had it happen to meif i notice im under the kind of extreme neuting that would be required to turn it off id sure as hell be watching my mods carefully just like any half decent pvper wouldfor the rest of your post it wouldnt be dumbing down anything  you dont need a very high iq to be able to activate a module that there are no disadvantages with it would simply be improving the ui and making it smoother thinking more about it ill support this despite the afk dc orcas that made me hesitate earlier since it wouldnt really be boosting them  it would simply mean that wed return it to what it was supposed to be from the start but couldnt be due to technical restraints
supportedif your fleets ability to take down a capital or any other target hinges on being able to neut off this one module i think you need to reevaluate your attack strategy
this is a much bigger concern than supercap kills afk hauling means the dcu is of no use to you if dcu are completely passive it will nerf suicide ganking
this was the first thing who come to my mind when reading the propositioneither way ill support this thread because i think ccp are enought smart to think about it too
i am in support of this because i honestly think it will help the uiand the ui could use all the help it could possibly get at this point
why would the resistance calculations be any different to what they are nowthis proposal is about making the damage control unit and drone control unit not require capacitor and thus need to be turned on in order to functionnothing else will change except that the module will no longer require cap to be activated
supported anything that lowers the number of unnecessary clicks gets my support there is no reason for a dcu to be activei cant really think of any other modules i wish we could say sensor boosters but those need to be able to be neuted i am just lazy 
i am not sure that making this module passive is a good idearthey are already pretty much a must fit on many setupsmaybe if the mod also introduced a hard cap limit or a percentage recharge reduction or perhaps if it increased doubled neutnos damagei like the idea of having it as a rig instead of a moduleas for passive hauling might even be interesting to force someone to choose between a cargo extender a dcu or maneuverability enhancementsbut i think what irks me most that it is a suggested change only to reduce lag not because people thought it ought to be a passive mod to begin withits basically the same as suggesting removing halve the weapon slots from all ships and doubling the damage output from each weapon with some added fitting changes for the ships or the weapons or basicallly removing seperate hit and damage calculations from grouped weaponssure it would reduce lag but would it enhance eve
first of all thanks for the intelligent discussion of the topic this is exactly the kind of feedback ccp needs and ccp veritas has said hes monitoring this threadone item that i have found particularly interesting if it turns out that this change would not significantly reduce server load there may be an argument for a game improvement that automatically restarts modules like dcus and hardeners after decloaking from a manual jumpplease keep the comments coming
1 for change to passive imo it just adds unnecessary chores to flying aroundas if youd ever want it turned off
that would be an idea which i could support unprojected modules remembering their activity state
yes restarting the hardener modules after jump is tedious
have fun killing a 60million ehp ship in a cyno jammed system if you do not neut off its dcu and hardeners they can just log off and will disappear after 15 minutes unless you bring more than 250 dps battleships by bringing a neut on every battleship the number is cut down to 80100 instead i think thats good enough reason to not have it be a passive modulethis i can support
to those making the argument that a dcu is easy to shut off i have been on the receiving and giving end of a curse neuting a ceptor it most definitely bottoms out the cap in a ceptor whether it is a heavy neut curse or a curse with a pile of mediums it instantly empties the cap in a ceptor despite that a ceptor is still able to get enough cap to initiate warp within the cycle time of the neuts that cycle time is less than 30 seconds so no if a dcu gets shut off there are either so many ships against the dcu ship that hes dead anyway or the neut ship just gets really really luckyi dont think that is a valid argument
good sir have you read my post at alledit to put things into perspective neuting off an aeons dcu lowers its ehp from 28mil with all hardeners neuted off already to 23mil thats 5mil less ehp and if you have 50 battleships neuting it its going to go down in a couple cycles
yup someone had posted a solution to that one that should already exist ccp is aware that people log out in super caps to avoid dying the solution was if you log your modules no longer impact the ship i think this is what happens when you eject anyway and a logoffski is basically the same kind of thing ie bailingive never been involved in a successful titan takedown so i have to claim ignorance when it comes to that topic but if making dcus passive can shave off some noticeable server load in all cases im willing to see more titans slip through my fingers youre also talking about a remote situation after all not only is a titan tackled but you only have enough firepower to take it out with the dcu off before it disappears that is an exceedingly rare occurrence
bagehi when you log off the first time all your modules keep running when you try to log in again and log off again  then they turn offatleast from my experience

p a good neuter can turn off even the dc sure its annoying to turn it on  but i can see an advantage in being able to turn it off from the shooters side

propose a concord frig that shows up instantly after a highsec ganking victim pops and shoots the wreck preventing it from being looted while doing nothing elsethere are too many riskaverting gankerwannabes hanging in highsec whose only motivation is looking for payoffs its just another form of carebearing but with huge payoffs minus work expensive wreck popping would restore suicide ganking to its original intent of lulz while purging the shameless iskfarming dont like someones boat gank it you get lol km and tears since its a total loss and victim cannot recover mods you do not get easy iskfarm concord providing consequences not protection
please dont drink and postmakes you look really foolishepic thumbs downironic id actually support suicide ganking but this proposal is full of fail
pretty much what drake said
or you can make it so nothing drops similar to self destructchecked background safe to dismiss those as suicider alts
gesundheit blackbird but seriously i think that a ships ability to fit 1 or 2 viable setups with only one type of weapon should hardly mean that it should not be allowed to fit others marauders should be versatile how freaking long does it take to train thema marauder is hugely expensive relatively and essentially an endgame mission ship it really should have the powergrid necessary to fit any projectile or even hybrid i dont judge i do lol however weapons systemtldr a marauder is supposed to be the ultimate mission ship after working so hard to get one it should have the flexibility to fit both weapons systems long and short range
i too want 1400s on my vargurs not even gonna train marauders skill until its grid gets buffed even though i have all prereqsedit speaking of vargurs its t1 version also needs some kind of buff incidentally id prefer a grid buff over anything else
it is a damn fine ac boat you miss a lot of fun tbh
i know but i really like alpha p
imo the ramifications of this are pretty limited allows fitting artillery ok have fun with that allows fitting acs  utility highs neuts in pvp ok thats also fine no reason for people not to risk vargurs in pvp shrugliang
even with connections social and diplomacy all at v you cannot get good standings accross the board with empire factions ccp has told me themselves and even with diplomacy v a mistake as a new character or even a choice in the past could lead you to be 6 to a empire faction choice and consequence is all well and good but not when people change their mind  and people do it alot  and then have to live with that choice in a game even if it means they no longer enjoy the game i think not especially as the only way to get those standings up then would be to have another playercharacter mission and share standings with a corpagent so you could mission in low sec where concordpolice wouldnt get involved and you could spend weeks clawing your standings back if not moremissioning for many isnt so much fun as it is merely a way to earn some isk not everyone buys  sells plexs not everyone wants to sit there watching a ship mine or dare i say it as there are some that do use bots to mine withthe whole idea behind a remap for attributes was so that you could train faster in a certain area draw back being slower in other areas but it meant you could have more fun because the skills you wanted would train faster this feature would be no different it would be fair to all as everyone would have the choice to use it or notepic arcs  cosmos missions are intended to increase already positive standings rather than 0 or negative standings as always though im fully aware that some will back this while others will sit there and pick holes in others suggestions instead of making their own so feel free to continue to do so
even easier run mission and bookmark all of the pockets turn in mission come back salvage to your hearts content
tldr win for pi
it is a game for me but in game it is in fact work to my character if i had a cent for everytime someone said that
so far i agree you should not log back in with less cap then you had when you logged out unless someone somehow managed to neut you in the time between your log off and your ships removal from the gamethis is the part i disagree with it should not cap up it should stay the same if you log out with 2875 cap what youd have after making a jump starting with max cap you should log back in with 2875 cap no more and no lessthe invul time is actually a minute i have tested it multiple times trying to lock a capital that i just lit a cyno for after its 30 second session change has expired that is not really what im worried about though and if you manage to create a fit that can do it then you dont need to log out at all i wouldnt even have a problem with it since youd have to give up everything else you could have fitted in your lows mids and rig slots what i dont want to happen is caps being able to jump somewhere log off before their invulnerability timer ends in order to make sure noone can aggro them causing a 15 minute timer and then waiting for however long it takes your cap to recharge before logging back in again and jumping out as soon as you exit warp if that is made possible supercapitals using it would be impossible to kill since there is no time to kill them after they jump in before they log out and once they log in it will take most more then 60 seconds original session change after logging in30 seconds for joining fleet session change to align for warp to where they were before they logged and then actually warp there meaning that if the cyno is lit before the ship actually lands where it logged out it will be ready to jump the second it lands before anything even gets to start locking as a side point if you find those 60 seconds to be too much it could even be reduced to 30 seconds since the char forming a fleet will be put in it immediately regardless of if he already had a session change in progress or not

what would you like to see change yeayif youre upset that there are minimal details surrounding ankhs removal from csm due to ccps statement im afraid you wont get the answer youre looking for
as trebor pointed out in the thread we sent it to ccp on monday from there on publication is out of our hands so we cant give you a fixed date
dont know if this has been raised yet but so winter expansion will be focused on polishing then we will have incarna  dust then repolishing 
honestly most of the fixes that made that list are things that people have been waiting for more than a year to see i dont think theyll be outrage at this point that something isnt included as someone had said in the minutes not everything makes it to release i will admit that if csm publishes a list then something from the list doesnt show up in the release rational or not i will be disappointed
which is pretty much the point of it all getting ccp to deliver results since they sign off on things putting it out there constantly makes them work for it we all know how it went like when nothing was visible nothing ever happened so if something from the list does not make it they have something to explain which is both a little bit of pressure and a prelude to strengthening communications neither is badvisibility communications even if ccp is slow itll get things on the table only that way it can be worked on properly

again figuring out which 25 or 50 to put on that list  not to mention the lack of a reasonable way to easily count supports and discern nonsupports from unthumbed supports and supportive discussion would require a huge amount of work to keep up with it but as a start ill ask for this thread to be stickied not sure theyll comply though and oh can deal with keeping it maintained since he started it if it stops being maintained it can just be unstickiedalso to the op please capitalize assembly and hall in your thread subject teachermode off for those items which have been raised and passed by csm as quite a few of your listed items have been you might want to link to the issue thread in the wiki since that will contain vote results and also link to the proper forum thread and any related others

yeah its free pizza you moron
destructible outposts would make it beyond impossible for anything but the largest 00 entities to ever own space with an outpost in it why simply move out of your space when you can burn everything down then move out to make sure its completely unlivable for anyone in the future large alliances would routinely destroy outposts of up and coming alliances to keep them out of 00 destructible outposts would end 00 permanently it would become stagnant in a way we have never seen
easy enough just link all the stations to 1 reinforcement timer or as said before 1 sov holding station and rest irrelevant
supported  look at providence they already have 50 outposts for 80ish systems seems to me that its inevitable that almost all of them eventually will when the better gameplay solution would be to allow more stations in the more centralconveniently located systemsrelated sov warfare mechanics are terrible and also need to be changed looking forward to that happening in 2012
thats exactly why this is a bad ideayou know how hard that was to grind through the sleepless nightsthe cries of manfred and obiwand over tsi have ptsd from it still
and not only has that already been addressed in this thread but if you allowed multiple stations in one system we could easily create self sufficient hubs that only require you to grind through one station not 35
public featureidea  bugtracker for evei started a thread about this on gd a day ago but its already on page 3  lets see how this goes here instead as i read the sticky from obsidian and the post from mynxee in there hot topics of the assembly hall 9 i want to start at last a discussion here about thisi see the problem with the actual approach of collecting opinionsideasetc pp from players about the game via the forums  reinventing the wheel over and over and overlets say there are several people who have the same kind of idea and irk with the game just not at the same time read months here how do they make a proposal that would get through how do they work on it from time to time add to it discuss it from different angles you cant search fi in a way that would qualify as helpful for forming ideas and if there wouldnt be chribbas evesearch you couldnt search at allits a halfassed and bad implementation to get features and ideas collected reviewed and worked onfor example i want to see all proposals and discussions regarding planetary interaction and there in special teamwork how do i do that do i make a new thread and hope all people who are currently interested in discussing that show up as long as this thread stays on page onetwo do i screen all pages of threads in the forum there to find old threads about it do i use evesearch with what kind of phrase can i be sure i found all there isi also want to point out the last brainstormingthread where a dev made his appearance and probably took some notes but what about us that thread will vanish sooner or later and all those infosideas collected in there will be more or less gone is the galaxy ever going to get biggeris the csm now in charge of collecting features and ideas for ccp and has to create run  maintain a framework for itand on top of that how does the information stored in this thing finds it way to the desks of devs in a usefullsupportivesynergistic approach read without to much hassle and reformattingand to add some tinfoil to the mix how to make sure ideasstuff doesnt get bendedwhitewasheddroppedsupressed by csm before it reaches ccp i have nothing against csm to moderate the process and guide here or there in an open and public way but with power comes responsibility and the human factor if ccp where to run that show database whatever i could at least be sure the csm or single candidates dont run their own agenda with itthe solution i see for this is a bugfeaturetracking program run by ccp on eveonlinecom

i for one am fed up with the same missions that i first encountered in 2006 and the constant rinse and repeat affair from them it is about time you moved from those dark red moon rising days and upgrade your mission data base and mission storys dont add any more rewrite them all bring us pve players into the modern world of eve faction missions i for one am fed up with these i have not joined faction warfare so why am i forced to run them or wait 4 hours only to find another faction mission thrown right at me again this has been happening a long time and is about time you refined them  i am fed up getting three faction missions back to back sort it out or your mission tables new mission tools use them ccp stop messing around and give us new missions or infact just rewrite them all we are in tyranis not red moon rising client you pipe on about all these new tools and stuffz you have we use them somedays i wonder why i play your game when i see the same missions when i joined back in 2006it is about time you stopped your we haff news tools rubbish and show us the players what they can do i am sure this has been said enough times but you do nothing or add a misison or two to the data base i am getting bored now sort it out bring your missions into the tyranis era or just get rid of pve for good 
eve devs dont do missions silly unlike you they create isk out of thin air so they can pvp nonstop without worries
always in favor ot more and better missions
yup
agree i dont run missions anymore but it seems like they could stand to be a lot more interesting sleeper ai more dynamism etc
thismissions are hella boring make them better and add some cooperative opportunities like in other mmos you know the ones with more pve content other than just bring an alt
more missions and make them more intresting sleeper ai would be fun but dont use it on every mission make the ones that have sleeper ai worth a little more lp or something not being able to use my drones in some missions should make that mission worth a little more some people only use there drones so the missions that have the sleeper ai would need a ship with more then just a large drone bay and a afk pilot i support the op for his wish of more intresting missions
supportedpersonally my favorite of these ideas is the one hangar of stuff idea moving stuff between modules is a pain and doesnt add any enjoyment or interest to the gameplayfuel pellets a strong second should be trivially easy too just introduce a fuel pellet bpo that takes the pos fuel componentsbut honestly all of these ideas are good and none of them are rocket science three coders two days and a few pots of coffee should be able to check off the whole liston the other hand its way more work than fixing rockets or blasters or assault frigs and weve been waiting years for that so shrug

i support this insurerance for being killed by concord should be stripped off the game i dont mind the wreck point let them buddys fight in highsec as they like to but get this damn insurerance nonsense off the gamein eve dont ever fly a ship you cant afford to loose its just that easy

hmm valid arguements lots of flames and a lot of no brainersi do agree that insurance is a bit off when you get concorded and get rewarded for it by a generous gift of isk because your ship got blown up support this bit onlyof course if we want pirates and police we need players in concord or allow podding of the negative security people in high sec by concord i gotta admit itd be an interesting day to see concord officers hunting down pirates actively instead of passivelyanyone else thinking of making an alt to join concord and naming them dirty harry joe friday or fiveoh

this is correct plus ive crashed before while in combat and the only thing that saved me was that modules kept on running and i mwdd off grid while trying to log back in so no thanks to modules shutting off on logoff
i have noticed a lot of concern about afk orcas and logoffski capitals i understand your concernwhat about if the damage control is fit on a sub cap it acts like a passive module if put on a capital ship you have to activate it to get the benefitif thats to complicated then i suggest the current damage control be passive and can only be fit on sub caps introduce a capital ship sized damage control that can only be fit on caps this of course would need to be turned on to workplease dont forget the motivation behind this idea is to help with lag and the tedious turning on a module after every jump which is anoying
for lag reduction it would make more sense that unprojected modules preserve their state as you see on crash  relog that already works so all they would need to do is preserving the state during jump

i keep refreshing my rss feeds but no blog yet i want to find out what all the excitement was about yeay fritg  if you check the previous minutes youll see that the list is going to come out with the patch notes for the next expansion anyway this vote was about whether to release the list in a csm blog due out real soon now and note even with mynxees vote the list still hasnt been releasedthe blog is 2500 words or so which implies to me that theres some pretty significant stuff happening in the next patch or two before the winter expansionim off to mash the refresh button on my rss reader until this blog comes out au revoir
ah which implies that the concerns in the csm were to do with how little the list of csm requests that made it into the patch appear i think my refresh button is broken 
just as an update about the csm blog we submitted the csm blog content on monday and requested publication nlt today an email from ccp a couple of hours ago said they are still factchecking if we want the csm blog published just like a dev blog which we do so that it becomes part of the permanent blog archive available here on eveo we have to endure ccps publication process given that it would be kinda dumb to scoop our own blog by publishing the list and other content elsewhere and risk diverting comments from the comments thread that will accompany the csm blog itself also patch notes dont contain csm tags for csm items some of us in the csm have asked for that but not everyone agrees with the idea therefore it will not be readily apparent in the patch notes which things csm influenced or was responsible for championing the csm blog at least can do thatbut i am not a patient womanso get on it ccp
mynxees correct there are a myriad of teams that xhagen has to check with to make sure that the items listed are correct as were dealing with the backlog once that review is done the next step is to do the grammar edit ccp does not edit csm blogs for content and then publication
yup
since t3 are made in wspace the fact that their use there is limited is insane we should be able to swap subsystems using the ship maintenance array but i would accept a new moduleif the module is introduced however i would like it to give us the option of assembling the ships support

basically here are the bare bones of it give all destroyers a fitting bonus to a new type of probe launcher and set of probes these new probes can only be loaded into this special destroyer only probe launcher that way no other ship aside from t1 destroyers can fit it idk what the stats should be on this new probe launcher but i would like it so that it does not impact our normal dessie fits at all aside from using up that 1 utility high that most of us have a problem figuring out what to stick in it in the first place do the same thing sb gets for fitting bomb launchers but instead for dessies with this new probe launcherall these probes do is allow cloaked ships to be scanned down like normal ships with the following exception under no circumstances will you ever be able to find out the name type pilot of said ship it should come up as unknown at what ever point the information normally comes up at while scanning with regular probesthis way we can kill two birds with one stone 1 destroyer pilots will have a a clearly defined role for them to fill 2 kill afk cloaking as we know it without impacting any of the normal cloaking mechanicspersonally i hate all the other ideas with these timers and fuel consumption and crap that will completely ruin cloaking mechanics this probe launcher and probes for the destroyer will not effect any of the cloaking mechanics except for being able to be afk for hours in a safespot sb pilots like who even while cloaked jump from safe spot to safe spot and move around alot while cloaked will have little to no chance of being caught like any other pilot who keeps moving around when someone who is trying to probe them down unless they are complete noob and only have 2 safespots that they keep jumping back and forth to which even still would require a decent amount of work on the probers part to find em and eventually tackle emthings that i see 1 busy systems will be easy to stay afk long enough for a cigarette and a toilet run in just because the amount of ships in system try pobing someone down with 50 ships in local its friggin hard 2 conversely low traffic systems probing is easier but either way if the pilot is at the comp and warping around good luck getting a green dot you can warp to and good luck if you actually land close enough to tackle 3 also who says its an afl sb thats cloaked for all the dessie pilot knows it could be a protype fitted cane with a pilot thats waiting for the moron dessie pilot to probe him downso inconclusion i think my idea is the best because it creates a definite role for destroyer pilots to play with it does not mess with the cloak at all only people that come out losers are the ones that think going afk in a hostile system is a smart thing to do
lots of words for fixing a nonexistent problemwhy would i fit a cloak the counter to probes if i can be probed out anywaywhy would you need a counter to something that is helpless in space a cloaked ship cant do anything to you especially when the pilot is afkhave you ever tried to live nomad style in 00 or a wormhole without a pos with a cloaked orcacarrier as baseif your idea would get implemented we would get1 your moduleship would become kinda mandatory in any roaming fleet and would only lead to more logoffski instead of warping to safespot and cloak up2 all the 00 carebears would just blob out someone who tries to cloak up in a system to wait out the get in gang and kill the guyphase or the everyone dock up neutral in systemphase so in the end their space would get even more safer that it is today and some 00 space is safer than highsecall in all  stupid idea thumbs down
lol obviously its a problem cause people have been arguing about it non stop since i started playing 2 years ago out of all the ideas with the nerfing of the cloak directly my idea is the best 1 only destroyer pilots can fit and use the probes in the first place that means someone is gonna have to be flying around in a thrasher instead of a hac or bs hell ill even be generous and say yes make the requirement for the launcher cut into our normal fit destroyer fit drastically so we only got 4 guns worth of cpu and powergrid instead of our 7you can always just log off and wait for the blob to go away or stay on and warp your ass around i take offense to the idea that someone can avoid a fight 100 if they are 1 not at their computer and 2 not in a pos shield or stationyou want to be safe and afk log out or dock up as to your arguements1 yeah thats kind of the point of giving the destroyer a dedicated role in fleet as for logoffski you dont want to risk pew pew log off rather have you logged off of eve if youre going afk anyways2 carebears will do that anyways regardless its just a matter of if youre willing to actually warp around in system while they run around with their heads cut off or are you gonna log off and check in an hour or two to see if the carebears will leave you aloneive always found the counter arguments to mine always way too carebear for my taste in the first place i dont want to pew pew cause the carebears might get me is always what the counter argument breaks down to
i will support this if you agree that this new probe requires a rank 64 skill at level 5 and its prerequisite is all 4 titans at level 5otherwise noedit also what darius said
this
no youre dumb get out
no just no bad idea keep cloaking the way it is
it appears that there are several points on your ship that turrets target when shooting how about there be some of these points around the ship as well shots that completely miss hit a point that is a bit far from the ship shots that barely hit a point that just scraps the ship and shots that do hit do as they are now also shots that miss and barely hit continue pass the points since nothing is there to stop it this should be within the abilities of the current engine without having to make to many changes but would make the effects a little better as nobody likes to see large lasers that are apparently missing every time engulfing their ship as if everything is hitting
yes it should be more like the movies
well its a bit more complicated than that i think for example laser animations end when they hit the ship if theyd end in space a new effect would need to be added that makes the beam fade away instead of exploding at the target pointthat aside i like the idea but if ccp commits time to this id rather suggest a more dedicated approach than just random spots around the ship optimal solution would be making the weapons actually shoot where theyre supposed to shoot depending on their tracking so as an example if you try to shoot a frig with large guns theyll usually shoot somewhere far behind the target and if your guns scratch the target they really do maybe even with a part of the beam passing the ship and fading into space behind itnother idea would be that laserbeams fade out depending on their optimal range and falloff but both these suggestions are huge overhauls of the current system so  just throwing some ideas around p
ccp is to busy with wis and incarna to worry about effects of lasers it does make since that if you miss the target that the laserbullet would keep going but then you have to think about what would happen if the laser that missed hit something else behind itsomething flew into it after it missed its intended target a fleet battle would be almost imposable to implament this on as you would have to track what the laserbullet might do to anything in its path you think there is lag now just wait to when they try your idea

the vargur does need additional grid as it stands it cant even fit an xl shield booster a large cap injector and 800mm acs without a grid upgrade of some sort thats pretty sad my maelstrom fits all that and has a solid 2025 of its grid left over i really cant imagine trying to put 1400s on the thing
so it cant be fitted as you wantso it is still the best marauderminmatars only know whining if their ship not op they start whining for whatever reason they think fitsgo try out kronos or golem if you thing vargur is not good enough
oh god its naomi knight all over again di havent played this game in 4 months work sux but last time i checked pretty much every ship worth more than 50mil can be fitted with long range weapons except the tempest can fit 6x 1400ii but cant fit anything else then the vargur and the apoc should it choose to fit tachyonsvargur needs several grid mods to fit 1400s  mwd  everything else you need and giving it more grind wont make it any better at marauder so i really cant see the problemi guess ill just train for machariel all i need is the gall bs skill anyway which is lover rank than maraudersalso while apoctachyons issue seems similar apoc is already so op at sniping thats the only thing holding it back from becoming the only viable choice for it when tachyons get nerfed to railarty levels or the other two get boosted then ill quit whiningedit fyi 1400s on a vargur are about as good as tachyons on an apoc except that it costs roughly 1bil more to fit very nice balance there sir
do you mean paladin by any chance
i mean apoc paladin is actually worse at sniping since it doesnt get the range bonus with tempest and vargur its the other way around 1400s can get a metric crapton of falloff and tracking on a vargur giving you the ability to almost match a tachypoc and while both setups are kinda gimp theyre the only ones that can shoot 400dps out to 200kmthe only difference is one costs 50 mil after insurance while the other costs quite a bit more and requires the marauders skill
and give the kronos a 10 or some  railgun damage bonus too
i know this has probably come up before along with proposals to be able to build pos parts at a pos but i didnt find one in the first 4 pages station parts can take an age to build and require a lot of m3 worth of material making logistics and waiting time a pain a 075x time multiplier array specifically for station parts will work just like an equipment assembly arrayfirstly it wouldnt be too much of an advantage for those living in 00 and wanting to build a station in the system they want it the pi materials could be made in 00 but would take a long time to get all the materials together so they would end up having to import most of it from the markets also the sheer amount of trit would require a lot of mining  logistics but being able to make it in high sec means that the station would have to be hauled all the way into null by a normal freighterhaving these arrays would offer 2 alternatives haul a lot of materials to null through many jf runs or haul the station from high sec through the traditional method of a normal freighterfeel free to back uppick issues with thisdawww

i would suggest to use another thread for this discussionbugfeatureideatracker built into the websitediscussion in question
about time this got stickied im with you bro
first let me say congrats on getting this stickied i hope you keep it up to date or someone picks up the torch whenif you leave the game this is a good thing for this forum especially since the noise to signal ratio is so incredibly high i completely understand your view on t3 while i dont view them incredibly underpowered i do think they are incredibly limited for the price you pay i honestly think removing racial requirements from the fittings so that caldari can fit amarr modules would make for more powerful and even specialized ships i look forward to your article 
yes pleaseand how about a few skills that help you improve the performance and capabilities of your pos as well
thankas for the upthe trails are something different i dont oppose them but they dont work when zoomed out
this could be linked to the concept of look at range  youd only be able to see this information so represented within 100km much further out its irrelevant imhoor whatever the surrounding concepts are interesting but i think absolute vectors for all ships are completely essential to eves future development superb idea

as for me im 46 years old and have to use a laptop to play the combination of my old eyes that suffer from perspiopia and the limited size of my laptop tends to give me severial challanges reading the items with 986g0o5sand b can be misinterpited also puncuation such as      other font options as well as a better choice of font size would really help out this old grey haired dad my eyes after hours of playing eve
how about reworking your weapon scoring to account for damage types you want scorch range nerfed so that its inline with barrage and nullthere is nothing wrong with the worsttracking shortrange gun that deals the worst damage type for most pvp situations having the best damage projectionyou want something nerfed look at the last round of buffs you know the weapon system that has excellent tracking selectable damage types no cap use a tech 2 ammo that compares well to scorchon hulls with multiple utility highs double damage bonuses best agilityspeedget hybrids buffed wait for things to settle down then figure out ifwhat needs nerfed
blasters highest fitting requirements on the worst overall fitting ships gallente and caldari have 3rd and 4th best power grids gallente have 3rd best cpu caldari is best for missilesid be satisfied with easing fitting requirements a bit

if you support this then please make a tick at the right moment i just left a post in the sticky thread i linked in the op and see how this goes drawing some attention from the csm and others interestedmy fear is that there already was a thread about this some time ago and i just made a new one
one of the problems is that suggestion can become old very fast you really want to discuss for example changes the scanning system and the proper thread is a a 500 page thread initiated in 2005 while in the meantime there have been 2 complete redesign of the system and several major overhaulswho will decide when a suggestion thread has been made obsolete by changes in the game or even what sections are obsolete and what are still validgenerally if thread has merits it stay on top of the relative forum section for a long time sure it will not aggregate all that was suggested about that topic but you really think that people will read and reread a 20 page thread to find the good points
having some kind of tree to hookrelate all those threads into would be a start as it is by now the information might be somewhere in here but whereabout what part of suggestion aged to much and how to keep it separate from the rest of them granularity just needs to be in the right order and about who decides what doesnt match to present eve i would suggest csm can have that jobi mean i see several approaches to this already just they wont be very automatic read needs many manhours to maintain and arent very compatbile to get this stuff organized
supported provided i get the 135 million or so skill points3 accounts  ive spent on them back one way or another and i really dont care if they just give it to me outright or just increase the training speed until the difference is made uphow soon is this likely to actually happen
makes sense

as mentioned in the csm devblog this issue will be addressed in the winter expansion
the description says it all ccp could keep the price of items the same and create ingame vouchers at a slightly inflated price such as 750mil  35 bucks to purchase items players could go to the eve store and either buy an item for them self or transfer it to a voucher to be sold ingamea similar system is in place for plexs why not open up the rest of the eve storeactually it would work identical to the plex system ccp would still get paid for the item not by converting plex but by buying a voucher vouchers would cost the exact same real life money as the item itself does only you would be able to sell the voucher on market or contracts just like plexs are yea you can get scammed this way but you can also get scammed with plexs too and if youre buying something like this wouldnt you check the contractmarket before you buy it to make sure youre getting exactly what youre paying forthis would eliminate people like myself from begging others for items from the store in exchange for isk only to get caught and banned for trading isk for rl stuff i have not done it yet but man id really like that guristas zippo and the navy mega model
vouchers could also not be purchased through the eve store if the item is currently out of stock or make special items unavailablealso the person redeeming the voucher would be responsible for sh
sounds goodbut ccp may not like it much
sounds very good1
me likey 1
sounds like a pretty good idea
it has been brought to my attention that some people may try to use this method of purchasing eve store items to transfer isk to cash so if implemented ccp could very easily allow only 2 voucher transactions per account per month ccp already watches large amounts of isk transfers so should someone try to transfer isk to a character for a few extra hundred bucks a month they would be easily caught
this has actually been brought up at fanfest 2009 i believe the devs said that sleeper ai would be a possibility if it didnt take up so many server resources i would like to see improvements though just like everyone elseand the faction kill missions send me into a slight nerdrage sometimes i am left with no real reason to not support this topic
they do get tedious once youve done them all at least 10 times some more variety would be nice interesting storylines missions that cant be blitzed anything really anything to make this party of the game better
im pretty sure ccp intends missions to be punishment for losing at pvp there can be no other explanation
oh please pvp havent existed since 2005 losing your boat is the result of not enough riskaversion and being on the other side of the blob
1 to thisinfinity to the faction mission part
considering that the last mission i flew was just to get some stuff from a lp shop and for the excitement doing it in nullsec i have to support this even sleeper get boring over time as the script that handles them isnt very innovative this is now something i dont really understand well partly the faction missions which where thrown at me ages ago during my normal missions where short and in low sec quite exciting and some change from the usual go there kill come backthough i understand that those arent funny if they all end in the same system which then gets camped 247 and the mission itself is more than just shooting forsome mere seconds at a simple target
i would have responded sooner but i fell asleep doing a mission1
for the normal level 4 missions just use a random script to generate them they are basicly very simple just x rooms with y spawns each with z ships that can all be random within reasonable constraints add some different settings either premade or also random and tada you at least got some surprises in missions
fully supported one of the things i really hated in wow was the repetitive nature of dayly missions and the like to grind up for stuff id like a bit more variety in doing missions cosmos thingies are fun for a change and i generally do other things than missions but i still need lps and standing so not much getting around doing missionslots for the antifaction thing i understand that the various corps etc dont like other races but can we get some kind of segregation between regular and antifaction agents or something i for one dont care for themmore chained missions would be nice too as i like the little stories they write even if it gets boring once you do the doll quest for the umteenth time
highsec is extremely safe as long as you pay attention if youre mining you can be afk because most mining barges can tank long enough to wait for concord to come and blow up the pirates dont haul on autopilot if youre cargo is much more expensive than a frigate or the pirates will probably gank missioning ships are almost always safe as for the ships that come out only once ever just invest those keep them for a few years and then sell them right now the primae is already selling for over 200 million
agree to no insurance for concord kills but an absolute no to anything else high sec isnt about safety its about consequences
welcome to evethings tend to explode and die in horrible sphincterclenching ways herewill you be staying long
bwahaha this so many times this
if you want revenge for those who killed you stay in empireif you want protection you will have to work for it move out to a space where your alliance can protect youif you want complete safety at no cost go play hko
yes lets make it impossible to activate any type of gunmission launcher and move all missions to low sec
noone cares
this proposal is for a corpalliance store the idea is for the corpalliance to be able to sell equipmentammoskill books etc to the member base in a controlled mannerthe following would be required1 store can only be accessed at a station where you have an office as per any market the stock must physically reside there2 a person with suitable rights will be able to link items to the store in a method similar to putting a sales order on the market visibility will be corp or alliance wide3 parameters will set the price max qty that can be purchased how often the purchase can be made etcthe idea is this is to allow for corpsalliances to sell to their members at a discount to what they would pay from the market without having to grant rights to a hangar that allows for someone to clear out a hangareg sell a skill book for 50 of market value to corp members but they can only buy it once to prevent the corp subsidising their sales to the marketthe current mechanics allow some of this already with corp contracts the main difference is that you can1 set the repeatability of accessing the item once off once per time period etc2 sell x amount of the item without having to setup x contractsi am aware that some will say this is bad for 00 markets but the fact that the items have to be moved to a location will balance this i hope in addition a ceo skill that limits how many items can be on the market might be of benefit once the purchase is done it will be in the members hangar as per any other market tradetldr i would like to see a corpalliance shop to allow for discounted sales to members of the corpalliance thereby making it easier for the industrial members of the corp to provision modules to the member base as well as an easy way for a corp to provide skill books to new members without being totally cleaned outregardshack
i like the idea but not sure how it can be implemented without as hack said destroying 00 markets maybe a mechanism to allow better corp contract management using the repeat sale suggestion above and a nice screen listing all off an alliances contracts would achieve the same outcome
i definitely would not want this to replace markets the aim is to allow a way for the corpalliance to subsidisemaybe this needs something akin to the lp store to make it work im open to suggestionsthe main things is that this doesnt totally replace all markets but does allow for corps to supply skill books to their members or sell ships etcone use that occurs to me might be for null sec ship replacement programs  buy your replacement dread for 12 billion isk from corp etca more complex security structure might lock out who can buy what based on rules  so you must be in the corp 6 months to access capital ships whereas cheap skill books are immediate etcanyway  this is a work in progress concept that needs much input to get exactly rightedit  supporting own proposal
it sounds like a great idea hacka nice way for alliances to help its members with things like ship replacements a feature similar to a loyalty point store sounds cool
this is a really great idea id imagine this could remove a lot of the hassle when replacing lost ships or providing skill books damaging the market in the local area maybe not after all all the items in the store had to some from somewhere
intresting it would make things more eficient i like the fast ship replacement 
i highly doubt that this would disrupt  kill markets as you currently would just have to convo  mail the person in charge of production and tell them you want something then they contract it to you at the appropriate price so unless you get impatient this doesnt change the market at all it just provides a more fluid exchange between alliance  corp  characteri like the idea

issue have been voted favorably in latest meeting
absolutely
courier contract certainly
totally supportedvery annoying issue that need solving
i fully support this and any other quickeasy fixes for lag sources as for those concerned about the afk hauler situation the client is aware the autopilot function is running in theory this should allow for a flag to be set to disable specific modules cetain modules would then be ineffective during the autopilot process basically saying it needs the processing power of the ships systems for those specific modules to do its job
very consistent behavior  it should be either passivekeeping state for all or for nobodyalso you know that people often use to jump inout out overloaded systems maybe you want to pvp a bit more
this post is driven by the fact that t2 rigs are way too expensive and i am sure everyone can agree with this how these rigs are manufactured today t2 bpcs which can be obtained either with invent or complexes and blue rig parts for materials to produce them the blue parts come from salvaging t2 ships only which sets their high prices and that defines the price of t2 rigs on the other hand it is relatively easy to obtain normal rig parts via common salvaging of rats wrecks this on the other hand reduces the price of t1 rigs to the level that most ppl dont even salvage wrecks due to the timespend compared with profit from this activityso my proposal is this players to be able to manufacture t2 rig parts from t1 rig parts it can be done via using blueprints for those parts or some other waythe consequences of this will be reducing the price of t2 rigs and increasing the price of t1 rigs in that case players will be more willing to salvage any rat wrecks and make a descent profit out of their time spent doing that more people will start using t2 rigs on subcapital ships in my opinion good alsoplease do discuss this idea constructivelyps im not sure if this is the place for such proposal but since i didnt find a better place on the forums i posted it here i am sure moderators will move it to somewhere else if needed ive searched the forums for similar proposal or idea but with no avail if there is such proposal already exist and is brought to the attention of csm or ccp delete this post
there was discussion about this earlier about a low sec pos mod that would convert x amount of t1 salvage to t2 salvage but i am not sure exactly where this went if it went anywhere
yes there could be a way to fix all the broken  malfunctioning  smashed components if even something as simple as 10x broken part  1x fixed part currently tii rigs are used only on capitals and maybe faction ships due to their price
actually the pricing of t2 rigs is not invariably fixed by the cost of t2 salvage quite a few of the useful ones can be produced fairly cheaply certainly for less than some expensive meta 3 or 4 mods in may cases the rigs are dear because theyre in low demand so theres little competition for what business there is granted t2 trimarks will never get cheap without a massive increase in the supply of intact armor plates but then i dont think thats a bad thingnot supported
t2 rigs bare very few exceptions mainly in l size are dirtcheap no need to fix things which arent broken

so many people use cloaks on combat ships and have no method of counter possible suggestion i would have of fixing this problem is adding a 10 minute cooldown after a hour of cloaking this gives cloakies the ability to wait out and stalk enemies without being able to be invincible
whine more
pretty much thiscloaking has been discussed to death  its fine the way it is
facepalms
issue people keep complaining about cloaking
then clearly others feel cloaking is a overpowered part of this game there should be some available method of bringing it inline with other tactics
it is inline with all the other stuffa cloaked ship cant do anything to you nothing nadaif it decloaks it can harm you but then you can harm it aswell you can shoot it jam it neut itwhat kind of counter do you need to harmless
ships designed to cloak  should be able to cloak  periodall others ships should not be able to fit them
replying as per request player was not afk was decloaked by drones
perhaps cloaks should not be able to be uncloaked with drones but need a cooldown timer sounds like a reasonable trade thoughts
no  thats exactly how you beat cloaking ships on the gate you burn towards them and try to get into decloaking rangei seriously have to give you the advice try to use the cloaking ships before trying to make suggestions and especially try to use them in 00run through some gate camps and stuff then come back
with a covert ops cloak it is near impossible for a small gang to grab a cloaky can it happen yes does it happen often no short of having a bubble multiple fast ships and drones you are not getting it before it hits warp after all cloaky ships are fast really it is pointless a single ship requires a 5 man team even with drones to stop even then its a chance of getting him with this idea of cooldown a skilled prober with proper skillset would be able to counter the cloaker but give them a short term advantage till cooldown keeping things interesting
it needs one ceptor  been there done that and it should be hard to catch them running through gatecamps is the role of covert ops and reconsand your cooldown idea is totally unrelated to running through gate camps and it wouldnt help there at all it would only benefit people who just want to blob everyone out of their system so they can carebear without the constant need to be carefulfrom someone who lives and carebears in 00 you always have to be concentrated there  no matter if a hostile cloaky is in local or not
thats right if you use a cloak on a combat ship you have no way of countering any attack against you because a there is a targeting delay after deactivating the cloak and b your sensor resolution is reduced by 50 due to having a cloaking device fittedits also worth pointing out that while you are cloaked your prey is also invincible since you cannot attack themimho the level of whining about cloaks means that the technology is working perfectly just as it currently exists people use it and it leads to other people losing ships because theyre not being careful
there is no problem with cloaking devices they work as intended

this is a csm devblog csmblog it has lots of words
is this the list which was the cause of all this angst
conceptwatch list that shows your current friends or enemies online statuscurrent implementationthe current implementation does not work you get a list of people who are online at the time you log on thats it if you stay in station for any length of time the list does not update even if those who are offline log on or those who are online log off this is a vital intelligence gathering tool how are you supposed to know when the people you have kill rights on are actually online so you can hunt them downfixdepending on implementation you could do an overlap of all of the below will increase accuracy in case of laglatencyconnection issues1 the server knows who has logged on and who logs off it also knows who is on which players watch list if a person logs onoff send an update to each client who has that person on their watch list and of course is online and for improved accuracy get the client to acknowledge the request2 the client knows who they have on their watch list at regular intervals 3 mins 5 mins poll the server for an update status for those people to which the server replies with a online or offline status for each member in that list3 at each system change we need to get a list of those in local anyway so might as well get this information at the same timethe 3rd will work for those that are continuously on the move hunting the first will work for everyone and the 2nd will work for those that spend a lot of time in a single system ie traders industrialistssuch a conceptually simple implementation and with a perhaps 5 minute window of accuracy its a heck of a lot better than being off by 8 hours
yeah fix this its driving me crazy how am i supposed to hunt 100 wartargets if i cant even see if they are online or nottime and money spend locators for offline characters are hella annoyingtime spend travelling 30 jumps to find out a character was already offline also ing annoying
as mentioned in the csm devblog this issue will be addressed in the winter expansion
lose much hint  when they flash red shoot them but i agree neutral reps need a 60 sec timer and i may be a privateer but i can assure you im proberly on the receiving end of targets getting remote repd than most people
eve online already become supercapitals online while every ship able to tackle capital ship only 2 fragile ships able to tackle supercaps so we have galaxy full of supercaps because they build everywhere and die very rarely let them ability to fight each other till the death make supercapital warp disruptor which tackle only supercaps and only supercaps able to fit it also its look wierd that one supercarrier able to kill all pos modules with no risk at all add supercap tackling ability to pos disruptor modules

its called a heavy interdictor cruiser they work great in packswhat happened to goonswarm gone noobswarm on us
super caps die rarelydid you just came out of a cave or something25 per week is the mom losses ps check the top week kills in this site for a few days
been trying to get to get something like this active for a while either this or a t2 dread designed to tackle large numbers of capitals  the haters i like how none of the lol u nub posts are from anyone able to field a considerable cap fleetedit im including you in that statement mister blast member
you are just upset that you cant catch the nc guys
they no more endgame ship endgame ship when alliance have only 34 such ships not 6080 super capitals become working horse like dreadscarriers were 3 years ago dont see a reason to not let them die like other ships ps nc i understand your im afraid to lose my shiny ship position
actually i wasnt even home during that i was more hoping it ed up when i left so i could blame dbrb that is completely beside the point supercaps are far too hard to kill i myself have done incredibly stupid things that should by any standard equaled a dead wyvern but they havent because of the ed amount of ehp i am packing and how comparatively little ehp anything that can tackle me has even if the ms cant kill whats coming at it it only requires a few good sniper hacs to strip off any dictors and you are good to go if at any time during the 1030 minutes it takes to kill the supercap you are untackled for even a few seconds you can jump out kind of dumb if you ask me
well i consider it endgame cause only titan needs more time to train for but yeah there are way more than 80  no idea about how many titans though pl had aroun 2530 of them floating outside station in ow so if we say 80 isnt considered engame then i am afraid we got no endgame ships in eve 
rss support and the ability to subscribe to threads would be wonderful i would love to get rid of the left and right columns though they really interfere with the presentation of the forums on a mobile device where screen real estate is a premium

please please please web 20 otherwise the suggestion of taking an already existing and thoroughly tested for that matter as in it will work piece of forum software and perform the necessary integrations the essentials includea working search systemprivate messages and profiles or eve gate integration why else do you expect us to use itthe ability to jump to a specific or next dev post in a topic  come on wow had that years ago were better than them rightuse cookies and sessions properly  im fed up of having to login find the topic again select the right character enable my signature again every single time i want to post on the forumsfor a list of ideas just look at phpbb smf ipb hell even vbulletin  they are all excellent pieces of software with plenty of support and a massive range of well design features
things id like to see in the new forums1 integration with eve gate allow for mailing people from the forum or looking them up in evegate2 automagic login and remember im logged in3 better handling of large texts typed in this box because right now its horrible with its scrollbar pushing up my text all the time so i cant see what im typing when im making a long post4 better integration with dev blog posts
in regards to not just this but every other feature that weve been told is in development or plannedwith all due respect saying something is in development is like saying the check is in the mail it does us no good how far in development is said feature when could we reasonably expect to see results this winter next summer two years from now six years will this feature actually see release or will it get thrown into the backlog which for all intents and purposes should be called the feature graveyard
what threat is the cloaker to the other people in the system why is it necessary to decloak the cloaker
so you can pod them while they are afk
so youve come here to peddle your lame idea rather than trolling over at the fid boardcloak mechanics are fineas people have told you numerous times beforenot supported
the current permissionrole system is seriously flawed the current system is to simplified to make it even close to effective if you live in regular space this may be a bit annoying but it is not a serious flaw in itself since you have access to stations where you can keep your stuffif you live in a worhole however you immediatly notice that the current role system is less than satisfactory if you have access to a specific hangar then that premission stretches to every hangar if you have access to the ship maintenance bay you can pick any ship you like no matter if it belongs to you or not either you need to trust your corp mates completely or it just wont workif you ask me the access permission administration system should be changed into something more akin to that of chat channels the corp directors create hangars and much set access rights that grants some people access and others not this way new members can be granted access to a personal hangar that nobody but the director and that person can accessa simpler way that would not have to remake the entire permission system would be to give every corporate hangarship maintenance bay a personal hangar this can only be accessed by the one having the hangar and directors
already proposed to hell and back linchpin that brakes the whole show limited number of bits in the variable that stores roles within a corporate structure as long as ccp doesnt remove that bottleneck read reworks this part of the code which naturally is interconnected with several other parts of the code you can propose this all day and will get nowhereand if we had a fi tracking system you would see that this has been brought up and supported several times already
id be happy with the bulletslasersblasts just passing by graphically possibly hitting the wrong tharget would be cool sure but not neccessary to get the right feeling
maybe at some point in the future after more urgent things have been addressed this would be a cool effect when ccp decides to do some new graphicsanimations work again
interesting ideas irae might there be an argument for barring caps as well as supercaps from low sec or perhaps from all but the lowest sec status in low sec delilah wildfriendsofevewordpresscom
no
how to spot if the person talking is a professional victim or someone who understands evesupercaps are often dropped into lowsec and kill unprepared groups of players this means that we need to get ccp to nerf the ability for capital ships to jump into lowsec we need to get together a bunch of friends so we can gank some tasty motherships pick one
tldr version faction navy replace concord in lowsec tweaked aggression mechanicsmost meaning all of these suggestions suck they basically boil down to funnel targets down the barrels of my gunsfirst ill deconstruct a few of the ideas whichve been refloated herethe suggestion about players moving in and claiming it well why to anchor a pos they need good faction standing and that effectively keeps the big alliances except cva out and the small ones cant repel the inevitable dreadnaught pos bashing which is a subtle disincentive to anchoring a few hundred million isk in lowsec who knewif you move missioning out into lowsec exclusively you instantly force all the mission runners to change careers or more likely games a missionfit is usually thrillingly expensive and to an order of magnitude approximately useless in pvp no matter the quality of the player told they have to fly their factionfit nightmares into lowsec to do l4s and l5s the majority after the first three or four goes around will respond really well im sick of the l3s i can reach and i cant actually reach the l4s dont like pvp see you in another mmo move everything but l1s to lowsec and no new players will graduate past the 21 day trialif you create safe corridors on roundabout routes between the popular trading hubs and make everything else lowsec the empire folks you want to gank just move the hubs to the safe corridors if you just make everything lowsec noone will ever leave their starting empire period then theyll get bored of their starting empire and quit the gameto forestall the inevitable theyll get good at pvp and fight their way out or theyll sneakcloak their way past the gatecamps eventually bull  new players or carebears get killed and smacktalked four or five times then decide that while theyre good at being the helpless victim it sucks and doesnt pay well play something else never look back fewer whining nublets might suit some but since subscribers pay the bills and fewer whining nublets inevitably results in a shrinking playerbase and that just leads to the income generated by running the cluster rapidly approaching the marginal cost of running said cluster from the wrong directionmaking a high sec bubble around gates wont help either  people will just warp bubble to bubble and low sec becomes a highsec highway as long as you dont pull over to use the restroom and if you allow anchoring of dictor bubbles between the two points well were back where we startedmove all the valueable mins into lowsec00 players either sign up with 00 alliances that hold sov and can protect them or just keep mining whatevers left in empire move all the mins to lowsec suddenly the forums are awash with complaints of 00 alliances blobbing lowsec pounding nonblue into the dustlowsec is actually nosec make it low security spaceno concord or special conditions to summon concord eg supercap agresses fn gankee podded instead you get a faction navy response only when a ship is destroyed not attacked and only when the attack would have generated concordokken in highsec it gives the carebears a sense of safety and that encourages them into lowsec space which remains significantly less safe than 05 and gives them some incentive pay ransoms flip a can and the miner flips it back no fn response if you destroy his ship ambush him and take him into structure no response then blow his ship up fn turns up since you can fight off or escape fn piracy is still possible you just need to think a little harder about how you do it now with more marks to choose fromtruth told couldnt care less if everyone in lowsec biomassed themselves this is a way to encourage people to come into your current aoe if you want no npc response at all and lots of targets man up and move to null
a couple of snarls lol then an interesting post that envisions a new dynamic for piracy and faction navies presupposes that null sec is the end game which for many it is not but that doesnt detract from the creativity of moars idea moar as i reread your post i wondered if you would favour eliminating low sec altogether and replacing it with a neutral zone apologies to trekkies between empires and null sec alliances a shallower depth of systems the game mechanics you envision etcdelilah wildfriendsofevewordpresscom
so delilah you figured out yet how to post with the pvp main account of yours  any day nowthis displays an ignorance of game mechanics and especially pos warfare what alliance do you know of that will for no reason at all eg moon minerals removing an enemy staging pos deploy an entire fleet bash a pos and then alarm clock an op later to remove it all for an insignificant lowsec pirate faction besides which corpsalliance can already anchor poss now and standings are for highsec or do you think that the recent nullsec alliance fights over tech moons in lowsec were waged once all the allianced ground out some high faction standings with the empire nations the point of giving people space is so that theyd be able to fight over resources andor do something like be able to fire on any targets that enter without losing security status a significant advantage for any pirate faction i left empire and started playing in lowsec about a week into my original trial period and then was in nullsec about a month or two later maybe we should just stop worrying about people who really arent cut out to play eve and instead focus on what makes eve the best persistent pvp mmo on the market nullsec most certainly does not have gate guns that will instapop any fast tacklers that aggro onto a target it doesnt have sec status loss for aggression doesnt generally have a profusion of npc stations lowsec has already had its purpose somewhat fleshed out by fw if fw in turn can be fleshed out then the factions will have more of a cause for fighting over space increased production efficie4ncy decreased pos fuel requirements whatever let other people claim space in lowsec too and theres a reason to use it making it safer for the bears is a fools errand though professional victims will always find some reason that ccp needs to save them thats what marks them as people unsuited for playing eve and people who simply dont get it no matter what you do theyll whine about griefers and the morals of internet spaceships and blah blah blah thats why we see them whining even about highsec there is simply nothing that can be done short of creating a pve server to satisfy those who play eve without understanding that its a pvp game and we shouldnt try because rather obviously the best way to attract a larger playerbase is to have the kind of nonniche game that is mainstream and obviously that game is wow and equally obviously the best way to be like wow would be to be wow and most of us do not want that
uhm which guy above you youre referring too again
dear csmthank you for all your timeccp is now a money only company as the game bad that they dont really listened you all csm membersthank you for yout time its now written in the minutes its ccp choice and you are against their view on qualitythey think once again based on the fact that new contents drive more paying playersand they dont think that not listening existing client make them drive awayoh there is no other sf mmorpgwellcheck the market guys somes are coming eve will not for so long be alone of the kind  and ccp knows it that why they want incarana and dust asap ccp dont get stunned when you will look mercedes storyonce they attempted to sell high prices car but with lower quality customers started to drive away nathanthats the guy that will cost you many paying accountsi fell we have attempted to tell you we liked the quality of your game be sure that an happy customer makes 10 happy new customers and that 1 unhappy customer make 100 less potential customermay be you should have thinked more than once twice to that but it seems you like to think we are 10 year old kidswith the new sf games that comes as you but for playing tooeve is dying and you make it capsuleers check on  wwwmmorpgorgyeay
dear csmthank you for all this work thank you for your free time dedicated to make our ideas and requesti was execting so few from ccpplease keep the direction even if they just do cosmetic changes to our universeyeay
to 1the ui is useful for most parts of the game but lacks excellence the extra mile to remove that pitaaspect from it it starts with simple things like cancel order right next to modify order and ends with corprolesposwhatnotto 2apocrypha with the t3 stuff was a damn good time to chase those sites and gear in themto 3as the name expansion implies it should expand the playground expansions shouldnt be used to push out bugfixes balancings nor refurbishments of parts of the playground  put those kind of changes into smaller bites like patches and release them every monthto 4wouldnt bother me anymore as expansions after apoc didnt really live up to their name nor expectationsto 5i got hit hard as halfassed and bad communicateddiscussed as far as i remember changes to drop rates of t3 raw materials had been patched in didnt bother with wormholest3 anymore afterwards
andreus good luck with your csm bid next election hope you noticed the csm blog which was published todayit should give you some idea how csm has evolved and prepare you a bit in terms of expectations if you dont know any former or current csms and want to chat about what the job is like im happy to oblige
sup
did i ever tell you i loved you obsidianwhile im not suprised you came up with this i am suprised that noone else had thought of it beforegreat worktamber
i think we need to rethink what black ops is i say remove these black ops ships and replace them with something battle cruiser size something that isnt offensive but can jump between systems without a cyno and can use covert ops cloak hell just make it jump into the system at 12000km from the gate or something so it can jump in and spy on the enemy without them knowing which to me is the point of black opsi just think black ops should be the ultimate spy ship not this half cloaker half damage useless mutant and not something one has to have two payed accounts just to use
fair enough one thing at a time is fine but i was just pointing out that scorch is usefull were hybrid tech two ammo not so much
the dialogue ive seen in this thread is quite well thought out imo most people are of the opinion that increasing blaster dmg would be the best way to go and i agree it would be nicebut then again any improvements would be niceat the moment longer ranged weapon systems can kite shorter ones and im all for that since it creates interesting strategies what i would like to see happen is for the opposite to also be possiblethat shorter ranged weapon systems blasters in this case being able to get under the tracking of longer ranged guns of the same class size missiles are naturally immune to this issue as they are also usually immune to kiters at the moment it is not feasible due to the poor tracking of blasters and that most blaster boats cannot control distance as well because they are either lacking in enough base speed andor are armor tanking which slows down these ships furtherso quite a few things need to be fixed that being said the first thing that needs to be fixed are the blasters so that we can have a good basis for judging what else needs to be brought in line on these ships with actually balanced weapon systemsmy proposal as some others have already stated is to increase the tracking speed a lot and dmg somewhat as well at least then we can have some real opportunities for creating strategies like the longer ranged weapon systems can
aye or at the very leats include fitting requirments and ship fitting oppertunities into the ballance of weapon systems for example acs do good dmg due to dbl dmg bonusses on many ships and have very very low fitting requirements as well as no cap use just too many advantages in comparison to blastersso in conclusion i support a significant decrease to fitting requirments for blasters or an increase on the grid of blaster intended ships brutix astarte mega needs cpu and hyperion should at the ver least be able to fit a rack of ions with a dual rep tripple rep should be what nerfs you to electrons
you have the right idea but you cant boost blaster tracking much if at all as ships like the megathron will be able to track frigates acs hold an issue as they have the same theoretical tracking as blasters but far more range yes i know its fall off but fall off is effectiveand acs get tracking boosting ammodamage is the real goal boost damage to be extreme in blaster range very high dps would give a stealth tracking boost as even slight hits would cause heavy damage maybe a slight nerf of ac tracking for overall weapon balancing then its a case of ship rebalance ie blaster boats should be very fast in a straight line but slow to turn basically a blaster boat would charge into range and attempt to destroy the target very quickly with overwhelming firepoweralso like ive said before rework the ammo so that it offers real useful bonuses one for plain short range dps one for heavy alpha strike but low rof one for tracking one for falloff and one for optimal
i give my support to this as well
yesterday i tried a shield tanked hyperion in bs vs bs you can approach very fast to antimatter ammo optimal but then you start to miss because of tracking it is ridiculous you cant hit effectively at long range because of tiny optimalfalloff you cant hit effectively at close range because of lack of trackingps btw look at common minmatar pvp ac fits they commonly have available low slots for te more range and tracking almost for free 
we need our anatomically incorrect gallente s
as a longterm supporter and shortterm friend of kamitora i have to give full support of this idea i humbly demand futanari in incarnia
make it a module you train to use and i support
no need a carrier is supposed to have maintaince hangars maybe a new cap part for production in order to make the carriermake it happen 1
10
im still very much for this idea
yeah why not  provided the so mechanic ed mentioned or something like it was in place this would be nice would save people hauling precious cargo from refinery a in system a to to factory b in system b  people would have to actually go further into the system than the gate to get any hauler kills and that would be nice
quote for the truth would be a bad day this would not be the end and this game is getting easier and easier i mean they have a training boost until 16m sp and if they dont want to train learnings they dont have toisnt it easy enough once eve gamer were proud that eve is complex please dont destroy it
very cool thanks for posting that link now if hybrid weapons could get some kind of buff
ummm trebor where exactly is this mentioned ive read that blog twice and didnt see this issue brought up anywhere
yeah nice improvement to the contacts folder with tyrannisoh waitit sucks now
it looks more web 20 now but its dire please roll it back and dock the pay of everyone who worked on it and the guy who pitched it in fact fine him a large sum of money and use it to pay the other devs for the overtime they need to get the other issues sortedalso preferably hang the guy who pitched the improved contacts list
this is different from rmt because money people would get for redeeming plexes for items or services character transfers has already been paid to ccp so there would be no issue about somebody suddenly deciding to turn 850 bilion isk into dollars and bankrupting ccp it seems that ccp is currently concerned about the plexes being stockpiled on the market see destroyable plex latest qen second initiative to basically remove plex from game and this could solve the issue easily
replace voucher with plex while ive loved the idea of plex for eve store credit for some time now it may be a little too complicated for ccp to arrange
a few further ideasthe more i think about it the more i like something akin to the lp store interface a new button can be added to the station if the facility is setup this means that isk might be one factor but maybe u need to hand over a t1 ship and other stuff to get a discounted t2 ie give some of the inputs for t2 building back to your industry base  all of this depends on the configuration much like contracts doa new tab on either the corp screen or the market screen should also exist to1 let you see what is up for sale2 maybe purchase remotely though should work like contracts and only if you are in the region this can only work if you have the physically required items in your hangar at the location of the sale isk obviously is not effectedim not sure about if the actual concept of corpalliance lp is a good one it does allow for active members to be rewarded but i am not 100 sure how to make the mechanic work does the ceo hand them out do you get them based on the amount of xyz u do hard to balance ratting vs missions vs mining vs industry here etc
cool idea not the first time ive heard it but worth adding
interesting idea and very useful thing
i support this concept
here is what i was thinking about  i know the idea has been around for awhile but this is my solution to it  scenario  i have 2 characters on 1 account character a i have continuously training skills since its my main and i want to be able to train character b on the same account for a month or two so i can get em flying an orca for example right now the only options i have is a stop training on character a and train the orca skills i need for character b b transfer character b off the account onto a new account then transfer em back after training is complete which isnt really an option suggestion  option c give plexs the ability to activate another character training slot on the same accountexample  i log into the character b while character a is training buy a plex ingame on use of the plex it gives me the option to use plex to extend subcription or unlock a skill training slot so character b which used the plex can now train along side character a after that skill slot time has expired account reverts back to 1 character training on the account ccp makes more money and players get the option to train 2 characters on one account and make us happy 
sounds good expinsive but goodi support the op also first lol
sure why not its no different than paying for another account except you get less total character slots
not exactly if you were to buy another account ccp gets the activation fee unless you activate by plex but also more importantly a commitment that you will keep playing on that account therefore ccp can expect to get money from you for an extended period of time if you wish to break this commitment and yet still keep playing the character you have to pay the 20 character transfer fee if this change was implemented people would be compelled to just train their alts for a month or two whereas without this change they would consider a full subscriptioni would like to see this change too but i understand why it would hurt ccps business model and i do not see it as anything crucial
first of all i really like that idea but im asking myself why ccp hasnt done this already my guess is that it would be a lot of work to do that probably too much work and it would be even more work to make it possible to play 2 chars on the same account simultaneously o also i would prefer to have all those bugs fixed and rebalanced done before such things get taken on
because ccp will lose 40 because of two transfer fees which beats the 15 they get from a plex
so 2 one time transfers are greater than continuous 15  month in
this is correct but also1 training more than 1 character in the same account is not equal to training more than 1 character in multiple account2 with multiple accounts you can do multiple boxingsimultaneous game play with multiple screens3 with multiple characters in one account you have to play with one at a timeconclusion if this is allowedthen it will generate more revenue for ccp most importantly giveus players more flexibility in game play
when you start another account in order to get the same results its one time transfer fees plus continuous 15 a month
if you start another account you get a free month from the invite so the activation fee doesnt really matter
i agree this needs to be allowed i have had an instance where i needed to contract 50 rigged ships many of which i did not have the skills to fly along with containers of ammo and a few of them had damaged crystals i ended up giving up and having the person come to the system to trade with me because that was quicker than finding all of the damaged crystals manually among thousands of items in each container plus since i couldnt fly some of the rigged ships i would have to repackage them to get the crystals out causing destruction of the rigs

after reading the minutes it seems that the csm wanted to change the focus of lowsec to a sort of pirate haven while i agree that pirates should have their place in lowsec we also need to include the bounty huntervigilante type folks in the equation as well if you are going to give the pirates all these great toys give the vigilantes the same toys to play withthank you
theyre in low demand because of high cost people dont even think of putting them on anything except carebear pimpboats and some caps all t2 rigs that has any usage at all are hundreds of times the cost of their t1 counterparts there are a few exceptions among rigs that no one ever use eg small t2 rigs that decrease hybrid cpu usage or increase laser falloff etc
this is my idea for a new item that would boost ice mining and add another use for pi mats in eveperformance fuels all ships would get a fuel tank added to them that would be accessable like the drone bay when a performance fuel is put into it the ship begins burning it at all times its in use durring this time the ship would gain boosted statsstat boostsminmatar ice fuels and pi comods would produce a fuel that increass ship speed by 4amarr ice  pi stuff would produce a fuel that gives 4 cap recharge bonuscaldari ice fuels  pi stuff profduce a fuel that would increase shield recharge by 4gallente ice  pi stuff would give another stat a 4 boost perhapse electronics effectsperhapse even faction fuel bpcs could give a double effect fuel like 56 of the minmatar speed and 56 of the amarr fuels cap recharge bonus so that fuel would give224 speed bonus and 224 cap recharge rate
isnt this basically boosters
yes this should be added to the game for the sole purpose of making your macroicers more profitable
good idea quick draft for how copies could look like note quick didnt have much time pplease visit your user settings to reenable imagesas for mepe levels on the icon im afraid for the numbers to be readable the corners would need to be too big alternate suggestion would be to add sort by mepe of copies left in the hangarcolumns  shouldnt be too much work as a ccp is already working on adding columns for metalevel and all that stuff and b the system is already in place for the blueprint selectionmanufacturing window
features and ideas discussion thread  commonly proposed ideas  post 5 link to  makes bpos and bpcs distinguishable  why it can be done without redoing the whole database even the difference between bpc and bpo will kill the database read the linked thread
displaying mepe on the icon would require a database call for each bp each time its displayed that would kill the databasebut supporting differentiation between bpobpc
actually i consider pilgrims arazus rapiers etc rather decent combat vessels these do not suffer virtually any drawbacks honestly i would be open to only make the cool down effect cov ops ships that have cynos or combat capability really think that this is uneven for a petition but if that is what is being argued over so be it in other words allow t2 scan boats immunity to cool down provided they do not have a normal cyno cov ops cyno being exempt to give them a better role then simply a prober
crying less and sucking lessboth are things the op needs to start doing more of cloaking is fine the way it is
cloaking is the counter to being found stop whining
cloaking in and of itself is not what is broken it the ships capable of using cloaks with little detrimental effects that is out of whack  made even worse by the mwdcloak trick which makes nailing them even in transit a remote possibility no change to covert cloaks and other dedicated ships increase cloak cpu fitting by a factor of 10andor double scan res penalty plus add similar lock range penalty so it cannot be mitigated by a single module penalties apply only if cloak onlined ie not active but online
cloaks are working as intended to avoid being caught this is just another afk cloaker whinethere are downsides to this being that the ships that can use covert ops cloaks are fragile and normal cloaks really dampen a ships performance there are plenty of counters to covert ships just because you cant think of them doesnt mean they dont exist
if you create a counter to cloaks make cloaked ships able to use all modules including gunsthen again youll whine more because someone killed you while you couldnt even lock him110 trololol
one unique idea as sort of a way to make covert ops somewhat more risky without making it too unfair is to create a new type of drone that does no damage but will orbit the ship that deploys them with a 25km range the orbit will follow an atom shape pattern rather than the typical circling pattern to increase the chances of catching something to compensate for the fact that theres only 5 drones they could travel extra fast speeds considering they carry no weapons andor give them an uncloak distance bonus depending on the size of the drone this solution may help discourage the use of cans and such
there are three platforms eve clientserver the forums and eve gatein the excellent recent csm posting the only must for the winter release was something that really had nothing to do with the winter release a forum feature i do not see any technical why that feature is tied to the winter release it could happen a week or month before or after i can think of reasons why i would not want to roll out new forums and eve client on the same day nor do i see a lot of tradeoffs isnt there a web team so more forumeve gate changes are not going to affect the zomg fix lag guyz team eve gate and the api may need some changes to the server but none to the client and some basic web changes to eve gate do not require waiting for a releasehasnt the eve ecosystem gotten more complex than one new clientserver every six months and shouldnt the planning reflect that
my only concern is characters with 0 sp getting 5 million may be too much having the same effect as a free playable character the reason theres no free sp in sisi anywayi believe the amount of sp should be scalable to a combined maximum of 25 of the players current sp or 5milthis would definitely get me more interested in testing things in sisias it provides strong motivation without giving god mode or making it better than playing on tq
pretty much what it says on the box assume n equals the quantity of identical drones if you launch a flight of n hammerhead iis the drones will be a single entity in space the model could be nnumber of drones in some closeformation for every 1n hp damage taken dps drops by 1n to simulate the loss of a drone if possible the drone stack will not be able to rep above that hp level ie you cant rep a destroyed drone once the drone stack is recalled the number of drones recovered from the stack correspond to the hp level remaining if for some reason you want to assign different drones to different targets the stack will split in to smaller ones prosserver has to calculate flight paths damage dealt and damage taken for only a fraction of the current number of entities  less lag less overview clutterless moving boxes in main viewcons more specifically unwanted sideeffectsa ship could lock all 5 drones by just targeting the stack instead of having to target each individual drone drone hp would be different from current model ie right now to destroy a flight of drones you go drone 1 shield  armor  structure drone 2 shield  armor  structure etc etc with the current model it would be drone 15 shield  armor  structure having a shield thats 5 times as big would certainly have some effect on the shield recharge and would give a pretty significant buff to drone hp finally it would be pretty hard to figure out where the hp level would be for loosing a drone a possible solution if game mechanics allow it to segment the shield armor and structure hp to reflect the number of drones and go down drone 1s three hp types then to on to drone 2s and so on
sounds like it creates just as many problems as it solves
explain to me why would i stack my drones if they can be killedlocked at once instead of 11nobody will do it
unwanted effects negative wing of drones can be ecmed as a single target maybe it can make even worth it tu use a tracking disruptor high damage weapons become much more effective killing 2 drones with one shotpositive you can rr a bunch of drones in one go
signednone of the issues you suggest are relevand in the type of warfare that would best benefit from this changein large fleet fights that isi just cant imagine anyone locking a drone in a 500 vs 500 fight in lesser fights  ie 10 vs 10 on a gate  it just dosent matter and everyone can use drones unstacked wo having big lag issues also
i dont give a  really about locking them 11 or all 5 but in 500 vs 500 fights smartbombing is common all drones in 1 place and you got smartbombing efficiency 500 upps learn to tick the support button
id like to propose an i wanna talk to a gm button wich would add players to a queue list to talk to a gm about issues that may be slightly more urgent than the 3 days a petition takes
issues like what exploits stuck petitions and billing propably has high priority already so im wondering what kinds of issues you see approriate for this new service remember that it has to be used only on extremely rare occasions or it will just become stuck and delayed like the normal petition queues also be prepared to issue mandatory bans for anyone abusing this tool for any other purpose than the one you will describe to it
that and the other items in that section of the devblog were the list we voted on whether or not to publish
the list is as underwhelming as we all feared it would be i am glad that the time the members of the csm and ccp put into this endeavor are paying off so handsomely
im not so much concerned by the content of the list i think theyre all good ideas and easy fixes but the fact that ccp only made one item a must and that was effectively changing a setting on their forum software not even directly related to the game tbh but i guess we have to see how seriously ccp takes the should issues and how many actually make it into the next expansion or if ccp isnt actually committing to any of these issues
background for the proposalhello i am kalindra naskan and im able to post this thanks to a friend having an active eve accounti was an eve player from 2005  2008 and is according to my account status no longer a part of the eve community but im sure the people i flew beside of or fought against will say differently i have stories to tell about what ive experienced and knowledge to share just because im not playing doesnt change thisfrom time to time also try to keep up to date with politics events and generally just the development of eve there is a problem however while i can read about everything i cant give my own opinion on the politics of eve i cant comment on the direction the development is going i can just read it is wrong that people thats part of the eve community when theyre not active players cant interact with the rest of the communityi know there exist fan forums but thats not where the core player base resides i believe that a member of the community should always be able to interact with all the others in the community even if theyre no longer playingthere are many reasons why someone is not playing anymore from disliking that it will take 18 months before there will be fixes for old content real life just doesnt work your way preventing you from playing or maybe even just pure burnout but as i laid out above they are still part of the communityi still feel strongly for eve online and the concept behind the game and recommend it for people that might like it because i know its a unique came that has a one of a kind community that is why i think it shouldnt be restricted to those only playing right nowto summaries the proposali believe that people that have played eve and been a part of it should be able to write on the forums if their account is inactivepositives of the proposalit is an invitation to all old players to rejoin the community and be a part of it again it might even inspire some to start playing againit can put ccp in a good light showing that they care about their community and wants to keep it togethernegatives of the proposali first asked ccp if i could get temporary access to the forums to post this proposal and i received this response from supportthis means that the forum login system needs to be modified in order for this proposal to work and while we can speculate only ccp knows how much work that entailsi also realize that there might be issues in deciding when a player should be counted as part of the community when he has paid for the first month or when he has paid for six monthsplease come with your own inputs and suggestions for this idea and more positivesnegativesregardskalindra naskan never ending member of the eve community
i personally dislike this idea as id rather there be direct consequences or the chance of ingame for people who post on the forumsid also not like to see another scrapheap challenge one is enoughhowever i must commend you on your proposal i wish everyone put as much thought and effort into their assembly post and its layouttamber
tldr no you are not a member of this community you have ties to it and some of its members and you care about the direction the game takes but that is all irrelevant to your posting rights on this forum and should remain so not supportedim not in favor of this primarily as this is an eve discussion forum for the players if you dont have an active account you are no longer a member of this community you maybe a part of another overlapping community and still have ties to some members of this one but that is not relevant to your posting rights on this forum even subscribers can lose that right and nonsubsribers should not have it to begin with also if you are not a subscriber i dont want to hear your oppinions on events and issues or hear your ideas and i dont want to see you or others like you trolling and spamming these forums with all sorts of nonsenseactive players should decide the direction this game takes and anyone else should have no say in the matter we also have enough active players to help people out so while you wanting to help out is admirable your help isnt really required there are other sitesccp twitter ccp facebook mmo sites scrapheap ect where nonsubscribers can talk about things with active players and there are other methods of staying in contact with your buddies if you want to influence the direction ccp takes either subscribe or have a member of the community post your ideas and oppinions
i have to agree with tamber while you and others myself at one point have things to offer the drawback of needing to be active serves as a minor deterrent to abuse from accountscharacters that no longer willcan have any reprisals against them for their work on the forums even now you need a posting alt to abuse the forums or face whatever fallout might come from your posts and unless you plan on never letting that account in a majority of corps can not give out your api to reveal that posting alt or continually recycle it and once in a corp cant use it as you may have in the past all that is if you care enough to do so with a non active account you are free from those if they would have even been any issue for you at all simply put either you reactivate post on another forum or move on from a game you arent interestedable to play anymore
as for the supercapcap ship issue which set off finns latest bout of indigestion a few thoughts much of the csms and other pilots are looking for ways to revitalize low sec various proposals to promote piracy avoid blobs fix bounty hunting keep out null sec alliances create commerce and the like have been floated some folks like irae seem to think that cap andor supercap ships are overpowered and work against some of these goals perhaps they are right now i really like moars idea about rethinking the role of faction navies in low sec while i wouldnt want to keep caps and supercaps out of low sec moar got me thinking about the neutral zone in st the federation and romulans would proportionally respond to an enemy incursions based in part on the proximity of the incursion to their respective borders so i started to think about a fusion of low sec the netural zone concord and faction navies as part of a layered response to the presence of caps and supercaps in low sec as a tentative idea it would look something like this concord and faction navy ships would respond to the presence of cap and supercap ships in low sec concord in 04 and 03 systems and faction navies in 04 through 01 systems the strength and speed of the response would diminish as the security status of the system droppedcaps would be engaged in 02 space and supercaps in 01 space the higher the security status of the system the more robust and fast would be the response of concord andor faction navies one can readily think about functional alternatives such as responding to caps or supercaps a certain number of jumps from empire restricting the ability to disrupt warp etc ill leave that to others there may be several benefits to adapting moars ideas on faction navies but to my mind the main one is that npcs could be used to achieve a better balance of cosmic elements without resorting to bans or nerfs of particular ships and their functionality in some ways this would be an extension of live events only with pilots fighting alongside not against npcs in this particular case pilots could still use caps and supercaps in hotdrops pitched battles and supply runs in both low and null sec doing so outside 0102 space however would have consequences that would increase as the security status of the system climbed alliances maintaining pets in low sec through the use of overpowered ships would not be advantaged as much as they were before the use of caps and supercaps by pirate and factional warfare fleets would be diminished to the benefit of small group pvp delilah wildfriendsofevewordpresscomtrolling contents removed jericho
enough with the ccp needs to make lowsec safer by adding a police force crap you seem to be proposing that concord hates all capital ships and supercapitals because theyre generically overpowered and it should expand its areas operation into lowsec well i have news for you1 youre talking out of your arse as you have no idea how many of these mechanics that you complain about work try living in lowsec before complaining about lowsec2 you have no idea how capitals and supercapitals are balanced or imbalanced currently the only problem involving capssupercaps is that a lot of lowsec fights end up with one side dropping supercarriers on the other side obviously to the detriment of the goal of smallgangs and piracy there are solutions to this however one of them is not some kind of vague nerf to capital overpoweredness3 concord only exists because ccp had to make highsec killings be penalized its a shame that you probably have the wrong reasoning associated with this but unfortunately theres a character limit and explaining to you why ccp would make unauthorized highsec aggression have such serious penalties would exceed it concord is not there to be your friend and savior it is there to blow up the jerk who blew up you it has no place killing capitals just because they exist in lowsec even assuming for some reason that capitals dont belong in lowsec ccp would be much better off simply preventing them from cynoing into italso your idea would mean chribbas veldnaught would have to get concordokken the next time he undocks in amarr because of where it is not because of its actions this is a fairly obvious indicator that your suggestion has some flaws in it4 this is not star crap academy this is eve 5 as mentioned previously this is eve htfu and try shooting someone before claiming to know how to adjust combat mechanicssadly im 99 certain already that my words will have no effect aimed as they are towards delilah wild as for the rest of you hopefully you can gleam something of value from this such as delilah wild is not someone who should be taken seriously when talking about combat
god perhaps
here is what i was thinking about  i know the idea has been around for awhile but this is my solution to it  let me know if you have any questions about it or other suggestions would like to see how many ppl out there would purchase an extra couple months here and there for there alts to train this would also give ccp a little extra boost in plex sales for charactersaccounts they normally wouldnt get tooscenario  i have 2 characters on 1 account character a i have continuously training skills since its my main and i want to be able to train character b on the same account for a month or two so i can get em flying an orca for example right now the only options i have is a stop training on character a and train the orca skills i need for character b b transfer character b off the account onto a new account then transfer em back after training is complete which isnt really an option suggestion  option c give plexs the ability to activate another character training slot on the same accountexample  i log into the character b while character a is training buy a plex ingame on use of the plex it gives me the option to use plex to extend subcription or unlock a skill training slot so character b which used the plex can now train along side character a after that skill slot time has expired account reverts back to 1 character training on the account and ccp makes more money and players get the option to train 2 characters on one account and make us happy 
dumb crosspost is dumbsecond crosspost is even dumber
please do not cross post the same idea multiple times in different forum sectionslocked
bumpplease solve this if nothing else make the sin have dampener bonuses and panther webtp bouses just for the hell of itbut mainly allow them to fit a covops cloak and all that good stuff
black ops needs some serious love hell  theres more titans flying around than bos probablythe jump range is a start but i think a little more innovation is whats needed with themccp please do something about them i dont know what you guys are playing at
nonsense you couldnt even hit firgs well with 90 webs under 5km back in the days with a neutron megaand they didnt even got abs
you know this because you having been flying nothing but blaster boats for years in pvp try it then come back and talk
not supported nude characters will look like crap even with todays 3d hardware and it has a good chance of ruining eves trating if it was done properly the whole idea will become uninteresting after only 3 days and is not worth the effort
supportedi dont see how putting the bulges in the right place has anything to do with complete nudity or making eve an 18 game if a gallente exotic dancer is wearing a bikini then their anatomy should equate to the back story end ofif people are calling for sexually explicit strip clubs then there is a separate issue that will exist irrespective of the dancers genitalia i personally have no problem with 18 areas such as you get in 2nd life but can only see that scenario being cost efficient for ccp if it attracts more subscribers at that point youve got at ask if those are the sort of subscribers we want to attract to the gameas for futanari it would be good to see it expressed openly in gallente stations it adds depth to racial differences and if anyone objects they can always play as an emotionally repressed god botherer
you do realize the exotic dancers are just pixels toons if you need that imagery buy a magazine you can keep open on the desk while you play the gamei have heard its all the rage to play eve without your pants on anyways pfunny proposal  i vote no
yes to genderbending traps absolutely yes to ending this hetronormative fascismfutanarino to nudity btw
heteronormative gender stereotypes are an amarrian principle if i had my way all the clothing and outfits in amarrian stations would be very gender specific and wearing clothes that did not match your gender and economical and social status would be punishable by fines or loss of standing however cross dressing in gallente station would be common and otherwise not a big deal you dont need nudity to add futanari to incarna i just put it in the thread as an optional term yes a gallente stripper with a great body nice boobs and a tasteful bulge would make the eve experience that much realer to me fable handles sexuality in a way that parents are not afraid to buy the game for their child in fable you can get married have sex get pregnant get aids and make decisions on contraceptives yet they do it in a way that has no adult content if eve did something like this where there was no actual nudity but there was however a clear text and visual indicator that the girl your looking at has both toys under the trunk then it would work
i like
i want one concordokkened special with extra omgwtfbbqsauce delivered to following address someone dev ccp pizza call pizza hut nao and commercialize this
you forgot the fitting screen and the shareable pizza fittings idea which was the best part about this
thread idea creative pizza fittings misc jokes are all awesome
i wonder about the logistics of supporting a pizza chain in more countries than just the us andor the eu but totally supported
i usually dont participate in offcopics in assembly hall but this is just awesome
if bungie and mountaindew can team up to make a halo 3 themed soda then i dont see why ccp cant do this atleast for a one time promotional thing anyways
yeah i see what you did there  so we have too many outposts  hm what to do  hell lets allow people to build even more brillant idea
this will hopefully never happen please dont do it be fair to the players that did  do spend the time on training those useless skills no really no please do notjust reimburse someone with other skills is not an option for me that i accept grow up and show patience people seriously
supported work this out ccp
supportedjust make it go away man
not supportedan alternativemake the acquisition of learning skills passive they climb to level 5 a little bit at a time while you train other skillsif you are training a skill that uses perception and memorythen while you stay in those types of skills your perception and memory increases
learning skills are pretty silly
not supported i like learning skills it should have more of them to make longterm plans of a characters skills more interesting
i dont want them removed but the fact that ccp as let csm put it in the in process on the mins and the fact that they showed a real tool for leting players place skill points were they wish makes be belive that its realy in the in process and ccp is for real this time as much as i hate thinking about that i will post how i would like it to go down1 add 10 points  10 to all characters attributes 10 points is the value of maxed learning skills 10 is a bonus to value gained by maxed learning skill2 remove all learning skillslike they never existed3 sp which player had been invested in learning skills will probly be be given back to the player just like they did before with the server down and they will probly give you all sps in all learning skills form all 3 toons but i think the tool is limited in that if you have max learning skills on all 3 toons thats 15mil sps that all 15mil  sps will be giving to the toon with the most skill points i think its becouse the tool is limited to giving it to only one toon on the account and the main toon is normly the one with the most sps so thats why thats just what i belive by want was seen of the tool beforemy main accout is just like that all 3 toons have max learning skills and 5 implants for fast learning thats 16128000 sps going to my main toon can we say instant cap pilot lolzthis is how i look at 16mil sps as 16mons worth of training time at max learning and 5 implants i train over 1mil sps each month my main toon will jump ahead 16mons worth of training time so this mite not be all that bad and it will make is super easy to train my alt toons on my other account as before i always spent the first 34 mons training first for 5 implants and then max learning skills now i can just train for 5 implants and jump right to what i want my alt to be doing
rocket drake does less dps than some destroyersi want my rocket drakes to be better supportedoh and my vengeance but mainly the drake
funny how people are using the gb2wow approach when its blizzards other game that could provide a fix diablo 2 had this nifty method of generating completely random maps  save for a few areas why couldnt eve do the same roll a few virtual dice and a complealty new mission is created that you wont ever see again in that exact form
because if missioning is your main playstyle in eve then you really do need to go back to wow whereas if you played diablo in singleplayer mode then you still played it in an acceptable mannerscam ransom play the market commit corp theft extort etc ransoming stupid missionbears and stupid miners is quite profitable missionbears play eve like its wow in space
even though i think its a waste of development time to create more missions  since doubling the number of missions would be a massive undertaking and people would still be bored again three months later anyway  i have to support this while ccp is at it they should proofread the existing mission text some of it is hilariously badif they ever implement sleeper ai and tools for it to use in normal missions oh how i will lol mission runners the majority anyway would be supered because they wouldnt be able to facerollsemiafk their way through missions anymore and the missions would take a lot longer
i thought open ended sandbox play meant people can play how they wanted and not be forced to play the way you want them to play
nuke the faction stuffsupportedi want to see a video of the agent trying on the meat suit at the end of the doll mission p
thisthe role required to change the material type of a silo should also be fuel technician not starbase manager or create another for it
nice ideassupported
two pieces of lowhanging fruit allow naming of pos structures the button is already there it just does nothing in the fuel screen show 0 for usage of the items the tower doesnt use charters or dont even show them at all
great list abdiel kavashand here changed narrowed down and sorted to my personal tasteaccess control personal divisions in the chas  smas hangar tabs in smas not needed if you have personal divisions access control based on individual towers currently when i want a person to be able to offline silos at one reaction pos i also have to give him privilegies to unanchor every other pos we control allow access to labs arrays etc to alliance membersand also based on standings allow acces to labs arrays to corp members without all the roles wallet factory manager etc i dont want my member to have acces to everything i just want to allow him to do some personal researchproduction currently its easyer to rent labs to alliance member than corp members allow forcefield access and using structures cha sma jb cynogens based on standingsimprove anchoring interface anchoring  onlining queue the box should not move when your ship moves give a visual indication whether anchoring here is possible  ie not too closetoo far away from the forcefield maybe turn the box red in invalid positionsui improvements allow renaming of all structures show the amount of ammo in pos guns somewhere without having to fly to each individual gun move the put offline button away from store ships on a sma and similar with other affected structures give ceosdirectorsplayers with necessary role a list of all the towers owned by the corporation and their locations planet moonother allow opening containers inside cha use take container role for that so i dont have to switch to industrial to open a gsc allow repackaging ships  items in a chasma allow assembling of t3 ships create a new pos array to manufacture possov structures or use one of the larger ones small issue you can anchor a tcu next to a pos but not a pos next to a tcu it should be either none or both didnt know that but it dosent make sence
the easiest way to stop pirates ganking you is to use t2 modules on your ships that your using to transport gear and dont put anymore than double the worth of the total ship into your cargo baysalternatively find out who their alts are and gank them back remember the videos the person you  off today can be your downfall tommorow pshave fun with the sand box and if you cant id suggest finding new game as its not gonna change imho
the insurance thing is being looked at most likely by next update you will no longer get insurance from concord suicides or from self destruction as wellwhich means only those pilots flying something worth more than the pirates ship and modules will get ganked
i support the idea i agree with highsec being just an illusion and keep an open mind to the idea
bump
i never noticed that i use null quite oftencompletely agree that 2525 is not nearly as good as 40but did anyone take into account the penalties of t2 ammoblasters get tracking penalty wich is the worst possible thing you can do to nerf a blaster boat ever since the web nerf you cant hit anything anyway and with tracking penalty its just ridiculousminmantar get a cap penalty big deal you dont fit a mwd because you have range and thats it you negated a penalty easyeditalso agree with a post aboveblasters and rails need to be boosted first then we can talk about fine tuning the balance
ive seen that ccp is adding a meta column to detail and list view what i would like to see is a volume column added so we can see how much cargo room each item takes up this would be added to windows for cargo containers hangar assets etc it would sum with stacked items so a group of three 5mUFFFD items stacked would show 15mUFFFD for that rowmy apologies if this has been proposed before
supportedanother related thing i would love  when you select several items there should be a display somewhere telling you the sum of volume of everything you selected useful for splitting stuff into cans or in courrier contracts
to prevent the upset of the 00 markets why not give the items sold through the store a corp tag of some sort so only the one who purchased the item could use itanyways good idea
not supported on the basis of eliminating 00 markets and market pvp
it isnt supposed to eliminate 00 markets or market pvpfor starters you need docking rights to get the stuff out of a non npc 00 station the fact that there needs to be a max limit in the same way that there is a limit on corp contracts would not remove the markets totallyit would however give corpsalliances a way to distribute things like skill books without them being subject to market pvp etcoh and previous poster  i think that would be a bit hard to implement what happens if you want to sell a ship the module is fitted to or the ship itself that you got from corpalliance store being able to set an order for a one off or once per time interval will stop people abusing the system in much the same way
you can already make corporation and alliance contracts any more of that and you will ruin 00 markets
i have a better idea or atleast a modification to this oneinstead of a corpalliance store add somethign so when your putting something up on the market you can click a chekbox and set a discount to corp members and even another sepparate discount to alliance members then when ppl form your corpalliance look on the broker they will see that some items up for sale are highlighted green and they will know someone from their corpalliance put the item up on the market at a discount for you and the listed price would then reflect that discountalso it would be nice if you could set a sepparate price modifier to selected corpsalliances and be able to charge them more for example if you dont like them and dont want them buying your stuff or atleast not without paying out the nose for itthese items would be listed as red on the marketi give support for this ver of the idea this way you wouldnt have to keep soem items off the general market inorder to sell just to corpalliance mates anyone can still buy but if they are from your alliance or an non liked corp they would pay the modified price
so you would rather put them in a hangar and give access to everyone who might need it as someone in an au timezone i often dont have someone online who has the rolesi repeat  this is not supposed to replace the whole market it is supposed to allow a limited amount of items to be sold to corpalliance under defined conditions
definately might make things easier for the inventory nodes too
hi sec is dangerous enough to try to make a living in what your suggesting would mean that every and i mean every mission runner would then be ganked regardless if they are worth it or not kill or the lols hulkageddon makes mining risky and sometimes unprofitable where expencive ships are totalled for the lolswhats next missiongeddon kill every mission runner you can find  would mean the death of eve imototally not supporting this idea hi sec is hi sec regardless if its dead space mission areas or not you gank players in hi sec expect to be ganked by the ultimate gankers in the game concord
you want to gank without repercussionsdoes your mommy still cut your food for yourofl
necroing threads should result in temp bans on these forums 
it use to be like that you know i would have no problems going back to that if they reverse the scaning changes back to the old days and reverse the protection that dead space gave to scaning as well to the old dayspirats get to try and find mission sites and bears can omost just as safely mission in low sec as high sec again i would have to go buy a dominix again and cheap fleet neutfit it again for low sec i like dominix becouse you dont need weapons o high slots realy you can put nuets and cloaking in high put the needed drones for killing mission pluse jamming drones in drone bay ya this old bear us to do alot of low sec missions in the old days the cloaking normaly gets the job done of saving your ship becouse all the mission dps retargets there pvp ship but neuts and jaming drones can help alot too

tldr people collectively need to know what it is that they cant do and what will happen if they do it once the exploits are known then enforcement can be much faster and more directcurrently ccps method of handling exploits seems to be lacking in several major areas that are essential for developing effective policies for a policy to be effective it must be clear visible and known to be enforced currently eve exploit policy doesnt fit any of those criteria very wellcurrently every individual person who discovers something they think is an exploit or bug is required to file a bug report and wait for a response if they have found an exploitable bug then they cant tell anyone else in eve to stop doing it because they are not permitted to publish anything about exploits this leads to every player in eve having the immediate defense of i thought it was working as intended for anything that they do it would be unreasonable of ccp not to take that into account when determining penalties for tos violationsexploits must be published via the login screen and forums if ccp is able to detect their use via server logs or if the exploit is a longterm operation if ccp is reasonably capable of confirming that a particular exploit has occurred then they need to publish those exploits and notify players that this action is not permitted ccp shouldnt publish how to perform that exploit but simple notification of the effects will allow normal players to avoid using themive always felt that ccps enforcement of exploits was far too lenient because players generally had little indication that a particular action was or was not classified as an exploit on published exploits better communication of minimum and maximum actions taken for violations would greatly improve the deterrent effect if for example the first incident of an account exploiting a published bug resulted in a mandatory 2month ban up to permanent banning or significant sp loss with subsequent violations having higher and higher minimum penalties until the minimum becomes a permanent account bansummary communicate existing exploits to players communicate significant minimum penalties for exploiting published bugs communicate rapid escalation of penalties for accounts repeatedly utilizing published exploitsedit a listing of bugs may also slightly reduce the number of petitions players open for bugs that are actually normal game mechanics
if youre too stupid to recognize an obvious exploit when you see one without having it spelled out for you you deserve to be punishedsee above assuming they were published however people who used the exploit anyway after being warned should receive a minimum penalty of permanent account closingmaybe one warning in cases where its not clear an exploit was use purposely or repeatedly otherwise permanent account closingsummary exploiters dont need special rights and protection not supported
waiting weeks for a gm response to a petition or a reply is crazy there needs to be a sense of urgency about petitions there is also the need for a maximum time for a petition to go unsettled before being elevated to a higher gm as it is i have been waiting for two and a half weeks for a petition to be settled
what are the details of your proposal what steps should ccp take to address this issue what do you believe the maximum wait time should beim actually going to contribute here in my opinion there should be a set of restrictions on what sort of issues may be petitioned frivolous petitions of which im sure there are many should be punishable by a weeklong ban for the first offense a monthlong ban for the second offense and a yearlong ban for the third offenseid estimate this would slash the number of petitions by at least a third and possibly even half or more
good questions actually an honest first response time of no more than 24 hours need to be in place i understand the volume of petitions but its not like ccp cant make a system to at least tell you where you are in the queue the other step they need to take is to clump petitions petitioning a glitch the system matches phrases and makes a single petition for the glitch reply goes to everyone or tells them to file it as a bug which needs to be do able from in the petition system honestlyget another 24 hour max response time when elevating the petition automatically elevates after x days 45 if the petition is not a bug report or not labeled as a non issue which brings in labeling how does ccp label petitions internally anyways a devblog on the actual petition process would be an interesting readin all no petition should take more than a couple of days tops to resolve there must be a sense of urgency in responding to people even a stern reprimand for being stupid is better than no response why cant the system send canned responses for things like getting scammed petition i got scammed in jita response awareness and common sense are key skills in eve it is your responsibility to closely examine any offers made to you please refer to link for more how hard is that
sounds goodonly noone knows what youre talking abouti dont feel like googleing for the minutes to find out exactly what youre talking aboutpost link quote explanation anything if you want a discussion about it
people have been grumbling about how much lowsec sucks for ages the csms are trying to address that and your first thought is to complicate matters unnecessarily by dragging vigilantes and bounty hunters into the equationlet them work on one clear issue at a time please they dont need everyone and his brother muddying the waters with his own personal vision of how things should proceed also hardly anyone gives a toss about vigilantes meaning theyre lowpriority the bounty system is a separate issue altogether and should be treated as such
there is no stated direction so it is not possible to change it even slightly butit goes without saying that if lowsec does get something like sovereignty for pirates that the same is available to everyone elsethe idea is to make it into the underbelly of society and that includes the hunters and vigilantes as far as i am concernedwe have some threads down yonder in fi about possible scenarios go give your input some interesting visions so far
agreed and apparently ccp zymurgist does too
in that case two things would happen ccp gets same amount of money because soemone payed for the plex so there is not lossthe idiot gets banned as buying hundreds of plex a month will atracks attention
not supportedi supply market with capacitor consoles its the only good salvage from sentient drones in drone regions and this t2 salvage materials are hard to get but still cacitor consoles are way to earn some money to drone region habitants we dont want to loose this source of income
while looking for something unrelated i stumbled upon this devblog
i support anything that would bring the cost of t2 downin 00 sec the value of a destroyed ship is important the values effect a pvp pilots winloss percentagesvaluehull costequipmodscargodestroying an expensive ship is a huge feather in your cap and each weeks stats include the 5 most expensive ships killedmost pilots will fly with t1 rigs or no rigs at all when in a blobt2 turrets are usedof course they do the best dps if your skills are maxed t1 or named turrets are used moreas to support equip some t2 is usedmwd invul fields damage controlsbut again t1 or named are used more oftenkeeps the cost of losing your own ship down and your percentages upnot to mention that you have to replace so many ships and modules if youre active with pvpthis of course may be different when low sec ganking high sec mission running would most likely be all t2i personally put the blame on invention my characters can invent and have invented but its a real pain in the assyou have to set up research agents for data cores but for the better research agents you have to invest in training the particular skillsif you want to invent a lot of different things you need a lot of different skills your chance of success is horrible if you havent trained each skill to level 4 use a t1 base item and the most expensive instructionsthen you need to scan down sites for a chance at getting the right parts for an invented item buildor buy them for a whole lot of iskyou can invent without instructions the top of the line give max runs but are very expensive if you need to buy them but your bpc will have only 1 runthe biggest complaint here is having to make copies of your originals because for some odd reason you are not allowed to invent of a bponot to mention the fact that a new invented bp is just a copydont forget the trouble to find open copy and invention slots and the cost of setting up and running those slots which does vary so shop around you will most likely have to wait in linethe research for time and materials on your original also effects cost of invention build again good luck on finding an open slot to research materialstime you can findneedless to say i invent rarely and only for my personal use not for mass marketingall this makes t2 cost too much
at least allow the cargo rigging to effect all bays
asarus atreyu kinda i guess you could view it as a booster for the shipgoose99 hell ya my macro has only been pullin 300 mil a day need to get back up to thet 3 bil aday markok sarcazm asside i think it would add a nice twist to the game and boost the economy win win
nope this would be another necessity to have for any pvp pilotboth boosters and overloading are very similar to this idea and each has its balancing side effect i dontt think another such mechanic is needed definitely not as a basically free stat boost

no horrible idea so youre waiting at a gate to jump a target and you run out of fuel because you waited and if you use just a little fuel and dont run out for hours then the idea is eaven worse because everyone will just put fuel by default every ship has fuel ammo and drones that would be the normon a similar note i did have an idea i didnt think it was worth posting so il post it here ship overloadingyou get maybe a 10 boost on everything ship related speed agility cap recharge shield recharge and ship bonusesbut like any overload you take damage hull damagethat would make active tanks without damage controlls more viable in pvp i think
not supported in its current outlineif a fuel tank can have a viable nonduplicating job or effect sure i would support it depending on what it would accomplishpossibly a tool for a last ditch effort to escape a bubble or scramit should not be an additional ship structure piece but a module for the low slotsits size and weight would logically add to signature radius and be a detriment to speed
not supported cloaks work fine as they are look at my proposal with the destroyer idea much better idea
thisand this
cloakies are in fact not impervious to attacks or counters nor are they invincible they do have to decloak in order to attack when that happens attack backif youre secretly referring to afk cloakers then theres nothing dangerous about them and theyre not deadly stalkers if they are stalking then theyre not really afk are they
lol
cloaking is fine as it isa cloaky ship specifically a frigate like a bomber wouldnt last two volleys toe to toe with a cruiser or bc unless it was rigged and tankedthen it would maybe be 3 volleys but the tanking would hamper its dpsif a cloaked ship jumps off a gate into a bubble there are very effective ways to uncloak itthey make good scouts but while cloaked they can warp but cant use mwd or shoot any modulesbuffs that need to be active to work wont activate while cloakedfrigate on frigate is fun10 bombers on 1 drake is funmostly single cloakers are scoutskeep an eye on your local and youll be fine dont rat by yourself with a nuet in systembasic stuff
issue players using local chat to determine if a hostile is potentially hunting them has no counter

the year is 2010 eve has been around since 2003this will not likely changegb2wow already
more eye candy i probably wont use it i do agree it would look quite nicefor awhileso ok its client side taking up the player computers resources and can be clicked offstill its highly doubtful it will be used much outside mission running too much going on in fleet fights with or without lag to have more stuff flying around ever seen 3000 drones buzzing about plausible idea for high end computer systems doing mission runningmaybe even some low sec ganking besides eve prides itself at being different to any other game and wont cookie cut effects attributes and such from another game if ccp wants something like this it most likely will take quite a while before it would be implemented and would be way down on the to do listccp still isnt happy with their explosions yetcare should be taking adding things client side or server side not everyone can afford hi end systems and probably most of the players have mid to lo end sytems not to mention the static systems in internet cafes people useits possible that only 30 of the players can run this game comfortably with all graphics settings at maxso if the idea is implemented but only 30 of the player base can or would use itit becomes a losing propositionif eve ever gets to the point that a customer needs to buy a whole new computer system just to play it most of the current base may leavelet some other things get ironed out first and in the future i might support this idea
definite yes
the reduction of the belts by 80 would put things back in par with the old days before the updates which as everyone knows was a total nightmare coming on to find practically every system in hi sec gone to macroersbest not to mess with the current amounts in the roids as it gives players who either solo mine or mine in small groups ie 2 or 3 personal accounts the chance to upgrade to larger better equipped ships and what the hell is with everyone wanting to shut down hi sec leave us alone stop picking on us care bears you dont live in hi sec we do
i can this about your idea having recently moved out to null and having to scan down hidden belts it is a  if this is a way to cause more people to stop mining it would be very effective for one the scanning interface is incredibly broken you have no grid to help judge where your probes are positioned also smaller things like ships are easier to scan out than a belt with rocks the size of a small moon till scanning is fixed all this idea would cause is frustration not make mining anymore interesting
i like the idea but any changes to the mining dynamic without careful consideration can cause a large decrease in output this would have an adverse effect on item cost and production0810 ratsfrigates0507 ratsdestroyers and frigatesretrievers and covetors should handle these ok hulks would have no problem with them players can tag team1 guard and one minersince every macro miner ive seen flees when they begin to take damage just infest more belts with a couple frigates more often the macros may end up fleeing more than miningtoo bad we couldnt warp disrupt only warp disrupt a macro miner without concord repercussionsi think we can get by without the cpu power grid and high slot buffsbut a plug in aimed at mining drone efficiency would be nicei also believe all ice belts located in sec 05 or above should be scanned down
posted in wrong place brother but here is an ideafind a friend or corp mate with good standing to amarr create a fleet and put himher in it and have them approach and do the scanning make sure you set rewards as shared
i think its quite simplethere isnt going to be a winter expansion this yearonly a plantary interaction patchand a useless new character creationand a patch for evegateand a patch for the forumsand if you put all that together and launch it the same day then you can call it an expansion so the players dont  how ccp mised this winters expansionall developers are too busy doing the real incarna expansion and noone has time to do any work on eve for this winteri might be wrong time will tell
you sound bitter
or you could release all three at the same time giving ample opportunity for qa to make sure the different integrations between the 3 platforms work correctly and also giving the devs a joint launch date to go by for all products related to eve
this may have already been postedon a recent roam my gang had a ship jump into us it was immediately bubbled scrammed and targetedits pilot realized right away the futility of resisting and ejected prior to the ships damage entering the structurea few of us myself included switched from the ship to try to target the podboth pod and ship were destroyedthe few of us that went after the pod were not included on the ship kill mail and had to be added manuallyit appeared that when the pilot ejected while the ships hp was relatively high and was not in immediate danger of destruction even though it was the game reset the ship as a new targetnew ship
supportedmaybe the numbers need tweeking but great ideayou spend a few hours testing and get 1 day worth of spbeta testers get paidif you want payng customers on beta tests pay themsp reward is a great ideaanother might be game timeif you spend your day testing instead of playing get that day of play time reimbursed but that would mean ccp actualy give money for beta tests so the sp sollution seams more reasonableany of these get implemented and ill be on the testsor maybe if ccp tests aplications that i develop then ill test their application for free

great ideathen a player would actualy be able to test stuff on the test server
enough trolling delilah its not entertaining and your la la la i cant hear you but ill keep talking about you in the third person routine is the kind of childish level of trolling we expect from you speaking of your continual trolling figured out yet how to post with your pvp main ya know as long as youre suggesting fixes to the game itd be nice to know youre not just trolling pvpers and you actually have a clue what youre talking about figured out how to post with that pvp main yet of course delilah knows what shes talking about i mean she loves pvp and has a pvp main account that for some reason she cant figure out how to post with certainly there are very good reasons to hamstring capital and supercapital pilots from getting anywhere near the lowsec chokepoints that allow them to jump tofrom nullsec there are very very good reasons why otsasai and the surrounding systems should be nogo systems for the northern coalitions capital fleet very good reasons surely and surely she can explain this once she figures out how to post with her pvp account that really does exist really as delilah is not a professional victim and a troll whos pretending to know about andor like pvp she knows that the easiest counter to supercaps on the field is to bait them out and counter them with a gank force certainly her argument is just a joke shes having a laugh and satirizing the patheticness of whining bears this is clearly misplaced deliliah is not a professional victim who would be better off playing on a pve server and she understands that gate guns and security status loss is already a perfectly sufficient method to make low security space less severe than empire but still a place where aggression has to be carefully engaged in clearly deliliah is a hardened pvper yes on her forum trolling account she has ravaged a grand total of nine enemy ships and lost 31 and yes her last kill was almost a year and a half ago and that was when she ninjad onto a kill while she was in a noob corp but shes obviously got a pvp main she just cant figure out how to post with it we know this because shes talked about how much she loves pvp its a certainty obviously ccp should look to such savage pvpers as deliliah wildest beasty killer mckillface when evaluating how to deal with the horrible problem of your enemies being able to bring bigger ships than you have ccp must protect the professional victims since they obviously cannot do it themselves its a tragedy a tragedy i tell you there may be actual tears
ps ccp should consider censoring this critique it might offend a few griefers
no no first you need to log out then you need to log in with the pvp main account of yours that exists honest i can see how youd mistake that for the rolleyes smiley however meanwhile i see youre up to your old sophomoric wordgame tricks now those who play a pvp game and arent professional victims who need ccp to save them from having to play on a server that isnt a pve server are griefers heavens to betsy
ps ccp might want to consider censoring this too
while your trolling is naturally off topic the meat of the subject stands on its own and is germane to the topicthose who do not pvp and more to the point not only do not understand pvp but are actually hostile to it are the last people who should be giving advice on the pvp dynamics of a revamped lowsec youve claimed before that you love pvp i contend otherwise i contend that you are lying and trolling and using your fictional love of pvp to cloak your antipvp hysteria a facade you let slip when you refer to pvp as griefing i have repeatedly called on you to stop trolling and either admit you were lying or post with this pvp main that you claim exists but it doesnt exist because youre trolling and you can only respond by rolling your eyes what with all your mighty 9 kills the last of which was about a year and a half ago now along the same lines you are trolling with your traditional antipvp crusade masked with a lets improve things for everybody baitandswitch now you want to nerf the ability for thousands of players to ever get their billion isk assets out of nullsec close enough to highsec to refit andor conveniently transfer items lowsec can use some help but not from people who want a pve game theyd be happier playing a pve game as there are many on the market
the number of lowsec entities that can credibly threaten a supercap is vanishingly small even allowing for batphoning
the posts from the usual suspects are classic and follow a wellworn pattern  personal insults and empty assertions masquerading as argument pointing this out wont stop it because some people always have to have the last word and there is no social context to encourage responsible behaviour on their part im hardly the first to point this out nor the first to notice that such posts exemplify the definition of forum trolling still what motivates such an intense animus is a mystery to me the intolerance dogmatism and hostility are palpable indeed apart from noting these characteristics there is little to nothing in such posts worthy of a response ccp has been particularly active on this thread censoring comments like this one and by comparison encouraging ad hominem attacks perhaps pointing this out will get one or more of us banned from the forums so be it delilah wildfriendsofevewordpresscom
possibly true but even if so so what if lets say lowsec residents were even weaker should we ban all armor hac fleets from lowsec since they couldnt properly counter them the fact that the tactic has a viable counter is what means that a nerf isnt necessary although the professional victim crowd want a nerf because they still think its ccps job to make sure that all combat is fair i will admit that is a hillarious bit of trolling whining about foivas pointing out your were talking ignorantly about game mechanics or me pointing out that you were lying about your pvp main account figured out how to post with it yet youve posted a personal insult about the usual suspects and tried to simply handwave away all the arguments that show your argument is full of  with empty assertions since other than trolling youve got nothing posting a contentfree whine about other posters just so that you can respond and have the last word and complaining about how they have to have the last word is icing on the cake high comedy of course responding to you and showing the holes in your argument isnt trolling and why would it be but your behavior like lying about your pvp experience figured out yet how to post with your pvp main account that really does exist or responding to people pointing out that your hatred of pvp is based on a lack of knowledge about game mechanics with snide babbling about griefers and such while you ignore everything thats actually posted that is trolling why dont you try responding to the arguments rather than trolling the people making them then its hardly rocket science here are some you lack a basic understanding of lowsec mechanics and the situation is not one of unbearable imbalance but that some entities are able to drop supers on their enemies due to having more assets you lack a basic understanding of how 00 space interfaces with lowsec and your proposed nerf to capitals and supercapitals would make logistics and staging locations almost impossible for anybody with a capital ship whod need to use wellworn ports of call concord is there to punish aggression not save people at all and the mere fact of a capital or super existing in lowsec is not aggression and not a valid cause to remove someones ship even if letting caps and supers into lowsec was a bad idea its not using star trek and muddled but in another scifi storyline type of thinking to justify horrible changes like making low security into modified highsec where faction navies will respond and try to kill all aggressors misses the point and displays an ignorance of what makes eve unique besides there are already star trek games some which are single player games so you can avoid pvp and those who engage in it who you call griefers eve is deliberately a darwinian struggle for territory resources ships kills etc if the complaint is that some parties have morebiggerbetter ships than you do someone who understands eve will try to adapt and overcome a professional victim who doesnt understand eve and who would do better in a single player game andor on a pve server will not have to worry about unfair fights to which their reaction is to demand that ccp protect them from other players playing the game as intended my opponent has shipstacticsnumbers that i cant counter ccp save me is the argument of a professional victim not someone who plays eve and is confident in their ability to play the game

so i was flying my hookbill the other nightwell it was about 4 weeks ago actuallycaldari navy standard launchers x 3caldari navy missiles  all flavours caldari navy bcu in 1 of the lowsall missile skills at 5cutting a long story shorti was kiting a daredevilhad him pointed  disruptor  and outside his scram  web rangelooks like it should have been a winkinetic missiles could not break his tank not even overheatedswitched to explosivelost bonus and still could not break his tanksighid like to know of a frigate hull that does more dps with lights if there is oneproof positive that bonuses on cmbs are badif the full bonus had been granted to piranahas it would have been enoughbut the low base damage of missiles compounded by the inferior bonus granted to non kin missiles make killing active tanks very difficult
all ships have different damage type characteristics may this be their resistances or the type of weapons these can fit the kinetic damage bonus is simply a special bonus which gives the game more complexity changing it to a mere damage bonus reduces the complexity of the gamenot supported
i support this caldari only receive the kinetic bonus the hookbill is the only ship i know off which has a more generic boost with 20 to kinetic and 10 to the remaining damage typesgallente get their drones buffed independently from their origin a myrm pilot with bc4 will buff his drones with 40 more hp and damage no matter if its a hobgoblin or a hornet which is a caldari dronein my opinion a damage boost would even out the capabilities of caldari it just doesnt make sense that the race which is considered to be relying in missile spam does not know how to handle anything else but kinetic missiles
yes ccp please remove the learning skills asap its a complete insanity that you have to spend a month training a skill which gives you no real gain except if you plan your skills years ahead i have 2 mil sp in learning and everytime i look at them i rage hard due to the time spent on training sht when i could have trained something fun i spent months training learning skills wo actually playing cause i felt i had to in order to be able to enjoy the game god just remove the skills so no one else has to suffer through the same horrible experience as i did when i first started this game please hurry up too
not supported learning skills are fine as they are
seriously do not do this just think about the futurewhat comes next  reduce the rank of capital ships to rank 5 and advanced spaceship command down to rank 2 and everything because people dont show patience
learning skills do more harm than good out with them
leave learning skills the way they are
added two cons submitted by fat freddy and another poster from shc reworded the pro and one con to make more sense original article hereto support this proposal i have resigned from the csm as 1st alternate say no to microtransactions keep eve awesomeproposal dont allow the trading of plexs for extra neural remapsthis is not a proposal that is against new neural remaps but the way they want to introduce itpros there wont be a new ccp mechanic that allows some players to benefit more ingame than otherscons real money trading happens regardlesspeople with more money can buy and sell plex ingame and get an advantage alreadyccp has more plex to sellpeople can buy characters with iskthis feature could possibly help fixing skill messups and lazynesswtf
the feature is cash for a skill point advantage a step in the wrong direction for the only thing of value in this game  skill points over time

very disappointed in ccp for proposing this measure whatever happened to doing good business instead of screwing people out of every little buck you can get sure this will make you more money but it leaves a very sour taste in most of your customers mouths
ccp goes rmt and develops the first step towards a micropayment systemno thanksthis idea violates the spirit of eve and hurts the feelings of many players because we dont want to end like other f2p mmorpgs with a micro payment systemso long phenom
very bad idea real money for ingame advantage is already rampant with plex rmt and character sales that have exploded because of plex ccp please do not make the situation worse by adding another mechanic that allows those with the financial resources to gain an unfair advantage over those who dontsigned this petitionzr
do not wantea dangerous precedent indeed
ccp you are smart but very likely not as smart as you think you areyou opened the can of worms that is plex so now htfu and deal with itprops for trying it out tho it was a daring move i give you thatif it turns out plex is a bad idea mantf up and get rid of it entirythis is not only a lame way of dealing with it its also dangerous to your game
not cool ccp
wtf ccp
why are this a bad ideaall it dos are helping people like me there after a half year of intmem finds out that one of the other races has been buffed and are the new fotm so now i have the choice between dont join the zelot gangs or train with 1515 in perwillhopefully this will change if ccp makes this change but remember that right now its just a thing on sisi ccp has not said if this is are for tq or just for testing on sisi
just like a mouthfull of horse spunk do not wantat least not on a week night
noooo very bad idea please dont let this happen to this game your going to take a game where players excell because of hard work dedication and time put forth to achieve goals and ruin it by giving an outstanding advantage to people with lots of money xp sp should be earned through time not paid for by people who dont wish to dedicate time to this great game so ccpwtf are you thinking dont ruin a good thing to make more money
wtf ccp
signed
remap for plex horrible idea that is all
wtf no
although i can understand that ccp is ultimately a business aimed to make money this is something that will hurt your standings with your valued customersi for one have been playing this since inception so i would not appreciate the idea that some one can actually get to my levels of skills on multiple characters by using rl cash yes the option is there for all of us to use but some of us actually do have rl to financially worry about and use this game as a means of escape not of more financial imprisonmenti personally detest this dea and hope ccp comes to its senses that cash is good but loyalty is much better
tell you what ccp its your game you can kill it if you want id be bummed because i think even with the bugs its the best mmo ever still though if it gets to the point where only rich peoples brats willing to shell out all their hundreds of dollars in allowance are able succeed in the gameill move on and do something else and youll have to entertain those brats with something other than players for i doubt ill be aloneyoure already competing with some major new deals coming out if i have to pay to play and pay to be competitive it just wont be worth it anymore youre already pushing the boundaries of my tolerance by requiring us to subscribe multiple times to have characters in different professions and in fact you almost lost me at the start when i was trying to figure out what i wanted to play and wasnt able to test different things at the same time now that ive played a while im actually starting a new account have purchased plex to sell in game etc but theres a limit to how much im willing to budget to a gameitd be a bummer to have to quit eve because the company behind it decided to get more money not by increasing subscriber base and fixing problems that make people go away but my trying to wring ever more dollars out of the people remaining itd be a bummer but you can bet good money that every single one of us has a limit to the amount of crap well put up even for a game as good as evewant to change the sp mechanic id be the first to support it i failed to get my gf an avid mmo player to bite into eve because of the forever wait to play you cant even spend more time pushing the leveling faster it kind of sucks to have a character that you have to brew for 6 months before its ready to do anything interesting so change it all you want but dont make it cost extra to speed up the process thats just being greedy
this
am i the only one who doesnt really see this as such a major issue you can already buy plexes and buy a character with that isk that has loads of sp how is this that much different
because now there is a way to generate sp faster by throwing money at it
no you are not alone and its the exact same thing real world money buys you an advantage ingame
no ccp no
wtf ccpis blizzard buying you out cuase this sounds like a blizz thing lol cmonno selling of anything that gives ingame advantages to one group of people over another
it doesnt mean that further perpetuation of such things are good for the gameamong other impacts it widens the gap just that much more between newer players with not much isk or rl cash and longerterm players who have had time to grow their isk reserves a slippery slope and a bad precedent in my opinionsupporting tamberjust say no to neural remaps for plex unfortunately this proposal will not be old enough by sundays meeting to raise it then but i will raise it in the following meeting if no other csm beats me to it
noone needs micropayment it is bull and always will be
confirming we do not want micropayment
gametime and portrait change are acceptable uses but character transfers and remaps are out of the question these would devalue the eve experience for reasons already stated

what the fk ccpseriously this idea is bull
wow possibly the single dumbest thing someone could possibly implement the only dumber thing would be walking instation seriously though ccp please do not go through with this
lmaoagreed please do not do this ccp
plexes are bought and sold with isk as such i dont support this threadliang
and no
this makes me and who knows how many other eve players believe ccp is heading in the direction of microtransactions which are one thing bad oh so very very bad
they are also brought into the game with real money
my good god what is going on here i mean if someone lost 74 plexes in ship could you imagine someone being able to remap literally every week in order to get into that titan i support my serbian leader
wtf ccp
wtf ccp
i strongly want plex gone its ridiculous that rmt is legalised by them want a titan well just get out your credit card unfortunately too many people on the otherside of the transaction like the idea of playing eve for free and plexes were cleverly marketed as a solution to rmt before enough people realised it was akin to governments selling methadone in every corner shop to solve a  edit diamorphine epidemicbut thats no reason not to resist further steps down this spiral or it wont be long before subscription 20 is a reality infact this change would basically be a mild version of subscription 20 pretty ironic that it was only a little over 2 years ago ccp joked about it to emphasise that eve didnt have a crappy pay model like other games im posting with the forcedassumption this is actually true cos right now im not believing it
supportedat the very least missions that incur a standing loss with a high security faction due to combat  ship kill should not initiate the 4hour timer nor incur a standings loss for declining itif thats not practical then remove combat  ship kill losses from targets in missions or make the losses much smaller
1signi have also stopped doing missions a long time ago after ive done the cosmos mission content which i enjoied a lot but i can do only once plz add more common missions in that style including scanning hacking for example and stuff
thiswe are not the faction warfarers you are looking for
the missions do suck and are overly repetitive and predictablehowever any changes to them such as l4s need to be done carefully you cant make them harder without introducing more reward and right now its not a great idea to make l4s any more rewarding than they are nowof course the biggest improvement to missions should be allowing the placement of agents in 00 outposts this should be a system upgrade option you do that and you can have an entire alliance able to support itself with just a couple systems
youre wrong eve is a multiplayer game where other people can interfere with your playstyle they can pee in your sandbox so to speak plus eve is a mainly pvp sandbox game pve only exists to support pvp so if youre an isk farmer then youre playing eve wrong eveb though its a sandbox
eve would feel so much more refined if the camera drones didnt spontaneously change position when you jump or undock this issue becomes a safety issue when you are in a pod because the camera drone moves in so far that it takes a minute to zoom out far enough to see danger and you have to do this every time you jump loosing a battle in 00 this can get very annoying if you have to travel very far to get back to your ships and if you fix this it would be nice to be able to anchor the drone so it turns with the ship pleasedont forget to check the support this topic if you like it people
its called an overview it shows you everything on gridalso ive never had this problem it seems to stay zoomed out at a constant distance for me im thinking this is either a bug youre experiencing or your client is having issues
i do not see the need for an office in this proposal but i support the idea on the basis of adding a corpalliance visibility option to the market orders
they actually started to do something like this for the empyrean age expansion called a storefront then they pulled iti like the idea you should be able to offer items for sale exclusively to your corpalliance such membership club stores exist in real life ie sams club and there is no reason why people who own space shouldnt be allowed to own their own market if the market pvpers want to compete the open market is still there they will just have to price their crap fairly if they want sales
i raised this proposal in the last csm meeting and it passed unanimously the wiki for it is here if youre interested the voting record for csm5 is here
yep and in pos hanger too
5 years ago you where lucky to encounter 1 capital ship in a fight speed up to today and entire fleets consist of capital ships  and even more so there made up of carriers and supers with the only viable counter being a bigger fleet of the sameto that end i suggest a new sub capital platform capable of taking on capitals directly  the capital contender the ship is simple  a tier 3 battleship hull that can field 4 large turrets and 1 xlarge turretwhat makes this ship different is that as a role bonus if its xlarge turret fires at a capital class ship it does x20 damage and x40 for super capitals reasoning could be a special launcher system that hyper accelerates the projectile causing massive damage to the thick hulls of capital ships while passing right through  so causing less damage the comparably paper thin armour of sub capitalsthis would give a platform that could engage capital class ships while not creating an overpowered ship in high sec
they call them dreadslook it up
after all the devastating feedback in fi it was definitely a good idea to move on to assembly hall
i dont know where your coming from to the best of my knowledge i answered all the question and made sure that none of the scenarios that where suggested could happenfor those who want to know this was the post
pretty much this
not supported at alla im not sure if its possible in the game engine to give a bonus to firing at certain ship classesb this ship as you describe it is ridiculously overpowered it does a full dread worth of dps to caps and 2 dreads to supercaps nobody would ever bring anything else to a supercap fight and capitals would melt in seconds if these only required bs skills  xl weapons because you could fleet up hundreds of themwhat you might be able to get away with is a sort of minidread bs for cap warfare using dread guns and increased dps relative to normal dpsfit bses but bs ehp flesh out details on a new system before coming back to assembly hall with this an anticapital bs isnt an especially bad idea but the details here create something incredibly overpowered and may not even be possible the assembly hall is intended for relatively complete ideas

ok i havent made up my mind about the topic but those are the cons i can think of when neuted you still need to reactive them which makes combat more active under neut theres gaps in the time you can activate them thereby lowering your ehp in the case of drones that also means you cant dispatch your drones to large distances until youve reactivated the items you cant activate modules while cloaked so when decloaking theres a gap under which you dont immediately gain full combat potential while the damage control is activatable in warp i believe thats not the case for the drone control unit more gapsin essence the reason one would want these items to become passive is exactly the reason they could be argued to stay active one needs to pay attention and go through the trouble of activating them one needs to do something to gain full combat potentialin these 2 cases i wouldnt be in favour of increasing their cap requirement but i would lean towards keeping them as they areas a potential sidenote but is probably not important i used to purposefuly leave some hardenersdamage control inactivated to give the enemy the impression he could kill me then activated them before he could do so to give my other character some extra time to dish out damage before the ennemies decided to switch primary
i have noticed that there is no mention in all these proposals about putting increased effort into fixing bugs im not tanking unbalanced items like rockets or deficiencies like not being able to view fits on inactive ships but programming errors the csm likes to put proposals into one sentence stories so what im an talking about could be stated like thiswhen a player jumps though a stargate the client will not crashwhen at a mission site stations will not be big red blobs like this
how is this a proposal this is like saying proposal make pigs fly
i support nothing ever going wrong ever anywhere in the world againi also dont expect it to ever happen or ccp to become gods that can predict how their code will behave throughout the known world on every piece of hardware with all software that run alongside it or how every single line of said code works with each other over the many years eve has been in development
jumps through a gate oh look my client didnt crashthat looks like an error on your pcs end not on ccps end update your drivers etc etcdo you mean something besides i dont want to hold my shift key down all the time with that because reallyare you holding the shift key that longsigh how about proposal lock troll threads before they startps not supported
seems we could never expect all the bugs to be killed but surely things can be better than they are now ive got many of those same bugssupported
ok there are a total of 6 varietys of turret based weapon in the eve universe  yet all of them are simple a use gun on ship button that fire of some sort of shot and then damage is applied with the only difference being what type of damage and how far i can hit you its old and could use some spicing up so to sayprojectilesartillery  artillery no longer have an optimal range but have a fall off of well as far as you can see before a ship leaves grid so at least 250 km as artillery are nothing but a massive slug launcher i see no reason why if i shot at a target 200k away why if my bullet hit it i would do no damage in response to this range increase the fall off calculation would be changed to make it so that you simply hit more often the closer you are to the target while missing 34 of the time at max grid range with the targets speed being taken into account you would hit a ship sitting still a lot more than if it was moving to compensate for this artillery may need a damage boast auto cannons  auto cannons at current really dont seam to match there name sake there simply a gun that fires every 10 seconds or so  so there more just a cannon to me auto cannons are like common day assault rifles in vehicleship form firing 1 or more bullets every seconds or so that big tank thing in terminator 1 had what i consider auto cannons as we cant simply have a actual shot every 35 seconds as both the severs and the eve community would hate me we would introduce constant damage  think of it like how we web some one when you activate your auto cannon against the target it gets a stat condition of 1 type x constant damage which will cause it to lose x hp every second with out having to call the server to do it using 8 auto cannons would give you a 8 constant damage doing that much more at a graphic point a hail of bullets would bombard the target shiplaserspulse lasers to me pulse lasers are like star wars with the firing every few seconds  again we would use the constant damage approach vs making every shot a single call to the serverbeam lasers sound like they should be a constant beam vs just a quick blast again we would use the constant damage approach to get this to work but other wise its okhybridsrail gun rail guns in most games not mass effect have always had 1 thing in common they where big heavy weapons that fired shots insanely far and at high damage  but had a long cool down that said increase the range and power of the rail gun but make its cool down time is longer and based on the total range of the shot controlled by ammo a shot that fires 40k will do the same damage as a shot that fires 240k but will be able to fire a lot faster due to reduced cool down of the gunsblaster as if i recall correctly the best blasters out there cant hit beyond 10k unskilled i dont see why they cant be retuned for maximum targeting that said all blasters gain a huge boast to there ability to hit ships and it only gets bigger the closer they get this will give blasters there edge over the other weapon systems while still confining them to the own little circle of doom and yes this means that bs equipped with blasters will be able to target sub bs sized ships but it also means that they have to be within 10k to do it  and if a frig cant out run a bs  there doing it wrong
your constant damage idea wont work because it still has to distribute all those calls and distribute the damage ticks and distribute the stop ticks even if it were to work welcome to a whole new world of desynching
the whole point of constant damage is that it doesnt need those calls  both client and server know that if the target is under the effect of say 3 5 damage that every second it will take 15 damage when the ship dies or the damage stops there will be calls made but not any more than normal should so switch targets or get blown up yourself
epic facepalmthere is utterly no such thing as constant damage in eve onlinei suggest you trash your proposal and take the time to study the mechanics of landing a hittrust me its a hell of alot more complicated than you think it is palill give you a hintgrab a bag of dice roll one for whether you hit or not roll one for whether the shot actually does some damage or all damage or no damage roll one for resistance of damage types one for each roll one for tracking roll one for signature radiusroll oneget the message yetwelcome to eve online
thinking a little to much in the box eh oh wellhave you stopped to consider that a direct shot is not the only way damage can be dealt to a ship in game think about it using a warp disruptor as an example when you activate it it puts a status effect on the target that the server knows is there and so does the client why could ccp not create a status effect that simple does x damage every second i mean you can stack warp scrams on a ship this would be no different
moar dots moar dots
you call your idea thinking outside of the boxdo you even understand the concept of what you speak oftell you what lets get some pvpers in here and some yarr types in here and see what they sayand then will talk about your so called outside of the box concept which is in itself completely and utterly full of failby the way eve isnt halo its 3 dimensional space combat involving a massive number of variables that range from your skills to the targets skills to the modules and then the various factors of speed and everything else in thereyou continue to ignore those factors your going to get laughed out of here very quickly
warp disruptorsscamblers dont work like that they do not induce a status when activated they put on points which can be countered via warp core stabs or inherent warp strengths deep space transports for example have 2 warp strength allowing them to warp even if 2 disruptors or a single scram has been put on themif an aggressor is disruptingscramming a victim ship and is ecmed the points will still stand until the module has completed its cycle after that the points are lifted and the victim ship can merrily warp offedit not supported
i seriously considered that and it was my first reaction too however there are stupid people that dont read things and ccps primary purpose as much as you might not like to think about it is trying to run a business and turn a profit accounts that are permabanned are almost certainly lost revenue if this happens to someone and the account is significantly valuable to them then they may seriously ragequit with their other accounts too leading to an even larger loss repeated andor persistent violations of tos agreements is a good reason to give up likely future earnings but one incident really isnt from ccps perspectivehonestly stating any kind of minimum penalty for any exploits would be a better deterrent than what ccp has right now the main issue id like to see changed here is for ccp to actually talk to the players about this process right now they seem to take the attitude that trying to ensure as few people as possible know about these issues is an effective method of dealing with iti understand where youre coming from but i dont think it makes sense from their standpoint
half my problem with all of these discussions is that ccp often ignores exploits after they are found and leave them there until someone really does take advantage of them before they go and do anything about it making it public is the only way it ever gets dealt withmonkeyspherethread
me supportedas a player i never know if something is an exploit or not and even when i think it might be an exploit i cant look at a list of exploits somewhere to find out i can only file a petition to find out and to be surei did that a lot in the past years and nearly always a gm told me not its not an exploit its normal game mechanics i now found out more nice little game mechanics and as long nobody is telling me thats its an exploit and giving me a personal warning i will treat everything what i will find out and really is not an obvious exploit as normal game mechanicsusing key macrosusing webbers on freightersusing mining crystals without rigsusing rigs inside ships without skillscorp hopping to avoid wardecsscams with blueprintcopiesusing trade mechanism for scamming peopleetc
this is not an exploit eve by iteself allow you to use macro keyes ctr  ed for drones etc hit esc and youll find how to activatechange some themnot an exploit you can web pretty much anything and will have the same effect would be an exploit if it was doable only with freighters mining crystals dont require rigsdunnonothing wrong with changing your corp you cant ban thisif you get scamed its your own fault blindness and stupidity cant be banned its the same thing like having a red in system and you keep doing that 1010 plex with your xtype fitted tengumarket is free in eve you can sell your staff at any price you want nobody forced you to buy from them
ccps method of handling exploits seems to be1 get a bug report from someone detailing it ignore it2 x corpallianceplayers take advantage of the exploit over time and make themselves silly rich3 someone else discovers the exploit and goes public with it4 ccp shoots the messenger and makes an example of the more egregious beneficiaries to cover up their own embarrassment and incompetencetheyve done this over and over and over t20 the ferrogel exploit etc what needs to happen is there needs to be a gm team that deals with exploit reporting exclusively who has the ability to grab resources immediately to investigate and patch them
none of the items on your list are exploits the only really questionable one is the corp hopping one and the only time that becomes an exploit is if you disband the corp and then reform the same corp immediately simply leaving one corp for another is not an exploit  even if it is a pansyass way out of a war dec

first this is not a nerf cloaking thread far from it  currently cloaking is tricky on one hand it makes you invincible on the other the ships that use it best are paper thin and 1 module can destroy any cloaked ship that said read belowcurrently cloaking is a its either on or off attribute you see me or you dont and once you see me i cant cloak so generally pop to this end i suggest a modification to both cloaking itself and the module cloaking becomes a strength check vs yes or no every cloaking device can produce x amount of field units per second with a ship requiring a certain amount of field strength to completely cloak a ship is considered phasing if its trying to cloak but not fully cloaked a phasing ship is still lockable and can be shot at but doing so only deal 10 of normal damage as well as reduces the fields strength by xthis will open up the market for faction cloaking devices and multiple meta levels eachthe second change comes in the form that cloaking devices are know scriptable and you can have more than one fitted and active at a timeslave script  forces the cloak to pull data from a none scripted cloaking device in essence becoming a passive module that increases the field strength the other cloak produces every secondgate script  causes a gate to partially misfire when you use a gate causing you to land between 50100k away from the gate rather than in the gates 15k catch zoneoverdrive script  requires at least 1 scripted and 1 none scripted cloak both of the convert ops class to be installed this script causes the ship to enter the cloaked state as soon as possible after gateportal jump in essence players land in system using there own cloak vs jump cloak the module this script is loaded into is considered passive like the slave scriptthis will have both pros and conspros any covop ship is no longer guarantied dead if he jumps and some on on the other side has a auto targetercloak users can be even more sneakycloak users can attempt to cloak even when target locked  and by installing more cloaks with the slave script they can winconscloaking becomes more effective
i find your ideas quite intriguing where may i sign up for your newslettercant say this is bad or good but certainly interesting
let me get this straightyour not wanting to nerf cloakbut now youve turned into some sort of shieldewar hybird module and made it 5 to 10 times more complicated than it really is
the cloaking device is very easy to figure out and you fail to see it as it is1 its ability to completely make you invisible comes at a pricea all of your ships modules are disabled and rendered inert for the duration of the cloakb you move at an penalized speed not taking bonuses into accountc you cant target quickly when you drop the cloakd if someone locks you before you cloak the cloak is blocked2 covert ops class ships can warp while cloaked all others cant use warp drive3 cloaked ships as stated before are completely unable to do anything but sit there and watcha they do show up in local but thats only if its in ks known spaceb covert ops cloaks are very tasking on cpu load so any ship that fits one has to make room for itc most covert ops cloak ships if not all generally are not that great of a combat ship unless its a very special niche ie stealth bomber and even then they typically do better in packs and not 1vs1 unless the pilot is very clever and typically they seek soft targets4 cloaking is harmless unless a you get into the targets mind by making them utterly paranoid and just sit thereb you fail to watch your six and dont have a wingmate to keep you clear of pestsc you fail to remember the most important rule in eve online neverstopmoving5 cloakers in a pvp context a typically are not what you call a solo wtfpwnmobile they have to roll the dice on timing and their prey and usually they only get the first kill second and thirds are rare and only happen when your surrounded by idiots obviously not the cloaker in questionb cloaking devices fail whenever they encounter an physical object within or at 2500 meters this means that if they bump into anything at all including a beacon they are exposed drones gate guns etcc cloaking devices are not immune to damage this means if someone uses an area effect weapon you will take damage smart bombs and space bombs are very deadly even though you may not be revealed your going to take it in the shorts been there done thatcloaking devices have one purpose in mind stealth thats itto take it any further than that is a total and complete waste of timeits not supposed to be a iwin button its not supposed to be made more effective its not supposed to be something that expires its just a simple onoff switch with a set of rulesrules that can easily be used to come up with very effective counterstrategieseve online is a game of risk not of easy wins

not supportedwe already have different types of semi cloakthats the small signature fitted unscannable ship with the right eccm fitted ship you are also cloaked so i dont see any need for more cloaking typesbut you have nice ideas and in fact they are interesting but there is so much more important work to do then changing the way of cloaking ccp shouldnt focus on that imho
i think a better way to deal with afk cloakers would be to start with a base chance of 100 immunity to scan decay over time that the ship stays in the system without dropping the cloakdecay rate 15 minutes of 100 immunity to scan then after that your chance to be scan increases by 10 every 5 minutes to the point that after sitting in a system without leaving it or deactivating and reactivating cloak you become visible at 105this way would still make scouting possible as would the use of cloaks for what they were intended for in fact sitting cloaked in local to grief the local population would still be possible since to reset the timer all you have to do is decloak and recloak but it would require you to be at the keyboard because after 30 minutes or so you are likely going to be able to be probed out and killedmy problem isnt cloaking its that people are being rewarded for doing something that takes no effort has no risk and that they dont even have to be at the keyboard to do
supported if cloakers cant carry regular cyno but gain 10 cloak ammount if carrying covert cyno
incorrect not supportedyou should just request a new module that phases ships to do what you essentially want and leave cloaks alone they work as intended the idea of fitting multiple cloaks makes no sense to me there are few ships with a slot for a dedicated cloaking device the others are all weakened by the presence adding a 2nd compounds the issue for a cloak that might not even be complete a phase shifter that has less requirements than a cloak and might even be a mid slot fit or low is a better option for your semicloak state that can be decloaked via weapons fire etc might actually fill a need where a cloak wont
i have seen a lot of cloaking threads and this one is kind of neat it doesnt really address the pros and cons of cloaking itself but they are cool ideas why dont we just request that they require fuel to activate possibly make it one of the racial isotopes timers on it would have to be worked out and honestly i dont even want to try but it shouldnt be nerfed ridiculously cloaking should just be a bit more dynamic
as i understand once upon a time in eve wrecks generated from npcs in missions like npc wrecks elsewhere were owned by the top damage dealerthis is not the case nowdays and hasnt been the case since i started playing at least this introduces the unintended sideeffect of being able to create objects owned by a player not yourself for an exceedingly long amount of timein light of missioner complaints about surprisingly long aggression extension a natural result of propertybased aggression rules in eve i propose the followingrevert npc in mission ownership mechanics to ownership by top damage dealer ensure that triggered secondary loot cans usually the mission objective drops are still owned by the mission runnerprowhile the current state of aggression timer updating when your property being reaggressed is sufficent i believe it seems to be very counterintutive as things owned by the aggressed player can be created with no interaction on this part if the aggressed party is not present new property owned by them should not be a viable thing to create this would restore a good deal of predictability to aggression timersconownership of loot could once again be stolen from the player that spawned a mission also a player could theoretically be tricked into aggressing themselves on say a deadspace invader by instinctively aggressing a wreck which does not belong to them if this is an issue it could be mitigated by a nonignorable warning dialog those seem to have been popular to implement the last few expansionsconstructive criticism appreciated also i cant seem to find the patch note that actually noted this change if anyone knows which patchnote its in i would appreciate enlightenment on that matteredit for clarity in my mention of agression timer updating i mean the display of aggression timer that you see when you undockz 3
aggression mechanics are fine just give a button to refresh the aggro timer displaymissioners dont need an unignorable modal dialog box when they shoot flashies this would decrease pvp
i agree the npc wrecks should belong to the person who has done the highest damage it doesnt really make sense the way it isorhow about make it so that the wrecks that contain no loot belong to nobody and can be tractored by anybody it makes no sense to me that i cannot tractor a wreckthe warning says it belongs to somebody elsebut the stance on salvaging is that the salvage belongs to nobody but the loot inside belongs to the owner of the mission if thats so why cant i tractor an empty wreck at least the noctis with the tractor bonuses will not really be a viable ship to use for meat least as i see it now
i really really want this its so annoying going back through 20 processors and checking to make sure i created the routes for everything even being sure i made all the routes i still manage to miss some from time to time
a simple yet immensely useful addition to the eve ui would be to add virtual desktop like osxs spaces featureit would allow you to set up 4  8 eve desktops and would allow you to assign a window to a specific space a simple rightclick on the titlebar could allow you to assign a window to a spacectrlarrow can switch between the virtual desktops if youve used osx this is a great feature if you have millions of windows openit would allow market research on one screen fleet chat  pvpcentric windows in another science  industry and pi screens in another and one that you can have that is free of all windows a small bar at the bottom can help visualize the different virtual screens  how many windows are in each etci also would hope readexpect that we would be able to save to the eve server rather than be per client maybe it would be userinitiated save but having all settings on the eve cloud would be great
supported but will probably never happeni would love to have 23 monitors with the outer space view rendered in only one of them rather than stretched across all increasing gpu load immensely and causing misc weirdness with the other monitors used solely for ui elements that normally crowd up the view on a singlemonitor setupwe can dream theyre apparently working on something sort of similar now except it requires windowed mode and increases the graphics rendering area substantially
i would love multiple monitor support with custom layouts but thats not exactly what i mean with this proposalthis proposal would not be dependent on monitor size or layout but rather allow us to group windows and quickly switch between them with the space view behind each it will effect ui windows onlyfor instance if you have the market open 5 info boxes a market graph and your email open pressing ctrlrightarrow will slide all of the current windows off the screen and slide in the windows that are on this other screen it is a way to quickly shift between tasks and fights the clutteri dont like spreadsheets online but there is so much information its difficult to display on only one screen whether im on my 15 macbook pro or my triple24monitor windows 7 workstation
oh i get itwell i support that too anything to make the ui easier to use and less cluttered

i found an issue when the bpo is in a container and you info it from a different system  you dont get to see the peme on the bpo it shows it as if its a basic blueprintanyone have this happen ot them
even the difference between bpc and bpo will kill the database read the linked threadbut a fairly common response to this objection is add drag  drop to the si dialog ie there is already a dialog box that lists these in a grid it already has a copy yesno column ie no addition db lookup required the eve client has already looked all that up before the grid is displayed you have a nice list of your bpobpcs you could now select and drag some to containers hangars and cargo holds rather than doing a show info on hundreds of items not the most elegant of solutions but far more functional than what is shipping now as an aside i can not understand how an employee could have signed off on the existing system as suitable for shipping

supportedhowever i dont think its gonna happen it has been proposed a couple of times in the past years ccps standpoint always was that with the new database layout a differentiation between bpos and bpcs was no longer possible back then we simply wanted the old view of purpleblue and even that was said to be impossible for reasons concerning the databasei dont recall the precise explanation for it see for yourself bpobpc colorregards lax
i dont know about more info but changing the icon would be good
while i agree that cloaking needs a counter this is not it   notice not flame of doom we have many piolets im my alliance who use all the covop style ships and they remain cloaked for hours at a time while actively watching a pos trailing some one etc having them decloak after an hour would be seriously bad news again going in the right direction but not the right fix ow and good on you for fighting the crowd of cloak security blank players who are threatened by any chance they could be found out
if it is not the cloaky ship you fear so much as the fleet of super caps the cloaky ship can summon instantly perhaps it is not cloaks that need to be changed so much as the cynojump process
honestly im not after destruction of the cloaky way just the way people yell they arent combat ships and so gimped yet can bring a massive combat force that isnt cloaky anywhere and tbh recons really arent weak so how would you change the cloaking system
not supportedthe counter is other players working with eachother and no cloaking doesnt make you invincible do some research before you spout off talking points of others or blindly believe them
players docked in an outpost or logged out of the game are similarly impervious to any counter ccp please allow me to destroy ships that are docked or which have vanished after logging off
im quite sure that you dont realize what were writing abouti dont mean that you dont get it only that you cant visualize itthere are sprites thats what 2d props are called already in missions they are debris floating in space in nebula and other strange space conditionsyou can have literally thousands of those in game without impact on performance but with awesome effect on video qualityif youve ever played a combat flight simulator its like having your airplane eject shells and using an external camera the immersion and awe of seeing your ship chew through ammo is just a little part of an immersive graphical experience but important nonethelessjust multiply that for shield ricochets and armor and hull chunks and effectswin
i dont think this would solve the macrominer issue1 they would just move to a static ice field2 they would just accept a mission and mine all the ore that is usually in that field cause sometimes that is a lot of ore3 scan a site  bm it  send macro miners there  done for the daythe other thing i see happening is the macro miners would still take out the regular fields  thus leaving nothing for the newbiesjust my thoughts
pardon more realisticyou realize that in our solar system the first asteroid was discovered in 1801 thats 209 years agoan interstellar civilization would be able to locate any asteroid belts in a solar system with the equivalent of a toaster and tin foil they tend to stay in the same place too so once found which they could do with a telescope from 1850 theyre found for goodscanning down asteroid belts is not realistic at all theyre as visible as most planets moreso in some cases
yes and no as above most of the pvp organisations in lowsec are comparatively small and focused on subcapital or even subbs small gangskirmish pvp and piracy however lowsec has an artificial restriction no bubbles that removes the single most effective way for a group of that kind to pin down a mothership so even before you start thinking about how a 100man organisation with say 1020 members online and active at any one time can muster enough dps to kill something with 3070 million ehp in the space of 15 minutes you need to gather at minimum a force of multiple hics with logistics support just to keep it tackled the same organisation in nullsec could do the same job with a single dictor it doesnt seem unreasonable to argue that if there are restrictions on the most viable counters available to smaller entities there should be corresponding restrictions on the use or abilities of supercapsshrug

never said they were a magic bullet just that they were a far more viable shortnotice counter to an unsupported or lightlysupported sc hotdrop than gathering up a bunch of hics with adequate support while simultaneously negotiating with other local entities whod be interested in temporarily setting aside differences for a supercap killmail as for fairness and balance that is very much ccps job and something with which they concern themselves see the nosnanodampfalconremote doomsdayaoe doomsday nerfs they rightly are entirely prepared to remove or rebalance ships tactics and mechanics that are perceived to be unfair or imbalanced
as it says on the tin i would like some kind of sp remap simply put why cant it be done from an eve universe point of view we can already remap neural traits once per 12 months surely rewiring youre brain in the eve universe cant be that hardit wouldnt be game breaking if done correcly but allow points to be moved from wasted skills or skills no longer needed by a player youd still need skill books howevercould be done throughplex micropaymentfree like neural remapitemcould be limited bylimited times in 12 monthslimited per skill points ie every 10m for example you get a free remapx amount of times per character life ie 3 times and thats it no morepersonally i would love this if done well all that time and sp in cruise missile spec iv could be invested in something worth whileideas sensible ones not just the go back to wow crowd please

not supported missiles always hit their target
supported  give caldari more love so they can pvp better
not supported missiles always hit their target missiles has max dps at all optimal missile turrets can not be disrupted missile ships can use any type of damage it is sweet to shoot exp against armor or em against shield
yes but that doesnt always mean that they do damagewhat about adding a thermal racial ya know so you get therm and kinetic bonus that way you still dont get everything but it is more useable and it does fit in with hybrid damage which is caldari gun of choice
i take it you dont use missiles muchwhat you say is not true at allmissiles do not do max damage at any rangemissile damage is attenuated by a ship velocity at any rangeoutside of web range missile damage is reduced sharply because the target ship can maintain a much higher velocitytrue missile ships can not be disruptedbut they can have there ammo distroyed midflight with defendersyeah defenders lol  no one fits them  but that mainly due to 80 of the ships out there being gun boatsbut still you have the option to use defenders if you so wishit would be adequate to shoot emexp if they were bonused fully which they are nota hookbill has a 100 bonus to kin at level 5 cal frigthats the equiv of 6 unbonused launchersso the fight i was telling you about a few post ago was the equiv of6 caldari navy standard launchers  unbonused  backed by a faction bcuall missile skills at 5and this setup does not have enough dps to break some frigate tanksyou think this is right damage type selection is critical to the success of missile boat tactics when solo due to the inheritly minimal dps of missile systemseven more so that with projectilesrestricting the bonus to only 1 type of ammo makes no sense
im not sure the kinetic damage bonus is really the worst bit about caldari missile boats even if you removed the kinetic bonus from say the caracal its still going to need fitting mods to fit a tank hams and a mwd all the ships have individual problems that are worse than the kinetic bonusrockets for example cant do full damage to a frigate without at least a web this ruins far more caldari frigates than the kinetic damage bonus does
plz
sure as long as all the other races get to shoot whatever damage type at full damage every time
im going to be fair and say i dont pay for eve with rl cash unfortunately some of us dont have the money for iti love the game but rl will always come over eve
and thus the death of eve online
and you think that somehow gives someone an unfair advantage if you want one spend the 2 hours to grind up the isk and get it liang
wtf ccp
no cash shop no   skill point advantagemake remaps accumulate 1 a year allowing more than 1 to be stored
its an isk shop geniuslianged and way to totally misrepresent reality there tamber
i never said i want one nor did i once elude to that fact i also said nothing about an unfair advantage my point is since plexs are brought into the game with realworld money i believe they should only be used for purposes that are also paid for with realworld money like extending an existing subscription this is essentially paying 15 for a neural remap
no way bad idea
wtf ccp
certain things will make me deinstall a game instantly one is the concept of what i like to call chizzling when rl money will gain you a major advantage over other players forcing you to purchase what ever product and then a whole bunch of little fees like 99cents for a new skin or 500 for extra cargo hold or 200 for this perk or that perksorry the second i see that rear its ugly head is the second i deinstall and stop playing mmorpgs till the old republic star wars mmorpg comes out ill play for like 6months and then get bored cause i cant loot the corpse and stop playing mmorpgs all togetherplex is about as far as i will allow a game to go which i do not mind so much atleast the way eve works because ships tend to be the least important thing in this gameexperience who you know sp implant ship isk is about how important things stack up when it comes to pvp so a dude being able to buy implants and ships with plex i have no problem with its when they can remapp with plex that it starts to really effect things for example i just recently remaped to hvy perceptionwillpower cause i want to power lvl everything that falls under those catagories like ships and gunnery what would be sweet is to redeem a plex is once im finished with that remap again to focus on some other area no this will get abused this will effect dramatically how this game is playedabsolutly not implement this and i will quit
ccp do not wantseriously
wtf ccpbad idea a step in the wrong direction
wtf ccp hello no
wtf ccp
till now impresive i dont think you triggered this mutch rage with the t20 issue
people with too much money can already spend it on fancy ships and learning implantsdont want to turn this game into a microtransaction one
i am against noncosmetic microtransactions in eve and feel this is treading dangerously close please do not implement this ccp eve is too dignified of a game for it to be brought down to that level
microtransactions should be kept out of eve i would not quit over this if it were implemented but id be highly annoyed and would probably quit eve after six and a half years if any further microtransactions were added

wtf ccpif they do this im closing up shop and letting my sub expire
bad ideaperiod
bad idea
i sincerely doubt anyone is reading this far back but here goesccp is trying to make extra money hoping that more people will buy and consume plex to put rl isk into their coffersthe better way to do this would be to only allow people to pay rl money for the remap not use an ingame item that it tied to the ingame fun economy things are volatile enough now that the mineral basket is sinking with the insurance changes let people with rl money use that money in a way outside the game economy before a pilots license extension becomes perverted into something it shouldnt bethe best way to do this would be to focus on micro transaction in dust and focus on quality products with the fixes players are requesting in eve people already pay every month to play a game that takes them away from real life stress and problems if problems and stress get introduced into play time then people will go somewhere elseplease remember ccp if your business model gets so aggressive it stops repeat customers from having fun then nobody winsvod
fully supported make price 500mil isk for remap and sell plex for this
yes indeed wtf
this idea stinks pewtox
wtf ccp
wtf ccp
buying game time with isk is a great idea cause players who couldnt afford paying rl money every month for game have an option and chance to enjoy the eve universe paying for remap and sp  really wtf ccp  ruining the values of the game for some extra income is not the way i see the future of this game

if i wanted easy and mash buttons i would go play wow you are just inviting people with no skill to ruin the game whats the point of the game if it took me so many years to get my sp to where it is and some noob comes in and buys his sp
wtf ccpthis is a terrible ideaplex exists to hurt isk sellers this is a good thing tmtrading a plex for a remap is nothing more than an unabashed attempt to generate more revenue by allowing players to micromanage their skill growth by paying ccp more moneynot only that but the economic effects will be profoundthe direct consequence is people buying more gtcs to use on remaps generating more revenue for ccp however not everyone will buy gtcs for this a great many will buy plex off the market and cash them in for these remaps reducing the overall supply of plex and iskthe very real consequence of this effect will be to drive the price of plex up and because of the perceived increase of value more people will buy gtcs to convert into plex generating still more revenue for ccpthe net effect is the addition of yet another moneyisk sink into the game however one that spiderwebs into several other effects that compound that effecta personal message to ccp we already pay a subscription to play this game if you really cared about growing eves long term revenues you would fix the longstanding balance and interface issues that prevent longterm adoption you want wow sized revenues try reducing the barriers to entry and making the game more fun for solo and low sp players this means getting rid of the damn learning skills i shouldnt have to tell my friends that if they dont want to waste their timemoney they have to spend the first month in a noob ship working on learning skillstaking 3 months to get  fit a ship thats actually worth flying  feels badass is way too long to keep the majority of gamers interestedrant gabriennelord knows if i tried to string my customers along with a gimped service for the first year while having them pay full price for it well i wouldnt have many customers for long

while i dont think using a plex to remap your atrib points is a bad thing allowing something like this to go through sets a really really bad chain of events which will spiral out of control and end up with even more ways for ccp to grab moneyofcourse you think getting more money from people who want to change remap points is a good thingofcourse you think getting more money from people who want to change their industral alt into a perfect mothership pilot is a good thingofcourse you think getting more money from people who want to buy themselves amarr bs 5 and t2 large pulses is a good thingsure you will have more money but when you allow these things to happen and on a sunday evening when you are sitting there looking at 5000 peak subscribers logged in think back to now when you knew it was a realllly bad idea

should i even say thiswtf ccp
i agree
i agree
agree
moar bug fixes less pandering to whiny nubs do dont get how the skill system works currently
wouldnt it be wonderful if ccp had a group of players they could consult in advance of making changes like this a group that could give them feedback on the possible player reaction
i agree
i agree
its a big step in the wrong direction do not want
this is the wron way ccp turn around  quick
i too oppose plex for remaps its a slippery slope that we should not get on
wtf ccp 
yea uh no
i never take slippery slope argument serious especially not if we are way further down the slope already plex for remaps has a much smaller impact than plex for isk and worse character trades i really dont see the issue imo remove all of them or none of them
fixed this is probably why they never consult you guys on a lot of stuff they never know if your going to give feedback based on what is best for the eve community or what is best for your personal agenda cant really blame them for not checking with you tbh
wtf ccp 
wtf ccp

i rather not see implementations like thisc
micropayments 
getting ingame stuff for out of game stuff is baaad mkay
plex for remapsno dont do it1oneeleven
if you really want to do this  make it for isk not plex plex should never be directly used for anything but to replace the subscription feeand while i will refrain from slippery slope arguments  microtransactions are a horrible horrible idea please never sully eve with them
no just no
why would anyone even think about such a mechanic
wtf indeed
supported plex for remaps is a bad idea in principlestuff like using plex for character transfers or portrait changes is fine  thats just an admin fee but effectively paying to create sp no
bad bad idea slippery slope indeed
wtf
wtf
im all for adding more uses for plexs but im very concerned about the bypassing of ingame mechanics for such uses the fact it also affects the speed of sp gains makes the issue especially distasteful ccp know from learning skills how sensitive people are about sp so they must have known how sensitive people are about any unfair advantages in that department i guess it could be a lot worse but i would rather we dont ever get to that point as i said more uses for plexs is a good thing and this is rather minor issue in itself but it is troublesome that they went straight to here knowing how players would react instead of trying less distasteful uses first not the end of the world but i dont like it and im worried were this might lead us

wtf ccp
im not saying plex for remap is a good idea personally i dont care one way or the other however this already exists more so with being able to get isk from plex i fail to understand how 90 of the sheep posting here can argue that plex for isk is fine where as plex for remap is not sure it does open a can of worms and brings plex for sp closer but i fail to understand how someone being slightly more versatile with their training its just a remap they dont train faster than you nor do they get sp is somehow completely broken when i can pay 15 to get two fitted and rigged hacs instead

wow crazy
im with you here i dont see how this would be worth quitting over or how its the worst feature ever
the hacs are evanescent the sp are here to stay
so is a 50m sp char you buy
now eve come like all the other online games out there if you have cash you will be betterwonder how many players eve will loose if ccp dose go ahead regardless of its players i know il be one of themwtf ccpdont
except it doesnt create sp it only means someone can have sp in a different category of skills than their previous attributes would allow
wtf ccp
what a joke ccp
gtcs a faction battleship with hg implants and officer modulesperfectly fine no advantage thereremaps so i can train a different category of skills at the rate im currently training a category of skillsomg ccp ingame advantage from rl cash im quitting over this  even though you can buy plex with ingame isk
microtransactions are bad mkay
no to 4spif you buy gtc and sell them for isk you buy a character from another playerbuy ships from another playerin some way benefit the economy and thus other playersif you buy gtc convert them to remaps via plesk youbuy sp from ccpoh and csm  stakeholder  ccp 
it boils down to thisif you are against using a plex to remap skills you are against anything bought and sold for isk that allows the increase of a players skill point gains or skill point total this includes attribute implants and characters sold for isk since both allow a player to increase their skill point gain or skill point total for isk and you can of course get isk by selling plexesi believe a better solution to this would be the completion of a quest to give you an extra attribute remap design it however you want use your imagination if you want involve a tradeable item giving isk some part in the remapping which would more discretely involve plexespsccp  we need less new content and more improvement of the game we have new client

you are wrong remap allows you to train fasterlets say i want to train for t2 large guns i remap all my attribute points in percwillpower and i got 1520d less to train for remap no 1then after thats done my science skills for some werid reason are low and i want them up asap remap all to inteligencememory remap no 2now i can do that every time i want with just 350m isk15 that means that i dont have to wait 1 year with maxxed inteligencememory skills in my character that means low perceptionwillpowercharisma  less training in their spec therefore if we allow more than 2 remaps we boost any time we want any attribute we want with a small fee our skill training
wtf ccpseriously
wtf ccpeve doesnt need even more real money trading for in game advancement
i dont like this
it doesnt allow you to train faster it allows you to train at the same rate as you normally would but for a different category of skills you also have incredibly bad planning if you have intmem train a gunnery skill then spec back to intmem to train science skills im not saying it isnt an advantage to be more flexible with your skillplan im saying it doesnt mean someone can train faster than me at all which is true despite hordes of bandwagoning going on saying that it adds sp to the game or increases your training speed which is very misleading

bad bad bad idea as a person who could afford to remap whenever needed it would be nice to be able to optimize my training constantlyon the other hand id feel that id always have to keep my skills optimized and that means that id start feeling like i have to play in way to maximize my in game income so that i wasnt spending 14 every time a skill finished that means that id be a lot more conservative in my play style which means id get bored and once bored leave microtransactions have always made me feel less like im actively doing something fun playing and more like im simply buying entertainment watching and i tend to lose interest in watching something much more quickly than i do playing something

im not going to read beyond first page because i already know there is a masive amount of players not happy with a very small amount happyim totally against this too ccp money for ingame advantage  tripledotim sure there are other workarounds but youve just taken the easy way outnot belonging to the topic one of my accounts ran out 2 weeks ago another one will in 1h and this one in 4days i do not plan to renew it in the near future until this game will be fixed without using easy way outsmeanwhile ill be playing games that are still in their beta which are definately worth it i might addgood luck ccp and the players still enjoying eve you have my best wishesi apologise for the wall of text however this is one of my firsts and the last post for a while i do not want to split it to 4 different qq threads where theyd belong
wtf ccp
seriously do you ccp have any focus groups you use before you propose an idea like this or is it just to place it out there and deal with the repercussions later

dear ccpcurrently i pay  360 per year for two subscriptions what  in your best estimate  is the probability that i will suddenly pay even more for the same service just to be able to stay competitive with other players of a similar ageimperian has the right of this genuine german accent and all i am out of here if this goes through and ccp will need to sell 24 plex per year to make up for the loss of my subscriptionsit would perhaps be wise to label changes like these hekla changes due to the sudden explosive and largely negative effect they will have among the player population not to mention within the local icelandic economysincerelyvhelnik cojoin

wtf ccp
this is a step in a very bad direction plex character portrait swaps character transfer feessales in game are all tied together and from that standpoint plex for remaps makes sense wtf ccpthey want the money it is that simple rmt showed them like nearly every other mmo that customers are lazy and willing to put  for game benefits game money rather than do it in game by grinding let someone else do it or hack another players account to get that game money ccp got plex to stop money from going in to rmts pockets when it could have been going into their own customers showed them they were willing to pay for isk so why shouldnt they oblige them and take the cash the side benefit is they cancould stomp the evil macroers ruining the gamepeople want to sell their characters well enter the character transfer fee more  in ccps pocketspeople want to change their character portraits enter the swap portraits option for a feepeople will want just about anything and everything that throwing cash at willcan get them ccp might just oblige them i think it is a bad idea but so is character transfersellingportrait swapping as has been pointed out you can effectively gain sp by buying plex selling it and buying a character thus you bought a character the argument is no that account was paid for over time and the cash went to ccp so it is okay that is your rationalization the end result is someone was able to get something they couldnt get without waiting x monthsyears or benefited through the paying cash or just made that isk in game presumably paying for their account with cash unless they didnt as many players have mastered the art of raking in billions and could easily fund several accounts for yearsallowing plex to obtain neural remaps which dont add sp to your account just allow you to train optimally just as if you actually planned properly the difference is you could then do it rapidly and gain by getting the skills to fully fly and fit a ship or races shipsweapons faster than someone else who optimally trained shipsguns then waits for the remap to train support skills etc the player not paying for a remap may have to fill a year before being able to switch over and in that year may have to train for something they plan to use later like a carrier or just specialize in weapons or the likei support the proposal the small group of people that screwed up a remap really should have a 2nd one as they would likely be new playerscharacters the remaining people who screwed up or made a stupid mistake should have read the warning before they accepted the remap that is a really weak argument the other aspect of this is it continues to widen the door for more micro transactions down the road just as the character transfer fee and to a lesser extent the portrait swap did
pros i could train stuff sooooo much faster with thiscons this decreases the delayed satisfaction of skill training in an extreme way
wtf ccpthe cool thing about plex being an ingame item was  you could only turn it in for 30days gametime thats why the majority of players didnt have a problem with the hypothetical scenario of some rich noob purchasing a ton of plex and getting shiniesveteran chars etc because he would pay for gametime of others who would use the plex to extend their subscriptionthats why plex was a brilliant idea as a measure to stomp rmt while not going cashshopnow youre about to change that and be no better than some f2pcashshoppay2win grinder

no micropayments kthx
wtf ccp 
nono money grubbing dam little schemes
no thanks
i like the idea of being able to fix an oops from my training plan planned on 3 remaps in a year and a half based upon 2 free then found out right before the second one that its actually 1 free and 1 realblocking remap so ive been running at slower training speeds than i planned on at this point but thats something ive been dealing with i dont like the idea of plex being used in this fashion it doesnt fit the pilot license extension stated use of the item at allif ccp wishes to make available additional remaps simply assign an isk value to them and charge that fee ingame but do not use plex as the vehicle leave that decision up to the player it doesnt fit the namepurpose of plex in any way
no ccp just no
wtf ccp no no no
that really sounds like a very bad idea
i will emo rage quit if u carry the out ccp  wtf are u thinking
do this ccp and i will pull all my accounts  wtfmessage ends
come on ccp stop listening to the greedy accountants and remember what this game was supposed to be about youve already done your best to ruin it with gimmicks that increase lag and decrease enjoyment remember who your customers are
wtf ccp
wtf ccp
no no noif eve is going the micropayment path ill be gone
wtf ccp
you know you could just buy a plex off the market no one is asking you to actually use money
wtf ccp
hey ccp can you start thinking of ways to fix lag and stop thinking of ways to  your former subscribers off thank you
this already exists you can buy and sell chars for isk and you can buy isk with irl money
what raging ret4rd at ccp proposed micro paymentswhoever it is needs tar and feathers
since i just posted this in the new gd thread on the topic i thought i would throw it out here as welldid anyone think that this is a good way to give incentive to move plexes around in space other then someone just being stupid this is based on the assumption that you will need the plex in the station you want to complete the remap incurrently i will not support the angst that is currently around i think that ccp wants to try this and see where it goes and we should see what happensedit clarityslade
yes the point is to use up more plexes period if they get transported and the remaps can only happen at medical facilities for instance that is just a better way to get more plexes removed from the game thus spurring the purchase of more plexes to replace those not available in game if ccp continues to find new ways to let plexes leave the game through other account services maybe extra jump clones maybe improving security status changing your name etc actual plex salesusage from this single feature arent likely to have a huge impact only a few who screwed up remapping cant wait or just have too much isk or lots of spare cash to blow would likely use it i disagree about seeing where it goes because i see it going to ccp opening up other services for plex and the goal is to remove them from the game spurring more sales which means more  that motivation can lead to ruining the game
all good ideas
camera drone what is that
i cant wait for you to lose your ship cause you couldnt find something to align to fast enough 
if you cant find something to warp to fast enough you warped in trouble unprepared  deserved to diealso camera drones areyou mean that the camera is reseting every time you jump to a system
or he meant drones that have a window and you see what your drone sees take a little snapshot and it saves to your eve screenshots
link  camera dronestldr  for those who dont give a crap camera drone  your visual perspectivedont you people ever read the chronicles and do your homework seriously
this was originally supposed to be introduced way back in 2008 before they took the industry expansion they had planned and made it into a nanonerf expansion with the orca thrown in for flavour storefronts are long overdue and id love to see them
this seems strictly less good than just having another account except for the transfer fee savings since its not overpowered and i believe the transfer fees are just compensation for the amount of work some gm has to do to transfer the character this should actually be okaymuch to my surprise
i would like to put a plex on my 10m sp alt not spending 40 to make it possible
just have the items name show as red and have a damage column on the items list in the contract if someone gets scammed at that point theyll deserve it and itll make a lot of stuff far easier
do this
or let us repair them
the idea of an anticap subcap is not a bad one this proposal is bad however not supported
i have always liked the idea of a battleship class pos destroyer that could enter a reducedeffect siege and not boost their tank like a dreads siegecarriers triagemainly for hisec and losec pos warfare when that research corp throws up a large pos with no defenses its pretty hard to find a sizable fleet to take it down in a timely manor without the resources of a large alliance they could have their misuseage however the reward  risk
U266A hes still a contender he will not surrender U266Bbut this proposal is pretty bad not supported

vote for adding hybrid rebalancing topic at the next csm meetingcould any csm describe more clearly the problem and the proposed solutions in detail otherwise everything will be like here
interesting idea but it does have a few flaws1 eliminating all bugs from a program is a programmers wet dream in that it will never happen yes some bugs can be removed and a few probably should be removed like the warp tunnel leading askew from the ship direction but these are minor in the grand scheme of things2 ccp put out a bugfix patch a while ago that sought to correct a monumental amount of bugs about 100 iirc do you know how much positive feedback they got from that you could count the number on one hand and have fingers left overif youre serious about this you need to congratulate ccp when they correct bugs like this most often bugs that the previous patch introduced otherwise youre only spitting into the windas the bugs in this game are mostly minor i dont support this measure
currently when in siege you can only lock 2 targets and your scan resolution is significantly reduced i propose that one of those be changed either increase the scan resolution when in siege so that it doesnt take a minute to lock a pos module or allow up to atleast 5 targets locked at a timeif a super can have more than 2 targets locked and do twice the dps of a dread then dreads should be able to lock more targets
this make no sense at alla mom cost as much as 10 fitted dreads mom with decent fit that is roughly 20bits way better than 10 dreads and it should be its supposed to be anticapital shipa titan cost as much as 30 dreads its way better than 30 dreads and as it is now its supposed to be the best ship in eve best in a way of capital firepowernone of the above ships can use triagesiege therefore they dont get their dps increased significallydreads can enter siege but at a cost reducing their scan ress and receiving a penalty on max locked targets is ballanced imops comparing different ship classes is kinda stupid a logi can lock 10 targets while being a cruiser that doesnt mean that battleships will be able to lock 12 targets
titans were never meant to be cost effective
 its a huge dck
a mom is 10x the isk for maybe 50 more dps i should hope it has some advantages when it comes to its secondary stats not supported
youre a sucker if you use a dread with sc in the game
pretty much tweaking around the edges of dreadnoughts is a pointless exercise when the entire range of supercapitals postdominion has made them little more than a lossmail waiting to happen
i agree that some changes are needed to dreads and altering the scan resolution and lock penalties are something to look at its my view that to bring dreads back into fight the siege mod needs to have basically nothing but positive effects the only real drawback should be it being immobilized and that is a huge drawback these days id also support dropping it to 5 minute cycles as with triageso ill support this though i dont think your idea is anywhere near enough
hi allnot sure which sub forum i should be posting this so have posted here and in game ideasas a busy person in real life i dont have anywhere near as much time as i would like to log into eve online this means there are many things i am unable to do in the wonderful universe that is new eden not because i dont love the game but because i dont have the time to research which of the many long term plans would result in the most funbest resultsi propose that the plex system is expanded so there are other things that can be bought by players in my situation rather than just game time items i think should be considered includetraining speed bonusspecial edition gearsoverignty rightsaccess to deadspace sitesmaybe even a tiered access system withbronze  standard members as we all are nowsilver  sig radius bonus speed bonus shieldarmorhull capacity bonus align time bonusgold  access to improved weapons systems as well as defensive bonuses provided by silver membershipkaurapa
so you want an ingame shop where you can throw real money at to get things ingame where your too lazy to get off your rump and do it yourself through hard work like everyone elseyeah right
i recommend mining theres also datacore research invention production gtc sales all sorts of things to boost your isk income because if you implement a system similar to what you propose lol broken squads

hi malcanisthis thread was not started as a troll i see a warning thread to ccp with complete opposite viewpoint in this very sub forum it has close to 400 players supporting it i am wondering how many people would support the ideas that ccp are mumouring about
you know there is a 19 page topic with all ppl signing against the idea you just started 19 pages in 24 hoursif you have time to make new topic like this i guess you also have time to read other topics in this form section
1 for reading comprehensionthere are rumours ccp want to expand on microtransactionsthere is a thread where a large number of people are expressing strong dissatisfaction for that ideathis is the thread that illustrates how many ccp customers support
may i propose more addons uberspecial ship for a plex its yours it comes with 24 slots boosts all weapons and its so uber you can even dualtank it though the ship expires after 30 days that wont interfere with the ingame balance jump pass to premium region beverly nebula dont be bothered by poor people anymore by simply accessing the beverly hills of new eden
id actually give this one an 85 for creativityto the op  off
not supported you should run your ideas through fid forum first also this idea is terrible and the current system works fine imo
current system is has and will continue to work fine you dont seem to understand gun mechanics at allif i shot a gun at your ship the server takes into account the dmg mod tracking speed of your ship speed of their ship ammo type transversal distance resistances and undoubtedly several other factors us players dont even know about constant dmg would be oversimplifying ityoure basically saying to give artillery 250km range across the board and that theyll always hit regardless of trackingrange mods have you ever pvpedyoure also saying to make acs and lasers do full dmg for every single hit hell no if every ship in the game was doing eft numbers for dps your tank wouldnt matter at all youd just disappearrails do need a boost but not 1000 dps at 240km boostand also lol at your blaster fix i can tell that youre obviously an experienced pvper with infinite knowledge of game mechanicsgb2wow
now i would support a change for the graphics auto cannons are always firing only the animation changes the server still calculates damage the same beam lasers would stay solid on for 12 the cycle time then turn off again cooling down again only a graphical change pulse would flicker on and off for 12 the cycle time and would cool down for the other half just a reminder only the graphics change artillery rail guns and blaster animation graphics would remain the same although maybe make blasters and rail guns look more cool like artilleryblasters too need fixing if it was up to me i would give them amazing tracking so they can hit stuff within their optimal especially for frigs or maybe when i used blasters my skills just sucked but leave the optimal the same
if your acs fire every 10s youre doing it wrongyour weapon values are trash no different values between smallmedlargexlarge guns huge ranges that make no sense in this game blasters at 250km theyre supposed to be shotgun damage guns at 0 rangeeven if you remove optimal ranges and say you could therotically hit a ship at 250km away with blasters there is no way to track it in order to actually hit it blasters need buff but this is crapplease stop trying to make eveonline similar to other genre games its unique and we like it
took 7 days to get a reply once elevated this really demonstrates the need for some better inhouse expectations for gms
most of the proposals ive seen include antipirates in the mechanics as well but yes if for some reason this isnt included it should be
i am pretty sure there has been a change for the worse from a pirates perspective with every expansion release sentry guns only reach 60k falcons could jam outside sentry gun range there was no warp to zero sentry guns did specific damage types sentry guns didnt do as much base damage the billboard could be blown up dunno if it still can but it used to have like a minute respawn timer concord did not react as fast in hisec when traveling through with low security status i used to fly a navy megathron from rens to amamake without getting tackled by concord now i get instascramed in a frigateslowly and slowly the focus of lowsec has been shifting from a place for lulz to a place for carebears the more carebears come to lowsec the more they cry about the mechanics and the more the mechanics get changed in their favorit is time to return lowsec to its roots bring new life to piracy give faction ships for fitting all of their mods ie ashimmu gets a boost for fitting all dark blood gear gila boosted for fitting all dread guristas make sentry guns do specific damage types according to race etc
agreed
frankly a lot of pirate boats need buffingthe phantasm is one of them so supported
supported as long as ccp gives the vigilant another two mids 5000 armor and 200 pgit will be overpowered but i believe ccp should give us one pro ship in exchange for the bull theyve been giving us
supportingbut what are you basing the increase in the capacitor level against another ship a shiny number pulled from your bum
yep it badly needs some love
the main phantasm problem is the inertia you have the same inertia then some bs armor but you tank shield its completly stupid the only possibility to use this ship its like some static turret dont move and try to shoot some body passing the gateplease ccp reduce the inertia by 2 of this ship also now its about a brick
both
i like the phantasm for its looks the tracking bonus isnt really quite up to the task of shooting tacklers and the damage bonus doesnt put it on par with hacs so it really is more of a hangar novelty item which is why they sell for less than a hac right now only worthwhile faction cruiser right now is the cynabal the gila is pretty nice also but drones still need a bit of work to put that in the same ballpark as the cynabal someone mention the vigilant the vigilant doesnt even have the eye candy factor going for it like the phantasm do people even buildfly those poor thingsi would order the fixes hybrid guns  phantasm  dronesi will support this as it would be fun to fly my phantasm in more than just a novelty situation
you know noone ed about the phantasm ever then the pirate patch came where they boosted the other faction ships and reduced the phantasms base shield amount i dont recall it happening to the succubus nor the nightmare but the phantasm was able to get nearly 20k shield a bit broken imo currently the phantasm is ok yea it turns like a whale and it could use an extra turret hardpoint but hey thats the price you pay for flying it dont like it dont fly it

t2 rigs arent supposed to be cheap or common  the cost on them is generally fine they arent like t2 modules theyre the equivalent of deadspace gear i dont want 10 t1 hardeners  1 xtype hardener either not supported

since the devs dont play the game anymore they have no way of knowing whats working and whats not without listening to feedback from playersthus i suggest that they read the csm minutes and also skim assembly hall and features and ideas every so oftenyou cant blame them for not fixing blasters exploration sites producing large t2 scanning rig bpcs lag etc if they dont even know that these problems exist
the devs do playnot all but many do read csm minutes and do read the forums they make a point of not commenting on csm forums unnecessarily but they do look here i wouldnt be surprised if there were at least a couple ccp alts posting here semiregularly for that matter

why didnt you tell them plex for increase in sphr was a bad ideai thought you were supposed to represent the player base
we found out at the same time you did we didnt get any advance warning however we are discussing it atm and right now the csm is not in favour of the concept
the point is thats not a unique objection its also hard to counter a 150 man rr battleship fleet cynoing in via titan bridge or a 36 man bomber squad blackopsd in or a 60 man armor hac fleet with 15 guardians or the fact that someone is able to bring more firepower than you to the table is not at all a reason for ccp to intervene especially not as insanely as people like delilah have suggested with having concord respond to capital ships in 04 space the most obvious counter to opponents bringing supercaps is to bring your own or neut the hell out of them and bring dreads or any of another swarm of possibilities like i said the first lowsec milf ever downed was killed before hics were even introduced balance is fairness is not ccp will not one hopes ever decide that two pilots are unable to engage you solo since it is horribly unfair supercaps are balanced and they can be killed they simply represent the investment of roughly 20 billion isk in one place at one time and they are supremely vulnerable to a halfcompetent counterstrike that many lowsec entities are too small to mount an effective counter is their fault as well and not ccps it makes as much sense to say that instead of nerfing caps and supers lowsec alliances should all be given 100 bots to even up numbers in case a bigger force attacks them the answer to my opponent can bring more firepower than i can is never so ccp needs to save me thats a hodge podge of balance changes nerfs and outright mistakes on ccps part where they caved to forum whiners and ruined valid mechanics damps still havent recovered properly even on specialized boats like the razu small gang pvp which some claim nerfing supers is supposed to bring about was virtually eliminated with the nano nerf and so on at the end of the day and the beginning too supers are not unbalanced they can be more firepower than many small entities can handle but thats hardly a reason to nerf supers rather than point out that small entities cant handle that kind of firepower and thats okay i also cant solo a properly fit t3 ship in a rifter nerf t3or to put it another way lets say that tomorrow more people want to be lowsec pirates or someone charismatic attracts a large following and forms a lowsec alliance or whatever but theres now a 2000 man lowsec alliance with plenty of dread pilots and good participation across a few time zones all of a sudden supers that drop of them get chewed up and eaten alive but ccp did nothing how can that possibly be since it wasnt game mechanics functioning as intended and one group of people being outgunned by another but a problem that absolutely necessitated ccps intervention since small corps that cant bring numbers have to be boosted by ccp or else its just not fair right
delilah wild do you play eve online i can see that you do have an account or you wouldnt be able to post are you saying that caps and super caps need to be moderated in low sec i am speechlessnocapital ships arent a problem in low sec space at all capital ships do not stop people from using low sec actually they are a reason to use low sec
no skillpoint remap unless ccp decides to remove the learning skills and are kind enough to let us us reallocate them on whatever we wantno other sp remap as fotm will get a totally new meaning at that stage
bad idea one core concept in eve is that choices have benefits and consequences remap of sp expenditures removes that
actually mazs items from last meeting should be on the agenda this time that said after 25 years of bringing up issues its not that weird for agendas to get shorter
this is less prevalent than it was a few months ago and theres nothing theoretical about it being an exploit if ccp catches someone pulling altrecycles theyll nail that accounti tracked this recycling stuff a bit the recyclers many using trial accounts so they dont even pay for this only nailed newer players so many veteran types never saw it  simply put vets park alts while the basics are trained up and chars of a certain age arewere far less likely to be ganked than younger charsa good deal of that backed off with some of the insurance changes and the like  though it still happens its far less than it was it could be backed off a bit more by removal of concord event pay outs 10 hours to train destroyers equates to 10 hours for a gank ship but a destroyer flown by a fesh ganker doesnt have enough firepower to knock down a skilled pilot  even flying a small ship it can take out a newer chars ship and those were primary targets retrievers wereare popular targets but so were almost every other kind of t1 starting out frigatedestroyer  that kind of stuntas for coming back after rebuilding sec status  yeah it can be done but takes a couple days or so and thats their costs for doing this i and many others find no problems with someone willing to actually pay for their griefer fun with such time consuming efforts eve isnt supposed to be safe but the griefer factor should always have costspenalties associated with it and this 12 days thats an acceptable cost
black ops revamp making them useful submitted as priorityummmerrrrhmmmmmerrrrrrmight there be a wee bit of official feedback regarding this particular issue please i mean rockets and sansha capital pve are all fine updates im sure but it would be nice to know that something was forthcoming in order to sort the rather undeserved prenerf of this class of shipssticky is as readers does
edit  plex for neural remapping added to the guy above me  from the way i understand it is as a priority on the huge list of back long changes this is moved towards the front of the list which means after higher priority back log of changes then black ops will be changed please read the posted dev blog and wiki page links for more informationplease contact a member of the csm for more questions on this matter also the csm have regular meetings infact twice a month iirc so if you have questions or concerns that need to be addressed please speak up in the jita speak center
is it too much to ask for some feedback heremanaging to fix rockets but ignore this bit sad really anyone from ccp or csm care to comment or has this priority csm issue been swept aside in favor of capital pve in the forthcoming update
to be honest at this point i will settle for adiquate

tracking dosent matter as much as damage  for one having to actually manage transveral is a player skill approach  orbit  boring the problem at the moment is that even managing transversal the damage output is meh up the damage output and it actually means something to put you ship in the zonea tracking increase is more solo  as soon as theres more then 2 ships involved damage output is more important by uping the damage blasters are useful in a slightly larger number of situationsand ofc more tracking  ownage of smaller ships

well if you want to trade raw dps or optimal range and the ability to insta swap crytals for the ability to change damage types and basically turn lasers and hybrids into replica of projectiles thats an entirelly new post i thinkwhy would you require full damage  are you nub enough to think missiles do full damage against targets sorry missiles havnt done that for 4 years iirca fast afterburning frig can attenuate damage from even the best missiles by 75some mwding frigs can do even better with attenuations of 90 or better or in the case of the dram can outrun them completelly
not supportedthats the sacrifice you make for being able to switch damage typesever thought that kin missiles with the bonus may do more actual damage than other nonbonused typesonly if the exp and em missiles are removednb i only read first and current pages
not supportedlearning skills are fine you have to spend some time to get something back if you dont want to train it it is your loss if you play this game for a longer timeand the reason new players will stay with a higher chance is a bad reason cause you have no proof even if they stay what will happen to them they could think hey eve is an easy game i get what i wanteve is not an easy game think one gm wrote it years ago eve is a dark harsh placeit is easier for noobs at the beginning they have the skill boost until 16 m sp and they can use neural remap two times now you want to change learning skills what is next rank 12 skills leadershipskillsplease ccp do not change it
i realize that the votes have been cast and the decision appears to be made however i have one question and i beleive it to be a rather impotant question at that will redistribution of sp be limited toon specific or will this be account based in which the account is given any learning sp from any of the 13 toons on the accountif the learning skills go away and ccp gives us up to the 5376000 skill points to redistribute as we feel fit and its toon specific i think that is fair and i am sure that anyone out there that has learned the full 5376000 skill points in learning can find a nice home for them however if this will not be toon specific and all learning sp can be distributed from all three toons on the account to any one toon on the account i have a major issue with that as up to 16128000 sp can be diverted from three toons on the account to make one supertoon if that is how the mechanic of redistribution will work please let me know and run out to the character bazaar and start bidding on characters that have nothing but learning sp maxed out seriously all sarcasim aside i would like to know how this would be implemented toon specific  good we still keep every sp that we have earned account based  not good go back to the drawing board make war   save the love for downtime  grammador

initially i was against this idea microtransactions seem to go against the general spirit of eve plex has always been a grey area of rmt some people love it but some people hate itthe thing is plex can already be used to achieve a similar effect  buy plex sell for isk purchase new character with skills you wantthe difference here is that the plex is consumed to allow you to remap which will produce another sink for plexes thus being a driving factor for plex demand end result price of plex goes up andor supply of plex goes up ie people buy more plex ccp earning money is a good thing imo furthermore a higher priced plex increases its attractiveness over illegitimate rmt which plagues us so which is also a good thingremaps are still available to those who cant afford plex irl  they can simply buy a plex off the market to get access to the same featurehowever i believe that if ccp does go ahead with this feature they should draw the line here plex should never be used as the only method to gain access to a certain feature of eve neural remaps are currently available to everyone once a yearso a plex for a neural remap is ok in my book plex for special modsships is not okay plex for sp is already in the game in the form of character trades so this wouldnt be as bad as people make it out to be though plex for sp as a service would make rl isksp conversions easier so if you are against character trades you would also be against plex for spso im going to say not signedbut im all for getting ccp to discuss the topic with us first before they put it on tq though im sure that my little drop in the bucket wont change the overwhelming support this thread has
good thing that doesnt happen with plexs or alt accounts now

seriously eve is supposed to be a credible decent mmo adding this will place it in the same bucket as all other ty f2p cash shop games
cmon ccp wtf
giving an advantage to whoever has more rl capital is a bad idea
supporting the playerbase actually having to step in and point out where ccp is going wrong
i dont see what the issue is myself i know it sounds bad on paper but at the same time how often would someone want to remap anyway i know i train my skills in blocks around my remap time i could see maybe every six months coughing up a plex to remap but i dont see the benefit some rich idiot receives by turning plexs into remaps a bunch of timesnot to mention that if its related to plex than theres no more rl capital involved than before i pay for my account with gtcs so thats pretty much some guy buying carriers and  using my ingame time in exchange for his rl cash if i wanted to remap a little earlier and bought a plex to do it rather than buying it to get more playtime so what you could make the same argument that if i couldnt buy a plex to pay for my gametime i wouldnt be able to train skills and thus would suffer the same fate as if i couldnt get a remap
f thatccp  sort your head out and the next time you come up with an idea like this try to imagine the look of horror across peoples faces when they hear about it shortly before they quitthis kind of real money advantage will cause such a massive loss of credibility and respect  you clearly have no idea
wtf
no no no
i support this
wtf signed
wtf skills and having to wait are one of the best features of eve
it is and ccp has been fine with doing exactly that ever since they started offering plex for sale understandably plex filled a player desire to buy gold while also allowing ccp to receive money that would otherwise go to peoplegroups that abuse ccps product and worsen it through macroing and account hacking this just puts emphasis on the fact that ccp might be fine with obliging player desires to buy their way literally through the game even more so than plexisk let them do now
wtf ccp
ccp i do not think this is a good road to go down i request you reconsider
supported controlling the real money for ingame advantage moneyselling phenomenon that plagues other mmos is one thing that ccp has done well going down this route would be a step towards undoing that good work terrible idea

hi i am willing to pay for a special implant that gives 100 weapon damage 100 speed boost 100 shields and armour and doesnt go away when i get poddedalso i will pay to change the colour scheme of my zealot please allow me to make it black like a stealth bomber also i would like this paint job to decrease enemy radar resolution so in effect i get 500 lock time delay on me at all timesumm where is the shop and how many plexs will it cost me to get these 2 things
remap for plex  terrible idea
i openly object to the plex wing that ccp is silently trying to bring upon usi meanwtfnot even a word but i suspect this is the reaction they were trying to avoidyou sell all this  about minor modifications sansha invadeswho the hell cares that affect nobody when serious issues have not been resolved and you present it like we should thank you for actually doing your job but for this that actually affects the whole concept of the eve community not even a wordi have never been a fan of the oldest profession and i dont intend to start nowi mean it was ok when the gtc trade was introduced as you were trying to close down isk sellers even okish when the plex system was introduced that was more or less the same but to actually change the one thing that makes eve special the fact that even if you have 1 mil euros in the bank you would still be at the same level as the dude that makes minimum wage and started on the same day as you sure you would be be able to buy a lot of flashy things but at least your character and your skills that are the things that matter wouldnt take into consideration the depth of your pocketsnow the more money youre willing to donate to ccp the better youll be ingame and yes there is a great difference between training for a skill in 19 days and training for the same skill in 15 eventually youll catch up time is what made this game special not the instant gratification those who need it should search elsewherewe who dont will search elsewhere if something like that gets introducedthose who fed up their remaps should learn from their mistakes as we all didbad ccp badkostas smacks ccp with a newspaper on the noseand yes i support this thread and i would support it 3000 more times if i had the money to afford 3000 accounts
remap for plex  bad idea
wtf ccp 
i hope ccp be trolling fail idea is fail
we do not have plans to go microtransaction with eveno there are no microtransaction plans whatsoeverson i am dissapoint
a step in the wrong directionplease dont
i dont think its quite the end of the world that people are predicting but i do think plex for pizza should be far higher up the priority list than silly remaps supported for this reason
planning ahead is eves spiritif one sucks at it he better play something elsesoftcore eve is that way  i dont think this would be the end of the world but it is definitely a step in the wrong direction man weve been ambushed and were fitted for long range ok guys  grab your plexes were gonna instarefit in space to short range we gonna pwn em because we have the money 
keep the system the way it is this system works fine and doesnt need changing
slippery slope
finger  hand
i really dont see the problem while wealth in game and out of already brings all sorts of advantages i cant see this giving anyone any particularly unfair edge all it means is that those who want to will be able to mix up their skill plans without the 12 month wait of training xy skills instead of ab skills at a lower rate i respecced to intmem a few months ago on my main and theres still plenty enough to keep me satisfied until my remap becomes available again if youre too addimpatient to be able to stick to a skill plan then more fool you for wasting iskcash on chopping and changing all the time andor drunken rage remapping
i have to support this completely as well ive never threatened to ragequit before but ccp taking cash or a cashequivalent to make a character better ingame is exactly what it will take for me to leave this game
its not a very thorough proposition but surely would help remedy the ridiculous annoyment of current planetary interactionwhat were they thinking when they set up the million clics per planet i really dont know its simply stupid and absurd and annoying

first my main gripes about poss after having lived out of them for the past 8 months1 no way to make someone have config starbase level abilities limited to just a single tower if you have private poss then a config starbase person needs to come to help them every single time they want to change something2 not enough levels of access for structures for example to set access to an sma it must be either everyone fuel tech or config starbase everyone is obviously not very limiting and config starbase will typically be directors  12 other people so across an entire corp and all their poss you only have 1 higher level permission you can use 3 no way to make it easier to offlineunanchor structures without also allowing them the ability to completely offline the tower4 requires config starbase to change reaction chains at least t3 ones not sure about t2 5 pos shields will eject unmanned ships that show a pilot if the pos doesnt allow corp access and someone bounces from the shields the pilot obviously knew the pw to get into the pos so why are their ships getting ejected later while its amusing finding free dreads floating in space 200km from a tower i dont think its an intended mechanic6 inability to anchor capital smas without sov obviously anchoring csaas should require sov but why csmas they are not just useful for supercaps itd be nice to be able to use a csma in wspace instead of anchoring 8 regular smas to hold caps for example some requested fixes1 allow 1 character name to be added to an onlined pos this person has config starbase equivalent power but only at that pos this isnt a trivial change so probably skip this one for now tbh2 add 34 other groups that can be selected when determining access to structures instead of a dropdown menu being corp fuel tech config starbase it could have those 3 as well as 34 others 3 break up the unanchoroffline permissions into 2 sets the ability to unanchoroffline structures at a tower and the ability to unanchoroffline the tower itself4 make it so you do not need config starbase to change t3 reaction chains 5 dont eject unmanned ships from a pos unless perhaps the pw is changed6 please remove the sov requirement from csmas
i have no idea how feasible this would be butit would be nice to be able to set the game to remember forcefeild passwords ideally cache all the passwords for each pos you visit but even just having one persistent password saved through session changes disconnects etc until changed again would help
my input on fuel pelletsit obviously isnt quite as easy as just add a bpo for pellets and itll be fine considering the varying fuel requirements for different towers in different systems to solve that though id have a couple of ideas1 the bpothe options here would be to either make four different bpos one for each isotope or one while streamlining the isotopes into one type that would however have a significant impact on ice mining and ice product economy as it would mean all ice types produce the same kinds of stuff i dont necessarily see it as a bad thing personally but could understand anyone who does it would simplify one small aspect of eve though and would also create the option to cut down the four basic ice asteroid types to one2 the fuelpelletitemas for the item itself another problem that needs to be solved is that different poses munch through more fuel than others do most significant difference there is obviously the pos size but some faction towers also consume more or less than their normal counterparts so by that logic one bpo producing one item wouldnt be enough for all poses as the different components sometimes cant be divided into small enough parts to make poses use x amounts of pellets per hour and keep the current consumption ratioone solution for this would be to treat fuel pellets like rams faction or mining crystals make them take damage x per hour once one item is consumed the pos starts munching the next onesmall edit reprocessing the pellets should either not yield anything at all or an amount of stuff equal to whats left in the pellet depending on damage taken to avoid exploits 3 starbase charterseven if isotopes were to be streamlined into one type thered still need to be five different bpos for poses in empire space and lownullseccouple of solutions herea get rid of starbase chartersb dont include starbase charters into the bpo add them separatelyc streamline empire starbase charters worse option as youd need one bpo with charters and one without themmy stuff probably been proposed and discussed elsewhere already but i didnt checknot supporting cuz i cant twice p
seriouslywhen you shoot someone with a torpedo it makes a big flashy shockwavebut the shockwave is just eye candy since torps only hurt the targetthen you shoot someone with a bomb and it makes a little spark just a little puffoh and it kills everything in 15kmi wouldnt go so far as to say they should be completely swapped since torps are used more often and should still look coolbut i would say that big aoe effects should accompany big aoe weapons and smaller effects should accompany smaller weapons

i support the part about being able to anchor the droneits kind of annoying when orbiting really fast in a frigate
i love the near complete and total lack of rp emphasis in eveits amazingits like ccp should just fire their entire fiction staff stop wasting time and effort making up storylines background history or anything unrelated to i shoot you i get your stuffive actually had a similar thought when it comes to pov during transitrather than watching your ship fly through planets and other solid objects the camera drone watches the ship leave the grid either using some sort of star trek there they go poof or a babylon 5stargate hyperspace window either way when you warp off the ship vanishes then the camera zips ahead to the destination and begins rendering the scene this would hopefully help with all the lag issues since your comp isnt focused on rendering everything between a and b including the inside of every planet moon station etc the camera renders the destination and then watches your ship exit hyperspace or just fly into the gridanother thought still along the lines of the hyperspacest warpinstead of seeing all of space around you including the inside of planets as you warp from a to bthe tunnel effect we see should be made much more opaquethe ship goes to warp and we are just left with a shimmering tunnel and our shipthen it unfolds as we approach the destinationagain i think it would help alleviate the strain of loading the destination grid if it didnt have to think about every point in between

after reading the discussion so far i am leaning towards this proposalpreserve the state of active nonchargeusing nonprojective modules such as damage control drone control hardeners etc over playercommanded gate jumpsthis deals with the issue of buffing autopilot haulers in empire and can probably be done by just having the client remember the state and send the commands to the server after a jumpquestion should this be extended to cynos and bridgingthe issue of whether or not to make damage control full passive should perhaps be mentioned but with a note that it should only be considered if it will have significant antilag benefits
i would bet that ap is also client side and not server side so from a server side standpoint you wouldnt really care if the ap or a player issued a jump command and as pointed out before  i often use ap to jump during laggy server conditions right click start gate  add as first waypoint  hit ap button i am quite sure many others do so aswell so to save the commands being send to the server you shouldnt differ between ap and non ap jumpand i mean it gets a positive side effect suicide ganker get a new challenge given both are pretty common ways of moving in 00 where most of the laggy fights happen i would say yes
so the fact dreads cannot move for 10 minutes have the mass of a planet and cant track at all isnt enough lolwhy use a dread instead of a sc perhaps because they cost way too much to use as much as dreads they take way longer to train for than a dread and you are stuck in it for the most part dreads are quick and easy to train for and relatively disposable plus scs cant shoot a pos as for your comparisons a titan does about 25x the damage of a dread scs do about 10k dps 12k for the nyx and moms actually have more ehp than titans if fit right dreads are also meant for cap warfare so you arguement of scs being anticapital is moot dreads do less dps than a bs out of siege and are complete  in siege because of their restrictions im not saying give it 1000 scan res and be able to lock 20 targets im saying give it the scan res of a bs or an unsieged dread and be able to lock 5 targets or just one of the two they are pretty bad as it is because of the introduction of fbs and the insane hp buff the scs got dreads deserve some lovin too
yeah this and what one other guy said the others are just bitter vets who want end game toys the only effect a dread could really get that would revitalize it is a 10 resist per lvl of weapon reconfig across the board to make it even remotely useful in todays game wtf would anyone field them against sc or titan any day if this werent true unless it was a sure kill time limiting and you could guarantee extra supers werent gonna drop on youtrue story 40 dreads vs 5 sc my moneys on the sc without 1 loss
because of tackle problems or in terms of pure combat stats because those dreads combined have about 4x the dps and the same hp as the moms and the only really special advantage of the moms in soft stats is the ecm burst which doesnt work on dreads the rr helps some but it doesnt do much against 200k dps assuming a steady stream of dictors to hold tackle the moms would die like lemmings over a cliff the advantage of moms is that playerforplayer they kick the crap out of anything that isnt a supercap and itll always be easier to get 5 guys into fleet than 50 but iskforisk dreads eat them alive
assume scs commit the scs would easily win the dps race  whether it is without any losses on sc side is another matter might lose one but would win the fight very decisivelythe dreadnaught has been utterly obsoleted by the introduction of cheap scs after the last tweaks to sc manufacture costs the amount of scs has skyrocketed to a point where supply outstrips demand ie not enough people with skillssince nerfing scs this early after boosting them makes no sense a buff to dread capabilities are very much in order i thinkps edit was a suggestion a few days ago in fi about giving them a projected smartbomb type weapon flak cannons could revitalise them as a direct counter to the sccarrier blobs we have been experiencing lately
1 rr on a mothership can negate nearly 1 dread worth of firepower on another mothership because of the super high resist 5 motherships can kill one dread in a range of 45sec  1 min eachdepending on exactly how you choose to start the fight motherships can actually get well under a dreads tracking limit actually hurting their dps a pulse fit revelation only tracks about 27ms a beam fit does about 16ms per 10km so if youre inside of 10km you can break tracking with full speed by nearly 35 times and it becomes exponential as you half your distance a lot of people really dont understand just how much that affects dps of dreadsand oh yeah unless you have about 10 hics motherships are free to warp out if needed dreads are not motherships hot dropping 40 dreads also have the ability to dictate range meaning if they park at 80km they can reduce a dreads dps by something like 30 initially once fighter bombers get in range of the dreads the moms can always move further away while not affecting their fighter bombers ability so dread dps declines over time while mothership dps is constant after a baseline of fb travel time and oh yeah heres the biggest thing beyond just that raw fight you can choose to park motherships at 50 and addtionally deploy 5 triage carriers at 40km range behind the fight and with just those 5 regular capitals of difference youve increased your ability substantially if you attempted to do the same thing with any number of carriers assisting dreads you project absolutely 0 more defensive ability while in siegei could add more reasons but quite honestly those should be enough fyi standard fleet fit dread does about 4200 dps in siege with faction cr ammo thats about 168000 dps with 40 dreads not 200000 if you have nyxes they can repair about 3800 dps per repairer an aeon is about 5500 dps per repairer meaning 8x repairers negate between 8 or 10 dreads worth of dread damage is the 5 v 40 rule 100 error proof no but then again i dont expect scrubs to be the ones trying itironically we just took a fight with 4 moms and 12ish carriers having about 4 titans and 4 moms  20 dreads and 10 carriers and about 50 fleet and it took around 58 minutes per kill they kited dread range carriers died first there was 0 lag and we had approximately 60 dreads worth of firepower yet managed to lose 4 carriers with titan and fleet bonuses even with rr assistance ie stronger than typical dread tanks and oh yeah the motherships were lol fit because they werent expecting to get hot dropped so they were anti fleet fit not anti capital costing them probably 12mil ehp or more each
agreed though id wager youre not mounting 8x rr on each mom five moms do 40k dps a fairly typical trimark dread can tank 10k for three minutes with 2m ehp so just over a minute per dread except phoenixes will last closer to 2 minutes per valid point and a lot of it depends on layout however you should notice the sig radius on those moms and how it affects the tracking calculations dread guns have a sig resolution of 1000 moms have a sig radius closer to 12000 that gives dread guns a x12 tracking buff when shooting moms a fullspeed aeon goes 66 ms a beam revelation tracks at 000144 meaning that the aeon has to be within 4km to outtrack the dreads guns doable against one dread sure but against 40 the dreads will be too spread out for it to be physically possible of course which is why i posited a lot of dictor backup in a direct unsupported fight the dreads would never siege both sides would just warp off at need and nothing would die yeah but if the dreads drop the moms then the moms wont clear the range until the fight is long over so assume a lr fit on the dreads and everyone staying in range the whole fight seems fairest if youre positing a triage support fleet then ill posit a battleship support fleet whoops moms are dealing 1k dps each now because all their bombers are dead cr dreads can break 6k lr are about 4k i just picked a number in the middle and i have no idea where you got 5500rep on an aeon i have seven meta 14 hardeners and a dc ii on here909 lowest resist and see 4191rep lets take 40 rev vs 5 aeon revs are fit cheap 4k dps lr 2m ehp 10k tanked for 3 mins aeons are fit pretty expensive 8k dps 2 reps for 7 mins and 1 rep thereafter 54m ehp dreads pop every 60 seconds first dreads death kills 7584m hp on a mom second dread 7344 third 7104 47 6864 6624 6384 6144 for a total of 48048m damage dealt when the second reps turn off the next minute deals 6912m damage which kills a mom at the same time as the eighth dread dreads start dying every 90 seconds now six dreads die to kill the second mom and they start lasting 140 seconds the third mom takes maybe 5 dreads down the fourth kills three and the last mom kills one lonely dread before falling seventeen dreads hold the field at 7580 efficiency
hmm lets see 5 spider tanking scs vs 40 dreads that cannot receive remote reps of any kindever heard of the term aggregate firepower its what you lose when you start bleeding ships the dread group firepower will be max at the beginning and dwindle down while likely nothing will happen to the scs
this and other thingsyour bs killing fighter bombers its not even close to mimicing what bs do to fighters off the top of my head fighter bombers have about 4x the hp of a fighter meaning it takes much larger coordinated effort to start killing them i remember hearing some fc tell me recently his fleet d fighter bombers for 45 minutes until the 10 sc he was facing finally ran out then he conceeded they just pulled them back and never launched the backup wave they have it takes a long ing time to kill that many fb some sc have fighters as backup some only go fb so any time i ever do hp calc for any type of fleet i assume command ship is included in todays eve organized ops wo command ship bonuses are rare in any normal instance where force isnt overwhelming and even then rare so the aeon number is reflective of that assuming moms are going to stay in 50km range over the duration of a long fight just because you want them to so your numbers holds up makes about as much sense as the guy who says lr bs will kill armor hacs that sit at 180km the entire fight if youre the sc fc youre job in a hairy situation like that is to minimize incoming damage in 1 way or another if it means moving out to a further optimal point so dreads have to trade down ammo you better damn well do it like i said before 5 vs 40 isnt for chumps but then again chumps arent likely to take that on anyways btw math wiz if you have 5 moms and 1 is primary the other 4 have 2 rr each  8 total ie 8  10 dreads of lost firepower over the course of 10 youre killing another 10 dreads so now youre down to 20 dreads of firepower add in all the other defensive factors possible for moms and you really start to see how that fight becomes winnable wo taking a loss would anyone with sense hot drop 40 pl dreads with 5 moms nowould pl drop anyone in the prov block using 40 dreads with only 5 moms atm maybe is anything in eve this simple never
the only appropriate fix for dreads and to a lesser extent carriers and battleships is removal or serious retuning of supercapssupercaps have quite literally destroyed any effective use of caps and battleship hulls in large scale pvp basically anywhere a supercap can be they will be and any dreads or carriers on the scene must then gtfo or die and even if they choose to gtfo they will take substantial losses this is a gaping flaw in the whole scheme of nullsec and lowsec pvp the supercaps were designed obstensibly with the idea they would be ultrarare alliance assets which would never be seen in large numbers now were seeing them in the hundreds and nullsec warfare in particular has stagnated to death because of ittldr remove and refund supercaps leave dreads and carriers as they are
ive thought about this a little but what if you made it to where dreads dont have to siege up thier bonuses somewhat to like where a titan is and trash the tracking so thier not effective against smaller than capital ships take the siege module add it to the titan dd to be able to do a area of effect dd but without it do the one shot deal the big problem is dreads when seige are like setting twinkeys in front of a overwieght person  as it is there isnt much that could really chase moms off just a thought though
what might be somewhat more interesting is give some of the small support ships a increased capability in killing fighters and bomberssay assault frigates or destroyers with webbing bonuses against dronesfightersbombers and if ehp is an issue perhaps a dps bonus as welli would rather look at some of less utilized ships as a counter against sc damage than just say we should remove scs from the gamehowever in saying all that back to the opit would be nice to have a slightly increased ability to dread targeting while in siege even if its just obfuscate the primary target in cap fights
im not sure that buffing underutilized ships to be sc counters really helps when scs are clearly taking over everything elses roles i dont really see any choice but supercaps being nerfed and hardliang
it has about the same amount of traction as a fat middleaged redneck covered in grease sliding down a 40 grade slope in a frictionless environment
tro lo lo lo lol lo lo lol lo lo loooo
to the op give me a plex and i will upgrade your ship and clone to a new one free of charge
610 timely with the remapforplex proposal but too obvious
oh well then youre just a damb fool and as you can see noone supports the idea of a cash shop asking for one in a game you like makes about as much sense as asking your city council to zone the house at the end of your street as a crackden
so i assume this is some kind of satire on the plex for neural remaps thing right if it is pretty funny if its not then this idea is obviously awful
i generally dont mind ingame shops though i personally never use them but holy  your examples are so dumb theres just no way anyone sane would support this a real ingame shop inventory would look something likerainbow engine trails replaces default engine trails 10rainbow laser crystals replaces multifrequency 10rainbow heavy missile replaces scourge 10rainbow explosion when my ship explodes replaces normal explosion 10etcanything that gives any real advantage is generally a bad idea and will lead to 1 everyone except the guys that spend a ton of cash quitting or 2 if bonuses are tradable broken economy which then eventually leads to everyone botting so they earn cash to buy said bonuses from people selling themeither case is bad for the gamepretty much this
satire has such nice conotationsif this thread stays near the top of the board with as much support as a pedophile managing a kindergarten whilst the converse thread stays at the top and becomes the most supported idea in the assembly hall hopefully ccp will see some sense
first off people have been complaining for a long time about the learning skills making training too fast also we have remaps now so choosing a race and stats in the beginning is meaningless beyond simple aesthetic purposes and starting area attribute implants are cheap and easy to get and thus add little to the game experience you only think about them while training cybernetics or for a few minutes after you die until you can get a new setkeeping all that in mind i dont really see the point of even having an attribute system anymore just set skill training speeds at somewhere around what 2025 attribute points gets you now and do away with the whole systemmaybe keep the implant system with implants that only affect a single set of skills like spaceship command electronics etc that go into a single slot number that would make the implants more of an isk sink by creating more turnover in the market the people who hide in hisec amassing sps with a full set of 5 implants wont have as many people whining about them since theyd have to replace the implants occasionally just like pvpers
i would like to see attributes actually effect skills aside from sp like other rpgs ive always felt attributes to be something you remap to power lvl skill groups for a while thats it
so your proposal is to in effect make eve less complex than it is now and provide even fewer choices to the players in terms of customizing their own charactersno no sorry i dont like that at all
i dont like this idea i wouldnt mind seeing attributes weighing a bit more in the balance though and rather not have them remapped with plexsimplification over improvement  not supported sorry
vc general just shut up
well guys as it sez in titali would like ccp to change the stelath bomber modles to that of the fighter bombersthis is mostly because they did sutch a good job making them look epix and i would love to see people flying these ships insted of limiting there apearnce to low sec mom blobs and 00 warfarethaughts
i would recommend you spell check and rework your thread for hope of having your proposal met with constructive replies
well i see ur point my spelling is 1st grade standard at best  but im not writing a 50 page plan of implimentation here its simple and to the point i u dont understand it then hit me up in game and i will use my voice to convey the point     oh yer 1 support for my idear
badenglishparsermy idea is to have the stealth bomber models changed to match those of the fighter bombers used by each race so that we can see people flying those instead of limiting them to tiny dots on the screen in nullsec blob warfarebadenglishparserwhile i really like the fighter bomber models myself i dont think i can support this
noand dear lord lern2english
you cant even spell stealth bombers correctly and youre proposing changes to themgtfo
im sorry playskool is that way this is eve onlinewhere we speak english and try to have intelligent discussions on these forumsim not going to even bother trying to read or understand your post ignoring all other translations because i can  o p 
what im suggesting changing is step 1 to receive bug report and let the whole population of eve players know about the bug and that they will be penalized for using it and 4 to ccp levies the minimum penalty that they had already committed themselves to via policy announcements to thousands of players the first time and hopefully next time it will only be 500 and then 100 the time after thatthe specific exploit team is i think already in existence as the bughunters but they seem to be horribly understaffed increasing staff would probably help them become more effective but it also costs money that ccp cant put into things more of the players encounters daily imo bugs should be given much more dev time but apparently shiny new things are higher priority than cleaning the rust of and repainting
hi guys n galsi am very new to the forums so this may already have been raisedi have been thinking that with so many battles going on a simple way for a player to track visually would be for different factions to have different coloured explosions when their ships or structures blow upthis could be attributed to the different factions using different compounds in the manufacture of the items in question or slightly different atmospheric factors in these structuresi personally find the explosions a bit dull compared to what could be achievedplease let me know if this is possiblethankyou
i am going to go ahead and not support this because i dont want the eve devs to spend time on superficial changesnicetohaves etc
yeah im gonna have to leave this unsupported as wellone reason being if ive zoomed my view in on the ship im trying to kill i dont get to enjoy the explosion anyway as soon as it dies the camera flies back to my ship and is often pointed in the opposite direction of the killthe only ship explosion you really get to watch and enjoy is your own
ccp gets around 30000 petitions a month source so its unrealistic to expect a 2448 hour response time on most issues
the few times ive had to petition i havent had to wait more then an hour or two tops one of em being the same day dominion was launched
a good pirate is nearly impossible to catch in lowsec and theres no incentive for an individual whos goal is to make isk to go out into lowsec with a pve ship a corp can try to control a lowsec mission hub or whatever but then you basically just end up with small scale blob warfare but with sentry guns and no bubbles it cant be fixed with game mechanics its nothing more than carebears realizing that pirates want to kill them and that they arent as safe in lowsec as they are in hisec or even in nullsec surrounded by corpmates theres really nothing to be done to fix the problem other than nerfing hisec to the point that its a waste of time and buffing lowsec to the point that nullsec is a waste of time
heres a thought first shipp all the store stuff to the 4 areas that ccp has offices in and let the shoper chose where it will be shiped from ie usa get it from ga 2nd i would buy eon mag with plex but the shiping just stops me still on anything from the store
that is quite possibly the dumbest thing i have ever heard plex basically  1495 once someone has bought a plex ccp has made its money its done now lets say i used plex to buy something from the eve store that was worth 1495 then i turn around and sell it for 13 thus undercutting ccp and making that person not buy something from ccp at this point ccp still has its money someone else has my isk and my merchandise no one got a month of free gametime and ive made less money than ccp ccp still wins in that scenario especially when assuming someone else will have to buy a plex or pay a subscription fee to keep the account open that my original plex was supposed to have done
i like this idea alot actuallyi would never buy eon magazine but if i could trade a plexmaybe
when the client updates the asset information in the asset window the scroll bar in the asset window jumps to the top if you have lots of buy orders this happens every few seconds it can be hard to even look at assets sometimes because the scroll bar constantly jumps to the top i propose the scroll bar not jump to the top when the asset data updatescalm and collectedthis is driving me crazy
you think thats bad i have two separate chat windows with different channels in each whenever an item trades on market it forcibly shifts focus to the bottom window even if youre in the middle of typing in the top one i literally cant finish a sentence for half an hour after i put up mineral buys in jita
the name does not accurately portray the damage that these missiles do to armor tanks the name should be instead changed to bryan havoc fury heavy missiles because there is no greater fury than bryan havocs
supported
sounds like a good idea to me
if what you are saying is true about ccp not breathing a word to the csm about this then this speaks volumes about how they feel about the csm a facad is all the csm truly is just some experiment to make the players think they have a say in things i have always known the csm was pointless but deep down i was hoping i was wrong that thread in assembly hall hit 20 pages or rage in 24 hrs i can not think of another thread that has come close to that except maybe the carrier blog a few years agoso what is the csm plans on this what are you going to tell ccp that they can already read and choose to not give a reply thus further adding to the rage i might add for themselvestime to earn those free trips to iceland free fan fests free subscriptions and who knows what else ehh csm
i dunno putting something on sisi without asking the csm certainly doesnt seem like a big deal especially something that doesnt really make much of a difference just letting people remap more often instead of utilizing 1 year plansnow if the entirety of the csm thought it was a terrible idea and told ccp to please not put it in because it would ruin the game and were ignored thatd be something else but is there really enough of a problem there to justify the csm picking this as a point to fight for personally i think its a good idea even though itll make all my plex purchases a bit spendier
terrible idea
marconus did you read the recent csm blog
i didto be honest it is very little that is being done considering the vast amount of things that need to be fixed not the csms fault really every term there is probably fifty new things that ccp needs to fix the players want it the csm passes that along to ccp which is silly because ccp reads the forums anyways so its not like they dont know about it like a middle man then ccp fixes say one maybe two things so after every term the pile of things that need fixed gets bigger and biggerbut i guess the csm can only be a loud parrot for so long
i like the style of your post  sum at the top and explain afterwords soundbite types can see it up front those that find it interesting can read the whyon the faction navy interventions  i think that should work just like concord but no concord at all will show up that way its just replacing the logic used for concord with fn ships which arent immune and can be outrun but that will call for more ships to help out so you get in do the deed and run like hell or potentially face swarms of npcs that will overwhelm any force but which can be outrun andor avoided no impossible to avoiddefeat junk just regular faction type ships with a lot of support available if the fight keeps dragging on
terrible idea there are consequences for your actions eve is a sandbox
if i could remap sp i would totally undo all that wasted sp spent into mining
no actions and consequences my friend actions and consequences doesnt matter if its fitting a ship where chosing one module over another could mean life or death or choosing to skill mining skills instead of something else eve isnt about internet spaceships its about the consequences of your decisions whats next pay a plex to gain health points in a battle

okay heres the problem with that idea that tracking is not important you cant do any dmg to ships you cant trackwhy does every person seem to believe that a boost to tracking on blasters will magically make them be able to hit smaller ships my guess would be that theyre used to the way other guns already have proportionally good tracking for the range they fight in so they rightly think that better tracking on those guns would allow them to hit smaller ships too easily my friends blasters do not have this problemas most of you know the closer a ship is the greater their transversal velocity so it will still be beyond blasters to reliably hit smaller ships any better than any of the other guns simply because the transversal velocity will be higher at the ranges the blasters can do anything in particularly since they even have a hard time hitting ships of their own size currentlyall im asking for with a tracking increase is to make blasters actually viable in the range they seem to be built to fight in whats wrong with making them a tactically different kind of gun than the others ie being actually able to hit ships well at a close rangethat being said it also needs a dps increase to make it worth the time to get in range hell why not even shorten the range somewhat even more just to make sure they have to be close range id certainly sacrifice maybe 25 of the range for proportionally better tracking for its range and a dps boost
derp derp
i agree futa is what we need this would give a whole new meaning to the term station games
imo ccp is way too conservative in depicting technologically advanced hypercapitalistic environment that eve is supposed to have even the star treks 20thcenturyinfuture had more socially intriguing conceptschoices color depth do want
still no hybrid changes  thats suck maybe i should just leave eve for something else why are you guys working on stupid cosmetical changes
yes
best idea ever

missiles do have a major advantage over turrets they do exactly the same damage at 0km as they do at there max range its always nice when i realise my hml drake outdpss a nano cane at barrage range

fw was dropped completely the week before launchthere has not been one single hour of dev time spent on it sincethere are 2 weeks showing on ccps books as being fw dev however this was fw players spending 2 weeks of intensive debugging on standings lag in lowsec that effected all playersso the players dedicated 2 weeks of their play to logging and debugging for ccpwhen will ccp return the favourccp needs to spend at least the same amount on developing fw as they did on hyping itbest content in the game
fw before incarna fun as it may sound to walk in stations if i want to meet people ill go offline and head out into rl most people in eve i only want to see through weapons flare as their ship burns which fw gives me far more opportunity to do
not supported this will not help player retention quite the oppositeno the decision has not been made the only decision that was made was that the csm should approach ccp about it
yeah i dont see how removing learning skills and attribute implants is any different or better than what i proposed which is scrapping attributes completely if you get rid of those things well be down to 6 numbers and remaps that makes it nothing more than a system to discourage players from training skills in a more balanced manner instead of training similar skills in year long blocks for minmaxing purposes telling a new player they have to train 2 months of learning skills to get the best results isnt that much different than telling them after those 2 months are over they then need to train 6 months of intmem fitting skills they dont need yet in order to save that 2nd remap purely for ship and weapons training
learning skills are an admitted bad idea burn them with fire and help retain more new players
i would be 100 satisfied because i could get my friends to play without using most of their trial not doing anything
it does take away from the complexity but is the complexity there for a reason most games have the reason that behind training your skill is the foundation of attributes as you know such as intelligence dexterity etc but those attributes dont allow you to train faster rather they allow you to perform your job my efficientlythats not the case with learning skills which only allow you to train skill points faster that may have been the only thing that wasnt really thought out in this brilliant game when implemented an even larger problem as mentioned in the original information is that it makes getting people to stay with the game much harder it already has a huge learning curvethis is what i propose as a solution a modifier level 5 learning level cut the max learning level to level 4 which would give the player the same maximum training speed as level 5 the last level level 5 gives the player a 3 increase in whatever attribute is used for a particular job for instance if a primary attribute on a particular weapon is intelligence then you would get a 3 increase in damage for having intelligence at level 5 the secondary attribute would add another 2if it were level 5 alsofor a total modifier of 5 and in order to make it something that would entice newer players to strive for wo making the game unnecessarily hard in the beginning is to double or triple the training time of that last level from where it is now that way you have maximum training speed after level 4 and you dont have to train the modifier level until you are further into game play while that last modifier level takes a really long time to train and would be considered an elite skill for advanced players
im all for a complex skill system that makes a player have to really think plan and make difficult choices but the current learning skills do not do this so not exactly convincing rationale for keeping learnign skills as they arewant a genuinely complex interesting and fun skill system make it have real specialization that cant be overcome with time and accumulation of more skill points in order to be the best at x your going to have to sacrifice being suboptimal in either y or z tie the ability to use some skills to faction standings maybe for a few even regional sovereigntylearning skills as they are now are nothing more than a meaningless grind that new players if theyre interested in taking the optimal path most mmo gamers are forced to trainremove them
okplease i thought people in eve had common sense just think about it if ccp were to remove learning skills they would not give all people a certain amount of sp they will implement a set of maybe up to 100 scripts to tally apis that have a certain amount of sp in the learning skills category and refund that amount of sp to the characters that did train these and none to people who didnt so its basically win win for people that did and lose lose for people that didnt that being said i am all in favour of removing learning skills since i trainede them and i would get my sp back so meh s can think they wont get is back and say not supported but for me supported
ccp if you are trolling us then this was a very successful troll i really hope this isnt for real though i love this game the plex system is unique in itself you can use the gtc to buy shinies yes but you are still on the same level pretty much because what matters are skillpoints and the way you are going you look as if you are going to start selling skill points and that will ruin the game

i have to support this completely as well ive never threatened to ragequit before but ccp taking cash or a cashequivalent to make a character better ingame is exactly what it will take for me to leave this game

well when i read this thread i thought greed is a sin and i support this thread but then i notice many posts likeif this happens im gonna quit but the fact is most people in this game dont actually pay out of there own pockets for game time they make lots of isk and buy etc from others so you can hardly moan if they want another method to increase revenue besides im pretty sure most of the whiners here are freeriders anyway1 for ccp

dont allow the trading of plexs for extra neural remapsi quit wow because of that  and believe me i am going to quit eve because of it
i totally support this thread this is a very bad idea people start shortcutting buying skillpoints and there will be all kinds of bs going down with gate squatters and such takes the fun out of the game with an avenue like that if this goes through i quit and many of my corpmates agree
over a two year period you will gain no significant advantage over someone who planned their training in advance the advantage will only be in the short term being able to get into a t2 cruiser a couple of weeks earler due to having more shorter neural remaps there is a possibility for getting some advantage in terms of memint to perwil to chawil but over the course of a two year period that will amount to a week or sothe advantage is only in getting to fly a t2 ship sooner or getting to use elite command centres sooner players will not be building sp faster as a result of getting more frequent neural remapsif sp building rate is the issue you should petition for the removal of attribute implants learning skills neural remaps character transfers gtc to isk conversion and two spare character slots on an account
wtf ccp
noooo ccp but admittedly i also think the existing form of plex is terrible
supported just to make it clear the current plex system is rmt between players facilitated by ccpif one adds the option to directly use a plex for ingame gain  in whatever form  then it becomes microtransactions with ccpmicrotransactions mean extra costs for the players above and beyond the regular monthly feeso a big no to microtransactions 
no way wtf ccp

sp is the real factor that keeps the paytowin away ccp was known for rejecting that type of game rightplex in itself is not a problem  it keeps a lot of people playing building selling and blowing up things now it even can be destroyed but it will be a special item since it means if you buy it you give real money for something that you can lose in eve your loss is others gain you must be not in the right condition for computer games if you waste a neural remap you bought so theres a big no
ccp stop supplying crack for your developersor whoever is responsible for this terrible idea

i want to clarify the reason why most people are against plex for remaps because most people who are for this dont understand or do not want to understand the ability to remap with plex adds a form of wealth to the game  a service that gives you more flexibility in gameplay  this opposed to the current plex for gametime system where the wealth in the game is only redistributed between the playersso it is the current system of limited player rmt regulated by ccp versus the introduction of a microtransaction system where one buys ingame benefits directly from ccpi hope this helps and perhaps the op should clarify this in his post
wtfwhen ccp meen that they must do it then can ccp delet all my accounts

whats all the outrage aboutits not really that much of a benefitalso you can do it by plex which you can gain by a bit of moneymaking ingamespending like 6 hours for being able to remap if your slowbesides remaps are allready available for freeit just allows you to do it more often meaning you can make shorter skillplansseriously whats your whine about

oo wtf do not want
to all those that say they will quit ifwhen this goes in tq no you wont youll  and moan though but you wont quit youll probably even buy a plex off the market for a remap that you may need
wtf ccpif you want to ruin the entire gameexperience by establishing f2p micropayment options go ahead starts with plex for remap and ends by all you want just give us your money and get a titan char in no time dont even think about that
i play eve for same chance as a other playerbut with this function is this not possiblethis is so bad

make the control tower have an interface to manage all modules every function theyre called that for a reasonin more detaila window pops up from the ct interface where you can manage fitting methinks same interface as ships can be reused containers run functions have items moved from one to another maybe merge them all to one hangar listing
 oh god please please do thisbut please eventually add the rest infrom a pos director side of things ccp please redo the onlineanchourunanchour timers they made sense to stop pos spamming but these days i would rather not spend 56 hours setting up a towerif you want to put a delay on how long before guns become active to stop towers in hostile space being built instantly then have a warm upcharging timer that starts from when the gun is online and doesnt slow down the rest of the pos work
an idea that has been repeatedly proposed elsewhere but not in this thread as far as i see  allow multiple people to anchoronline modules at a pos at the same time reduce the time needed to set up a pos its not as complicated to implement as a queue and most of all promotes teamwork
agreed i believe back in the day before torps got one to many beatings with the nerf bat they had aoe damage as well and thats why there so flashy i do find it funny that the tiny explosion a bomb makes does so mush damage  half the time i dont see the explosion at all  zoomed out 
while your at it structure explosions could be so much better now they just explode in a odd pointy splosion and then everything just suddently disappears boring
yeah this makes sense and if ccp could implement something that is flashy enough to warrant the predominion gjallarhorn effect id be a happy man
i want big things to explode in ways that will make my sphincter clench and make george lucas cry tears of pure alderaanian joy
aesthetic change that would make sense

part ieve is gaining subscribers at a steady pace and has been since it was released that is of course very good and a standing ovation should be given to the developers who have been able to make a game feel so open and fresh for so many yearshoweverthere is a small problem and that is the amount of players who try the trial get tricked by the unforgiving world of eve and decide never to play this game again it doesnt take much for a player to decide to play something else if he has a bad start there are a lot of games to choose from these days my belief is that if someone was given a different experience during character creation and tutorial then it would take a lot more for him to actually give the game up  what you want as a new player is defniately not a wall of text every time you open a new window the information is not bad and should definitely be stored in a database of some kind accessible ingame  but only at a players requesteve is very broad and you dont really understand the awesomeness of eve with the current tutorials there are so many things to do but too much ruined by confusion in this thread i would like to give my thoughts and suggestions of how to make improved tutorials based on which profession you decide on during character creation my visions of good tutorials are the kinds that make you feel very personally related to the characters and the environment around youfirstly a small revamp of the character creation system need to be made to make it easier for players to choose their path character creation should be made during downloadinstallation of the eve client as the tutorials will be very customized with voice actingcinematics it would be very unnecessary for other players who are not playing the tutorials to download all this extra data if you are an experienced player it should be possible to skip the tutorials all together but you will have to select that during character creation as it will not be possible to cancel once you started  you will also miss the benefits the tutorials would give you my most important suggestion would be to create small secure branch of systems in unknown space which is only accessible to newcomers they would consist of 5 systems branched together and then a 6th system which will be where you complete the tutorial and move out to the real world of eve i have added a drawing of an example of how the systems could look like  mind you im not an artist
part iiyou will at this point specialize yourself in a profession as everyone deserted at this unknown part of space must contribute to the survival of the colony the character creation has become a bit simplified as you did the first part of it during client installation if possible the idea is that you only choose race and clan at first and at this point you will be making making the choice of which path to follow if you want to become a fighting or industrial pilot as always in eve this does not mean you cant swap paths later its only to supply you with the correct tutorial and some starting skillsthe tutorials will be a bit more interactive than they have been so far showing you how the market works  for tradersmanufacturers it will actually give tips and tricks on how to profit from the market as a trader it is an important quest in your tutorial to put up buy and sell orders on the market in order to generate some profit this will be a cutoff region of space so noone else will have access to this market and the people at this remote location will not have access to any outside market so the pilots here will only be able to get what the local market supplies  making it a lot more manageable at a first glance than wondering what all those thousands of modules do there will be some ammunition simple modules and a few t1 frigate blueprints available to get by completing certain missions this will help players specializing in this type of gameplay to get a good idea of what to do when they actually reach mainspace you will also meet the shady dealer sly that lives at his own little place a system down from the main hub sly is supposed to supply you with a contract for some parts at 10000 isk but will actually put it up for 100000 isk in order to demonstrate ways other players will use to try to scam and trick you nothing puts you off more in a new game than when you spent a long time getting your money up a bit only to lose it all by a player whos playing dirty i know you intended eve this way and i think its good to let people have that freedom but there is nothing wrong with warning new players of common risks if you accept the contract without realizing buck will compensate you but also let you know that he will not be there to help you next time and your money will be gonea specialized surrounding for the fighter pilot will be the hostile drone zone where some rogue drones that seem to have been made thousands of years ago with ancient technology have made a base of operations these drones are some very mild and early stage of sleeper drones and have some remarkable similarities in looks the reason they have stayed in that system seems to be because their ai has not figured out how to use a stargate yet they often scout and scan the gate though as it often releases energy bursts one mission in particular that will be helpful for future pvp pilots is where a friend of buck by the name of duck nah im kidding  his name is warren has sent out a distress call after being attacked by some drones you will have to fit a remote armor repair unit and actually use it or duck i mean warren will get blown to pieces this will be a good lesson in how its possible for pilots to help each other out in battlethe main thing with all these missions is doing what i would have to say have failed with in previous tutorials introduce many important aspects of eve but in a small scale the eve universe is huge and brilliant but if you get it thrown in your face the moment you start the game then it will feel very overwhelming
the final mission will be where buck contacts you and says he has detected an anomaly in a nearby system and tells you to equip a probe launcher on your ship and follow him to investigate you will now go to the exit system which is also instancedbuck will teach you how to probe out anomalies and you will detect a wormhole which should be very easy to scan out just to give players an idea of things that are possible when you visit the scanned out wormhole buck will start a conversation with you explaining that this might be your chance to get away from this unknown part of space he will tell you that you need to investigate and also that you should bring with you anything important as you might need it basically its a oneway ticket when you enter the wormhole it will be time for another cinematic and how the wormhole collapses before buck manages to follow you in and voila the real eve universe opens up to youi have many more suggestions and ideas on how to implement this but i wont bore you out with details on every single thought in my mind if you are not interested i hope you understand and like the main idea that im trying to convey thank you for taking your time in reading this
i got my first ransom when i was a trial i was only able to do this because eve has an open environment that uses very few nonplayer restrictions on where players can travel i probably would have quit eve if it were like most mmos where theres a starter area to shield newbies from the outside harshness
i personally am not looking for a store front in the sense of some other games as much as a way of being able to easily sell to your corpalliance at a reducedsubsidised price with suitable mechanics to prevent abuse of this reductionsubsidy
the feature should probably be able to do both if they implement it right
why make it ugly like the lp store just make it another market you can access just like the normal marketsperhaps to help with not ruining 00 markets allow this feature freely in lohi sec in 00 allow it only if you have sov if you lost a station lose sov you lose your market
yes  i like that linking it to sov would sort some of the issues out and having a limit like contracts would sort out the rest i would hopemarket or lp store would work for me  im not beholden to either especially
there is currently still a limit on pos being launched and anchored in the same systemlimits are5 a day for an alliance1 day for a corp from what i remember this was put it place to stop tower spamming when pos were used for holding sovereigntythis as we now know has changed and yet the limit is still therei understand this will only effect some people but im against random old bit of code that are set up to limit things it can be very annoyinglastly some praise to gm huginn because hes awesome
ccp could always add the damage percentage in the item attributes like they should have done years ago keeping that hidden really doesnt make a massive difference since most people run with spare crystals anywayedit even just adding something like a small icon somewhere on the crystal items image would be leaps and bounds better than guessing at this point
yes yes yes i jump into that situation from time to time dont see the rationale behind not allowing thatsigned
the reason damaged items cant be traded is because of scammers i dont see how this problem couldnt easily be fixed with the same warning popup you get when accepting a contract for fitted ships or containers in the first place
i think in eve you could make interceptor battles 200 times more intense or any battle for that matter if you had a joystick option for ships making it so you can or cannot use a joystick for eve to manually fly your ship in spaceone of the main reasons i bring something like this up is because i think alot of people are getting board with the same old warp in on target orbit at 15km drift out to 20km point shoot kill the answer nooooo this is too boarding for a game as imense and epic as eve we can have better and you guys can do better using star wars movies as an example imagine how intense a 20vs20 man frigateinterceptor fight would be if every one was manually flyingthis puts more skill on the individual rather than did he click the correct orbit rangei was thinking of a 4 axis moving plan up and down with the nose of the ship and tilt left and tilt right of course i supose you could add some sort of rudder for quick turn arounds which would be cool but you could just integrate it into the left and right axisi think you would have to make an in ship screenview so people can get the real intense feeling of flying a space ship into combat seeing the flash from there guns and the burn of the missiles flying out or into there ship i believe this would make the game extremely more enjoyable by creating the real space dog fightsalso im sure you can set your hot keys on the joystick to have a throttle and hot buttons for your warp scramble and guns as wellgive it some thought thanks gaijin mei heretic army
you troll you
imagine the lag in a 5v5
lagg could be an issue i suppose but think of how insane this would be
unsupportedno lag would be an issue eve can only run somewhat lagfree because it is amazingly efficient about the amount of data it sends to the server only changes in directionspeed and activating modules giving manual control to players will cause them to send velocity changes to the server far more oftenanyway since ship facing is irrelevant to everyones ability to hit you then what would you gain by piloting manually which you can already do by doubleclicking a lot
granted lag would be an issue but if they could fix that then it would be awesome and yes your right the way your ship faces doesnt have to do with anything however if u have pvped alot you would see the relevance with this when it comes to lowering transversal and angular flying but aparently you dont know these things lol
you can already do that by doubleclicking joysticks are great for reaction time and precision but dont really give you any new options if you change to a joystick method of control then youll allow people more easily perform a spiraling approach rather than the current angled approaches somewhat valuable in pvp but you can already do this with the orbit maneuver even if it is annoying to type in all those orbit distances but i dont think that is worth the absolute necessity of sharding the server to turn it into more of a flight simi guess the best way to explain it to you is to break down exactly what eve clientserver has to send now and what it would have to send after your changesunder the current system you only need to talk to the server when you change something flying in a straight line requires practically no bandwidth orbiting requires practically no bandwith an autocycling module requires only a hitmiss notification sent each cycle etcthere is a reason that there arent 100v100 dogfight flight sims the amount of data is impossible to transfer tofrom the serverinstead of a single new vector the server has to send data every few seconds as you move the joystickturn 80x 20yturn 75x 15yturn 20x 0yturn 30x 20yturn 75x 10yturn 80x 20yusing a joystick will inevitably increase server bandwidth requirements significantly by increasing the number of course changes those pilots must use to fly their ship
all right the lag will kill the game next  indeed we could have the cokpit view  that would be wait for it awesome 
that indeed would be incedibly awome and would probably bring lots and lots of ppl into eve as there are many afaik that hate the way you fly ships in eve but yeah it would probably be extremely hard to make work on a eve scale maybe in 50 years or so it could be possible until then keep on dreaming
we doyour capsuleer is sitting in a pod full of goo and sees exactly what we see trough the camera drones
allow players to choose specific modules to target and damage in addition to the current targeting system the more damaged the module the more of a diminishing effect it will have this would allow for more strategic combat in both pve and pvp examplesyour enemys ship is faster than yours you target and attack his propulsion the more damaged it is the slower the ship will goyour enemy is dealing out more dps than you you target his weapon modules and individually take them out the more damaged the lower the dps  rate of fireyour enemy is using a shield booster  armor rep and is too much of a tankyour enemy is being remotely boosted by an ally not capable of doing any dps to you
might be fun on supercaps but completely impractical for anything smaller
the 3 core focus spots for ships going into combat are their ability to hit decently avoid damage and take damage this suggestion seems to be aimed at gutting their ability to take damage which favors avoidance yet bigger ships have lousy agilitymaneuverability to avoid being hit if it is bypassing shields they become fairly worthlessif it bypass armor all armor tanks are worthless and many ships cant fit decent shield tankif it bypasses hull then hull tankinghull improvements become worthlessetchull tanking which has been used in the past though out of vogue now may not be a first line bright choice but some folks actually fit healthy buffers there and those modules would be worthless due to this change it would remove a surprise shockvalue fitting option from the gameplayers specifically pick the modules for their ships based upon a precarious balance of performance and ability to take damage and this would drastically change that by making avoidance of being hit vastly superior to a ships ability to sustain damage batches of frigates taking down capssuper caps by targeting their systems through the defenses not good
according to the incursion update release page pilots can join public fleets and cooperate to destroy the sansha incursions and return the universe to normal receiving wealthy bounties earning loyalty rewards and high commendationmake the bounties and loyalty points that result from destroying sansha fleets correspond to the security of the system that the event takes place in and possibly null but not highsec so that you get more rewards if you take the risk of going out to lowsecbasically highsec should have substantially lower rewards lowsec should have substantially higher rewards the content can either be the same so that highsec carebears can still kill battleship fleets if they enjoy doing that without skewing risk vs reward or more difficult npc sansha fleets can spawn in lowsec only but the rewards in highsec need to be minimal
one flaw with the keep state ideawhile this would work with bridgecyno it wouldnt work with gate jump as you cant run modules under gate cloak
so should we make people have to click to activate the armor platings both energized version and the nonenergized one and shield resistance amps while adding a slight cap use to them to get that effect as much as possible no just because it might in some niche scenarios be easier to kill someone if dc remains as it is doesnt mean thats the way its supposed to be if it was possible to fit and use a doomsday with a t1 frigate would the fact that removing that ability would result in fewer dead ships be a valid argument for not doing so again nothe only reason damage control is active right now is that game mechanics didnt allow for it to be passive in the past its time to fix that now
obviously it would require the client or perhaps the server to remember the module state when the jump begins and start the modules up again as soon as the player breaks cloak it occurs to me while writing this that a cloak timeout perhaps should not activate the modules
honestly id be more in favor of making things like energized plating powered than dcs unpowered passives if someone forgets to turn it on thats their fault and plenty of folks ive met forget to turn mods on early during combat and that costs them this recommendation may have some nice sounding arguments to it but the net effect is lazier less active modes of operation of ships in combat and i really find that lame
plz make new for remaps cost i not pay 450mill for plex card cost me 13billin for 3 accs 90 my isk i make in 30daysyou make remap pass make it cost 20 to 15so will not  up for ppl play sry i not look for 2nd job i join eve play for fun
well that how plex work sir no one will change that
not trying to be a jerk here but hear me outhaving spent literally years in online rpg admin i totally understand the following things1 programming ie adding features creates bugs its unavoidable2 tracking and squashing bugs takes time effort sometimes pure luck3 players get boredstale when new features arent added4 players can be the meanest bunch when their daily fix isnt available how they want when they wantnext i am also absolutely flabbergasted by the way i see eve customers treat the devgmpr teams absolutely nuts the customers behavior blows me away  they instantly turn into 4yearold brats who need a nap when any of the following happen1 a downtime is a second longer than estimatedprojected2 a bugfix introduces another bug3 a feature does not manifest itself exactly as the customer had hopedthoughtpredicted4 a freebiepromo is granted to the playerbase go read the threads about the primae if youve forgotten how absurd people can get over a freebie ridiculous what a bunch of childrenreading some of these threads especially ones begun by devs or notifications about dev blogs would make you wonder why they even bother seriously the way the customers treat ccps employees in some of these threads is mindboggling talk about a sense of entitlement mannow having said those two things i hope you get the picture that im sympathetic towards those who spend huge chunks of their lives building supporting and maintaining games like eve huge props for the thick skin in regards to the way the customers treat them wowbuteve is a commercial product you see their ads all over the place it is advertised and touted as a fully commercial product it is official to declare something as publically released ie not a beta etc pretty much brags about a certain level of polish finish robustness eve does not have that to congratulate a dev team on squashing bugs in a beta absolutely but touting yourself as a released commercial product never when people are paying money for a product they dont expect perfection of course or shouldnt but they should expect to receive a polished fullyfeatured stable commercial productfinding and squashing bugs is what the devs get paid for its their actual job i may be tickled pink and delighted to see a particular bug squashed but to pat them on the back forget it i expect bugs to get squahsed i pay to have bugs squashedmaybe if eve were in beta sure
i think salvager drones would be more useful than salvager ships like mining drones they would spread out gather and returni would have a great use for those pesky pirates or mission npcs that suffered an illfate at my hand the could also come to use in warfare you know clean up the dead pick for valuables etc i would buy a few my self at a reasonable price 200050000iskunit
why not salvager drones you askthats why
because then people would stop asking why the salvager drone skill is listed in the database
because ccps job is to make a good profitable game not make the game even easier for mission runners at the expense of everyone else salvaging drones would destroy the ninjasalvaging profession which would make eve less of a cold dark and harsh world and more of a happy candyland where everybody sings songs holds hands and runs missions together i dont think many people want to play in this candyland
because if you bothered to do a bit of reading before posting salvage drones would cause a hefty increase in lag according to ccp
more like wtf cargo hold i want a tech 2 with scrapmetal compression and more cargohold get it done
ive never tried it but bombers are about as hard to hit as cruisers and have 25k ehp so maybe a hac gang instead of battleships whatever a 20hac gang has the firepower to kill about one bomber every 4 seconds assuming the target broadcasts go through properly so thats less than 7 minutes to strip the first rack of bombers off 5 sc obviously thats heavily idealized circumstances how many fb did he kill and what did he lose in that period of time what did his fleet look like command ships on the moms up the rr close to 50 and the ehp by about 11mbut they also add 2k tank to the dreads and half a million ehp the dreads go from dying in 60 seconds to dying in 90 if you run that through then instead of the first mom dying at the same time as the eighth dread it dies at the same time as the seventh dread adding command ship bonuses across the board are actually worse for the moms because their resists have far higher stacking penalties from all the extra hardeners and thus they gain less ehp relatively speaking agreed its a simplification dreads can maybe exit siege and miniwarp to close the range back down but it seems unfair to assume one side is permabubbled and the other gets to use slings at will remember though if the fight starts at zero range it will take the moms something like 13 minutes just to get out of the dreads optimal with multifrequency by then youve already lost one mom and a second is bleeding badly im not a moron i included that in my above numbers without rr thered be 22 surviving dreads not 17 of course im just saying at equal isk values dreads are perfectly competitive with moms in a straightup fight and in terms of raw number theyre actually significantly superior the reason why moms are the gods of the battlefield is that isk isnt generally the limiting factor pilot count is and moms are vastly more pilotefficient than dreads are im not saying that theyre not good  a proper fleet of moms is scary as  but theyre not invincible

liang i just kitted up an excel sheet to analyze the numbers much more carefully than i did the first time around i show 20 dreads surviving killing the last mom at t2795 which is pretty much in line with what i got the first time i can email youor anyone else interested a copy if you want to check my numbers theres a couple minor kinks left due to the handling of timestamps in discrete secondswhich it seems you didnt do but theyre pretty insignificant the dread death times agree well but i really have to wonder where you got your mom death times from i get moms dying at t473 972 1534 2151 and 2798 care to email me your work im curious now   the extra three dreads are seemingly because i used slightly pessimistic numbers about dread survivability the first time around turns out that surviving 67 seconds instead of 60 actually makes a pretty big differenceedit realized theres an easier way to show my work
i notice a few things there1 when the 4th sc dies dreads can tank more then the dps put out by the remaining sc in your spreadsheet that results in their damage taken column going into the negative which is ofc impossiblebut at the same time if your dread fit can tank 10k while only 8k is incomming its true that they can save up some cap and tank for longer instead 2 dread cap most of my dread experience come from the pl sniper dread fleets with a single repper but your tank numbers require 2 and a quick look at eft seem to indicate that cap life for tankguns is indeed about 3 minuteshowever moroses and revs use cap to fire their guns so once they get primaried they will not have full cap and will not be able to tank for quite as long3 following 2 if a dread really use up all its cap it may no longer be able to even shoot at all so capped out dreads should reduce the dread fleets dps too4 i dont think overheat is considered for either side overheating the hardeners and crars on the scs should increase repping very significantly at the start of the fight and quite a bit immedietly after each sc goes down aswell when the next sc get to overheat its hardeners crars are already heated close to max ofc in the same way the dreads could heat their local reppers 2 mins or so increasing tank by 30 similarly to the crars dreads can also overheat guns for a while at the startwhat are the exact fits youre assuming for dreads and scs
if eve were played right in the optimal of a dread with full cap where armor reps cycled properly while a sc sat at 0 speed within 58km range at all times and dread pilots were as typically inclined to have max skills in all things dread related as sc pilots were 10k dps tanked per second for a dread is really high btw its a lot closer to 4k also its easy to cycle targeted items such as rr when an local rep get stuck youre sorta ed til the game gets over itselfalso if you take your scenario where dreads dictated the fight by hotdropping the sc your dreads just started at about 35 capacitor thats a huge crippling factor
yeah i know i figure its an acceptable fudge for the reasons you list besides by that point it doesnt matter much the fight is over valid points however changing the dreads tank duration to 2 minutes means that 19 dreads survive instead of 20 so it doesnt matter too much and for comparison if you drop the dread tank to 4k capstable then 9 dreads survive this is a halfhour fight overheating wont make too huge a difference also since it affects both sides roughly equally im assuming its a wash revssiege 3x dual giga beam wblood mf3x cap recharger ii sensor booster ii2x capital repper 2x heat sink ii 2x eanm ii damage control ii cap power relay ii3x trimark i5x bouncer iiaeons remote ecm burst 2x capital rr large neut 2x large smartbomb5x cap recharger ii i dont think most mom pilots are willing to spring for officer rechargers which is why it only lasts 7 minutes with both reps runningdamage control ii 2x xtype explo hardeners xtype emthermkin hardeners 2x dracliras eanms very expensive but i figured id give them a solid advantage5x trimark ii20x mixed bombers zero speed doesnt matter  moms are so immense that theres no conceivable tracking issues if we assume that the moms clear the range asap from zero then two moms are dead before they even leave mf optimal and if we assume dread 4 and cap turret 4 then the dreads still do over 3500 not with a dualrep tank whether you want one depends on fleet size of course with 40 dreads its not crazy though youre into the territory where a third eanm or a third hs is quite arguable too i went with the dualrep setup because thats what i usually use though the dread fleets i fly with are smaller i assumed that any lag is a wash i havent played enough highlag fights to really get a feel for which modules cycle best but assuming autorepeat works properly it shouldnt matter too much since pretty much everything just stays running until you cap out also this is a fight with perhaps 50 in local lag shouldnt be too huge a problem at all fair point but that repairs fairly quick even if we take one dread off the field while the rest cap up for a minute assume 3500 dps per dread and assume a 2minute tank life  a fairly pessimistic set of assumptions  then were left with 7 dreads holding the field not decisive as victories go but still massive isk efficiency and a clear enough victory to say that your 5 sc win with no loss claim is obviously false i mean yeah if you drop your moms 100km from a pack of blaster moroses sure but assuming an engagement and not a turkey shoot the dreads not only kill one mom but actually hold the field dreads are perfectly reasonable ships for the isk they just take more numbers in fleet to do the job thats something most groups prefer to avoid but its not a sign that theyre unusable
i can once im home but i cant right now the real clincher is how much rr happens at the beginning of the fight if it starts at 10k dps repped per sc then the dreads win with 11 dreads remaining 105 and the scs win with 2 carriers remaining its really touch and go and utterly ridiculous that 5 scs should even have a prayer of defeating 40 dreads in a stand up fight liang
i lold a little bit at work to this but then read the followup posts and yeah its indicative of a serious problem that even this hypothetical is so shot full of doubt for the dreads that it wont hold water im far more inclined to agree with liangs asessment of the encounters the scs clearly hold the cards regardless of what your premise ison a related and equally comical note given 8 to 1 odds that would mean a sc fleet of epic porportions the kind were already seeing now and the kind of which will probably be common place in another year or less 100 scs what then 800 dreads even if youre going to claim derp impossibul fix lag ive definitely got to take issue with considering a single ship wich currently does have the potential to be massed getting those kinds of odds against a cap to say nothing about how obsolete that makes everything else
wtf ccp

ok putting this idea out to the pod peoplewhat we need is a new type of shipmoduleone that can fit modules for bad intel think of a ship that when a specific module is fitted appears on the scanner and overview as another ship type so while your flying a frig i have xx module running with xx script that makes my ship look like a xx on scanneroverview i think the tech 3 frigs would be the perfect fit for this type of module or maybe even tie it in to a subsystem the idea is that while the ship is looking like another to sensors it is really quite useless in combat the question is do you think that this would work i think it would definatly change the game
0 supports guess that means your epic fail
do any of you actualy read the idea in full or just skill and make conclustionsapparently not  i said that they had the potential to not that they would always hit oh yes here it is now i may have phrased that badly but this says that should you fire at a target thats 245k away three out of four times you are garentied to miss then take speed into account reducing your odds furtherok where did you find that info cause its sure not from my post at not one point in my op did i ever say make blasters have a 250k range i said make there tracking so good that if you managed to get into range of a enemy ship you where more than garentied to hit it  even frigs but they should be able to outrun you additionally i never said anything in status to the size of the weapons just the ammo that they use so uriel please re frame from posting stuff like this as its showing off your iq level
fail post is fail
attributes dont make eve more complex all they are is something for players to base their training schedule around they dont add anything to the game other than knowing they exist not training electronics because i remapped to train spaceship command doesnt add any entertainment or depth to the game if you guys think a once a year decision between apples and oranges makes the game more fun or interesting youre all idiotsi will give you that they used to add some depth to the game when you picked them at creation and couldnt change them but remaps made that meaningless if remapping for plex goes into effect than the decision making aspect is even more meaningless and id say the system only exists at that point to make ccp extra cash
but i did it for you drake
hey i was pointing out that the proposal should be dropped regardless of translationits an obvious fail threadyou however are always epic win note to self dont step into des wormhole and get ganked because i likely got a bomb with my name on bound for my ship
i sincerely thought thetitalwas supposed to say modules models are fine modules are fine too so take my advice and use spell check then forget you ever read this post i suppose
hellocsm members are doing a good job but ccp are using them to only react if there is a commercial pressure on the companythe financial pressure to gain more clients and paying material is more important thant the existing player basemore to come to pay more  few to go away that arent anymore paying in real moneycsm please stay on track but avoid being the pressure release instrumentin each company there is a im acting right elementlike the petrolleum company investing in green energy to save the planetmy personnal point of view for csm members is that your place is not with ccp based on ccp way of working but out of ccp acting as player lobbyi vote for the csm to be ccp independant no more nda no more meetingin iceland go the syndicate way make requirements for players freely publish players voices organise outside ccp that was the syndicate organisation history toobutits a game we pay for if you dont like it btwstop paying and play an otheri decided that paying for this game orientation was no more fun on mysideyeay
time to send in leave of absence requests to work take unpaid days off sacrifice family time to attend ircsummit meetings time to face the player flames day in and day out and time to roll eyes at yet another groupie who thinks that its just fun and games to be on the council eh marconusseriously no one can honestly look me in the eye and say with sincerity that the current csm has not bent over backwards to get the ball rolling on quite a few endeavorsit seems quite clear to me that when the csm requests the input from the community that the same people who are strangely absent in their feedback are the loudest criticsas for the plex for sphr its not for sphr its for a neural remap one more pointsisi is a test server for a reason i highly doubt ccp tells the csm every little thing that gets changed on a daily basis
black ops improvements are not on the list of csm items ccp has indicated they are working on at least for the winter expansion
well thanks for the feedbackand thanks for nothing ccplong live the sansha invasion and other pverelated stuff in a pvpcentric game i guess quite disappointing
fyi  im a blackops enthusiast and i agree that they need work unfortunately there are more urgent things 
hello violentuk sorry for the delay in responding real life fair question actually i havent a settled opinion one way or the other i understand the need to cyno in and out of null sec via low ive scouted for some of these and i wouldnt want to see that end at the same time some folks believe hot drops prevent all but cheap roaming blobs and thus degrade small group pvp since the idea behind this thread is how to revitalize low sec in part through small group pvp im taking that concern seriously there is an interview on tenton with ccp lead designer noah ward that touches on whether supercaps are overpowered hes not willing to say they are or they are not which indicates to me that ccp is looking at this issue at some point theyll have to decide whether the use of supercaps and caps in low sec enhances or detracts from the space i do like however the core of moars idea of using faction navies in creative ways his idea has promise for balancing certain game dynamics without the need for outright bans or nerfs whether a layered progressive response from npcs is justified or workable in this instance is something im reserving judgment on i appreciate you asking the question and i for one would be interested in more of your thoughts on the matter cheers delilahfriendsofevewordpresscom
as youre a troll im just going to point out that you finished with this nonsense hoping that your tldr post would hide the fact that you never actually answered the question obviously you dont actually play any part of eve that youre so eager to nerf just as obviously you dont actually pvp and yet you lie about how much you love pvp also as youve lied before you did indeed say that not only do capitals need to be moderated in lowsec but concord needs to utterly destroy those who cyno into the wrong lowsec systems otsasai is off limits to cap pilots in your fevered antipvp hysteria saying you havent decided one way or another after youre the one who proposed it is well its pretty much the general pattern of deception that you use very seriously what with all your pvp experience on a mysterious account that you cant figure out how to post with but exist honest of course your comments above just display the general level of ignorance and bull that your arguments are based around as you never pvp you dont understand even the basic dynamics of pvp there are literally dozens of ways to roam that arent neutralized by capitals to say nothing of the fact that since youre a professional victim the possibility to take control of your own game experience and not simply be a victim doesnt even occur to you very very basically and clearly a capitalsuper hotdrop can be successfully counterattacked your ayieee i am powerless and a victim ccp must save me logic is antithetical to eves dynamic of playerdriven conflict more of your standard dishonesty anybody can click on the link and read it and see that your description is to put it charitably amusing he specifically refused to say that they were overpowered but said that in general ccp is always looking at balance and gave fighter bombers as an example and even then refused to say that they were overpowered and none of that gets into your professional victim rhetoric about how you have to have ccp save you from supers even if they change how fbs work they can still drop on you and savage you with a swarm of any other drone you misspelled his utterly unnecessary and counterproductive ideas to make lowsec into highseclite even though players already have the entirety of highsec to play in so that ccp can nerf pvpers but again as dishonesty is my stock in trade ill just pretend that its creative stuff and not a direct nerf to pvp in lowsec typos like that happen yet more dishonesty shockah not only is there no need to balance lowsec which is heavily stacked in the favor of defenders and against outlaws anyways but the idea that having swarms of scrambling faction navy ships come in to break up any attack is somehow about balance is an utter absurdity you pretend to be concerned about smallgang pvp but then you talk about how any small gang would be met by overwhelming faction navy firepower for having the audacity to initiate pvp in lowsec yah great call im sure it came from your wealth of pvp experience in eve what with scouting for capitals and such
sigh
no no no weve been over this before delilah dont know why its so hard for you to understand the way to post with your pvp main account that really and truly does exist honest is to sign out and then sign back in with that account and then post with it not the rolleyes smiley its understandable how youd make that mistake but having explained it to you i think you should be able to handle it give it a try post with that account since as youre not trolling it really does exist
btw folks following this and other low sec threads may want to read a new post by mynxee on her life in lowsec blog entitled priority low sec she is creating an making low sec matter committee to revision and make proposals about revitalizing low sec she stresses that this is a personal initiative and not a csm or cpp project sounds very cool and with her organizational skills i have no doubt theyll do a great job cheers delilahfriendsofevewordpresscom
to answer all of the csm flames i have a few wordsthe csm is nothing its meaningless the elected representatives are just players like you and i they can tell ccp what to do no more than you or i cangetting angry at the csm for a ccp decision like getting angry at your class treasurer for the school district laying off the volleyball coach it doesnt computebeing elected to the council is much like being elected class president the class president in no way runs the school or the class or in any way affects the operation management or planning of the school hes a puppet of the powers that be just like his constituents does the principal hold him in high esteem yes does the principal use the class president for public functions and to provide a more supportive face on assemblies and other student functions yes he is a public relations tool to give the appearance that the powers that be care about what the electing constituents think the reality is they dont that much is apparent ccp have a bunch of intellectuals on staff who are so convinced of their own superiority their reality check bounced on reentry with doctorates from mit and lots of big words they like to impress their shareholders and we still keep paying them money to crash internet spaceships its a business and that is our only real power the power of demand when enough people have canceled their accounts over issues like the font and lag and any number of other things eventually it will affect their bottom line they will be forced to climb out of their ivory tower and actually do what people want rather than what their design staff is telling them is more importanti can tell from what theyve written in official statements that they have a ton of staffing redundancy it took their web devs 10 of them 6 months to crank out evegate an app that no kidding a four man crew in india could have cranked out in about 3 weeks from spec to signoff the app does very very little i personally could have cranked it out in about a month and thats going easy on myselficeland has a really rough economy right now so they try to employ as many people as possible unfortunately this makes for a very bureaucratic nightmare getting anything done in the capitalist era this nonsense wont provide for a very healthy future for the company sure they run in an agile environment and use all the buzzwords and make people think theyre all brilliant and godlike but in the end they get very very little done and what gets done is usually buggy this is not the fault of the csm if you want to blame anything for ccps lack of efficiency and utter disregard for its customers look no further than the economic plight their country is suffering theyre trying to do their part to stem the tidewith a game that has an interface that was obviously designed by an engineer and not a ui designer and server software that while groundbreaking it was at one point right now its barely breaking windi dont want to sound like im bashing eve though we love our community that has been built around eve because were all nerds who like generally the same stuff and can bond friendships that transcend all the bs that ccp pulls us through the stunning graphics and pretty good sound with the sandbox environment makes the game a unique experience any unique experience will always have an audience we are that audience
i know the csm brought up a few issues and i know that some of the things the csm asked for are going to be implemented but i cant find what features were actually going to make the expansion from the csm discussion the expansion notes are extremely ambiguous in this regardas you may have seen im a big backer of the font issues and i wanted to find out what actually made it
the csm blog has the information youre looking for
ive always been more of a top guy myself but hey everybody needs a bottom sometime
heya thought id throw this out here and let people who have the time for it work with it why dont we have a fleet message of the day like with other chatchannels when you join you get a message the first thing that pops up with information about the channelops what not if we had this for fleet and i know about the fleetdescription already but people are too stupid for that one it would save a lot of time and allow fcs to lead more  more pewpew  more fun and probably more lag but hey just throwing it out there as ive not seen a single mention of it in the 5 years ive been playing
suppor er this thread would go really well in the assembly hall
moved from jita park speakers corner to feature and ideas discussion
sorry about that was really stressed when writing it and just wanted to get it done thank you for moving it
to quote me again from the 2days old threadthe fleet finder already gives you the option to write up details about your fleet people just need to read it before joiningand unlike an motd in fleet chat you can always look up that information later as it doesnt scroll out
supported pos improvement would be awesome
supporting this ive been longing for some revamp of poses for quite a few years now
back to first page
blasters have 2 major problems the way i see it1 there mainly fitted by gallente nubs who dont know what the ships speed control is for  controlling transversal 2 eft that tells them they get omgwtfbbqdps for fitting a magstab when a te would actually work much better in the real world
too awesome to not support reallyits icits different what other mmo would do thiscmon ccp show us the surprise in your spacesuits and implement this in some fashion or another
yes
do this ccp so people can literally live off of eve
so you support nerfing the damagerof bonuses on all minmatar ships unless there firing fusion 
guns also have a major advantage over missiles they do exactly the same damage at 10000 kms as they do at 0kms as long as you use keep at range rather than orbitmissile users can not improve the quality of hits against a fast moving target
yesthe analysis on the first page iircbasically 25 bonused kin is better against t1 armor tankers than unbonused exp by 5 to 10against t1 shield tankers kin may actually be worse than unbonused em or 5 better than unbonused thermalbonused kin is lovelly versus mini t2pointless against caldarigallente t2and maybe equal to unbonused thermal v amarr t2over the lifetime of a ship  assuming the pilot has max hull skills for that ship  and assuming the pilot fights optimally  with the best ammo  a 5 per level kin bonus will produce a dps increase of approx 8this compares unfavourable withgun dpl bonuses  25 more dpsgun rof bonuses  33 more dpsdrone damage bonuses  50 more dps
no they dont they have a bette chance of getting a excellant hit but its not a consistent damage even at 0 transversaledit the fact you said 10000kms did you mean that turret ships do the same damage no matter what speed there own ship is going
in a dogfight its only the difference in speed between the 2 ships that affects tracking and therefore gun damagefor examplein a situation where your target is doing 1900 ms and your doing 2000 ms guns will track really well and will deliver high damageeven though speed is high tracking is still lowif you were using missile  damage would be rubbish and there not much you can do about it if your kiting outside web rangespeed is to missiles  what trackingoptimal is to guns
thats a little narrow as for most ships to do that sort of spped your looking at mwd which then blows the sig up so for example say a vaga is kiting a drake the vaga sticks his mwd on to keep his distance he then gets murdered by the drakes superior dps at that range coupled with the vagas sig bloom
thats one example and about a narrow a definition as you could possible come up withits also a worse case scenario  vagas being week to kin and low ehp  which would actually be improved by this proposala drake pilot with emthermexp loaded  which would be more likelly if they were bonused would do less damage to a vaga in the initial stages of a fightyou might think that the drake is hurting youbut in no way are you taking full damage once your up to speedin fact if your flying around in a vaga  your more likelly to be killed in a solo fight against another vaga or cynabal  both gun boats  than you are to be killed by a drake
ok i only chose the vaga as you chose a high speed situation the hml drake actually out dps a barrage loaded vaga past 15km in the parameters you outlined keep at range this is when shooting each other the situation is the same with most bc and lower ships down to cruiser against a hml drake and with precision hmls loaded you do more than enough dps versus frigatesalso i know when out in my drake that if i see a vaga on scan im either going to kill it or force it to warp same with vagacanes and pretty much anything that loads up long range ammo and tries to keep range as i will hit them for exactly the same dps at 0km as i would at 50km and that its more than most long range setup bcs can do at the same range due to there tracking and fall off
kinetic damage bonus is the least of cmbs problems as most have fitting issues you give the caracal an omni damage bonus and it wont change teh fact that it severely gimps its fit to fit hams or hmls with a tank and mwdalso forgot to mention that guns are also affected by signature radius maybe not as badly but they all are
look at another situationcerb v nanocanespeed will be similar in both shipslets say for arguments sake that the nanocane is slightly faster so that range and tracking are not the issuelets say there both doing around 1400ms for arguments sakemissiles from the cerb will have there damage attenuated by about 6070nanocane will hit for full power and melt the cerb in about 20 secondsthere are all sorts of fight that happenstating that missile are better because they have a range advantage is entirelly falsemissile may be better if you cant keep up with your target  cant control range but guns are better when you can keep up with your target  can control range due to not being affected by speed and having much higher base dps
all i have been trying to point out is getting rid of the kinetic bonus doesnt solve anything if a nanocane comes across a cerberus it a has to catch it and b even when it does i would fully expect it to kill the cerberus same as i would fully expect it to kill any sniperhacguns tracking are effected by speed hence why webs help tracking
even if this was true it still wouldnt change it by giving the caldari missile boats an omni damage bonus as most cant fit the primary weapon systems of there type those that can are aguably the best in there class the drakeedit sorry about the double posts
it is true im pretty sure your allready aware of the way missile damage is attenuated by speed  looking at the number of drakes you have killed with your dram changing kin to rof wouldnt change what  sorry you say it i am not trying to change the difference between missiles and gunsread the op for why i think this would be a good changebasically bringing the value of hull bonuses more inline with the other races8 extra dps for lvl5 is totally bogus
im saying i want any torps on my hound to do the same kind of dps on my hound so i want em torps to do the same damage as my explosive torps are doing now on my houndand this isnt called nerfing its called boostingthe hound is locked to shoot explosive torps  explosive bombs if you want to do some dps  alpha and its the same with the drake and kinetic missilesso if you want to have the same damage on other missiles to do the same damage as your kinetic missiles are doing now then i want to have the same thing with my houndi hope you understand now what im talking aboutthe drake alone shouldnt get special treatment
well i dont know what op you read before posting here  but i never sugested any boost to the manticore  which would be the equiv ship to your houndthe drake alone is not the subject of this postif you want to compare the drake to its mini equiv compare it to the caneand if you really want to swap a 75 boost to exp for a 25 boost to rainbow on your hound  i say fair enoughbut it should only affect you personally when you fly a houndas i pretty much suspect everyone else would think that was a sucky trade off
your post is very difficult to understandare you saying that you want to prohibit trial accounts from committing concordokken offenses
uh are you saying that people shouldnt be able to attack anyone in the trial period and that those in the trial period shouldnt be able to attack anyone in high secliang
this is an interesting point and if ccp indicates that they are considering dumping learning skills i will recommend they think about the potential consequences however the effect may not be all that horrible as most accounts have one toon with most of the learning skillpoints and those points do represent roughly the same amount of training time no matter how they were distributed also most people would put the points into their mains
i like this ideal but i had level 4 skills before i had level 5 skills belive it or not thoughs 2 points make a noticeable differnts so i would not wish to lose them you have 3 and 2 thats 5 5 over 10 levels worth of skill could be simply added as 05 each level and would make each level trained more usefull and mybe even fun too this is hands down the best ideal i have seen to date this is what i would do to make everyone happy or happyeredit 5 my be to much or to little so what ever is ok with max skills just spread it out over all 10 levels you mite even or probly would wieght it out so you got better or more benift from the higher ranking learning skills tooedit2 another good ideal to make them usefull more then they are is adding them as preq on some iteams or other skills notable would be socal skills for tradingsocal skills intmemory for sciance ie i aways belive its better to fix content then to remove it
well thats a  argument it wont help retention why not no reasons given you are simply flaming and being annoying please save us the omgwtf this guys stupidly  feeling we all get from reading comments made by people like you
supported
every player i have trained is still playing the game once the players saw the benefit of investing time in learning skills and how it helps them in long term they were encouraged by it i have never had anyone put off by learning skills not onceplenty of people really dont like reading your stupidly ed comments
just think about all those noobs that come from games like wow where doing something grants immediate gratification those types of people dont want to spend the first month of the game training skills and seeing the reward 6 months later they just want to actually play the game ccp want a larger playerebase so they are helping the retention of former wowies and the like
way wrong move
i dont see why not theres no obligation for those who dont want to use it to ever do so and for those who would it means more  for ccpedit to all those worrying about rl money affecting the game it does already anyway whether you realise it or notben
agreedive only recently started playing but i know well over a dozen players now with 4 or more alts to generate their isk and help their main fly efficiently if thats not rl money plex are paid for by newbs like me so  you if you think thats not money being spent changing the game then i dont know what is
microtransactions in eve is terrible idea
bad idea
 microtransactions wtf ccp
quoted for truth i dont know any long term players that have not ether payed cash for plex to sale for isk or spent isk to buy plex in game for one or more accounts or for one or more months already a remap here or there would be nice i will be one of the ones that buys ingame plex for isk thoughthe only real down side of this is thta it will probly drive plex prices up for a spelledit as a side note and trader there are worse things to lose your isk in at least with plex i ether make good isk or i have free mons of play time on hand
supported
going with the common responsewtf ccp
looking like ccp is now after cash and lost their way to improving the gameplay and contentterrible idea in respect of gameplay great idea to make a quick buck
supported stupid idea ccp
the last two years in eve have been kinda meh for me a lot of broken promises and a lot of broken features the dominion expansion probably was the worst i was looking forward to everything it promised about sov changes and it opening the door for more people to get into 00 without having to become part of power blocks or renting and such it in fact did nothing like that actually the opposite happened so for you to say no one will quit is a foolish statementthis whole plex thing first the introduction of plex to help curb the issue with the illegal buying of isk with real money i thought it was a good idea but it should have stopped there then they introduced the ability for plex to be able to be moved around the sole reason for this and this alone was so plex could be blown up why so it would be free money for ccp thats it the only reason soon you will be able to use plex to get free attribute remapsthe reason someone does a remap is so they train faster what next use plex to buy faction gearthere are several critical reasons why i came to eve1 one server no chasing the population around2 when i blow  up i can take it or they can but you get the idea a players ship exploding has meaning3 you can do anything none of this class stuff where you are only allowed to usefly certain things4 aside from the monthly subscription fee real money would not give a player an advantage over other players the game is a cold dark and unforgiving place that is nice but this aspect has always been the even playing field it is where no matter who you are no matter what you do no matter where you are in the world here is where we all are equalthis reply is far longer than i had anticipated but those four critical things is what brought me to the game those four things is what has kept playing this game for over 5 years at probably 30 hours a week i promise you this if this happens then number four will no longer apply to this gamenow you can sit there and argue that there is no better mmo out there like eve so i wont leave till your blue in the face even if this is true it does not mean i have to subscribe you can also argue that there is no way to keep real life money from affecting the game but that is no reason to throw in the towel and have the attitude well if i cant prevent world hunger there is no reason to trytldr this goes live i promise you i will quit the game so lick my nuts mr laalt no you cant have my stuff
really because im pretty sure i could buy a trillion isk and a halfdozen 50m100m sp pilots off the bazaar if i were willing to spend enough money probably not all at once mind youtrue most people dont have 60000 to spend on a game about internet spaceships but some do and it doesnt have to be to that extent
no remaps for plex pleasehaving remap once a year is huge advantage allready over the previous system where you had to custom tailor you toon from beginning to specific courieryou allready can go and buy highskilled toons from bazaar if you got the isk so we dont really need plex for remaps anyways
supported
there is a thin red line and its drawn exactly hereno
wtf ccp
wtf ccp
no remaps for plex
money cant fix stupid
no way
no this  end of eve
its a sad day for eves sandbox if this heappens
wtf ccp
updated the op so theres less timing confusion
oh man these would be awesome
these are all great ideas and are dearly needed the one idea im a little unsure about is the fuel pellet concept but its not a bad approach
amazing ideas all thumbs up
definetly needed improvmentsas someone that runs pos in highsec limitations of pos are clear structure management is pain not to mention managing right to have those managed control distances of stuctures need to manually go and move stuff from hanger to manufacturing array etc come on we have drone technology nowdays cant drones shuttle that stuff automaticly in pos or can we atleast get links tehcnology that we have for reactionsmoonmining so assembly array can ask materials from hanger and deliver finished stuff to same hanger or different hanger depending how you link them upand definetly add those hours in fuel warnings now i need to use my own simple php script for that
the worst thing about a pos is if you have access to an sma you can take any ship in there we need to either password ships or give everyone an individual hangar rather than for instance the 7 tabs in a corp hangarit is so easy for a corp member to steal anything if living in a wh as my corp does to my mind that is the most important thing to fix
yeah more roles or indeed the ability to make roles and assign them different sections of pos to mess around with on your own would be awesome also please limit them to a per pos set and for the love of god give us some security in the sma other than assigning people a slot in a nearby cha to store their ships in
oh hey support for myself
another bomber pilot supporting aesthetically well oriented idea
in terms of an fx and graphics buff id like to see the following randomized impact points over a models hulla miss is a miss  so the damn beam should miss not hit the exact same spot as if it was a wrecking shot id also like to see differentiated impact effects for applied damage types and what theyre hitting shields should fizz and pop in a bubble around the ship armor should flex and glow as it redirects the impact energy and structure should flash and explode as it gets destroyed  damage skinsas a ship gets more beat up the hull should look like its taking damage scratches appear on the paintwork and when things get really bad superstructure jutting out damage skins already exist for some models even  when you kill a supercap you get a hulk this would go well with wrecks that look like the ships they were frombigger ships  more bits want the melted cap consoles look in the reactor section of the that apocalypse want targeting computers look in the upper section of the scorpion hull that broke off over theremuch more varied and interesting than tractor salvage fail fail fail conductive polymer fffuuuuuu sentry dronesi would actually like to see them shooting not a tiny hint of a sparkle i want to see bouncers spitting out tracer rounds gardes mashing things at close range with their blaster plasma and wardens throwing rail slugs out to extreme ranges not a badly scaled plane with a dumb texture map that shows up on the screen as a barely noticeable twinkle clouds nebula effectslook awful and just plain annoying im sure there are better systems than using an oversized sprite for this effect by now more and varied props  increased interactivitycan we start being able to blow chunks out of asteroids and derelict stations now how about live stations how about watching that pos fracture and fly apart in a more physically correct manner rather than a big dumb boom warping through planetsmake a ships warp trajectory follow a 3point spline that avoids any celestial objects instead of warping through a planet or station the ship would follow an elegant curve hell if you wanted to be really clever you could even introduce some minor orbital mechanics gravity etc to alter the warp speed slightly more tactical options open up railgunslook weedy blasterslook a bit weedy did i mention railguns and blasters look weedy stations and capshipstextures are starting to look dated there too
yes eve needs a real tutorial made new and from ground up it should warn people about hazards and it should include the faqs from all the hep channels and all that not as a wall of text everyone clicks away and then wonders what to do and how the hell to even move your ship
i guess you missed the part where people are allowed to skip the tutorial if they so choosethere are twentyyearold text muds  sandboxy skillbased hardcore muds that make eve look like a repository for simpletons and chimps by comparison  that have tutorial areasi support this idea maybe it is themeparklike but its worth a try
the whole purpose of mmos is the m part multiplayer if you want a singleplayer tutorial then gtfo back to wowi joined this game in 2007 the tutorial back then was utter garbage compared to what it is now i learned almost all i know about eve from my first ceo who incidentally ive flown with now for 4yrs the point of the sandbox mmo is to encourage these types of interactions between older players and the new incoming generation this bolsters continued recruitment and training of new players by older corporations made up of bitter vets as well as the amazing thing known as human interactionas well there is an enormous wealth of information on the game that is less than a google search away the eve wiki has a great deal of articles that delve into the complexities of the game and euni has some amazing learning videos on youtubeif anything the tutorials only need to stress the importance of human interaction to being successful in the eve environment not hold peoples hands
lykouleoni think you misunderstood me i did not state that i wanted the tutorial to be single player in fact the starting cluster will be where every new player starts so its going to be pretty crowded i think the only thing i stated was that i wanted the starting and exit system to be instanced but that was only for conveinience and to remove the possibility of having multiple bucks at the same spot doing the same thing with 50 different players of course this could be remade in a deadspace sort of way like other missions you say that you joined in 2007 and have been active since then thats great  i joined in the end of 2005 and have been playing back  forth one thing to remember is that eve is a lot bigger and complex than it was a few years ago not saying it wasnt complex then but 2007 would have been the revelations expansion pack and a lot more content has been added since theni agree with you eve has a lot of good information websites that are great for learning the game however it is not going to be read by anyone unless they are introduced to it in an interesting way you need to make players want to read more information and you can only achieve that by catching their interest in the first placeand its not like im suggesting they should be in this cluster for ages i would say 710 days for an average player and maybe half of that if you like to play a lot just to be able to breath for awhile and learn the basics before you get swarmed with thousands of different modules that goes for thousands of different playing styles
lets face it pi sucks the idea is great the interface sucks horribly why because you have to click several hundred times each time a deposit is exhuasted and the extractors need renewalit is quite simple to fix this simply add a drag box feature so multiple extractors can be selected and configured at the same time it will not completely fix the pi interface but i believe it will make pi much more manageable
yeah this seems obsolete
have to agree
supported
oops to vestigial limits
removing the obsolete and renewing the old is never bad
supportedthis limit is way too annoying and shouldnt remain active if anyone has good reasons to object its complete removal at least consider raising the numbers substantially
supporting my own thread seems like a good idea p

i like this for most people of normal income any more than 2 characters doesnt make a whole lot of sense since its beyond most peoples ability to operate 3 clients at once and the majority of people myself included probably arent to paying another 1115 a month just for a training accounti pay for two accounts at the moment and wont go any higher than that but ccp would be able to wring more money out of me if they did this at no real cost to their bottom lineunless i get fed up with supercaps online bull and quit when none of it is fixed in incursion of course
im not sure id support this i have a fantasy of eve without alts but this would need massive gameplay changesthus im not fond of anything encouraging or simplifying the creation of altsoh wai im an alt too
i dont understand why you can only train one char to begin with well i can understand the financial reasons behind them but why not just have one slot per account theni have three slots but not being able to train the other ones simultanously discourages me to use them allsome might make an argument relating with character sellers but id rather be able to train 3 chars then to buy onebuying chars is for the rich anyhow now training multiple chars is too
supportedi can see how simple logic might lead people to the conclusion that ccp is losing money here but think of the money theyd gainsimple economics there would be some players that choose to use 1 or 2 or 3 plexs on an account when they wouldnt purchase another account if that was the only option they were at the margin and they demand plex they either buy it with cash or isk either way ccp gets money and arguably more money than the other situation the one we are in now where your only choice is to buy another account
problem i have with ccp or anyone making this excuse not saying that you specifically are is that it is ccps own fault if someone gets scammed for crystals ccp never really decided to add a legitimately decent system for damagedundamaged crystals plus ccp prides eve for having a system that allows for scamming and most of the playerbase understands that they can and probably will get scammed its not like eve would be an entirely different game if they allowed damaged crystals to be contracted tomorrow without adding a system showing that crystals are damagedalso do people really make contracts where crystals are the main possession for trade most pirate crystals can be boughtsold from the market iirc
aside from the logistical issues caused by the extra data being transferred it doesnt fit in with the eve shiptypes anyway true interceptors can move quickly and almost seem like fighters but theyre still large ships all of the pilotable ships in eve are stylized and made to function like navy ships rather than as combat fighter craft even the smallest ships are naval vessels even if you added joystick functionality they wouldnt fly like fighters theyd continue to fly like frigates battleships etc and wont respond with the sort of precision that a joystick would suggest
well true for the pod but a view for the crew so i mean an inside view will be really cool to watch dogfights
hiits seems that when ppl talk about pilots that dont do pvp they get the term carebear stuck to their namewouldnt it be a much nicer too use the term fuzzy wuzzyregards the lemmingswarm
asking ccp to change culture of rpgmmos is a complete waste of their timeyour better off trolling somewhere elseand if you dont like the terminology then dont act like it or ignore it
a few years ago the devs were talking about such a targeting system theyd like this implemented the first hp boost to the ships were aimed at providing longer fights partially for this project sorry im too tired to find any valid link about that as it was called subsystem targeting and since the release of t3 you get a load of results when you google it  but other old enough vets could confirm thisthey still havent found any suitable implementation yet as nothing was to be heard about it for quite some time nowi support this idea for the core concept and remind the devs about it but it needs some serious and thorough examination to prevent it from becoming some formal disable mobility disable tanking gank tryptic
the last 3 people i have spoken to who have tried eve all said the same thingwell they didnt say the same thing exactly  but the gist of it was the same in each instancethey tried the game but found it too complicated and therefore gave upeve allready has too many rules and too many variable in combatmaking eve even more complicated may be a bonus to older players to help keep the game interesting but it will also starve the game of new bloodalso attacking propcaptargetting is the job of speciallist ships and modulesif you can do the same with dps they become rather pointless
problem is on a super cap you dont want to destroy any modules as the loot drop from a dead titan pays for the entire fleet op less modules mean less loot if you could shoot say a dramiels mwd then i could see a reason to target a module
erm this would increase the amount of information being sent and received by the server  more lag  bad
ive been playing eve for only a few months now but i enjoy it from the previous dungeongrinding game i used to play you know what im talking about i am however disappointed in the incentives for getting another person to play the game sure 30 days is great and all but thats kind of expected in a mmo now not too long ago one of the other game companies released a recruit a friend bonus which gives triple experience for 90 days between 2 accounts im sure ccp could think up something equivalent to this 50100 skill training bonus for x days anyway thats just my 2 cents
so you want to start a new rmt racketoh please go back to wow where you came fromim seriously getting sick and tired of these noobs who think they can just bully their way into easy street
no that it has become standard isnt good enough of a reason to accelerate training in a game where you dont gain the training based on how long you play the game ie every jump you make nets you 100 skill points the only thing close in eve would be to double your bounties or something but seriously a free month for getting another player to signup is enough
wow the anger i guess opinions arent appreciated if they arent about fixing lag or the ui how am i bullying anyone again i dont remember making any threats about quitting or pointless things like that
dont play coy with us its very obvious what your up toobvious stealth troll is obviouslet me break it down real easy for youa every time a foolish proposal such as yours a repeat of the same old stupid whine is made its done so from a number of obvious faults lack of experience and they think they are experts on the subject already lack of time put in and too lazy and tired of waiting while the majority of the population who have played eve far longer than you have 2 years plus here who have put in many many days of training to get where they are dont take kindly to some noob who walks up here and thinks they deserve better by taking short cuts didnt bother to research the subject before blowing said mouth offb didnt bother to take into account just how unique eve online is and then borrowing from an obvious game of which you came from wow very likely and then start equating things from it such as speed of xp gatheringc ignoring experience by not talking to other pilots and getting input from them before broaching the idead ignoring other failed posts in the past of the same subject matter and obviously discounting the volatile nature of daring to ask such a questionand last but not least the most obvious fail point of them alle by invoking such an idea whats to stop a gang of guys from getting individual email accounts and then inviting them all together to start up a new racketwait a few months then sell the chars back at tons of money or isk for that matterrmt is something ccp wants to stop not make worsenot that i dont mind seeing a total noob of an idiot buy a char with a dreadcarrierrorqual show up in low sec to get his butt blown up repeatedly the point is still valid some of us like the fact we invested many months of training to fly that nice shiny ship and mods only to see a noob such as yourself invite a few friends to play eve and then suddenly you gain a ton of sps with very very little effortangeryour underestimating that angereve chars are like finely crafted pieces of wood some of us are not so good as others but all have one thing in common it takes time and i dont like it when someone gets ahead due to wealth that i dont possess or sheer social power thanks to an exploit that you proposeyou didnt make a threat but your idea is the largest threat of them allif you cant stand the time it takes to get anywhere in the game then leavethe free 30 days bonus for getting someone to subscribe is wroth it imhoto change that is a total waste of time as its all to easy to get enough isk to buy a plex as it isits bad enough that ccp is toying with the idea to use plex to exchange for neural remaps and thats ed alot of pilots offgee i wonder why maybe its due to the fact that some of us put a little time and effort into the game than most lazy noobs eh
im fairly confident they already said they were doing this
in all areas of space high sec low sec and zero sec with the appropriate reward multipliers depending on where it is of coursedevblog
if its anything like missions then highsec fleets will pay too much and lowsec and nullsec ones too little ccp needs to promise the people who play its game that it will do a better job at balancing risk vs reward this time
and incursion in high sec should never ever in any case be able to out isk lvl 4 missions because if that happens i guess we all can imagine what will happen thenno one will go to low sec even if it gives 4 times more reward
why cant you just let them implement the feature first before you start complaining about what a crappy job they have donethey promise to balance highseclowsecnullsec rewards should they fail you have every right to complain about it afterwards but now all youre basically doing is threaten the designers if you dont get it right this time i will insert generic idle threat hereim sure ccp is well aware of the stream of complaints theyll receive should the balancing not please the customersjust relax and let them do their work lax
imho if it reduces lag by a noticeable amount make it passive if not keep it active as it keeps a bit of variety
thumbs up
devs claimed we had x amount of volume to fly to in system y when they talked about removing deep safspotsnow i would like to propose that they actyally allow us to fly in all that volume in spacepick a direction any direction set warp distance you get there  few  and hit warpcatch no further then 20au from most distance object in solarsystem measured from central star as far as i know thats the same limit you can still make bookmarks fro safespots
this feature already existed during the begining of the game a double click anywhere in space made you warp and drained your capacitor emptycant remember why they removed this feature but it was with rmr expansion if i remember rightthe limitation is now to 10au from the farest celestial of staro7
making kills off a gate or station even harder to get
i do agree with the fact that it would make it possible to insta warp out of the gate cloak or from the station undock even without special bookmarksthus i would suggest to add a warp calibration timer of like 520 seconds and it also could empty all cap even if you dont warp at max rangealso i could even imagine a cool down after a free warp so it gets kind of impractical in direct combatand makes it easier for probers to get lock on someone warping randomly around the system
fully supported i cant understand why this isnt possible now possibly because it would make the artificial space barrier setup by ccp that more apparent
supported in principleanother possibility is that a player can push a button type in a set of destination coordinates and if the coordinates are valid then the ship needs to align to warp to the destination and then stay aligned for 20 seconds before it can enter warp being bumped out of alignment resets the timer
plus 1 for hybrid rebalance i cant use any other weapon system and it sucks like someone said above should i invest the 70 days for lasersprojectiles should i have too at all each weapon system shouldneeds to be balanced to the other ones a solution needs to be found
i want hybirds fixed to but i myself cant think of a good way to rebalance them with out making some hybird ships op i mainly fly bs class ships its been a very long time over 2 years or more that i fly anything smaller so i know most hybird bss come up lacking in some major way or another but one mybe two will become op with most of the stuff i can think of
just cross train for minmatar its much faster than waiting atleast another 16 monthsbtw who doesnt has a crosstrained gallente char these days
there has not been a single council yet that has not had its work over shadowed by scandal and failure since its inception so sorry if by looking at the history of the csm has turned me from golly gee those csm sure are my eheroes and are a true representation of the eve community to wow for all that hype they sure are ineffectiveme looks the poster alt in the eyei hate to be the bearer of bad news but your csm heroes are ineffective either thru their own device ccps failure to properly get them the right tools to do the job or a combination of both an insane i mean insane amount of players never come to the forums neverthe csm is ineffective there is no arguing that until they are able to represent the player base they never will be i do not care if all of them spend 90 hours a week working their fingers to the bone until ccp implements in game toolswhatever that puts the csm more in tune with them an in game browser window does not count  they never will be remotely close to itdont give me that crap because i didnt post in that thread it means i dont know what i am talking about that thread got to fourteen pages over a week in assembly hall i do not know how many are second post dont care the thread on the plex in regards to plex allowing attribute remap hit twenty pages in twenty four hours or less there is a reason why people have given up on the csm and the issues people have raised they have voiced their opinion and have seen what happens nothing happens or very littleseriously 419 post on what should have been a major thread for a game that has a subscription base of what 350 thousand give or take what percentage of the player base is that it is closer to 0 than 1 that has got to be the most pathetic participation level i have ever heard of in regards to anything that has ever taken place in the history of well anything the only reason to remap your attributes is to train faster thus having better skill points trained per hour stop spinning thingsso you are saying that it never crossed any ccps mind that something like this would be highly controversial dont be so naive to think they never thought about it ccp knew what the csm would have said and chose not to run it by them to get some feedback if ccp truly did not know this change would have negative reaction from the csm or the player base well then that just shows you how out of touch they are with the csm this is about money which from a business point of view is a good move for the short termthe ultimate bottom line is the csm will always be pointless if there is no connection between the players and them in game
ever think they ccp may have just put it straight on the test server so they could make sure the code works correctly you know kinda like testing iti think the csm is a useful tool you just have to accept that its on ccps terms not ours id rather have the gradually evolving and more effective csm we have now to give my feedback to and have it taken seriously than the old ways of 90 page forum threadnaughts full of trolling and off topic whining that get ignored at the end of the day ccp choose what feedback to listen to and what proposals to implement so ing at the csm and claiming theyre useless because ccp chose to do something you dont like without telling the csm first is ing stupid how could they complain about something they werent told was going to happen you expect them to be ing psychic or something its not their fault that ccps communication skills are on occasion a massive pile of ass
oh so just put it on the test server with no intentions to implement it you know just for the hell of it what are you smoking manat last you finally are starting to see the problem ehh without a real in game mechanic that can properly connect the csm to the player base in game web browser does not count the csm or ccp will never come remotely close to being in touch with the player base right now the only real input they have is subscription paid i like this unsubscribe i dont like thisthat is the only thing they have that and the fraction of a fraction of the player base that post on the forums that is a joke as far as ccp or csm being in tune with the player base there needs to be some simple in game tool something that is easy to use and very user friendly that can be managed by ccp and csm something that is not a hassle to try and provide feedback and opinions on current issues something that has up to date eve news and such things a little tiny box and news column on the log in screen that they will see only once and delaying them from logging into the game is not cutting itccp the csm have been tasked with the equivalent of climbing mt everest in the 20th century and the equipment you have given them is a nail file three feet of twine mini pinball machine with no pinball and a plaid shirt with one sleeve missing to do itso in closing like i have said before and i still stand by it all csm counsels along with this one are ineffective to do the job they need to do the only time players have voiced the most opinions about something and it still was a laughable turnout in comparison to the number of subscribers was when it comes time to vote for the csm at which point the candidates go to every major trade hub and spam convo and local trying to get votes the csm should not have to spam local and spam convo every day about everything that needs to be addressed to get an even fraction of player feed backnow does any of this makes sense or am i being crazy here
there is csm public channel and evemail both of those give direct access to csms if you have something else in mind more ambitious than that by all means share your ideasmaybe as a proposal in the assembly hall so csm can champion it if it seems feasible dont forget that csm is a community endeavor so in my view there is some obligation on the part of the community to step up and participatecontribute in meaningful waysi didntand dontdo that ever so please dont group all of us in a blanket statement describing behaviors that we dont all engage in
this is my main feel free to contact my ceo join excellence on irc and compare my hostmask with the other people who come and go regularly or ask herschel who has also been quite active in the csm threads even ran twice for it but hey believe what you will tinfoilmaybe previous csm iterations have had growing pains would you attribute the actions of one as speaking for the future i hope not with change comes uncertainty and hesitation its only through determination and hard work that your concerns can be quashed it takes time and it takes patience its not an excuse no im not happy about the crap that has done down before either but im not giving up that easilyso the challenge youve just identified is very simple increasing player feedbackparticipation youre quick to dismiss csm efforts as ineffective have you put any thought into suggestions on what you believe would increase feedbackwhat would you prefer ccp and the csm have posted quite clearly whats upcoming would you be willing to give them a chance to prove to us that what has been described will now happen yes there have been challenges in the past to get ccp to listen and act that was then theyre moving forward will you join the celebration or sit on the sidelines mopingwhy not were here to have a debate it only seems appropriate that criticism is matched with answers i havent implied that those who dont post know nothing those are your words what bothers me is that those who cry loudest are strangely absent when the call for help goes out there must be a logical reason beyond because nothing will happen i believe dierdra commented that discussion is under way with ccp to determine what is happening and he also clearly indicated that the csm does not support the idea its a four day old issue are you unwilling to give time to hear back from ccp before abandoning hope call a spade a spade not a sharp instrument with which to dig in other words the issue is the ability to use a plex for remaps which have a secondary effect its hard enough following the changes as it is sorry if keeping the facts straight is construed as spinning its obfuscation and manipulation that leads to spinning my friend i dislike when others choose to say things which are untrue if youre going to argue then argue the truth of course its controversial of course the csm wouldnt support it and of course they wouldnt be told thats my assumption however as it is yours again wait for ccps official comment on it we all know that silence would speak the loudest shall we see what happensjoin csm public ingame there you go
been there and done that that channel is a ghost town most i ever saw in it was twenty people give or take at its peak hell lets be super generous here lets say there was fifty people in it at all times the average users logged in is about thirty thousand what percentage of thirty thousand is fifty peopleagain not the right tool to do the job needed it is ineffective is an understatementi have already described what is needed you cant honestly tell me that paltry player made channel and mailing list is an accurate in game tool to be in tune with the players please let any csm current or past tell me that that meets the needs just fineif that was the case then i apologize for generalizing you the only think i remember the most during that time was local spaming and convos spamming linking personal websites about each candidate and asking for votes you didnt apparently but a majority of the candidates did no as annoying as it was that time is the most interaction with the csm the whole time what was the percentage of active accounts that voted based on total active subscriptions at that time anyone know
you walk up to a panel there is a red button above the button is a label that says sandwich you push the button and a little door opens and an empty plate is inside the door closes you push the button again and the door opens again an empty plate you repeat this process three more times every time is is the same empty platenow your friend walks in and sees the panel with the red button he then asks you so if i push this red button a sandwich comes out the little door rightwhat do you tell your friend will happen when he pushes the button based on your experience with itof course but i am sure the csm has said to ccps face a slew of ideas on what they need there has also been several times before me people have mentioned iti clicked the link and saw the thread and wondered when this thread was made and how did i miss it i am being honest here i consider myself somewhat of a forum warrior not as 1337 as others of course i simply dont know how i missed it maybe because when i did look at assembly hall at that time it was buried below the front page many people who read the forums never go past the first page in a thread much less the second you can call me lazy if you want but for someone like me who reads and post the forums missed it what does that tell you about the majority of the eve community take the player base then take the small percentage of those who go to the forums then take that percentage and get another percentage of those who frequently visit assembly hall then take a percentage of that for those who by chance happen to see that thread at that time on the first page this reply is getting long but you get the idea that in combination with some other factors probably is why there is such are see why it got such little feed back on a thread nope there should have been a dev blog that was release before this hit the test server and players find out on their ownyour starting to lose me here but this is basically what the change means if i got the real money i can have a max attribute character the entire time it is training in every category in every skill
the thing is marconus as far as i can see your entire beef is based on the issue of poor communication from ccp correctat teh risk of repeating myself you do realise thats something the csm has absolutely no control over or ability to influence all they can do is draw attention to it when they feel it is lacking which is something theyve been doing repeatedly on every occasion its become a serious issue its then up to ccp to make the adjustments so flaming out on the csm seems really pointlessyes the issues with communication do mean the csm isnt as effective as it otherwise could be but that doesnt make them useless they do the best they can with the tools they have
can ye high and mighty csm tools please wake the  up and realize rage against the new plex system is a complete waste of your time did you consider that some players dont pay for a dozen accounts or plex as many accounts but might pay for a remapping service instead what harm is this doing to you the bitter vet none what harm is it doing to them the noob with more dollars than sense none people with money will train fasterthey already do it with extra accounts this is not newso please whenever you feel the need to beat ccp over the head for this take a deep breath count the number of alts you have then post about one of the hundred thousand more relavent issues to this game that you should be supporting you prats
totally agree here ccp doesnt give a rats ass what the csm says in the endyeah we considered it and rightly dismissed it as idiotic and gamebreakingthis makes it so that someone who is rich irl can just buy a crapton of plexes to train faster than everyone else while one of the primary determinants in this game is player skill rather than character skill accelerated training times for people who are richer irl rather than skilled at this game would pretty much ruin everything want to fly a supercarrier but itll take a year to train all the skills for it buy some plexes want to fly a pimped marauder with level 5 pulse laser specialization and cloaking 5 buy some plexes see abovedont confuse the two concepts oh logic god thats training two different characters at once both of those characters gain exp at pretty much the same rate buying a plex and using it to remap one makes it gain skillpoints faster same goes for straight up skillpoint acceleration heres the fundamental part where you and i disagree skillpoint acceleration for rl cash ruins the game
the initial response was fine despite being disappointingyour response is annoying and pointless do you really feel that sansha capitals ships are more urgentgo away
csm did not request sansha capitals and argued strongly against a new pve feature at the summit requesting that ccp spend more time on fixing various thingseverything csm requested from ccp is on the wiki
yeah thats fine tdi am fully capable of readingand was quite satisifed if not thrilled with the updatedierdra doing some postin for the sake of postin added nothing and by suggesting the urgent things were perhaps in hesheits hands to influence annoyed the  out of meanywaynever mind no point beating head against ccp wall of goof when 90 thread of commitment to excellence and various other issues are ignored in favor of pve content in a pvpcentric gameoh waitnew ship classsalvager yeah whatever all that artist time coding time dev time test time one hopes devoted to some crappy pve ship that already has a cheap useful counterpart ingame ie dessiessince those are ignored too lol as opposed to the short amount of time and resources required to simply reduce the amount of fuel consumed by the bobs portal so it doesnt require a hauler and maybe a slight increase in jump rangeseriouslywho do ccp think they are fooling here bleah pointless rant over enjoy your new pve content
if its any consolation i know how you feel pretty much there myself ive had that black ops thread bookmarked and have been watching it for a long time trying to decide best next move as regards it yeah sure black ops got a tiny bit of love a long time ago presumably in response to this csm issue but im with you that they need a bit more love in order to be able to justify their cost and be most effective thanks for pushing this issue forward into the attention sphere again with everything that is going on  rl its easy for things to slip through the cracks after i get my making low sec matter project kickoff stuff done this weekend ill spend some time reviewing that thread and talk with other csms about possible next steps to get some attention on black ops againalas i see youre no longer in veto man i hardly got to know ya
low sec is dire wormholes on the other hand are what make eve unpredictable enjoyable and funbut the point of this particular thread was simply to highlight a long ignored issue dealing with what can be described as endgame content for those pewpew pilots that cordially detest capital proliferation and are more interested in enhancing the abilities of small groups to play on an equal footing where skillbloband the utter stupidity of having a ship as skill intensive as a bobs requiring a damned hauler alt to fuel the covert bridge when a titan can cheerfully bridge hundreds of blobby f1f8 headrolling bs across rather large distances by comparison without similar logistic support is just wrongand easilyquickly fixed if ccp would make the effort to do so ccp has dropped the ball end ofeditforgot to say enjoy veto plenty of fine pilots therealsowant a simple solution to nullsec get rid of it make all current losec into appropriate region npc nullsec get rid of stupid sentrys and the handholding 15minute sin bin and provide the same pve possibilities and spawns that nullsec residents currently have obviously minus the sovboosting junkyeah you have probably heard the above beforeand all the phoneylolpirates worried about the implants in their head will  right off to high sec crying and whiningbut anything else is just patching over a rather silly training wheel that has no place in the game anymorehave funedithaha congrats on lifting oldest veto pilot by a country mile
yeah must admit wormholes are my favorite feature of eveha as for oldest by a country milethats your fault it was only a hop skip and a jump before you left mister
actually theres a lot that wasnt said by dierdra that would probably change your mind a bit and ill probably catch some crap for posting about it but without that insider info their post does read a bit like posting to postdierdra is a director of the blob noob corp eve uni most members last about 27 months then move on into player corporations across all aspects of eve game play some like me last a year or more and have some decent skills we help out with various things but there are few classes available for characters our agesp levelthere are roughly a hundred of us yearling types around like 1500 members or so total  it fluctuates a bit  so were a fraction of the corporationthe fan didnt mention that about 2 months ago they started bringing in guest lecturers on black ops hotdrops and have been working at arranging practice runs for those of us with the skills to do these things many didntdont have the skills for this so adjusted their training plans to catch the next class the topic sparked a lot of interest by many of us more senior typesthe community support for this issue is thin youre ticked at the priority being towards more popular fixes but backing more popular fixes is what a csm is supposed to do  irrespective of their own wants dierdra is working on getting more players active with this area which in turn will increase support for the issue which canwill raise its priority not as a csm but as a playerdirector of a corporation interacting with other players ingameas i said at the start ill probably catch some flack for talking about this in a public forum but i figured you should get a bit more info before assessing them as just posting to post  theyve been working on this issue for months and will be a few more months helping train on the tactics associated with the use of black ops ships while convincing others of their potentialps if you think this is sucking up you dont know the uni ill be lucky not to end up in 1 officers corpse collection for talking out of turn like this one has 2 full station containers of corpses  we dont ask why nor what he does with all those corpses incarna might have a macabre aspect to it
delilah wild it is clear to me that you have little pvplow sec experience i can see that you are attempting to arbitrate a problem you perceive exists because you see people complaining about a common themethere is reason that low sec attracts attention it is simply lack of use balance is not the issue the possibility of hot drops is known to all but the most naive of cap pilots it is an understandable risk i have personally havent seen small gang pvp deterred by capital ships my experience is that low sec is still the place to go for small gang warfare super caps overpowered they might be although im personally not going to leap onto that bandwagon i feel that when the dreadnoughts tracking was nerfed ccp removed the main weapon that could be used to counter super capital fleets i feel that this was a mistake despite what you may feel super capitals arent actually that common in low sec the super capital issue is more relevant to 00 where their use directly impacts the major alliancesfinnagain zero can you just calm down
hello again violentuk perhaps a tad more experience than you think that said im floating ideas and not trying to arbitrate anything that is what this thread is about you may be right about the caps and supercaps and ill keep an open mind on the issue cheers delilahfriendsofevewordpresscom
figured out how to post with that experienced lowsec pvp alt yet because it really does exist right rightoh and allow me to cut that noise a bit early delilahs pretty much constant trolling should be called out if you want to pretend that theres something not calm about calmly pointing out any of the times where delilah yet again trolls in order to argue for ways to nerf pvp thats your call but dont fool yourself shes not accidentally arguing to nerf pvp because people happen to be talking about it shes arguing for the professional victim party so that ccp can nerf pvp which is griefing in her narrative and pretending to be a pvper in order to sell her trolling dont believe me one of her favorite trolls on this subject is to suggest a drastic nerf for pvp like her above suggestion that any capitals in 04 space should be concorded then claim that its not about nerfing pvp but balancing the game and making it better for everybody and then she pretends to be all about pvping herself do you think shes ever going to post with that pvp account because she has 9 kills on the one she trolls with and the last kill was about a year and a half ago if you think im overreacting maybe you can find that pvp account of hers or admit that yah shes trolling
i have to tell you belloch i think you have a real future as a motivational speaker
so ive been a member of the csm 1 12 times i ran based on this position the csm does at least three very important things and is expected to do something it will never succeed at doingwhat the csm does very well1 the csm is the players oversight organizations when major in game scandals occur they can speak to ccp under nda and examine evidence provided by ccp to make sure there is never another ccp employee involved scandal ever again they are intended to keep ccp honest some folks might say that ccp could just bake what they show the csm but i maintain the csms job would be to ask the tough questions of ccp to make sure everything is handled on the up and up so far the csm has shown it can be very effective in this role2 the csm can be a sounding board when ccp is thinking about features they can spend time with the csm to get detailed feedback about potential new ideas if the ideas really seem to be a poor fit for the future of eve the csm can change ccps mind in at least one case i know of the csm kept a very questionable feature from ever being part of eve the csm is also able to interact with ccp in an open manner where anything can be discussed because of the nda to brainstorm this is very valuable to the players in eve because in theory the players have elected csm members that would think like the players that elected them do3 the csm can be thought leaders the csm during their interactions and conversations with ccp can affect the way ccp is thinking about taking eve into the future the csm can absolutely change how ccp evolves eve with their direct interactions with the developers and designers of eve these interactions often can happen outside the formal csm sessions and can happen over a meal or a beer in iceland basically the csm gets facetime with the developers and designers that players never get during those interactions the csm can help evolve eve in the directions that represents the views of the csm support basewhat the csm is not ever going to be good atthe csm will never be the eve feature fairies i hate the current focus on very specific issue or game design elements from the forums to ccp to become a feature in a backlog that has failed and will continue to fail id make the case that every feature someone claims got into the feature backlog from the csm would have made it there anywayswhy would i say this simple eve has dozens of folks that work full time on the future of eve they have information and visions in place that have been in place for some time they are professional game developers and designers it is their job to design eve they read the forums and the csm isnt adding any value bring a feature idea from the forums to ccp sadly i think the csm has shot themselves in the foot and reduced their credibility by making it seem that this read the forums and be the feature fairies of eve their primary purpose this is why it seems like the csm has had no real affect on the planned features in eve csm need to think big picturesimply put the csm is excellent at keeping ccp honest when scandals occur i also think they can be fantastic at helping direct the future direction of eve by having bigger picture discussions and brainstorming sessions with the devlopers and designers of eve its true that occasionly the csm might find some low hanging fruit specific game changes that can get put in the pipeline but to focus on detailed new features or very specific changes in the way eve currently works if a waste the csms and ccps timeccp has full time designers already with strong visions for the future of eve that know how eve is built they can be swayed but the intertia of the details of their plans cant be overcome in 3 day meetings a couple times a year and a spreadsheet or two of 3 line feature requests from a player organizationissler
if they arent contributing to content there is little reason to travel to iceland other than it provides an incentive to convince players to join csmi kind of like the idea of csm helping ccp identify which issues are most important to players i agree though precsm ccp often successfully data mined the forums for some good featuresissuessolutions
until the perception of lowsec being fair certitude of loss is gotten rid of nothing will really change a bar of gold in the bottom of a vat of acid you arent finding many thatll try and grab for it no matter how much you feel its worth  the idea of the loss will outweigh the potential gainslowsec already has some rather sizable advantages pve wise over highsec  people just arent into the downside of trying for those benefitsfigure out how to change the belief that lowsec is just too dangerous and folks will go there until then that bar of gold in the bottom of a vat of acid comes to mind  people believe its just too dangerous and such beliefs will be hard to change
im not convinced that the perceived problem with low sec is really a problem with low sec itself low sec should feel like a dangerous or possibly foolhardy venture for someone who doesnt know what to expect for players with experience in low sec they are aware of what the risks are and what to expect low sec is balanced in my opinion why do people feel that the risk is too great here is where i fear the problem may be outside of low sec space this may sound like an insanely obvious comment but if you are not in low sec space you are either in 00 or high sec right one possibility is that you may be in high sec space trying your best to earn enough isk for a shiny new ship for many pilots it will take many many hours to earn enough isk for a ship to go to low sec every high sec nerf that reduces pilots income will affect the next available opportunity for many pilots to go to low sec i really dont feel that nerfing high security space is going to work at all if anything a high sec income boost could potentially make ships more affordable to lose and potentially increase the likelihood of players taking what they feel is a risk in low sec now we all know that it isnt quite as simple as that pilots that are risk adverse will continue to be risk adverse perhaps not in all cases but for many im sure there are pilots out there who would love to go to low sec but they feel that the isk loss to them would be simply too high to risk before they have had time to fully understand what to expectso am i suggesting a possible remedy for this situation no i would like people to consider what could cause players not to risk a low sec venture
i dont remember being in the same corp as you and your name doesnt even ring a bell maybe you are that type of player that people quickly forget
yes it does but making 250 people read it before they ask the bloody question in fleetchat has been proved over and over again as impossible shouldnt be that hard to code so that the motd and the fleetfinder advert are the same no
or you just point them to the fleet finder when they ask after a while they will learn it hopefully
its stupid how long this has been being asked for and that its still not announced
signedthis needs to be recognized
personally i think to be in line with other covertstyle ships blops should get a bonus to their racial ewar instead of useless things like velocity and agility along with other improvements less mass for one reduced fuel use longer range supposed to go behind enemy lines not two jumps away actual t2 resists better fitting etcthe widow is fine for bonuses at least but it would make sense to give the sin a point range bonus the panther a web range bonus and the redeemer a neut transfer bonus this would be consistent with the other covertrecon ships for each raceits a bit silly to compare tanking and offensive ability to their t1 counterparts since blops ships arent meant to be effective in straightup combat but they need a serious boost to mobility fitting and bonuses
supported i still dream of courier contracts in which you can offer transport space on a route which others can fill up until a certain deadline
csm should deffinetly look into this
hmm altho this is a joke thread it highlights an interesting question how much sexualized content eve needs if at all from the incarna pix the art department has clearly chosen to not avoid emphasizing gender features and exotic clothing i wouldnt mind nudity at all hell im all for making this game 18 but i dont know how the game would benefit from it sure scifi red light districts realism and all maybe pixel  but then what its definitely not the feature that would make eve complete also we dont know how much content well get with incarna but it would be hilarious in a bad way if all we had in stations were stores bars and strip clubsbrothelsah yes and about futa there are dozens of other and more frequent sexual orientations so i dont get why that is the only one youre pushing other than your probable personal interest for it
this
props for sticking it out dav good luck with your proposal
i support this topic as other have stated since gallente gets a damage bonus no matter what ammo is loaded along with minmatar and amarr the caldari deserve to get a straight missile bonus regardless of the damage type since this is their main weapon type keep the damage bonuses for the other races in the game though
i know you not trying to cahnge missiles to something more like guns i actually said changing the missile kinetic bonus to something else wont improve any of the bad caldari missile boats as they still wont be able to fit there weapons a tank and mwdfor example the caracal wont be improved really as you cant fit hams or hmls with a tank and mwd without several fitting mods
the 5 to kinetic missile damage per skill level damage bonus that applys to the following ships is a poor bonus and should be replaced with a 5 per level damage or 5 per level rof bonus like the other races get on there shipstotally support this topic and i feel that the proposed replacement bonuses are fair
i think the game needs a way to remap your skilli dont know if this has been up yet by anyone i only got threw about 5 pages of this section of the forumsyou can limit it to once a year and make it cost a lot of money not to mention the loss of skill books already learned and the purchase of the new ones would make you really have to think hard about iti think it would help old players as well as the new onesit would help new players who get a few months into the game fix some of the mistakes they made when they didnt know what they were doing and some of the older players who just want to switch up game play styles  fly different races switch roles to a more pvp game play from an industrial or wei think it might take the sting out of changes that happen to your race that dont turn out to be so good instead of being stuck with it for a year or 2 till the problem gets looked at and addressed the option to switch these things could cut down on a lot of the omg fix my race posts and help the guys at ccp spot problems when they see everyone switching from certain races to othersi think the more customizations you can do to your character  without having to retrain for a year or twois a great idea and keeps things fresh and funlets people play the game the way they want toi know it would be really hard to implement and a lot of work but if we start rumbling about it now and dont let the issue die i could see it happeninggood thing to run on for any of you guys up for reelection youd get my vote and many others id guess
no we really dont need that instant training for the current fotm wont help the game
this has been suggested several times before oddly enough each one suggesting seems to think that this is the first time such an idea has ever been brought upresponses are fairly routine by nowno no instant respec for fotm for you
loling at all the fossils in here with 34 accounts saying this will somehow turn the eve into wowbeing free from any defined career path is one of the main things that separate eve from lesser mmos being able to compete with far older and more experienced characters is anotherlearning skills and attributes in general encourage specialization and have led to our current situation of having every minmaxing grognard in eve thinking it necessary to have a zillion accounts to experience every nuance eve has to offerfurthermore learning skills only serve to broaden the already massive rift between old and new players who have no hope of catching up anyway regardless of learning skillsspecialization is for insects learning skills run against the spirit of eve
part 1 of 2there have been several threads regarding learning skills most have included some very good arguments both for their removal and for their being left in the gamethis post does not concern itself with either opinion camp it is a consideration of the followingif ccp believes that the potential new player perception of the learning skills mechanic discourages new players and if ccp wishes to address that perception directly here is a possible method this method focuses on the actual problem the problem is not the learning skill system the problem is the waiting time that new players perceive is necessary to become competent playersi assign no right or wrong to the perception the purpose of this post is not to judge but to suggest a solution the solution is called taking them out by leaving them inpremises based upon previous threads and from reading ccp dev blogs about resource allocation1 the method should not involve a huge commitment of programmer resources ccp has already indicated that they have many teams working on many other items therefore it should involve existing mechanics and tech as much as possible2 the method should not reduce player choice or force players into a cookie cutter or one way to win mode3 new players should be encouraged to become knowledgable about skill choices before they have invested a huge amount of time or skillpoints4 simple removal of the learning skill system might be considered by many players of longtime duration to have a high impact on the benefits that they accrued by investing time and skill points in the old system new players should not just get something for free that older ones did notsuggestion if ccp is considering doing this at all1 on the inception date of the new patch all players currently playing eve online will receive a device capable of adding skill points not time but points to skills ccp already has such a device as evidenced by the 100 000 sp skill stick the amount will be discussed below it is up to the csm and ccp to decide whether this will be one stick per account or one stick per trained character on the account2 starting immediately after this event any new character in eve that graduates from the full set of instructional tutorials put in place by ccp will then receive an identical skill stick the hope is that experiencing all of the tutorials will at least give completely new players some ideas of the very many possibilities for careers income and entertainment in eve there are already graduation flags in the game so this should not be hard to flag either a new tutorial explaining the significance of the learning skills is recommended3 the current learning skill system will be left in place exactly as it isthe free skill point amount is suggested to be around 3 000 000 3 million sp the player is still completely free as to how and where the points are spent the choice will then be whether to make an immediate entry into one or more skill paths or whether to spend some or all of the points on learning skills the decisions and the potential for right or wrong choices will still be there but for those new players that feel that they do not wish to lag behind over the long term they may make the decision to favour learning skills instead of immediate gain or they may decide to favour immediate gain instead in one quick decisioncontinued in part 2
part 2 of 2in other words this suggestion does not change the fundamental game mechanic at all but removes the initial play time lag if and only if the player wishes to take learning skillsrationale 3 000 000 sp is not enough to max out all the learning skills but it is enough to complete a large portion of them the possible outcomes will then be1 existing player with maximum learning skills 3 000 000 sp to spend on current plan or offplan skills2 existing player with some but not all learning skills apportion the points as above or use some to further your learning skills if you now think that is worthwhile3 existing player with no learning skills or new player with none decide if you wish to increase your long term learning rate or have a fair number of immediately useful skills or a combination of the two just like everyone else had to decide beforethere is of course still a negative impact for people that maximized their learning skills early on 3 000 000 sp are not as impressive if you already have 60 000 000 whereas they seem like a gift of the aesir if you have very few sp however it should be noted that the younger folks still have exactly the same conundrum as the older ones did they can get into that shiny ship and maybe have a couple of income skills or they can get the learning out of the way but not have the instant gratificationat that point it becomes a choice not whether or not to play eve but how to play it the entry barrier is gone but not the decisionthis suggestion could be tweaked and massaged a number of ways including throwing it out entirely but if there actually is a problem with a learning skills barrier then it is my hope that this suggestion addresses the problem without being unduly hurtful to any particular camp in the game either the haves or the havenotsit is not my intent to preach or to be hurtful but simply to suggest what i hope is a clean and simple method if ccp is actually considering the change if they are not i have wasted my time and more sadly yours reader in which case sorry
id like to use this featurehowever everytime i did id feel i was cheating and breaking the game by paying cash for skillpoints
strongly against this featureif ccp feels remaps need to be more frequent then do so do not attach it to plexon the other hand if there was a plex for my favourite bugfeaturepeeve getting development time program
wtf ccp
ccp
im not afraid to say it but money has never been a problem with me people use money to gain an advantage in real life all the time there is no reason it should be any different in a game i am looking forward to training faster no mater what skill i pickhate me if you want but just because you were lazy in life should not bring me down to you level in a game if you think that this gives rich people an advantage then i have this to sayget a real job then losers
plex for 100 training speed bonus pleasebtw i dont want to compete with you by money for a game loserbecause real life losers always spend alots of money in game to gain the confidence they cant get from real life
i dont like anything exchange with 30d plex
not supported i can see why some people might want to oppose this idea as a point of principle but this is only a very small step towards a microtransaction enviroment and has very little direct effect on gameplay compared to the other advantages already on offer to people who want to trade  for isk via plex this is very minor the only people at a very slight disadvantage here are those who cant spare enough isk or  for extra plex and who dont have 1 year skill plansin fact i would quite like to see the use of plex extended to cover more account services  character transfer portrait swap  not to mention pizza
anyone feells happy how ccp is shooting itself in the foot  for a short term gains 
i support this man 
wtf ccpstop trying to slip things like this past the players ffs
i dont want allow plexs for extra neural remaps
no to remap for plex instantlybut support remap for free by every six months
rmt
id have to agree there unfortunately its definitely a move in the wrong direction in an attempt to create more revenue from the game
exactlybefore this change player buys plex from ccp player trades plex for isk to buy shinies  character  whatever ultimately someone uses the plex for gametime end result ccp has to offer 1 month of game time no matter who gets the plex in the endafter this change player buys plex from ccp uses it for a remap end result ccp does not have to offer 1 month of game time economy now has an endless plex sink broken economywtf ccp
amazing isnt it its like that department is run by someone that can talk bull really wellhis fanfest video showed his ability to ignore the outside would and dictate his unique viewhow he managed to convince them to go in the complete wrong direction and then managed to ignore everyone when they pointed at the glaring mistakes and is still employed that guys got it madeactually the funniest part is how when deciding on the 300 limit they did an sql query to tell themhow many players have over 300 contacts and found that this will only effect 1 of playersthey then decided that 1 with over 300 contacts was inconsequential and those 1 wouldnt matterdid they not also read the 1 rule when they were looking into social networks 1 are the content creators the hubs these people with their large contact were keynow with contacts mattering so little and no one needing very many of them surely no one needs to categoise their contacts its almost ed thinking
you make a good casethe control tower should definitely present an interface to interact with all the anchored modules at the pos territory control and resource exploitation is so core to eves gameplay the task of controlling poses should be welcomed not abhorredmore roles more roles more roles
well ccp can always make another skill for that that should require anchoring v  or starbase defence management v 
i have updated the opening post to list most of the suggestions made so far my current plan is to continue this discussion for another 2 weeks or so then we will do a prioritization crowdsourcing followed by a csm proposal at the end of octobermy thanks to everyone who has contributed so far
another thing that should be easy to implement on the processes  production screen where you see moon reactions create an indicator that says everything linked properly or reactor output not linked with the linking interface as it is it could use a redesign tbh but thats way more work this is sometimes not so easy to tell when you are running multiple reactions and mining from the same pos
selfish bumpcome on i cant be the only person that thinks this is a good idea
being fixed in incursion in a different but similar way keep up with the news
bumpedybump for a worthfull post
recently i lost a ship in what could be said was a noobish move noobish or not a game mechanic was used that i had never seen before and was defiantly not intended to be used as a combat tactic in gamei set up a ship in jita and undock grab a bait can for a tank test and eventually the guy starts into me i tank it for a bit and the guy sends a fleet inv i accept to chat with him this was the noobish bit and we chat while he shoots me after a bit he starts nueting me and his corp mate in a vindi undocks and shoots me as well i tank for a bit then click dock nothing happened i check no aggro i click dock again still with nothing happening i spam dock a bit then dieturns out the baiting toon had been swapping my fleet position repeatedly to constantly update my session change timer and keep me stuck outside the stationthe fleet mechanics where never meant to stop a person from docking during combat the smack talk function is always there after joining fleet but was certainly not made to allow someone to move you from spot to spot in a fleet to stop you from ever docking which is exactly what was done to methe smack talk function works as session change timer as far as i understand it the point of session change timer as im aware is to stop players from becoming stuck this guy used it specifically to get me stuck the fleet position change was certainly never meant to be a game mechanic to be used by someone trying to kill you by keeping you undocked isnt that the very definition of an exploit to use a game mechanic that was never meant for a certain use to gain an advantagei was told since i joined fleet there will be no action taken by ccp regardless of whether or not i joined fleet a game is being used in a way that was deffo not intendedthoughts  comments please
yes id call it an exploit but its easy to avoid so no biggieofc the whole session timer concept should be reworked but thats something different
quoting for when he edits it after people make fun of him can we get this moved to cp mods please thanks
exploit is an exploit and theres no excuses for it ccp lately seems to see their own product as perfect i guess unfortunatelly its not if mechanics is used for other purposes then original then they should react  and this is typical situation tbh
changing your position in fleet is a session change that it keeps you from docking or leaving fleet is unfortunate but i wouldnt call that exploitbut i have to ask you something  why do you need to join a fleet for a simple 1v1really  that is the embarrassing part
there are serious issues in your initial recount here1 your in jita pulling your little test how seriously noob are you to do that in the games most heavily trafficked system for crying out loud go to perimeter or something2 you accepted a fleet invite from someone attacking you3 every time you do something in the game that changes status you get a session change duhconclusion  is this an exploitfirst off an exploit is intentionally game breaking mechanic to abuse somethingsecondly what happened here you started and you enabledlastly other than the obvious fact that the guy was intentionally keeping you pinned down you where doomed regardlessnow you want to talk exploits how about an invisible aggression timer that continues to get added on without any warning or prior knowledge thats an exploitwhat you did you did so with full knowledge of doing soepic fail man man up and move onaint gonna get anything here
if you spent more time reading what i wrote instead of smacking and crying about your own ship blowing up you might have a better idea of what happened here bud
i think there are two issues here1 op actions were consistently stupid so his ship got blown up2 this use of session mechanics is an exploitwhich lead to two conclusions1 if op petitioned for his ship to be returned petition should be denied2 future use of this mechanic should be deemed an exploit and followed by banningjust my 002 ymmomv
if you had read what i said youd figure it outyou had every conceivable visual warningcue possiblethe mechanics did exactly what they where supposed to doin my case they didnt and even ccp admitted that and have done so many times they just refuse to fix the several year old bug for some damn reason that even evades everyone else hereits well documentedpsssst  if you trigger an aggro your supposed to get 2 things  an aggression timer and an warning pop up when docked i received neither do your homework prove me wrong smarty pants stop being noob and use that head on your shoulders for once because your obviously missing the point i knew exactly what i was getting into and the timers should have kept updating endlessly constantly reminding me that i started something that could bite me in the ass instead i got no timer not even a blip of a warning at 30 minutes into the aggro timer which is 15 mins by defaultthink before you act pal welcome to eve onlinewas it dirty yeah but i seriously doubt its an exploit maybe underhanded but most people wouldnt even do what you did to begin with
now what aries did was stupid but thats how you learn etc etcusing the fleet to keep him from docking is an exploitation of the feature which is meant to configure your fleet setupi think this exploit is one of those gray shades between white an black basically it comes down to wether or not you want to win ugly since this exploit is so easily avoided you cant blame ccp for focusing on bigger problems my guess is that they will never regard this as an exploit nor prosecute it accordinglyregards lax
change this issue to make session change timers shorter and reduce the number of them i would support it
its a dirty move yea but an exploitno so muchyou can just as easily smack in a private channel instead of joining a fleet tbh its your own damn fault for not watching your session timers not ccps
in no way this is an exploit joining a fleet leaving one or changing your position causes the standard session change timer any competent fc is aware of this and asks people before moving them around so that they wont get stuck on a gate of course if the fc wishes so he can use it in the opposite way  to prevent people from jumpingdocking if you are so stupid as to join a strangers fleetin exactly the same way the fc could execute a fleetwarp and warp you off into their gangsolution leave fleet wait out the session timer dock
1 i would be buying 3 plexmonth for this but i wont spend anything at all on transferretransferaccount bull ccp would make money on this and its less usefulpowerful than having a second accountliang
i was all set up to say lol nobut this is actually not a bad idea no more unbalancing than existing mechanics a lot more user friendlycould if badly marketed leave a bad taste in new placers mouths  those players who still think you should be able by default to skill up all three slots at oncecan you gain xp on three characters in the same account at once in any other mmooverall supported
reading comprehension bro this would do the oppositecurrently the only way to have two characters training in tandem is an alternate account this idea would mean you could train two characters but only use one at a time meaning people unwilling to pay for another account might be willing pay a little more to be able to train and industry character or something on their main account
tldr create a new option under graphics settings to completely remove all subcapital ship models in an effort to help players with lowend hardware experience fleet battles more smoothlyi think i have posted this idea on the forums before but i have not seen it formalized in its own thread the basic premise is simple in fleet engagements positional awareness is vital you stray away from your logistics or wander too close to the enemy fleet and you are dead however in large fights even players using highend hardware are having problems viewing the battlefield at a suitable zoom range the two usually offered pieces of advice to increase your framerate are either to zoom all the way in on your ship or zoom as far out as possible both eliminate any sort of positional awarenesseve currently has several options to change the graphic details trading visual quality for performance however there is quite a lot of these settings and changing them around every time before and after a fight which requires a restert of the eve client can be quite annoying ideally players want to enjoy the highquality graphics eve is famous for during daytoday actions but also an option to get as high performance as possible in fleet fightsthe proposalcreate a checkbox in the graphic options to remove ship models to make the models not render at all i am guessing that rendering ship models and associated effects takes up the majority of computer time during a fleet fight these models also have to be loaded into various caches which could be used for more useful things rendering just the ship brackets in space should be much faster note my background is in cs and computer graphics i would like to think i know what i am talking aboutdetailsthis option should affect ships drones containers wrecks missiles and shipbased effects turret effects and missile effects not the missile models themselves should stay as it is very important to see who is shooting who in a fight i think that large models such as capital ships starbases stations asteroids etc should be unaffected those are usually not as common and hiding these would decrease situational awareness having exactly the opposite effect to this proposalnot displaying any ship models at all would also mean that all the other craphics settings texture model hdr quality etc could very well stay at high seting because there would not be anywhere as many objects rendered on the screen at the same time this would lead to this setting being usable much more easily than the current onein typical fleet engagements the players camera is zoomed too far out to appreciate the visual quality of ship models anyway targetting is executed using the overview or broadcasts and situational awareness is obtained by looking at ship bracketsof course i know that this would do nothing to counter the lag which is a serverside problem but with the recent fixes put in place by ccp this is becoming less and less common in mediumsized engagements especially on reinforced nodes clientside issues and dropping framerates are becoming comparatively a bigger issueespecially for specialized ships such as logistics or interceptors being able to assess the situation and react quickly are crucial for their role and for all practical purposes looking at colored brackets in space is equal to viewing all the ship modelspossible negative impactnone players who wish to see the ship models at all times could simply ignore this option
supporting my own proposal
supported
good idea i fight off brackets and in large fights im not interested in looking at the high quality rendering of my targets hulledit forgot to click the support button the first time
in general terms the negative impact of any feature that allows a player to downgrade graphics for pvp performance is that due to the competitive nature of pvp pretty much everyone feels compelled to use that featureso the question becomes how low a bar do we wish to set in terms to graphics to performance personally not even rendering ship models is too low for my tastes so i cant support your proposal
eve is not a fps or twitch player skill based game if youre worried about the performance of right clicking and turning on some mods and waiting then you need a new computer with or without thissupported
ill support this primarily affects the number of remoterep targets currently limited at 4 mostly a factor in c6
this right here is ed for a tier 3 a siege module of sorts is not a bad idea but it should not stop the ship completely then that relatively fragile battleship just became a sitting duck that can easily be insta popped by any dread thats already in seige some speed penalty is acceptable say 50this would give the dread breaker fit tier 3 battleships a new tactic they would have to microwarpdrive in close then activate their assault module to ensure the capitals guns cant track them this in turn drastically increases the need for capital fleets to run with heavy support turning relatively capital only battles into classless brawls
along with everyone else here the idea as presented is horrible but the core concept could with some work be worthwhilea subcap capitaldestroyer would be nice  if it worked like stealth bombers in that it requires a gang to be effective and it is fairly weak against other targetsrework the concept based on the feedback here and resubmit op
i think ccp prefers to call them the majority of our customers orour largest revenue streamremembering that at all times when contemplating game changes may be helpful
depends on what you mean by modules if modules are the actual mods on a ship then youre correct if modules are meant in the same sense as station services  ie you have propulsion offensive defensive electronics engineering and such  then it might make more sense also why would shooting a drams mwd be useful if you cant hit the ship why would you be able to hit a specific part of the ship and if you can hit it why arent you just killing the stupid little bugger instead of messing around with its speed mod
i concur with herschel this isnt master of orion while this strategy would be great for a turnbased strategy game it really has no place in eve not supported
i have recently had an unhappy love affair and dont see why anybody else should have a good timenot supported
its possible but would need to be done carefully to prevent too much imbalanceif it was implemented it would be best if it served as a way of allowing smaller ships to influence larger battles otherwise it would just be another toy for supercaps  admittedly a kind of quick draw situation where titans were targeting each others doomsday devices and the fastest locker doomsdayed the others doomsday before it could fire would be entertaining but i suspect it would get dumb pretty fastid suggest only capital and supercapital ships having targetable subsystems and that systems could only be damaged by a weapon system 3 sizes smaller than that of the target vessel in other words xl capital ships would only be vulnerable to subsystem targeting from small sized gunsdronesmissiles and xxl supercapitals subsystems would only be vulnerable to small and medium weapon attacks this could either be determined by signature or a hardcoded restriction whichever works best
as it is now the only reason that people eject is to prevent losing skills when losing a tech iii ship i propose a new skill called ejection that would allow your pod to quickly move away from your ship in a random direction 6kmlevel if you should manually eject from your shipthis skill would allow some escape mechanism for getting out of a bubble in 00 but the great speed for that short time maybe 12 seconds in total would make the pod take longer to warp creating some risk for interceptors or other fast tackle catching your podof course the skill would need a different button for regular disembarking if for some reason you do need to get out and not be 30km away from your shipskillejection intelligence perception2x skillprerequisitesevasive maneuvering vnavigation v
totally false i can recall all sorts of fun occasions where people have ejected from their ships for other reasons whereas i dont think ive ever seen a t3 ejection the proposal is weird not very good design and adds ui clutter for no good purpose not supported
remember the buddy account offer gets used for alt accounts more often than it gets used for actual friends and you can activate a buddy account with nothing but a plex do you really want to create a state of affairs where people can pay game currency to get a boost that massive to their stats first rule of eve game design  whatever you create players will abuse as hard as it can possibly be abused keep that in mind when you make proposals
noany change that lets a player get an advantage for outofgame actions is bad the posts above are a good example why it wouldnt work even if you somehow made it so that it cannot be abused it would unbalance the game
start a trial account buy a plex get faster skill training hell yeahby that of course i mean noand to be a bit more constructive the buddy rewards dont mean anything as long as you dont actually have to invite a friend  new customer to the game if the rewards were any more significant  any better than the price of one plex people could just send invites to themselves over and over to exploit the mechanic see above
ntok i suppose i should write something here whilst ccp is tweaking the numbers on rockets for sisi testing would it be too much to ask that they make some corresponding adjustments to hams hams are somewhat overlooked compared to rockets because of fewer hulls using them  only the sacrilege is a dedicated ham platform  but they have problems of their own nonetheless like rockets they give up a great deal of range compared to heavy missiles to gain a modest eftdps increase and then in practise have trouble effectively applying that eftdps to their target more than that the grid requirements of hams make them unattractive options compared to heaviesthe fact that sacrileges often fit unbonused heavy missile launchers rather than hams although it seems nobody flies sacs these days anyway and that ham caracals and cerberus and to some extent ham drakes are mythical creatures never witnessed by man is surely a sign that something is wrong here
could you possibly throw some numbers out there because i dont see a problem with them i have a ham fitted cerberus and legion i use mostly the legion nowadays i havent really had a problem with them
the i dont understand missiles hurr durr door is that way please exit now
what hes trying to say is that the dps on hams was nerfed awhile back against smaller than bssized targets the problem is that theres not much of a role for the few ham boats out there if their weapons are designed to damage bs targets since exchanging fire with bs isnt something hac gangs usually do unless they are just ganking ratters or blobbing smaller fleets so while it may look good in eft ships like the sacrilege take about a 50 damage hit against same sized targets unless they use tps its basically like theyre shooting little short range cruise missilesthe range i have no issue with they work well on the cerb with its range bonus and the sacrilege is mobile enough to get close enough to use them
when going for smaller than bs i use javlins  target painter never had a problem with it myself
your doing it wrongnot supported
my sensors detect a high degree of irony
yes we really need 650 dps 90k ehp drakes
850 dps with overload on that note  undoing the range nerf for javelin hamtorpsrockets would be nice
basically the problem is that the warpto point for customs offices seems to be in the middle of the bounding box and for me its sporadic but common to get bounced off 30kmcan we get them to fix the warp points for custom offices to keep this from happening
imagine mining operations in low sec with scouts guards and hit and run style of miningafter downtime on randomly belts in low sec appears rich ores like arkonor or bistot like faction spawns of npcs but a bit often not too much amount of ore  maybe enough for 12 hours of mining depends of effort if depleted or after next downtime appears in different system to prevent large alliances from claiming those systemsthis issue force people to scout low sec belts and do something there now they are dead place also give miners opportunity to mine on enemy ground with good riskrevard value and with some adrenaline guarding miners could be also profitable professionplease comment if you like the idea
1moar mining ops in lowsec belts please
what purpose does this fulfil that is not already fulfilled by the existence of gravimetric sitesid rather see a rebalancing of grav site mechanics to make lowsec mining exploration more attractive than it currently isreally default lowsec should be more attractive than nullsec is to be honest  since in lowsec you cant improve the space with sov structures nor secure it to the same degree
i do like that idea but for that to work there would be the need for a super rich ore type that gives 10 or even 20 times the yield normal ore gives so you can get a worthwhile amount of money out of a single hulk hold
any chance we can get achievements ingame and for steam stuff for pvp successfully got through a gate camp with 3 or more hostile ships pve completed 100 level 4 missions solo or with a group etci love starcraft 2s achievements system where you can get an achievement and a reward as well as leveled achievements first tier at 10 50 100 etccivilization v also uses achievements with steam and since eve is now on steam i think it would be great to incorporate achievements both ingame and on steamalso  it would be great to actually get unique and tasty ingame items perhaps when incarna releases you can promote walking around in stations by getting little plaques or things to decorate put on and wear or sell  trade in the game anyways i know theres lots on the eve plate of things to do but i would like to see this incorporated at some point in the near future
we already have achevements theyre called certificatesalso pretty sure this is a troll thread if not
the problem is all the best achievements are so hard to measure i mean can steam really award achievements like wrote a spreadsheet larger than 1mb got a 1010 rating on a forum troll or got md to think youre trustworthy those fools properly
deargodno
ow god no lets not do that please visit your user settings to reenable images
im sure ccp is well aware that whatever balancing they implement will displease quite a lot of the customers regardless guaranteeing them a stream of complaints
god yes ive launched 9 drones before realizing my drone control unit was off too many times
all of this hence not supported
love the idea sometimes i just want to be away from it all unfortunately as much as i dislike pvp at the moment i have to agree there must be some timers of some sort or another so that the pvp people have the opportunity to kill people in the appropriate places so that gate camps are still effective and it isnt some sort of permanent get out of jail free cardlike i said love it but gotta side the the pvp people
when youre not moving at all you are aligned in every direction at once or more accurately to nowhere aligning to warp to something straight ahead takes exactly the same amount of time as aligning to warp to something 180 degrees behind you this has been tested multiple timesi dont really care one way or the other about this except that you should indeed not be able to click some kind of warp straight ahead button and instantly enter warp due to stations at the same time though it would be kinda funny to see a jf undock use that and then be stuck in a 65k au warp taking it roughly 25 hours to reach the end 
do not fear marconuswe are on it and its on sisi onlytamber
thats illogical given present mechanics and the plex system itselfi have four accounts at present all of them but one have trained toward combat ships in some way none of them is under four years old and yet there is minimal overlap in terms of ship they fly well essentially ive been paying for more accounts to acellerate my training and ability to fly diffirent ships sure if i had gone the lets fly every subcap rout on my first character id have a lot of it covered by now but that takes more timethe fundamental behind plex and many players having more than one account is the same as that behind plex for remaping the rate at which one is capable of flying more ship goes up when you input cash be that cash another account with purchase of plex with the use of actual cash subscription or with plex for remap does not matter they are one in the same thingcan you justify your position on the matter logically or was this a simple kneejerk reaction as it looks to be
more generallyhas anyone in the csm considered or suggested resignation in protest andor organizing boycottsif you only have the power that ccp gives you then youre basically an elementary school student council but if you have legitimate complaints and a constituency thats willing to act on them you could achieve a lot more than rockets could not suck02
well you are either simply wanting delilah to expose any such pvp toon so that you andor possibly countless others can go after her probbaly repeatedly or your stupid enough not to realise she wont easily expose such a toon because that would be the inevitable resultwhich is it
hrm from the school of all pirates are griefers just one of those coincidences think about that for a moment really think about it if true that means that delilah decided a long time ago to troll the forums she had been doing the same song and dance for ank quite some time ago and decided to insulate herself from possible ganking with an alt to the point of creating a fake blog for her alt to use in order to try to  people off and draw attention only to that alt because she figured ahead of time that she would  off countless people whod want to pod her thats quite a dedication to trolling with malice aforethought and it is of course your suggestion i just think shes lying about having a pvp main of course the reason why delilah should post with the imaginary pvp main she has is because shes constantly trolling about how much she likes pvp while wanting to nerf the hell out of it or how much she values capitals while wanting to nerf the hell out of them or how much she enjoys combat in lowsec while wanting to nerf the hell out of lowsec combat in lowsec and combat in general obviously she doesnt understand those issues and is using her alleged pvp account as a cloak to hide behind its bog standard concern trolling so she should either post with her pvp account if it actually exists or admit that she doesnt have one and is just looking for ways to nerf pvp and none of your ayieee people could gank her nonsense no not even if you try to sell bull as ice cream and suggest that anybody who doesnt want a cone crammed full of it is being stupid not that buy my bull cone and like it or you are stupid isnt an effective and intelligent tactic minda pvper has nothing at all to fear from people coming to pvp with them thats the point of it the very idea that yikes a pvper has to hide their identity lest people come to shoot at them well to put it gently it kinda misses the point and while im at it sport my stupid enough his stupid enough her stupid enough their stupid enough the word youre looking for is youre a contraction of you and are and not your which is possessive just ya know as long as youre alleging stupidity you should be writing on a 9th grade level minimumnow dont say ive never done nothin for ya
hi daool its nice to see you here actually delilah wild is my main as well as my pvp account finn is simply trying to be offensive and poses no threat hes too busy stalking the forums he also hasnt bothered to do his homework or to consider alternatives no surprise there such as the many roles one can assume in pvp when i started i received some excellent advice from a null sec pilot who tracked me into something beyond tackle and i could care less about killboards and epeen even so i appreciate you speaking up those of us who are not griefers in eve or the forums need to stick together cheers delilah
relentless trolling delilah and really obvious and still your silly i cant heaaaaaaaaaaaar you lalalala i am going to talk about you in the third person trolling grow up more of your standard trolling go figure the fact that you obviously never pvp shows that the homework has been done as i caught you in your lie you yet again making  up to troll is hardly a rebuttal to say nothing of the obviousness of your lie you do something in pvp which you engage in all the time honest that neither involves tackle nor dps nor remote repping nor combat probing and of course why almost 100 of the ships youve lost are frigates except for an obviously pvp but failfit scorp that you also lost in other words you do not pvpand of course youre trolling which is why you can only make vague noises about how of course you pvp its just in a super seeekrit role that nobody knows about and why anybody who expects you to actually show up on a killmail because you were involved in a fight is all about epeen and probably a griefer ayieeee
if you took a look at finns killboard stats you would be able to tell that he would know exactly what roles you can assume in pvp finn has amassed 1458 kills with a success ratio of 481 to me and im fairly sure many who may read this post it is you delilah that havent done your homeworki have no problem with you posting your ideas on these forums and i applaud your relaxed attitude but you cant expect to be able to pull off i am a pvper to experienced combat veterans
hello violentuk finns stats are impressive and i hope my character will do as well in time even so they are as irrelevant as mine to his ad hominem arguments the real issue and the one that has him so exercised is a different interpretation of eves past and future the rhetorical claim that i am masking a hatred of pvp by pretending to like pvp is simply one of his canards cheers delilah
actually its a bit higher my api verified kills with razor go back to mid 2008 and theyve a few more they dont include any combat i got into during the first two years i was playing eve and battleclinic is unfortunately somewhat spotty in any case yes ive flown just about every type of subcap ship from logis to command ships to fleet battleships to bombers to ceptors to hacs to dictors to im used to how small gang large fleet and capital ships brawls work which is part of why i object to nonsense delilah is trying to sell on that countthe problem isnt merely the ideas they are in the main very very bad ideas but thats besides the point its the trolling and dishonesty thats used to sell them its one thing to say that you want to nerf lowsec pvp because you dont like pvp but its quite another thing to say that you want to stick it to pvpers in order to balance the game and you know what youre talking about because youre a pvper its a pattern across many arguments nor is fauxcivility a beneficial cloak either if its a troll and more to the point its rather poor faux civility her talk about how pvpers are griefers is just a step down from the mentally ill rhetoric that typified the disgraced and happilydeparted ank of whom delilah was a rabid defender delivering poison with a smile isnt true hospitality and her usedcarsalesmansmile while accusing anks critics of slander even when they were quoting anks own words was just more of the same the fact of the matter trolling aside is that delilahs ideas are horrible precisely because she doesnt understand how pvp works or even the fact that eve is a pvp game when faced with that fact she resorts to a pattern of trolling whereby she pretends that people who know eve is a pvp game are fumdamentalists that these bad ideas are consistently cast using dishonesty and from a rather disgusting position of whiteknighting about how horrible griefers are in their fundamentalism since eve is just a cosmos well the whole and im a pvper is just icing on the cakeps delilah stop trolling whats it going to take an ad hominem argument is one that seeks to address an inconsequential personal detail about a person to debunk their argument it is properly a non sequitor pointing out that you are ignorant of pvp and thus youre offering an uninformed opinion that displays a basic ignorance of game mechanics and therefore makes basic errors thats not an ad hom pointing out that you have a near anklevel hatred of pvpers in a pvp game and that colors your every suggestion about combat in eve informing and forming the substance of many of your errors is not an ad hom pointing out that you do hate pvpers you are a liar when you claim to like and engage in pvp and you are using your trolling about how much you like pvp to cloak your arguments for nerfing pvp is a fact not an ad hompointing out that your point of view fundamentally misses the basic dynamics of eve that because you rage against eve being a pvp game and see yourself as a perpetual victim who has to be saved by ccp that because you view the very game style ccp deliberately set up as grief play shows that the view of eve you have is toxic ignorant and antithetical to the functioning of the single best persistent pvp mmo ever createdan ad hom argument would be that your avatar looks silly so your argument sucks
the csm definitely should be contributing to content but i think its a waste of time to have them focused on lets make the ship speed indicator green level of disucssion they should be engaging ccp in broader terms for example where low sec could evolve and doing that with big piture ideas and brainstorming they should also be representing the players regrding the relative importance or lack there of when considering what attention should be given existing in game elementsi think the csm can be very effective at nagging ccp about thigs that just didnt work as represented nul sec sov changes are an example of something that failed completely at achieving one of the main goals which is to say get the little guy out in the badlands it might eventually be that but not until treaties are in place so for example the csm could be nagging ccp about the priority to get that new game mechanic doneissler
yes thanks for this im going to just bring the post from last meeting so i have it saved somewhereim going to write these wikis someday
violentuks point is a good one i remember worrying about losing ships when i first started in sharuveil its wasnt the loss of the ships per se but how to replace them a few people were very kind in helping to support me in those early days eve u has a superb ship replacement policy so when i joined i stopped worrying about ship replacements as a complementary point i also recall being disappointed with the brevity of the engagements which reduced the overall fun even when one lost ships in low sec having a longer time to have fun in the engagements would be appealing dont know if anything could be done about that without impacting every ship and many tactics still its an interesting thought experiment cheers delilah
hello aelius i look forward to running against or with you for csm 6tamber

actually you know what implement it im curious to see how people would reskill their characters my money is on pvpers reskilling for amarr and minmitar and miners reskilling towards caldari missileshield boats
3 nos and 1 lets try for gigglesnot what i had expected  anyone out there think this is good ideaonce a year as i said means no fotm build more like foty and i also said make it cost a lot of money and i mean alot of money like 10 mil sp  100 mil isk sp remap  skill book cost the higher sp players would really have to think hard about doing it it would cost billions of isk and youd be stuck with it for a year i think it would be used mostly to right the wrongs of newer players and might let them try something new instead of just bailing on the game after a few monthsand the fact that this has been coming up is a good sign thats how things get changed remember if your happy with the way youve trained you dont have to use it its not for you then it actually might save some accounts for others to get further into the game and find something they like to do
do itbut first let me go buy 10 chars with  skills in the character bazaar remap the sps and flip em for 200 profit in all seriousness if they limited it to like 5m sp or even just 2m sp per year then sure but it needs to be capped isk cost is stupid because people will just buy plexs and sell em for isk to pay for it essentially allowing them to buy sps
hell no live with your choices or gb2wow
i like this 2m sp per year would be cool
i like that idea of a few million sp a year that would address the argument of buy 10 toons off the forums and remap at a profit yet still help new players adjust at least once for mistakes and spare us from the go play wow argument this post is for ideas not flame trollsso pls keep the ideas coming and keep the flame fingers off the triggerid like to see a real discussion happen on this
the problem is that there are no mistakes you made a choice about how your character should be and thats it you skilled astrogeology v you made a choice you formed your character formed his history and made him unique and because of this uniqueness your character is an eve character a character from a game where choices matter most of the timeso you want to take that and make all characters the same fotmfotyfotddecadedont destroy the diversion
not supportedthere are no big mistakes in eve there is no mistake you cannot correct no skillpoint prevents another skillpoint from being trainedif you trained inefficiently or trained something that isnt as useful as you would like  stop training it  the skill points are spent and forgetting something doesnt make you smarter at another thingall this would add is an increased belief that there is a right way and a wrong way to train and i dont think eve needs that

like t2 bpos the fact most of us have many alts and the general reality of a static buildup of skillpoints over time that argument is not being backed up by logic players with money have benefits over others already if they want it this is nothing newyou listed enough reasons right there but if you need more just visit highsec some time and check out the baddies farming up plex money with l4s theyre the poor tools buying plex so your anom farmers can play for free so please cry more about the advantages that these players are going to get by plexing an extra remap now and then if you eventually pass out from dehydration you might come to your bloody senses and realise this is the most childish and stupid thig the csm has bothered to notsupporttldr business as usual htfu and get off your high horse just because it makes you cry to think plex might get more expensive for your 12 accounts doesnt mean this is a terrible and ilconcieved idea
this
use plex in this way is not a good idea
not supportedi enjoy the idea of being able to remap again by spending 300400m on a plex and going yay fixed that ed intmem thing and not being stuck for a goddamn year
wtf ccp
buying improvements to your character with money no thanks
do not want
i dont mind itit is interesting to see that only old players whine about thatlooks like they are fighting tooth and nail to not give newcommers any advantageespecially since this advantage is really nonsense just set up a long enough skillplan so no i dont support this at all
just so you people in ccp know what you loose if you go ahead with this bulli have 7 accounts all payed with cold hard cash do this plex change and im cancelling 6 of them and that 7UFFFDth can run highlevel missions to buy plex with isk so you will not get money from that eitherthats 715  105month you loose right there reason i poay cold hard cash is im too lazy to learn how really generate massive amounts of isk in this game
ccp fanboy posting to say this is a baaaaad idea
while im not sure if this is true and id like to see your source of this information ive not gone through the ages of every character that have posted this would be interesting and also something to take into considerationalthough i dont agree that there is no advantage to be gained from this feature it has in some of these posts been stretched way out of proportion to what advantage it would actually give tamber
wtf ccp
oh no not again
so no advantage from free remaps means its ok to sell them for plex next time they will introduce a way to buy sp for plexisk  the interface is already implemented remember the last expansion and the free sp it always starts with small things

more remps  okaymore stuff to buy with rl money  not okay
you dont actually know how marginal of an advantage it will be and its avalible to anyone obviously and yet you decided to make this threadso i take it youre aware this thread continues to loose merit as we goim extremely dubious as to what the motivators are behind the various csm fatcats being hot and bothered over this issue but i do hope someone can come up with a more coherent and logical explanation soon that isnt related to the tired snot fair money advantage stuff that obviously does not make a shred of sense
doesnt bother me since i get the same advantage by planning my training long termhowever where it may lead in the future does bother me
plain and simplenothat is one step in the wrong direction
i am for using plexes to buy neural remapshell im for using plexes to buy spyou can already do the latter by selling the plexes for isk and using the isk to buy a characterso whats the big deal
vote against plex4remap
to sort of pinch in the probes together we have shift click and move all probes at once in the same direction why not have shift click and mousewheel to make them move closer on each other or widen away
honestly not a bad idea

oh god yes pleaseand please fix access to corp hangar arrays and mobile labs to alliance members sure its one of the long standing features that never were completed and ccp stated multiple times they wont do it even xhagen said so in a video interview but we will keep asking for this  the ui options for setting alliance access exist but they have no effect whatsoever
bump
and it is right there that im going to tell you to gtfo
i like this proposal and the idea of simplifying the universe for newbie pilots in their first hours but the problem with your proposal is that it is stuffed with words like singeplayer or instanced which let most eve people shiveri would introduce this as a kind of simulation inside the starting stations a new player would so to speak play eve while playing eve awesome sentence  the simulation would start with the basic features and interface and then add everything else in the training process maybe similar to your explanations it would be like another universe with own market own wallet maybe another set of starting skills and stuff like thatbut of course every new player could anytime leave the simulation and undock in the real world as soon as he feels like it and when he is ready to continue the tutorial simulation he docks somewhere and enters it again
as you didnt bother to read the rest of the sentence im go treat you like a trollrtard from now onskothen i dont think i said single player once in my whole text i always said that i wanted there to beother players to interact with as thats the whole point with a mmorpg and eve in particular i just dontthink it benefits anyone to have a new player getting harassed by people who have been playing for 5 yearsthe first time he logs in i dont really see the difference of starting at a deadspace complex than a instancedsystem tbh youre going to be alone there no matter what i would also like to add that while your idea of a simulation to train players isnt bad its just  donttake this the wrong way uninteresting why would anyone want to play something that pretends tohappen in a game you need to get the feeling of being stranded in there the oh  i must work together or againstwith these people to be able to get myself out of here everything you do in your first hour must seem relevant to therest of the game the bigger picture so to speak
by having no barriers between the new and the old the new players are forced to harden up and learn the ins and outs of the game in order to survivea good example of this comes from a thread posted awhile back where a career mission runner posted a thread raging about how people had probed out his mission site flipped one of his wrecks and tricked him into engaging with his mission ship it was an otherwise ordinary emorage post with similarly ordinary responses until he posted back saying that he had not bothered to learn the mechanics of pvp because he didnt want to know anything about pvphad missions or highsec been instanced and forced contact not been possible this person would have remained ignorant of a large part of the mechanics that make up the game through this rather unfortunate event he learned that he had to understand the aggression mechanics in order to stay safe this is of course assuming that he didnt quit eve altogetherthe difference is that there is a chance that you can be probed out in a deadspace complex and be forced to interact with another player an instanced system in the eyes of many here is where there is no chance of forced interaction for better or worse and is thus akin to hand holding which is very much against the ethos of evewait so you want an instanced environment where newbies can learn the mechanics of the game without the risks of running into a vetolder player and yet you turn around and say that newbies need to have the feeling that they have been stranded and must work together i have trouble following that line of logic as a safe system for newbies will hardly give that feelingoverall i do agree that the tutorials are dumb and need to be looked at again perhaps something where the autopilot will take over and perform an action just once in order to show you how to do certain things but i can see this as being a coding nightmare for the devs and raises a few possibilities for exploits but i digressthis smacks of a korean mmo style intro and i cannot support this on principle alonenot supported

insert a whine about the ui here
this isnt an exploit its just intelligent use of game mechanics its not like youre going to fall for the same trick again after all its sneaky as hell and ill certainly keep it in my bag of tricks for future engagements but its perfectly within the realm of intended mechanics
does this also prevent someone from jumping through a wh
not an exploit
personally i would say this is exploitbecouse if this is just intelligence use of game mechanics then ccp better reinstate all those banned accounts from that mon material reaction fiasko that forced ccp to do some changes how they handle thingssince game mechanic allows in that case too it clearly was inttelligence use of game mechanics maybe op should actyally petition this upto senior gm level to get definitive answer
the mistake the op did was to accept the fleet invite if the op have had any experience with fleets he would know that by accepting a fleet invite gives you 30 sec session timerif the op had known this this would never happenso this is not an exploit and have never been it either its a big noobish mistake by a player that didnt know how fleet mechanics workslike me i havent done empire wars in like 4 years before i joined mbalm and i was pretty much clueless on how all of those empire aggroing things was working but thanks to experienced players in our corps that have exaplained most things to meso im aware of pretty much everything nowthe best thing you ever can do in empire is to be smart if your not smart your gonna lose alot of isk
ccp should add liquid ozone as allowable ship cargo in the ship maintenance array ammunition was allowed in the cargo specifically because its something every ship has and its not typically something people like to haul long distances so allowing it in the sma is not very abusable i believe liquid ozone also falls under this category because its uses are largely limited to cyno fuel and pos fuel and people generally only haul liquid ozone alone only as cyno fuelhaving to go through a bunch of liquid ozone cargo bs with your cyno frigates is really annoying
the watch list is a handy tool but there are some changes that can be made to greatly improve usability1 allow ctrlclick of watchlist members to lock them2 allow option to automatically remove watchlist members when they die so pods dont clog the list3 add optional ship type column4 make it easier to resize the list and the columns within
yeshow would this be different to scamming with bpcsbpos
while i could see selecting reprocess on a whole unpacked cargo container as useful for recycling a bunch of items at once i cant imagine that i am the only one who uses cargo cans in hangar to organize equipment if youre not paying attention and selectall the hangar contents to reprocess your meta0 junk it includes those cans and will happily reprocess itso basically an unpacked cargo can and its contents shouldnt be allowed as valid targets for reprocessing
itt stupid people do stupid thingsin all seriousness though it would be nice to see a specific warning ie you are about reprocess a cargo container all contents will be destroyed
a popup warning would workim normally careful about recycling but just one mental slip can ruin your whole day
supported either to entirely disallow or give a warning
it should only be possible to reprocess empty containers
this
supportedits not particularly funny to find the two cans you dont want to reprocess between the 600 different modules you acquired over a few months of mission running
unless youre zoomed in very close which no one is during fleet battles ships are practically invisible unless you have brackets turned on theyre a waste of rendering resources at that scale
seems like a good idea to me
you do realize though that not the models but the brackets are what creates most of the client side lag theres a reason everyone tells you to switch off bracketsi guess it also depends on your machine but for myself i can say that turning on brackets slows my machine down to a slide show where as turned off brackets speed everything up to 3040 fps againthus for me it has always been bad software engineering rather than a ty computer because seriously why are the overview and the brackets slowing down my game and not the models and the aaaawesome sensor booster effect that you see so rarely edit supporting the proposal with this exception fix the lag created by brackets i find it awful to fix a broken feature by adding a feature to fix said broken feature
 thisi tested having brackets on and off during the battle for dg earlier this year i run typically with all settings on high hdr enabled and all effects on my fps was knocked from my usual 80100 in space to a grueling 2030fps however in most lowfighting situations such as undocking from jita 44 my fps doesnt take a hit regardless of having brackets on or offwithout brackets or models youre essentially playing a pointandclick excel spreadsheetand wheres the fun in that
you heard that right but it was not a wreck it was by wreath how about special hud tags for minmatar ships saying this is not a wreck
i support this as an april fools day gag
sounds good to me
many cruisers can lock more then 5 targets for example recons and logistics 2 roles that t3s are supposed to fill can handle 10
then where can i find your proposal criticizing that the t3 can lock as far as bs can have a higher sensor strength than bs can reach the same dps the same tank but at the same timer are more agile and faster can track better can be refitted to evade bubbles and warping cloaked and have t2 resistsgiving t3 cruisers the stats of battleships but denying them locking any more but 5 targets is nothing but ridiculous although 1 target would already make me happy enough
this is exactly correct the type of ship that would use a joystick might be the drones which are effectively piloted by the computer
right now if you put guns on a target that is dying due to some timing issues your guns end up going on the next target instead of your intended target this csm proposal is to change the client so that if you put guns on a target or if the last target died the same time you pressed f1f8 to not set the guns at all and possibly put up some notice to the player so they know it was because the target died and that they can try againthis is to prevent issues like shooting friendlies as there is currently no mechanic to differentiate friendly locks from hostile onesright now there is only one workaround and that is to lock an additional hostile or neutral target in the right order so that when your guns go to them accidentally they dont cause serious problems but sometimes thats not an option
f supported here had a fleet engament yesterday my domi neuter a widoow black ops and a drake totally cost for all around 13bil not that you need to now that lol anyway lol we took on a domi and mega i neuted out the domi and mega in the first 30second theyre sitting ducks we get the mega down to 10 armor or around that and rr comes along fkk we lost the drake i nearly lost my domi i went 5 struct and the widow just managed to escape we could have lost all of those ships due to 1 just 1 rr this is ridiculous its our flippin war wt vs wt not us vs 40000 pilot and even more stupid people niow hire players for this support for high sec wars stop this now
wow just wow
sry wolf but i have to ask this question did you actually read your post once from top to bottomthe information i decyphered goes along the lines of remove neutral rrsi agree that neutral pilots should not be allowed to interfere with the war effort of another corp but this post of yours is just lets say it is not working in your favouryou were so angry that you didnt even enter a subject for your posting i recommend leaving the pc for half an hour next time you get angry about a computergameregards lax
ctrl  click on broadcasts to lock targetpretty simple really having to right click is really annoying tbh
as far as i know you already can you just cant do it for broadcast history
as you may or may not be aware the kronos is fairly widely regarded as the least useful in pve of the 4 marauders primarily this is due to the nonfeasibility of blasters and the underwhelming power of railgunsthe bonuses on the ship indicate that the original intent was to have a blaster fit to this intent i would suggest that the stasis web bonus be dropped in favor of an optimal or falloff bonus to hybrids extending effective range of blasters to approximately 40k before the dps drop is ridiculousdownsides this may make a fairly ridiculous sniping platform with railguns this is balanced in pvp by the low sensor strength of marauders making them ridiculously easy for a decent ecm pilot to remove them from the dps equation
oops supporting my own post 
i have to point out that with reguard to your augrment the same can be said for the paladin as it to has the stasis web bonous just like the kronosi would support 1015 per lvl bonus to the effectiveness of tracking computers for the kronos where as give the paladin a stasis web range bonous of 1015 per lvl insted of the stasis web speed reduction bonous that both ships curently have that would make them more in line with the rest of the marauders
i agree  the paladin isnt hindered nearly as much by its nearuseless bonus but in both cases the ship is helped greatly by a change
the webbing bonuses makes sense especially with rails so you can hit close orbiting ships angel or merc missionsnot supported
the web bonus also doubly applies to the use of blastersdouble not supported
the webbing bonus does make sense with rails  but rails are not what the other bonuses seem to suggest as primary weapon system on the kronos it seems to suggest blastersthe blasters do enjoy the web bonus but it seems to me theyd be better off with a range bonus so that you dont have to be at ridiculously short range to apply dps which is the problem that makes the vargur invariably better than the kronos for missionsand dont argue but but pvp because the low sensor strength makes marauders a reasonably bad choice in pvp
enough people use marauder in pvp you just need to be prepared to handle ecmstill not supported
many of those who use a marauder in pvp doesnt really cares about the low sensor strenght they pvp in hopes of not meeting a falcon or someone with ecm dronesor they will in some cases have a falcon alt them self so they can jam the falcon that will jam the kronos or other maraudersi know some guys that use a kronos in pvp with high success ratiothe kronos is perfectly fine as it is now
i dont know why the original design called for one jump clone per station only but were long past the time period when jump clones were shiny new things and now this particular restriction is just annoying removing it and allowing us to keep multiple jump clones in a station will be more convenient for players
assembly hall  jump clones
awesome that was the guy that originally requested me to raise the issue in the first place i must have lost his thread thanks
its apparently by design that the eve patcher closes all instances of eve instead of the one that is getting patched is it really that hard to close only the patching instance of eve this is really annoying on patch day with multiple clients and multiple accounts
some of us use junction points to avoid duplicating the entire client install in that instance not closing all clients would be a very bad thing
oh this is interesting ive never heard of junction points before im totally making use of this nevermind this ah issue then
proposal would give some reason for people to eject to save their pod as is i hear recommendations are against it as it prevents you from warping away quickly enoughinteresting idea given it guarantees you will lose your ship however i suggest that it does not have any penalty which makes it easier to catch your pod and perhaps has a longer range to make it unlikely to be possible  in exchange the pirates are getting to keep your ship and 100 of the modules assuming they stop firing before it explodeswould provide interesting interaction options if implemented  supported
and this is the most ridiculous thing i have seen in a long time i love how blizzard you can say its wow btw nullified any achievements that other players made without those buddy invites
the range on javs was ridiculous iirc depending a bit on if it were rockets hams or torps when i get 40km range on my blasters with null you may have your old range back for javs
this is a stupid thread theres nothing the damn matter with hamsham sacrilege  problem is sacrilegeham caracalcerb  problem is pgham drake  problem is 
ham sacriledge  problem is the people who have no fing clue how to fly close range shipshams are some awesome  if you use them right missile users just arent accustom to that style of fighting i thinkjavs could use about a 10km boost in range right now they really do suffer from their slow travel time the drift effect usually makes what is 30km range really only about 25km range
i usually just bring javs to annoy people who try to kite me in warp disruptor range but in general that ammo is nerfed too hard compared to barrage and scorch
whats that got to do with the topic you can already do exactly what you describe although the effective range of hams makes it a failfit for anything but a gank the op isnt complaining about the range hes complaining about the fact that a cruisersized weapon isnt designed to hit cruisers
im pretty sure hams do good damage to cruisers if youre too dumb to fit a scram and probably even a web thats not the weapon systems faultjust because youre too scared to miss a killmail or two because you cant fit a disruptor or youre so afraid to lose your ship that you have to fit an extra shield extenderinvul doesnt mean the weapon system is brokenat least your terribly broken hams do some sort of damage to frigates too i demand a 200 tracking increase for projectiles because i cant shoot an orbiting frigninja edit oh and on that note sorry for saying 650 rather than 850 hams on drakes are broken enough in game balance terms i thought i exaggerated well enough but hey
i would support a javelin range boost and maybe a 5 pg use reduction but other than that i think theyre fine personally you can get some brilliant paper dps which can be made a reality with javs and tps just look at ham legions only way to fit a legionnot supporting
i have no idea about this as i dont do pi but if this is true it shouldnt be hard to fix
never had this problem wtz puts me right next to it every time with no bounce
i really like this
the only thing that could doing hit and run mining in low sec would be spawning some very dense or pure asteroid there that can be only mined with a new class of t1 mining frigatethe asteroid spawning should be a random intervals not a dtfor example spawning 02 asteroids in each belt with 100 m3 of a new mineral that would yield 1000 units of zydrine but that require the use of a high frequency mining laser or some other mumbo jumbo a laser that can be used only on dedicated ships that way the miner would be in and out from the belt with a high frequency and killing him would require some decent planning having a regular 00 asteroids will do little the time needed to gather enough mineral to refine is relatively long making them easy targets
spawning more ore at downtime would only benefit people in the right timezones to pick it up for everyone else and this includes the majority of eve population doing this would have little to no effect as any extra roids would be gone by the time they get theregravimetric sites already fulfill this role perfectly
its not quite as illogical as you might think first off the number of accounts you have is effectively irrelevant given they all train at the same speed all it does is give you more sets to chose from rather than expanding the set you have as an example lets take 2 identical accounts all variables being equal under the current system they will always train at the same rate no matter what actions the owners take now lets add unlimited attribute remaps possible through plex for remaps to one of those accounts they still have the same equal variables but one account can train faster than the other simply through being able to constantly optimise itself for whatever skill is being trainedthats why i agree with foivos that plex for remaps is a bad idea it upsets a mechanic at the very heart of the skill system the mechanic that all things being equal two accounts train at the same speedbut anyway enough of my rambling
under those circumstances the player not to be confused with account since were well beyond the false supposition that players generally have one account recieves the same benefit at the exact same price the only variable left out of the equation is the necessity to fill in prerequisite skills that more than one account may hold alreadysince we are already well aware of the time this takes and subsequent number of plex or monthy payments incurred for alts to develope into their designated roles why then are we arguing the semantics of how this is baddiffirenti cannot see any negative to this system which does not already exist via rampant alts who already exist two accounts train at the same theoretical speed but that does not work in practice even if you remove the implant and learning skill variables you are still left with proper remap allocation and skill training order to optomize sp gains over the year this is something an alt can take full advantage of because you already have other characters to amuse yourself with so again at the most basic levelbuy another account    can do more things in less timebuy plex and remap    can do more things in less timethe only diffirence being no matter how skilled one character is it wont be able to fly two ships at once so the alternate account user still wins in the longrun
im not sure which horse you believe me to be riding or why this would be a knee jerk reaction i posted an assembly thread post gave everyone the information that i thought they needed which includes much more arguments against the proposal and for this new system and then left the vote up to players judgement to me the purpose of the assembly hall is to post proposals and to get peoples opinions so that they can be represented faily by those csm who work in this manner a good proposal if neccessary will show both for and against arguments so that voters may consider each side and although the proposal is not neutral due to the topic being against something it is well balanced the cons were expanded in this particular proposal due to some feedback from players who didnt fully understand the ones that were there and clarity was neededie people can buy characters with isk is not inherently unfair as before plex everyone had equal oppurtunity to do so  and as such this is actually covered under the real money trading happens regardless and people with more money can buy and sell plex ingame and get an advantage already argumentstamber
that may be true but the main reason i think people are worried about this is because its skirting perilously close to the whole cash for skill points issue that flared up a while back accelerated training by using plex to me looks like pretty much the same thing you may well be right and it ends up making no difference but the issue is such a hot button topic with such serious implications that i believe its better to just stay the hell away from it as much as possible
for me the most basic level is the plex mechanic not character sales or alts before plex everyone had equal chance to buy and or sell characters tamber
you seem intelligent enough to realize that you made it blantly obvious people should oppose this prior to giving any compelling debate on the subject you clearly failed to sit down for one second and rationalize anything based on present game mechanics and the plex system status quo you want anyone to believe youre leaving this up to the players judgement then try leaving your own bias out you are purposefully trying to seperate the plex to remap proposition from the preexisting   plex  character relationships that already exist when there is no reasonable way to do so the only reason i can find for this position is that you as a representative of many players who support their accounts with plex bough via ingame isk do not want another use for plex because that would upset your constituents trying to support many accounts in this mannerso kindly stop blowing smoke up our collective asses and have out with your agenda and actual reasoning the oh but players will get an advantage shtick is a rather obvious load of bs
hrm from the school of all pirates are griefers just one of those coincidenceshmmm i think you need to look again and not make assumptions
delilah  mindless ankh fangirl whoda thunk it tbh i started ignoring her right after reading her first 3 paragraphs of bumf that boiled down to whaaa pvpers are all griefers and i hates them and seeing that every idea she has is poorly thought out utterly unbalanced and totally ignorant of game mechanics i suggest everyone else does the sameanyway in reference to the op speaking as a low sec pvper delilah take note feel free to look up my stats any time you like i personally recommend doing it via our alliance website
tbh i think that its important to start with the logic for any proposed change and then see if it might impact the availability of targets after all we could always just make it so that any gate had a random chance to take someone to the system next door or tama putting more people into lowsec will be a good thing but it shouldnt be the only thing that were getting at bounties in particular are notoriously open to abuse and would very quickly simply turn into a revenue stream for any outlaw with a noob corp alt transferable kill rights might work a bit better especially if theyre coupled with a built in locator agent style servicei still think that boosting the faction warfare system and allowing lowsec residents to claim space and get advantages from that will be the way to go ultimately to improve the game and lowsec as a consequence give players something to fight over other than simple kills and hunting ground and lowsec might see more use potentially at least because in the final analysis what matters it that people are ready and willing to pvp or at least risk pvp with the number of people who break into a cold sweat over the possibility of griefing its unfortunately not the totality of the eve playerbase nope i was correct as folks can see from clicking on the link but interesting how quick you went from of course delilah isnt posting with her actual pvp main which really does exist and only an idiot would expect her to to so erm lets change the subject
finn i dont think delilahs trolling i think shes just like that normally
oh my
well youre either deliberately misrepresenting that thread or you are simply doing so without realising itin it you will see most of the discussion was about hisec griefer wardecs as in keep wardecing untill the corp members quit eve style griefing as shown by highsec grievers help noobs cancel the subscription its clearly in ccps interest to encourage this with current wardec mechanicsyour confusing a dislike of people deliberately using game mechanics to force people out of eve entirely and a enjoyment of one of the many integral components of the game which delilah has also stated as such  combat between semiconsenting players

wow trebor nice post very informative and thanks to the active and visible csm members for their hard work emphasis my own for anyone who wishes to complain about hybridblaster changes not making it into the list if you would please direct your attention to the failed csm vote the proposal rejection was nearlyunanimous i would recommend drafting a new proposal via the assembly hallquestion for you trebor do you think that the csm might do another crowdsourcing after the october summit
at first i wasnt going to bother logging in to support this despite the fact its the most amusing thread ive seen in a long time since the csm is a serious institution after reading the meeting minutes i made up my mindthis thread illustrates perfectly what is wrong with with the current game development and to see it being treated in such a fashion is absolutely horrible i dont think anyones seriously suggesting we should be able to order pizza through eve by using plexes or that development time should be used to enable such a feature though it would make for an interesting promotion gimmick i do give people posting here the benefit of doubt and enough credit to assume that most of them dont want to order pizza via plex but are making fun of a messed up dev cycle that introduces new bugridden content that sees little love afterwards and then plexes are suddenly supposed to become a backdoor to do microtransactionstheres faction warfare theres our for all intents and purposes disabled address book theres still socket closed issues for nUFFFD people every once in a while the same amount of players cant even launch the game after a patch and if you look through this forum section alone im sure youll stumble over uhm one or two more yessupporting this ridiculous notion and bringing it to ccps attention mightve been a wakeup call when it comes to customer preferences but i guess its easier to pretend you have more important stuff to do
speak for yourself id totally order pizza for plexyep ccp isnt giving pi some lovin in the next patch nope not at all liang
i guess there is a negative example for everything selective quoting also helps to win the interwebs i heard that way the one example of ccp investing substantial time into further developing a somewhat unpolished feature and writing a dev blog about it to make sure people have something to point to when the topic comes up again  which it always does sooner or later is in no way connected to the four examples i already mentioned of where it is unfortunately not happening to the degree of producing a noticeable effect and of course there are countless more almost like it didnt happen by the way this is where i would insert a smiley that rolls its eyes if i was just a tad coolerthat doesnt mean i dont appreciate what is being done to improve the game when i read rockets were finally being fixed i rubbed my eyes and was very very happy but how long did that take to happen how many threads and players spending time asking pleading crying and why wasnt that a priority over adding new shiney featurez that ended up breaking other parts of the game when introducedas much as i like eve and think ccp is awesome for creating it and keeping it running they do sometimes have their priorities wrong that theyre planning to introduce backdoor microtransactions with plexes is a step in the wrong directionordering pizza for plexes wouldnt even be a bad thing albeit slightly ed mind as it doesnt have much of an impact on the game itself except driving plex prices up but it serves perfectly to illustrate the ridiculous scope of it all
your first post here went on a long tirade about what was wrong with current game development at ccp  how they would introduce a less than stellar feature and then leave it to languish so i pointed out a feature that directly contradicted you that was in the current game development cycle you think that past features should be iterated on  we get that hell maybe we even agree but they cant all be iterated on nowand while i dont see eye to eye with you on the microtransactions ill let that aloneliang
make the cost exponential per sp ex 1 sp remap  1 isk 2 sp remap  4 isk 3 sp remap  9 4 sp remap  16 isk and only be able to do it once a year
the rate at which ships weapons and modules are rebalanced in eve is more or less on a yearlybiyearly schedule that means that when a certain race has fotm ships it will stay that way for a loooooooooong time ergo this will only be to the benefit of the minsmaxers out there who wish to fly the best ships granted what is or is not the best is purely a subjective thing mostlyas far as cost goes 100 mil is for the most part chump change for those players out there who have a lot of sp and 10 million sp is a lot to toy around with perfect support skills cruiser 5 maybe bs 5 and then some you could fiddle with the cost of it but then youd potentially be shortchanging the newbie players that you are aiming this formy first post here was mostly a sarcastic jab i can only see a homogenization of what ships people fly if this were to be implementedlive with the skills you train for better or worse you never know they might someday be usefulnot supported
not supported you make a choice as to what you train for and should live with it
wrongat max learning skills you have a total of 968 with an average of 1936 per attributeif someone who remaps to get max learning on each skill they will train as if they have 121 total skill points with an average of 242 per attributethey will train faster than you so it essentally means real life money  faster skill trainingbut with ccp keeping quite and they fully programed the feature already there is no stopping this plex to train faster feature oh well
the big deal is that under the current system nothing is generated when you sell plexes all the rewards ie isk you receive for trading a plex to someone were brought into the game through proper channels and then given to you if plexes could be directly traded for a remap that would essentially generate a reward ingame for real life money
wrongyou can put a maximum of 15 points into any attribute for a remap regardless of how often you remap you can only put 15 points into any attribute if you do put 15 points into one attribute youll only have enough points left to put 9 into a second attributecreative shuffling of neural remaps will allow someone to plot an optimum training plan to fly a battleship a week earlier with the skill training plan over 2 years evening out with someone who stayed the patient course training all the intmem skills in one block then remapped to perwil for each different optimal plan add another year for the break even if you want to do a chawil for leadership and trade skills add an extra year to the oneperyear remapping plan and youll break even the person who buys neural remaps is not buying sp faster than you theyre just buying access to skills and thus equipment or activities earlier in their training plan than someone who isnt purchasing extra remapsthe extra points added by implants and learning skills are irrelevant to the discussion of neural remaps
i think this proposal is blowing this way out of proportion i dont see any valid reason to be against plex for neural remapping except that it could open the door to a cash shop which i would most definitely be against besides that this proposal has no merit imonot supported
two thumbs up stop ccp now from even getting near the slippery slopebesides that putting it on sisi then not commenting on it anywhere is like trolling the playerslike its deliberately designed for the purpose of angering and insulting the players trolls of this nature are disruptive and do not contribute to the sense of community we want for our forums
correctyou contradict yourself you truly do not have a grasp on how this works you honestly think some who can remap a often as they want will not complete a year or two year skill plan faster than someone who can only remap once a year you entire argument is hinging on a skill plan that uses the same two attributes the whole year no one does thati would not say that because both amplified the difference between someone who remap once a year and someone with unlimited remap
dont go down this road ccp youre one of the few companies that has the integrity to stand by your playerbase and not screw them go down this road and youll be just like every other mmo company out there and you definately will not get any more of my money
wtf ccp

ok this is fairly simple 5 people are selling 12 units each of item x you want 7 prices are 750 800 899 900 950right now if you put up an order for x at 1000u you fill all the above orders immediately but pay 1000u instead of their sell order price this obviously sucks but so does making 5 separate buyssimply put it should autofill sell orders at sellorder price if they are under your buy at least for immediate orders as it stands its just a ui hindrance
the same thing happens with sell orders iircif you sell for 3000and there were buy orders for 5000  4000  3500 then you only get 3000 per unitit seems that the price paid on matches comes from the most recent order whether that be buy or sellchanging it to the oldest order may make more sense
this isnt an issue its a lack of understanding of how the market works if you treat the market more like a commodities trading center than a supermarket this actually makes senseperson x has agreed to sell widget a for no less than 800 iskyou say i want widget a and ill pay exactly 1000 iskthe system looks through the commodities for sale and based on those criteria you buy person xs widget at the price you agreed to pay 1000 iskif youre making a buy order youre obviously on the market screen already check the sell orders for prices lower than what you to pay right click click buy item enter a quantity and viola youve paid what they were asking and you didnt have to create multiple buy orders at allactually you get the highest price available in the system you are selling from check the range of the buy order before you try and sell something most of the really high paying ones are only system or station wide in my experience
as it stands i cant go to the lowest sell order and type the number i want it will only give me the amount theyre selling although thankfully it wont charge me for moregoing through a bunch of sell orders is just a pain in the butt and a waste of timeif it as you say works for sell orders why shouldnt it work for buyssupporting my own post
real men buy out the bottom 15 orders all at once paying the highest price for everything so they can do it in one operation having said that good idea supported if it can be done without a significant impact on server load

well worth doing
riveting idea chap

i do definately not want a safe environment for new players eve is not safe  it would be completly stupid to trick them that it was one of those systems should even be 00 so they can kill each other there as only frigatescruisers will be allowed it gives them a pretty equal chancei just want the new players to not feel so overwhelmed when they start playing a small goal to reach that you dont have to fly20 jumps to reach using autopilot also old players in eve are s  i want to give them a fair chance before they encounter them sorry if i destroy your weekendfun in harassing new players also i dont want the rest of highsec to change just the first week of playing  there is a big difference
jetison objectbookmark objectpull object back into cargo bay
doesnt work during warp and that method is just as slow as using people  placesi support this there is no reason not to implement it unless doing so would use up large quantities of development time which i rather doubt
ehh there is already too much stuff on the rightclick menu maybe make another drop down menu off it that would allow you to bookmark and be able to move useless things like lock target seriously who uses it onto that menu to make more space
it is annoying especially when timing it to the exact split second where i wont get a bookmark less than 1 au from the nearest celestial
bookmarking easier and one less window open supported
yes i dont know why this never made it into the game
could we also get the ability to hotkey bind that action pretty please
you can bookmark objects in spaaace why cant you bookmark your own damn ship people and places is cluttered oh god we need folders back and laggy supported
bumping and supporting please give your thoughts
oh god yes
very this i hate having to buy station containers just so i can figure out how much i can contract to my jf char it wouldnt be too bad but then you cant delete them for 2 weeks and assets window gets all ted up
whats a toon like a cartoon how did a cartoon switch your fleet position
1 you took a can from someone you didnt know in jita no less2 accepted a gang invite from someone you didnt know 3 didnt notice the session timer until it was to latenot an exploit you just fcked up welcome to eve
quoting for hillarity
to be deemed an exploit criteria one is that it is a bug this is not a bug but the way the fleet system works i admit i would never have thought of using the fleet system this way but that doesnt automatically make it an exploit unless the code itself is doing something unintended it sounds to me like everything worked the way it was intended and designed to work  he just used that design against youof course the only way to get a definitive answer on is this an exploit is to file a petition and see what ccp says
tell me something i dont know about pvp  fleet mechanics now
most certainly not an exploit if you dont want to be locked out of dock  dont join a gangfleetlast thing we need are shorter timers so that theres even more station hugging
how is this not an exploit someone is clearly using a mechanic for something that is unintended and doesnt belong into the context of the gameits not really a bug still its exploitable was the moonmineral thingie not an exploit because it was just as possible and within the game mechanics as this or the wormhole exploit the ecm burstaggressing of ships in forcefields because ofc thats not an exploit toobumping someone off a station or neutral rring is one thing forcing session timers upon someone else is something lots differenti can imagine just fine how almost anyone in this thread would ragepost on the forum too if he lost his ship that wayand lol at the guys saying then dont join a fleet its like replying gb2wowedit im not shouting for a fix or anything but just like someone said this is in the very dark grey area of exploit or not
when did inviting players to fleet and moving players around in a fleet to other squads being an exploit if the op is so stupid to accept a fleet invite from someone that is red to him then he deserve to die in a big ass fire for his stupidityofc if there had been a way to get the players into the fleet without letting them accept it them self it would be an exploit but hey he accepted the fleet invite him self its his own stupidityeveryone with some kind of brain would understand that by accepting a fleet invite will get you a 30 sec session timer automaticly so if the op had known this do you think he would have joined the fleet thenits all about understanding game  fleet mechanics here
nightmarexgo back to school and learn to read bud then read my post againhe changed my squad possion from member to squad leader and back to member wash rinse and repeat i didnt die from the initial timer try to keep upill also add that i took a can from a 1 man corp thats right a 1 man corp figure it out guys i would have added that at the beginning but this post is about something i had never seen not something people already know is an exploit
and you still had been stupid enough to join a fleet there is no finger pointing look into a mirror and you found who is responsible for your ship lossps whining here would not solve the issue at all you would need to file a petition to get an answer if this is marked an exploit or not but i guess from your whining you havent done that so far
ammo and charges are allowed so you can carry a combat ready ship thats one of the intended uses of an sma an itty 5 with rigs and expanders can hold over 96k liquid ozone carrying that much cargo in an sma is not an intended use it is the very reason the change to smas was made roll back the change completely or leave as is an exception for one item is pandering to a very small part of the playerbase
this was added to forcibly encourage people to use rorquals and later jfs when they were introduced not only is there is no need for it anymore but it doesnt prevent people using carriers to import minerals compressed as torps and suchthe ideal solution of course is to allow any ship with any cargo inside an sma provided it is not over a set limit ie 1000m3
i like that 1km3 idea too i dont know if ccp wants to change how it works but i think ill add that as an alternate possibility instead of using a whitelist for items because people often put weird stuff in their ships like exotic dancers and bongs and if they have to store their ships in a carrier the lovely ladies are left out in the coldliquid ozone is not really compressible and if you want to carry a lot of it as pos fuel in a carrier you still have to make a jf jump to carry all the other pos fuels too so i dont really see a whole lot of carriers gearing up to haul liquid ozo in mass because of this and if they do its still really inefficient
when are you at an sma where there is not a cha right next to you theyre the slightly more blocky ugly thing floating in space next to the huge ugly stick i hear told they have a bit of room in themsarcasm aside allowing ships with charges in them this makes sense you want to be able to respond to an enemy potentially before they jump through and having your different ammo types already prepared is a good thing this also applies to extra ships brought into battle by a carrier but for the liquid ozone how hard is it to keep some spare in the cha and spend 1 minute to pop it in your bayi see where you were going with this but i just cant give it support
with respect to your first item in the list afaik it already allows this provided your intended target is on the same grid as you are and your intended target is not in warp2nd item dunno if that would be helpfull maybe on short engaments3rd itenm could be usefull4th item i have no problem with
this has already been raised with the exception of the remove when killed option i assume you mean is in a pod because being podded reverts them to the off grid stateid rather the watch list didnt autoremove people and the ship type column option would make it unnecessary

ctrlclick already works this is an issue for the broadcast window and i think the broadcast window issue is more pressing than these watchlist issuesbut i agree with mazz and abdiel supported
yes please

i keep trying to think of reasons why this shouldnt be implemented but i cant i will say that im not sure why you would ever have two forreal characters on the same account rather than starting a new account every time you want to train a new character or to receive a character purchased from the bazaar but even so thats no reason not to implement thisso supported
crap i have to hesitantly support this i guess my biggest problem with this is the fact that i currently have three accounts with all three slots used on each and i actually use all nine of those characters if this were implemented i would most likely go broke
make it more easy and less expensiveif you start training on the 2nd char cut the training points of each char by 50

sounds good
instead of adding this option add a tiny 2d squares do not kill my client button see supreme commander for examples adding support anyway because some people have ty computers and this might help them
i see your point  with this in effect even players on highennd machines who would like to enjoy the visuals could feel forced to remove them in favor of better performance however i do not think this will be a large issue as a currentday computer can easily handle small to medium scale engagements even running fluently at full details in large fleets which are what this proposal is aimed to help with you have better things to do than enjoy shiny spaceship modelsi agree with the last point brackets shouldnt slow the game down as much as they do now however i have no issues when i turn off brackets for drones even if i leave all the other brackets off meaning the performance with brackets on or off is roughly the same and the thing that matters is the number of ships on the field flying with brackets completely off is nearly impossible because you lose all positional information the ship models are too small to be visible from the usual zoom ranges and there is no way to tell a friend from a foethanks for the support and for comments so far
although your suggestion is logical i doubt that ccp will even consider itjust imagine headlines of all major mmo related web sitesccps newest graphic engine expansion includes removal of ships
supported this would be very useful
supportedalso the timer should be shortened to 23h imo so you can jump somewhere one evening and can already jump over again the next day when you get home instead of waiting and spinning ship for 30minutes
i have highlighted the portion that makes you look like you failed basic english comprehensionas well understand that the t3 cruiser can be adapted to a multitude of situationsbut it cant do them all at one time and be good at them unless garmon has perfected an ecm cloaking probing bubblenulled 100mn ab tengu by now which wouldnt surprise methink of it in this fashion can you stick a lorry engine in a mr2 the mr2 is going to be faster than a lorry have cooler shinnies inside of it but is limited by its chassis size to engines of that size come back some day when some scottsman is running around with a f150 engine in his smartcar and well talk
at least be able to lock 6 the number that most t1 cruisers can
supported
supportedat least 6 targets for a cruiser sized ship
yet another op who has forgotten that were pod pilotsnot supported
there are other games that do this well and can do so because they limit the number of players to 32 or 64eve is not limited or instanced in this way reduced twitchtype immersion is the price we pay if it was feasible id support this but its notyou are hardly the first person to dream this up its not possible yet
flight simulator is that way not supported for the reasons stated above
helloi would like the option to set a system destination for fleet for example if i want my fleet to go to null sec to kill some scrubs i could type in say p3ene solar system into the chat box link it and then right click as fleet boss or fleet commander though there could be a new option set destination for fleet there could also be similar options for squad and wing commanders just in case you want one wing or squad to go somewhere else though someone in the fc spot could override those directions and a fleet boss would override the fc the route generated for the fleet would also be according to the fcwcsc settings which are prefer low sec high sec or shortest and override a squad members preferences in that wayif this has already been suggested please show me the earlier thread and i will discuss it in there
link it  right click  broadcast destinationfrom there on it should be the responsibility of your fleet members or you want to lock and fire for them aswellnot supported
while this certainly would be helpful for people who just cant pay attention at all i can not support a feature that allows someone else to mess with my settings
now people who cannot pay attention to the fleet channel might aswell leave the fleet cos those peole are usually the ones shooting when the fc already typed and screamed several messages to cease fireyour proposal would make fleetmovements lets say less complicated but thats not the way you want to go for fleet ops in this case you just have to pay attention to the fleet channel at least once to even get to know the destination of your pvp adventurenot supportedlax
is it so hard to set route settings that are logical for the occasion and watch fleet broadcastsnot supported already implemented in game features can and should be used to cover your suggestion
yes also be able to target for the entire fleet and control their modules and drones
some pvp pilots are smart enough to remember this is a sandbox game  they consider the source of those nifty t2t3 ships they like to pop
why
no they dont highsec missions have been nerved already enough the only way i would agree is if you have to grind so long for the ganking that you need as long as your victim to recover ganking a 25 bisk ship would mean shooting rats in low sec for that value about 25005000 times play your game in the regions that are provided for that and let the highsec missioners play their game other then that crying for ganking support by not getting concorded makes you worse then the meanest carebear accept eve for what it evolved into or quit its as easy as that
supported
id rather have a button to make it impossible to activate weapons or e war on fleet members but yeah 1
this
if the only issue is shooting friendly targets i suggest having the client simply drop fire requests at friendlies and only friendlies just after your primary blows up i like daisy chaining my artillery on peopleliang
supporting this as ive shot at friendlies every single time ive been in a rr gang pretty much
perhaps but shooting friendlies can be a vital part of eve when you want to kill your corpmates
this is a fantastic way to counter supercap proliferation1 all supercaps have shootable subsystems which affect them as they take damageelectronics affects lock range and scan resengineering affects capacitornavigation affects align time eventually disables jump drivedefensive disables local and remote repair modulesgang linksoffensive interferes with drone control and hislot modules2 only certain ship classes can lock these subsystemst1 frigatesassault frigates oh look a role for themtech 2  tier 3 sniping bs finally i can have a t2 rokh3 subsystems cannot be remote repaired but are made of shield and renegerate after a certain period4 supercaps can fit new modules to increase subsystem resistanceregeneration at the cost of missing out on their usual modules5 a refinement to the broadcast system  allowing fcs to broadcast a given subsystem target for fleet memebers in the relevant ships to focus on this all combines to provide a viable role for new players in 00 combat opportunity to give new roles to abandoned ship classesweapons and makes super capitals vulnerable to something besides simply having more supercapsccp could even incoporate this into the new player experience rookie pilots doing their part to take down multibillion isk behemoths after a few training missions disabling subsystems on npc capitals they will be ready to take on real ones in 00
this should work for history too because of the spam of primary in large fleets
i have been getting excessive lag since the update as a result i have had to go from the highest settings to the lowest settings and yet lag is extreme there for if the lag problem is not corrected in the future i will stop playing eve

youll notice on the propsal that it mentions character sales and seperated from selling plex with no other dialoguethe only problem i have with character sales is plex  as stated above everyone had equal oppurtunities and choices to trade chars before plex tamber
calm down and take a deep breath then reconsider your logic fall of your horse and maybe read what ive written and then think rationallypeople obviously have a problem with this system as you can see the reactions from players already what would you have rather had that we discuss this after it was implimented in game can you seriously discount so many players opinions so quickly or are you all consumed by your logic  this is what the csm and alternates are supposed to do  represent the players get their opinions and get them to vote why not go and post a counter proposal written for this feature and include all your logic and arguments for it for people to consideri havent used plex recently and my issue is with where it could lead not so much with the benefits you could possibly get if id wanted to make it completely biased id not have included or added the cons once ive seen all the evidence for and against i will vote and make my decision based on all the arguments and what everyone has said and feels the issues that i have with plex are outweighed by the benefits of having them ingame such as helping to slow down rmtand as yet i dont see why remapping needs to be done with plex  why not do it with isk or tie it to an existing completely ingame mechanic tamber
how much money would ccp be able to put in their pocket with that kind of mechanic
right so were both being irrational people did not write anything by in large but signed wtf ccp11 in response to this issue i interpret this as groupthink and herd mentality given the amount of uproar you suggested in your own posting i do freely discount any players opinion if it makes no logical sense if someone told you that buying regular unleaded was a terrible trajedy but buying premium gasoline was perfectly legitimate what would you say id say youre not being logical i agree what you should be doing as csm is presenting arguments facts and attempting to justify opinions of the devs with those of the players but you didnt do that here you took a clearly stated position from the very title you didnt open anything for debate you merely opened the topic with a suggestion that it be disapproved of and mocked this is extremely poor form on your part fristly im aware that you have used plex recently but thank you secondly in what way was your post unbiased are we going to argue semantics of just how biased is biased the issue you are trying to create is one that already exists that was the point i made there is no appreciable benefit to this system over the old method of more alt accounts you can argue that this is some intangible line being crossed by expanding microtransactions but you cannot pretend that the system for rl cash being turned into ingame advantages does not already exist
first nobodys unbiased and stop creating the strawman argument that tamber should be she represents the interests of the majority of players by her very nature as a member of the csm second stop equating popular support with a mindless horde mentality people have posted valid reasons both on this thread and on many others as to why plex for spremaps is a bad idea third pics or tamber using plex recently didnt happen
representatives of the public should not present their own personal bias wether or not they have one is their own business niether of you have a psychic link to the majority of players hell the majority of eve does not even read the forums and they certainly do not have anything to do with the csm im asking for a factual discussion of what seperates the current plex system mutliaccount playstyle and preexisting game mechanics from this new proposal to cause any negative consequence as a result of its launch there have not been many arguments to this effect what there have been are a high number of wtf signed insert rediculous hyperbole posts that have been in large part parrots of an obviously popular figures opinions you have been no diffirentso i encourage you to debate the facts as they are rather than try to take some kind of false majority highground the sooner you tamber or anyone else is willing to have that discussion the betterive made it abundantly clear that the socalled major advantage this offers characters is inreality a miniscule bump in training speed over what one can already achieve by training delegation over multipul charactersaccounts ive also made it clear that the correlation between money to spend on plex and appreciable benefit ingame already exists in many ways i would like to debate the efficacy of these arguments rather than the statistics of ones supposed constituency and the supposed opinions of csm members that i have not even seen to post on the matter yet
youre doing a couple different things at once which is pretty impressive you confuse bias with opinion bias implies she has some sort of malevolent tendency to present an intentionally wrong view of things tamber does not second you make the case that she is presenting only her own opinions judging by the 25 page thread in assembly hall she is not alone in thinking that plex for spremaps is stupidoh im sorry i mustve missed the part where you had access to the precise statistics about this while nobody has a psychic link to the minds of the majority of players and nobodys said anything about one before now what is out there suggests that you are in fact talking out of your cloacal cavitypass whatever youre smoking this way pleaseid like to try someso in your opinion something must be stupid if a lot of people agree about it okayi thought thats what this thread and the threads i linked were about preeeeeetty sure but i could be wrong those threads could in fact be about corynebacterium sepsisyouve made it abundantly clear that you have no intention of changing your views based on facts logic and any other outside stimuli short of a scantily clad exotic dancer thats about itwelcome to eve its a cold harsh universe and having fifteen bucks wont fix your mistakes
the debate about who has a finger on the pulse of the eveplaying public is just sad folivos im debating the issue and saying that you do not have statistics nowhere did i claim to have the support of popular opinon and a 20 flame thread about a sisi change well now hold the presses ive never seen that in all my years get back to me when youre ready to talk about the plex issue at hand and not debate mythical statistics and support based on a glorified troll thread youve offered absolutely nothing here but strawmen of your own and precluding any discussion with but you wont change your mind is the worst kind of copoutwelcome to eve by ccp where my irl cash already gives me a license to print isk and as many training alts as i want so keep on trolling if you like it will keep this post bumped and perhaps someone with the intellect to give a meaninful discourse on the matter will emergeso when this goes live can i have you stuff
u mad bro
if im mad can i have your stuff
1 youre still trying to change the subject rather than admitting you were wrong when you tried to defend the fact that a 9kill account is dishonestly being represented as a pvp main 2 this is really off topic and people can look at the linked thread anyways to see that as per the op bullies aka griefers were defined not as people trying to get other to leave the game but almost anybody who wardecd someone else who didnt want to be decd or how you thought it would be a good idea if corps could just pay concord to be wardec proof or where you alleged that it was hard corp sic griefers who were the ones telling others to htfu perhaps how you defined griefers not as those trying to drive other people out of the game but people whod farm corps who respond to a wardec by paying a ransom
daool is correct if one looks back through the usual suspects comments on ankgate pvp fundamentalism or this discussion of low sec misrepresentation is their stock and trade no amount of reasoning will change that you cant make the irrational reasonable even so far more read these threads than the few forum griefers who try to shout the loudest they may not contribute to these debates but they can see such posts for what they are  dogmatic intolerant and hostilea bitter screed will follow this post of course now that i have my very own personal stalker that is all to the good as far as i am concerned as it drives the point home cheers delilah
dont let the thread hit your ass on the way out
unfortunately i think that was just petulance not a you wont have me to kick around anymore mmm hmmmm figured out yet how you spend all that time pvping and yet somehow not flying a combat prober tackler dps ship logi same old same old people talk facts you make vague handwaving gestures about misrepresentation and then justsohappen to be unable to discuss specifics just like anks own words were smears just like everybody who plays a pvp game is a fundamentalist and people who point out how full of it you are are griefers loltrolling you sling insults and bull and then preemptively hop up on the cross moaning about how people might say something mean and grief you heh toss out the bait and then complain that you may have gotten some bites on that bait anyways get down off the cross its going to be winter soon and well need the wood you seem to have the same sort of mental issues that ank did now you think anybody is stalking you is the cia spying on you through your dental filling too two bits of advice first youre not important enough for anybody to care about enough to follow you and of course theres the fact that nobody actually is following you and its your own crazy paranoia that anybody can check by looking at the threads you post in and who posts in them with you and second when you start seeing a grand conspiracy of griefing stalkers when people simply point out your bull you need to up your dosage
not sure where i tried to change the subject i simply answered to a particular pointas for delilah my statement was any such pvp toon as i assumed she wouldnt be silly enough to point out obvious missrepresentations and trolling from a main ohhang onthats probbably just what im doing  if so then so be it although ive never made any statements of any pvp knowledge quite the opposite in fact though slowly learningas for the liked thread you again missrepresent it pattern much  you say a good idea if corps could just pay concord to be wardec proof when wardec proof was not never has been and never would be my position the position was merely to allow for the real life aspect of where money has supposedly allowed concord to look one way to allow a war that it should also provide the possibility of them looking back again and also dont assume a statement made that certain features be implemented are done out of a desire to use them never paid to avoid a war yet and never will nor docked up nor run from not everyone posts only in self interest
the point where you went from absurdly defending delilahs lies about her being a pvper to distorting your comments in another thread and trying to keep the conversation on that point instead perhaps how you still refuse to admit that delilahs claims about being a pvper were obviously false glad to clear that up for you as the one trolling and making misrepresentations is delilah and now you go figure you dont have much of a point of course yet again youre attempting to change the subject from the fact that delilah was lying when she claimed that she pvps and loves it but nice paranoia there a pvper has to be very careful about posting on the forums lest people pvp with them which would be bad ayieeeestalkers indeed pattern exactly someone points out something thats going on a few of the usual suspects furiously wave their hands while shouting look over there nothing was misrepresented and i already linked to the thread so folks can see youre not telling the truth for instance you just lied about something where i can quote the original thread let me guess your own words are a misrepresentation of your own words and im griefing you yes are you also afraid of stalkers
right because for all we know eves main problem is always having not enough new content as opposed to stability bugfixes and gameplay issues
uhm priority can be low or high funny you would be assuming that the csm would be asking new stuff to be made a high priority instead of pushing to lower the priority as compared to whats alread in eve that could use some luvin tmthe point is the csm should be providing that sort of feedbackissler
now i feel like wanting pizza 
you do realize that all of you who voted no for the pizza are not get reelected right
what you dont know is that we checked with ccp and the reply was implementing pizza delivery would halt all development on evethe reason for this is that ccp devs as part of their campaign for excellence would insist on exhaustive testing of the pizza delivery mechanics to ensure that they and the toppings were properly balanced given the number of possible pizza permutations even if we exclude pineapple as just plain wrong it would take years to properly test and would cause a tripling of the coronary disease rates in icelandafter much internal debate most of us realized that the vast majority of eve players have already demonstrated the ability to overpay for bad cold pizza and so the feature wasnt really needed
only me and deidra vaal had the pepperonis to stand up to the health food lobby and vote for what we believe in and what we believe in is pizza for we know what is in the hearts of the players what is in their hearts are in their stomach this csm has exposed itself as corrupt and compromising that it will bend to any smallest pressure like so many congresses and home owners associations no pizza for you eve players for the csm majority has ruled instead let them eat cake also condemning pineapple users as wrong is plain racist and not acceptable in a family friendly institution such as eve onlinealso i lolled
perfectly put
i remember seeing the capship for the first time so small1 on this
supportedjust about every extended fleet op is nonstop p0rn links anyway might as well make it official d though considering i had to edit this post to add a zero to p0rn to subvert the censor i think the likelihood is rather minute 
what would be the point of that ccp obviously isnt interested in devoting the resources to fixing any but the most trivial problems and that will go double for the summer 11 expansion compared to this upcoming one wod alpha  internet spaceships
and its attitude that determines what will and will not happen apathy is a great way to get nothing done
getting some feedback on how useful it was and how it might be improved is on my todo list based on the response or lack thereof well decide how to proceed
thanks trebor
mea culpa post was intended for the other thread before and i was informed after i posted it that the thread is lockedno  i dont think that trialists should be blocked from doing anything that would result in concord retaliation what i think is that ccp should do something about it there are many players who obviously know much more about the concepts i also have no idea how many trialists go directly into the lowsecpirate business i think not too many genuine one trial account is not always the same as a fresh new player to the game but if you have longer plans with an account you can pay for it right awaysuicide ganking should ruin ones career  but if you can do it without actually paying for an account you dont care at all of course its not easy to answer what should be permited for trial accounts  but then  even now you cant fly industrial ship i bet more ppl would rather fly indy than doing suicide ganks so even making all players invulnerable to trial accounts should work you can still kill trialist  and youll be punished trialist can still do other kinds of crime  steal stuff or shoot a gate  but he just cant do the suicide for profit  without any real punishment one nonpaying customer is ruining game for paying one if someone pays and decides to suicide me ok here i am 
im not contradicting myself over a 2 year period the person sticking to 1 remap to switch from intmem to perwil will achieve the same training goals as the person switching infinitely many times between intmem and perwil remapsat present we have no option but to use the same remap for 12 months if you plan carefully you can prepare a morethanayear plan involving just your intmem skills electronics engineering science for starters and a morethanayear plan involving just your perwil skills spaceship command t2 ships weaponsjust because you arent using a 159 remap for one specific set of skills for 12 months doesnt mean noone is doing it you are a sample size of 1 in a population of over 300k a sensible person will realise that after basic ship flying skills are taken care of many support skills and learning skills fall into the same intmem skill plan cap shield cpu pg ewar targeting etc so once you can fly a basic ship spend a year focussing on support skillsthe addition of learning skills and implants diminishes the impact of a neural remap on sphr the people who will lose the most when comparing one remap per year versus remaps on demand are those people who refuse to train learning skills or use implants a remap in this instance can add 200 to the sphr acquisition once you add learning skills and implants the difference in sphr acquisition is reduced to 50where an infiniteremap character will get an advantage is on training plans that involve switching between more attribute plans than total years spent training thus switching frequently between intmem and perwil gives an advantage in the 2year timeframe at the end of which the 1remapperyear player will have caught up switching between intmem perwil and chawil gives an advantage in the 3year timeframe so you could be flying a command ship before your friend by the end of 3 years your friend will catch up and eventually be flying that command ship with the same skills for far less isk or rl money spent on remapsif one was to use plex for remaps over the course of a year to squeeze into a command ship faster one would spend about a billion isk on remaps it might be cheaper in the long run to simply buy a character off the bazaar with the appropriate skills already in placesome people are moneyrich others are timerich on the one hand we complain that moneyrich people will gain an advantage by buying remaps or characters on the other hand we complain that the timerich people are running missions all day so they must be macroslets be clear about one thing you dont have to be money or timerich in real life to be isk rich in eve selling remaps for plex simply means those with the smarts can build their isk fortunes and gain a temporary advantage over other players in the short to medium term
donUFFFDt introduce this f microtransactions in eve i stopped playing every mmo who do this and try to extract some extra bucks from me the end they got nothing from me

ok buddy you do your full year of nothing but training skills with the same primary and secondary attribute only i salute you for such dedication on never deciding to train anything else during that full yearhey guys my engineering skills are 1337nice what ships can you flywell um i can fly any gallente t1 frigate and shuttlesumm gtfoanyways you have fun with that
neural remaps via plex has little to no affect so this proposal is simple a waste of time tamber has exaggerated the effect and thus caused everyone to blindly give thumbs up i suggest you all do your own research before following some loud mouth csm member she doesnt even have all the details yet is raging about itnot supported
do not want
looking like a large mass of fail aheaddo not want
yes its so stupid having old jumpclones in longlost stations that you cant even redock at and to clear out my jumpclones list manually would cost me like 50 million in new clones
supportin
this idea has my vote
yes the current mechanic is stupid and cumbersome this is the way that it should work anyone who disagrees has never used any kind of market irl
subtle usability improvement i dig it
yeah
supported before the inline image gets yoinked
supported that would be a nice addition to the colortags we already havewould be nice to see the crosshair colored as well
supported
yes yes yesandneed i say ityes
the proteus electronics subsystem the cpueg at present offers1 low and 3 mid slots360 cpu with an extra 5 per skill level65 km targeting range and a scan res of 225 before skills with a sensor strength of 17i have been eft warrioring like mad trying to place this subsystem with a combination of other however i have found it completely redundant one of the other three other subsystems is always a better choice for what role you would like to fill if you want an unprobable command ship use a dissolution sequencer for the sensor strength bonus if you want to pve explore use the emergent locus analyser and the friction extension processor gives you long range warp disruptionscramble capabilities none of the fits ive been looking at require the ammount of cpu the cpueg offers and all the subsystems offer 1 low and 3 mid slotsi think this subsystem needs a dramatic redesign to something useful or an entirely different subsystem id like to discuss what these could be and the possible implications of such changesi think the first change should be that the cpueg should give 4 maybe even 5 midslots instead of 1 low and 3 midthis would give players who are designing a proteus fit who really want another mid slot an optionanother change could be that the cpueg also offers 50 mbit drone bandwidth and 50m3 drone bay this would give the proteus when combined with the drone offensive subsystems that magic 125 mbit drone bandwidthso what are some of the implications of these changeswell the pve aspect firstpotentially you could have a passive shield tanked proteus with a defence efficiency of roughly 600650 with 570 dps using 3x 250mm failgun iis youre also left with a 3 utility high slots t2 fittedanother pve fit would offer an active armour tank with a de of 450 and 630 dps with blasters dual webs and an ab perma running also with 2 utility highst2 fittedpvp possibilitiesthe shield gank would offer 830 dps and 868k ehp give or take depending on how you like to fit with 5x neutrons and 4 ogre iis with only a warp disruptorscrambler webmore tank would be possible if the cpueg offered 5 midsan armour buffer tanked pure drone boat would offer 730 dps and 109k ehp hardly out of this world performance youd also have 3 utility highs that youd struggle to fill with anything power hungryan armour buffered gank boat would offer 870 dps with 1136k ehp t2 fit with a spare mid for dual pointwebeccmsebo hardly utterly mentaldoes anyone else have any suggestions or can see something glaringly wrong with this idea and yes i know that you could potentially get 150 mbit bandwidth with this but that would only be useful if this subsystem let you also fit a drone control unit which to be honest isnt that mad either
win
ctrlaltb would be a good default supported
someone must have had a brain fart not to have already had this in the game
at least some csm think about it1 keep up the good work mates
another alternative would be to assign bookmark current location to a hotkey although this would most likely facilitate spamming since there is still some time investment required to right click  bm current loc
do i need to type something in here to just support
you can have several of my fives but not all of them
usually im all for reducing the amount of rightclick options in eve but this is one that would be really useful
this should have been in the client from day 1yesedit for thumbing

mazz is on a roll
my guess is this series of decent threads from mazz is some kind of huge metatroll but a good idea is a good idea
brilliant
i can read very good sir its just that you wont get it that its your own dumb fault that you lost the shiplike i say to many you have to start somewhere and start learning things i have been doing some very dumb mistakes in my noob days to and have learned by my mistakes and i hope you did that to this timewe cant just say something is an exploit because of someone doing a biiiiiiiiig mistake and gets blown upedit and can i ask you why you didnt just leave the gang instantly after you joined it or even better why did you join the gang in the first placewhat did you expect by joining it a nice buddy that can do level 4 missions with youif you had left it instantly after you had joined the fleet you wouldnt be killed then
he expected a fight as nice as it gets with neut logis and whatever may come the opponent stacking session timers is not something that could be expected from that
again expecting something that you dont know anything about cant just be taken as exploitnow the op have learned by his mistake i hope and i think he wont do that mistake again
which is the exploitative use of game mechanicsdocking in the middle of a fight to avoid losing a ship or continually rearranging the fleet in order to prevent a fleetmate dockingimho theyre both misuse of game mechanics
i just told you it was a 1 man corp you  i took a can from a 1 man corp with the ship sitting in front of me thats not stupid or dangerous if you think it is either you should man upnext yes i wanted a lil fight and nuet rr or not i wasnt afraid of the ship i stole from who by the way was shooting me for a good min or two while we chatted wich is the second reason i joined fleet to chat it up with the 1 man in the corp who had agro to me ohhh so dangerousand no im not whining grow up this thread was to discuss forcing a session timmer repeatedly with gang mechanics as they were not inteded to be used in that manner so do that instead of fail smackingkthxbai

what the title says including post with stupid questions and typoskeep flaming and giving dumb and unnecisary remarks to the roleplay forumsat the moment most post from capsuleers are full of crap replies that go oftopic verry quickly replies like these are just not needed keep polite and on topica good example is this post and the reaction of el liptonez

see my point i rest my case
im sorry some people have ruined you forum reading experience i can see you problem and i for one will make sure that the alliance im a member of will know of this problem and behave in the future if you encounter further problems please contact me in game and ill make sure the space police are in their ships and ready to give you and hand you might want to get a hold of the forum police and have them investigate yours trulyrastino cryptonym sleepers
this thread was doomed from the start so to speak honestly there are funny comments and there are totally useless comments i think an anthropologist should have a look at this behaviour cos this is how people start behaving when they dont have to fear any consequences i go as far as saying that most people who write such useless comments to get some attention online would never dare to do a similar thing in public  just because it would ruin your reputation now online your reputation is of no concerner cos you can always make a new account right just not enough intergrity out theremy opinion regards lax
u mad bro
no he came off more as amused then anything else
ahhh cool are you the linguistic professor then im so confused right now
as am i want to be confused together over a bottle of good whine at my place later
right now this upgrade is worthless no one uses it time to make a changelevel1  will create a wormhole to a random system2  will create a wormhole to a random system in a specified region3  will create a wormhole to a random system in a specified constellation4  will create a wormhole to a specific system5  will create a wormhole to a specific planet or belta lot of alliances have worked hard to clean filth from their regions it is about time they got something to keep hitting the fools no matter if they hide on the other side of eve
havent you been banned yet
quite often also noncorp members cant see inside or take from chas if i want to launch a cyno ship for another alliance member i need to  around with launching a can change overview settings to find it and put ozone inside and thats assuming the can appeared in transfer range of my ship  they quite often dont for larger capitalsabout as hard as keeping ammo in a cha its an extra and entirely unecessary mechanic that only serves to waste time and complicate matters it needs to go
whats that the dissenting cry of someone whos never owned or operated a carrier for anything beyond missionsshut up
also agree lo is used to fuel jump bridges as well so most of my ships have a quantity on lo in the cargohold as well that and the cyhoships end up being a real pain with having to manually remove lo before putting a ship in an sma and remembering to take the lo again afterwards
there are many people who deactivates their accounts for a period of time for various reasons then returns back to the game as we all know the skill points that could have been gained in this period lost forever and there are many characters with high character age and low sp level out there my proposal is to allow paying for the past months unpaid subscription fee for gaining those ungotten skill points please read the following q  a for understanding the scoop of this proposal better what is the benefit of this proposal ccp will get paid for the months the account was deactive and hopefully it will encourage more people to return and stay around longer also if any active player deactivated his account for couple months in the past he will be able to match his sp level to his character age how is this system will work deactivated unpaid months between the account deactivation and reactivation dates will be calculated and the player will pay regular subscription fee for these months either using plex or out of game payment methods ccps choice once paid the minimum amount of sp a player can earn for the given months will become available to the player please note that player will not be getting any learning skills or implement bonuses only the base skill points without any modifications since implementing this system into the client would be difficult it can be accessed through eveonline web site  under account management player will still be required to buy all the missing skill books before those skill becoming available to him over the webpage and he wont be able to assign any sp to a skill unless all the prerequisites of it are already filled nobody will be allowed to gain skill points higher than his characters age allows also this system will not be available for trial accounts which means if a person opened a trial account but never paid first months feeactivation fee a year ago he wont be able to use this service what about the people who stayed online and played eve isnt this unfair people who stayed and played eve will still have many advantages compared to this first of all since this system will not allow any sp modifiers the amount of sp a 2 years old character can gain will always be lower than other 2 years old characters who remained active due to affects of learning skills and implants besides if a player didnt pay for last one years fees he will be paying 1794 1495x12 only for the skill points while the player remained active got a chance to actually play and enjoy the game he made more isk made new friends and gained experience at the top of the skill points this system will barely allow old characters to come closer to the active characters of same age but he will never be able to match or exceed them doesnt this system encourage character farming people can just open an account suspend it and pay for all the skill points couple years later without bothering themselves with skill training que if this is the concern ccp can limit this service to credit cards and can bring one credit card can be used only for one account rule since an average number of credit cards each person owns is limited this would stop people trying to abuse system at bigger scales thank you for reading this proposal i am looking forward to hear your comments
absolutely not supported having active skill training is part of the privilege of an active subscription ghost training was killed some patches ago for this very reason it would ultimately hurt player balance and ccps bottom line
this tbhit will encourage character farming no matter how you slice it character for sale 25 million unspent skill pointsno thank you
nopewere all now dumber having read this proposal i award you no support and may god have mercy on your soul
one of the main problems of this proposal how many sphour do you use for the equationwho says your char wouldnt have lost sp to podding when you had actively playedthat said  not supported you didnt play you have no sp
ok you may not want to let the sligthest advantage you have to go as an old and active player even though it wouldnt take anything away from you and could have brought you more skillful players to play the game with but it can bring good amount of income to ccps wallet  which may translate into better development and it may encourage more people to return the game as well if they are willing the cover their unpaid monthsanyway it is a proposal thank you for reading and responding to it
i was wondering if there is a way to see someones afk on the alliance potriat and corp potrait so then i can place my self on afk status so people know im away from the keyboard 
should be interesting to have a light carrier with the only purpose to provide small roaming gangs new ship when some member are destroyedwhen i say light i mean cheap and with of course limited capacity something the size of a bs hp  manoeuvrability wise and same price with very limited number of high slot and a little cargo and a rather big hangar but nothing excesive i would say a hangar that could contain 4 frigate sized ship or 2 destroyer sized or 1 cruiser sizedthis way in roaming gang when somebody see his ship destroyed instead of being nulltoo ed of because hes in a pod and now he cant follow the gang anymore and must go back in a station x or xx jump away to get a new ship if its worth it to come back the light carrier could jetisson a new fitted frigate ready to use and then he could continue to have fun
oh sweet some developer must have traveled back in time and implemented this while we werent lookingi think its called an orca
read again or eventually read more than the title if u can
why does it need a new ship when a real carrier with cloak can do that job just fine
my guess is they want to be able to use jump gates not cynos and the price tag of the carrier doesnt meet the cheap request in the opthat said the orca does already do what you want  unless youre roaming in battlecruisers in which case pony up the cash for an actual carrier and deal with itnot supported
orca cost 300 m and is very slow i want something more able to follow the quick roaming fleet not something that will slow it an orca 400k hangar can hold near 15 fitted frigate me i want to lower the price something like say 100k to put 45 frigate in itorca can do the job for a fleet of like 50 guy the ship i want would be for team of 10 guys or such
lol you want something that can carry multiple ships and should be able to follow a fast roaming gang you dont really notice that this cant workeven a bs would fall behind after 23 jumps of burning so the first ship you would mostlikely loose is the ship with all your spare shipsthat said  a carrier seems to be the better alternative it can jump directly to your position and bypassing all gate camps once the carrier gave you the ships it cloaks uplogs off and you can continue your roamand i forgot to mention  the plan with the orca would work differently1 scout orca with cloak to a good strategic point in your roaming area eg through wormholes2 orca cloaks uplogs off in a safespot3 when ever you need replacement ships you log in the orcait helps if you scout the system to be sure you dont log the orca into a trap
seriously buy a carrier and have it cynoed in at a safe system or stop complaining that the guys you try to hunt kille some of your ships thereby ruining you perfect roaming gangin short harden the  upps the use of an orca work fine in wh
i saw these on the internet earlier today and i thought you lot might find them interesting for new ship designs
tbh scrap the watch list it only adds clutter to the interface that is already badeveryone on overview that is in your gang has hp bar columns problem solved that way you can sort it however you want apply tabsfilterswhatever use ctrlclick to lock etc
the issue with this is i cant filter the overview to show the fcs ship the scouts even offgrid and all the shield logistics in other words not nearly precise enough filtering for what is the watchlist supposed to do
true i forgot about having people on list to warp to and such stuff scrap my idea then p
i think this is exactly the right idea
it would be awesome to have this information in a column option like speedtransversal you could add to you overview would obsolete the watchlist for my smallgang needs signed
as it stands right now going thru jump bridges requires liquid ozone that is fair and all but to carry around all that requires far too much space and is a logistical pain in the rear i propose a remote liquid ozone module that goes in the high slot this module will allow the jump bridge to sincronize with what you have in a hanger in the same region and remove the liquid ozone from there instead to help balance this it would require 1015 more liquid ozone to activate the bridge possible roles to take it from a corp hanger would also be welcome
gtfo
as it stands right now alot of people are trapped with their caps lock on consuming alot of internets that requires far too much space and is a huge pain in the butt di propose a remote caps lock module that goes in your pocket this module will allow friendly players to synchronize with other peoples posting and reduce the caps in there das balance it would require 1015 more pro posting to activate possible other uses could also include remote emoticon reduction
when your idea is stupid you have to use bold caps lock to get your point acrossunderlining may also help in the future
your proposal sounds reasonable but it doesnt make sense from the position of ccp  as was indicated it removes the commitment of the player to keep paying for the account once a desirable training level is reached the based training of alts is nice but still significantly affects the game mechanics of the game if anything what i would imagine to happen  if ccp decided to do so  would be to give each account 100 skill point allocation either via each billing cycle or through some other mechanism allow the player to divide that percentage among each of the three slots so i can either train 3 pilots on a single account at 333 speed 1 pilot at 100 and so on i think this would encourage the use of multiple accounts since it satisfies our needs as subscribers to know that were achieving multiple goals i have about 78 pilots some dedicated some not its perfectly possible for me to consolidate to reduce the number of accounts i need to run but if i could distribute out some allocation of training speed it would certainly make keeping that extra account a bit more desirable
i would train my jump freighter alt to do market stuff like i should have from the start i would likely also get interceptors just for the sake of making instant warps also maybe get the nav skills up a bit
 yesthere has to be a better way than having to repack all amarr ships
this but only for unpacked containers containers that have not been assembled should not generate the warning as they cannot possibly contain items
definately multiple clones per stationregarding the timer imo make it depend on distance jumped
what people are forgetting though is that even if eve supported this theres about a second of background lag in this game at all times which would either make flying on a joystick a nightmare or in case client prediction was implemented teleports around the grid if the ship was fast enoughthus in eve this is not possible even if there were no bandwidth issues
agreed i will then proceed to buy 500 accounts train them all to drakes and apoc and solo own eve awwwww yeah
actually had this discussion in corp the other day several ideas that were mentioned would be having specialized drones  suicide bombers for lack of a better phrase that would be extremely expensive effective only against caps and require full use of the ships drone bays alternatively would be to have a dedicated ship class that is basically a very expensive suicide bomb ship that detonates against on the capital ship the pilot would most likely lose the ship and sent back to their clone or allow a special cap mod that allows pilots to relaunch for the cap ship the balance would be in the ratio of isk required to build up a fleet of these drones andor ships versus the cost to build the cap and set such that the use of these new mechanisms isnt a catch all solution to capital engagements but only utilized when the strategic nature of the op is of the utmost importance that the sacrifice is willing to be made
the yield for these exploration sites are very low and the tech 2 bpcs are mostly useless i suggest tripling the salvage loot and replacing the bpcs with something better perhaps tech 2 ship bpcs
this has already been passed by the csm and will be one of the issues presented to ccp ahead of the december summit
please dont conflate the concepts of pve player and carebear there are any number of hisec pvp corps who class as carebear since their playstyle involves very little or at least easily quantifiable risk such as the corps who only wardec industrialist corps in order to pad their killboards with a few hulk or hauler killsmission runners industrialists inventors market players  very few of these are actually carebears so much as income support for nullseclowsec pvp mainscarebears are the players who are riskaverse and will only engage in pvp when the outcome is predictable and ideally profitable

would be a good option
or have two target lists one for things i want to shoot the other for things in fact the things i want to shoot list would be a queue insteadso youd target things then add things i want to shoot to the shoot it queue then liangs daisycutter approach will work just fine as will the rr bs gangs rep some things but blow up other things approacha simpler version would be to allow dragging targets within the target list so your rr targets will always be the last things you end up shooting
you may want to have your handeye coordination checked there is some space between the reply to topic and new topic links
noand really why would rr not be usable you are receiving something from another source that is not impacted

pros there wont be a new ccp mechanic that allows some players to benefit more ingame than otherscons real money trading happens regardlesspeople with more money can buy and sell plex ingame and get an advantage alreadyccp has more plex to sellpeople can buy characters with iskthis feature could possibly help fixing skill messups and lazynessmaybe you read it againtamber
and this is the part where you explain why this is new when ive been saying the same benefits already exist through diffirent avenuesif i give you a dollar and the next week i gave you four quarters are you going to ask me why im giving you something new youre talking about two diffirent systems performing the same functional role and i have no idea how you can patently seperate the two without explanation
players can always mine more rat more run more missions whatever the ability to make isk via plex is not a different type of activity than making isk any other way it just differs in the specifics being able to pay for remaps however is 100 different from the other methods available eg shut up and wait a year
yes but you do get a remap on each alt every year and aside from the first year or so theres hardly a reason to remap additional times in the yearlong period since you can cluster likeattribute skills
remaps are always useful and clustering has its limits want to train up to dread v with racial capital gun v and all the jump skills to v its much more efficient to remap before each bunch of skills otherwise your years remap is only for the average of all the skills rather than one set either that or you can nerf your training potential and only train a specific primary attribute and leave lots of neat stuff till the next year
or you can plan for dread 5 capital weapon whatever 5 jump skills 5 before you create the character and optimise the plan for the 1 remap per year plus free remap the length of that training plan means youll be wandering around in frigates with maxed out jump capabilities long before you can fly the jump capable shipsall the additional remap option buys is the ability to fly the dread earlier catch up on support skills laterit will still take you just as long to get all those skills trained up you just get to fly the dread with belowpar skillset sooner
read it againif you read under the cons is quite specifically states that people with more money can buy and sell plex ingame and get an advantage alreadytamber
you clearly have very little experience in programming working with code cranked out by a four man crew in india or interfacing new technologies to legacy applications the dev blogs stated quite explicitly that evegate was a proof of concept where most of the work was done by their api development team to allow evegate to actually function as an interface into the eve gamei have had experience with code cranked out by a four man crew in india and ive had experience fixing code whipped up by some selftaught perl ruby and python programmers in about a month in all cases simply getting the code to be reliable portable and maintainable took more effort than was expended by the original authorsthe csm is not meaningless they are now counted as stakeholders by ccp to the point that changes proposed by csm have been incorporated into the game because the change was on a list prepared by csm even if one of the pending changes was accompanied by a ccp dev blog complaining about csm stealing their thunder just that one devblog invalidates all of bellochs bellyaching about csm being a meaningless pr stuntps yes were still waiting for that announced csminstigated change to make it into the game or rather waiting for it to be acknowledged in patch notes
it seems like this csm is working hard for some good goals not criticizing but realistically the csm does not represent what is best for the players they represent what is best for the players engaged enough to vote 87 did not vote average voter age was over two years when the average subscriber does not last past 7 months nor does csm represent what is best for ccp or the game i suspect ccps shareholders would be better served by more efforts on the new player experience lowering the learning cliff and retaining more subscribers but there is no constituency for that among players and especially players who voteyou make a good point that a collection of buffs shouted out from the forums does not make a coherent development strategy i see the value of csm to provide a sanity check that the designers are still connected to the customer base some companies fail because they are bad other fail because they are quite successful use their success to validate their decisions and grow out of touch with their customers the minutes seemed to show some surprise from ccp regarding player perception of excellence it would be very nice if each release ccp fixed most of what players consider most important bugs and regardless of what thematic plans the developers have for rockets or eafs or incursions there are things like fonts the pi click fest the poscorpsi user interface  that could be prioritized and fixed i am not saying they should use focus groups and usability labs like nongame or large game software companies do but it so easy for developers or players who have been playing for five years to not understand the frustrations  be they the grind of large alliance logistics or the confusion of newer players with some of the mechanics hell its hard to prevent them from launching into 2006 stories of walking to school in the snow uphill both waysthe csm can provide ccp some filtered feedback on these sort of issues
in my work on the csm while obviously i carefully consider the opinions of the players engaged enough to spend time posting on ah and emailing the squeaky pod gets the lube i also try and consider the effects on the silent majority and on new players in particular my impression is that i am not the only csm who does thisi have consistently argued that improving the npe and making it easier for noobs to get hooked on our drug of choice is just smart business for ccp and in the longterm interests of existing players that is one reason that i sponsored the learning skills and the ui lowhangingfruit proposals i made one brief stab at crowdsourcing a set of npe tweaks earlier in the summer but there was no response i will probably try to do it again after incursion hitswhile being an expert focusgroup is a part of what csm does though how expert we are is matter of personal opinion our primary focus is as an advocate for the players realistically the more input we get from the player base the better we can do this job
more players is good for existing players eves biggest strength is the social interaction so the more people in the game the more fun everyone is having assuming the nodes dont go boom more than any other mmo eve puts a focus on working together with other players which is why im amazed this element of the game is conspicuously lacking in the tutorialnpe
does a subscriber who drops out of the game drop out because the game is just that broken or because flying a speck around in a huge black field shooting at other specks just isnt their idea of fun gameplay perhaps they dont like the grind and the amount of actual work that has to be done to progress in this gamedoes a subscriber who has been playing for over two years have a better understanding of the spirit mechanics and fault of this gamedoes it make sense that the csm does in fact represent the player community since those who dont vote are obviously either happy enough with the game as it is or wish to remain unhappy with the game because they enjoy being miserable all those people who go to great lengths to proclaim how theyre not voting because they dont believe the csm will achieve anything how do you represent a playerbase who is already content with playing the game warts and all and are content to accept whatever changes ccp implementsthe 13 of the players who did vote consist of individuals who care enough about the game to want to have a part in determining the games future or of alliance goons who were ordered to vote their particular candidate in so the alliance could play the metagame of introducing new features beneficial to that alliance such as trading the billions of isk they have lying around from their moongoo profits for pizzayes its hard for players who are familiar with the game to identify with the frustrations of new players who are just coming to grips with the idea that you dont actually fly your ship in space by the same token its hard for players who are familiar with any game to identify with the frustrations of new players coming to grips with complicated rule sets which make the game more interesting such as for example four ones beats four kings in pokerthis is why the rookie help and npc starter corp channels are essential tools in the new player experience along with the excellent tutorials that have been set up through the career agents

is it too much to ask that any drone boat have this abilityhow about allowing 10 of the ships repping to extend into the drone bayso a sar i will mend 6 hp per cycle to a hob i thatd take about 20 cycles to fully repair the drones armorand if youre mending hull damage youd have to sacrifice a slot to fit a hull repper whether you need it yourself or not
yes
want a way to buy skill points
why not give the new players the learning skills pretrained to level 4 this should give enough training speed to make the starting easy but not remove the question should i train a learning skill to l5 and gain benefits in the future or should i go with a more immediate skillalso the older players who already trained them the hard way should receive the equivalent sp back a little bonus optional and the isk for the advanced books which might not matter for a 2 year old char but will make a difference for a 3 months old onealso not supporting the original proposition but the need to do something about the learning skills

this guy is like my heroand i agree with the ops thing too but that and this would just make my day supported
same at ogogov make a thread and jsut copy paste that ill support it
i think that the idea of 5 mid slots no lows and 50mbit 50m3 drone bay while keeping its cpu bonus would be the perfect solution to make this subsystem useful 1
sounds plausable     but then again 5 oger iis would be stepping on the ishtars toes 90 of gallente ships are armour tanked some can be efectivly tanked for shield myrmthere is also a ballancing issue within the t3 relm currently imo the picking order for t3 is somthing like thistengu best mission t3proteus epix gang pvp with good tank and gank at same timeloki 2nd epix gang pvp unrivaled speed and tracking dps lackinglegion good gang pvp epix locking speed massivly underwhelming dpsi think that all t3s need the 5th mod for each ss and the loki legion need a slight dps rework
maybe after the legion gets a bit of attentionalso unsupported proteus is good enough as it is
i agree that the proteus is a good ship what i am saying is that the cpueg subsystem is completely useless i am also offering something that could be done to change that this is a discussion about this subsystem not other ships
well the proteus already out tanks and out dpss all other gallente ships of equal size so i dont think that would do so much also the proteus costs 5 times more
of the t3s the proteus is my pick for pvp its got it all really dps tank and a 20km scram if you want it the cpu subsystem is indeed rather crap ive got a full rack of neutron iis on mine and im going a little nuts with cpu usage and ive still got plenty left thats the way it should be for any t3 ship of course given their price tag but it also means the cpu subsystem is a bit pointlessi would like to see it changed to something more useful giving it a drone component would be overpowered however its already the gankiest brawler t3 giving it the ability to use 5x mediums or 4 heavies with any configuration using it just makes it stomp all over the others and its already superior i think a better option is simply replacing it with a scan resolution subsystem like the legion has it doesnt add tank or dps just speeds up lock time i suppose you could make it have 1 mid 1 low compared to the other electronic subsystemsall that said the legion needs a look first the 10 cap usage per level bonus on all legion offensive subsystems needs to be replaced with a useful bonus the whole reason the legion has such laughable dps is due entirely to its complete lack of a damage bonus on half of its offensive subsystems and the other half getting effectively only 2 damage bonuses instead of 3 this applies to many amarr ships however the maller also needs that bonus changed to 5 rof or damage so its not exactly a problem unique to the legion
while the maps refuse to show it outer ring is dominated by player alliances by the looks of it its between it alliance and ev0ke hereby referred to as theyand by adding yet another bpo and a skillbook which is only available in 1 of 2 ore stations ccp is further lining theyre pockets they truck in bpo and books selling in jita for huge profits they camp all the gates collecting bpo and books from anyone foolish enough to try and sneak them out selling in jita for even larger profits no cost to them after all they are already making tons of money off the other bposo how about ore having once been a gallente organization establish some field offices in gallente high sec its been long enough i dont think theyre in any danger of being reclaimed by the gallente federationrp blah blah blahput some more offices up particularly in places we can get to without dying several times over in the attempt
use a cov ops or preferably a t3 with interdiction nullifier and covert ops subsystemmake insta undock at station you want to buy it hint do it before the expansion buy stuff undock use insta to get rid of possible bubble camps that is also why a t3 is handy after that just travel back if really paranoid make sure you got a black ops in system you need a cov opsrecon to get it there via covert cyno after using insta undock go to the black ops let him bridge you back
i was wondering about this my self how do you justify doing what they are i support the op
right orgo to xyz system in essencesinq and buy it
this is cute if you want to have fun  look at the distribution of technetium moons and wonder why nanotransistors are just going up in price since the change from dyspprom 
loli think youre looking for this thread
not really  but i found it funny that you whine about a few skill books compared to billions from technetium moons 
billions in moon goobillions in bpo sales noctis covetor rorqwhatevertroll score 110sorry
is it really that hard to go there on your own and buy it yourselfalso heres a hint buy more than one and sell some for those sick high profits
1 how many blueprintsskill books do you need to sell to make a few billions2 everyone with a bit preparation can easily acquire the blueprintsskill books and haul them to empire as mentioned in the post 2 alreadyi would highly doubt that those stations are camped 237 well maybe the first few days after the patchso the accessibility is not really hinderedbut keep your conspiration theories comingps i think i would make the run with a covert ops  redeemer 6000 m3 redeemer can hold a lot of blueprintsskill books and bypass most gate camps
spelling police they fought and died for cloud ring why should they not be allowed to profit you want convenience pay the price
oh so fight in a fleet battle or twothen guaranteed trillions in profit for the rest of your gaming careergot it
so getting rid of the other afk isk making moons worked pretty well but you just made a new bottle neck that is getting worse and worse 80 up in price over 3 monthsmy solution for this would be to open wormholes for moon mining its already proved that pos take downs do happen and it would generate more good fights if there was a reason to fight over your pos rather than go i dont care any way
the problem with wh moon ming is that there are too many wh moons making them mine able would totally crash the market and t2 ships would cost probably less than t1 ones lol
there arent enough moons in wormholes to do that doing this would finally open the mining of worthwhile moons to people with less than 10k allies i dont see any reason not to do ithowever at the same time it is not exactly a fix the issue is a completely fixed supply for the worthwhile moon minerals hell it might even drop with increased demand due to being more time in reinforced with an ever increase in demand that is just a terrible idea
right now fail alliances that are mad because they cant hold a single system are purposly targeting easy prey by hot dropping super capitals on them this is game breaking and needs to be curbed nowi propose that super capitals can only jump to a super capital cyno generator this means of course that a new module needs to be introducedsuper capital cyno generatorpg 750cpu 250base liquid ozone usage 1000slot high slotcapital cyno generator can only be fit on a battle cruiser or larger ship each level of cyno theory reduces the liquid ozone consumption by 50now if someone really wants to drop a super capital they need to really commit something instead of doing ultra risk free pvp not sure about the fitting requirement on pg and cpu but it should be up there so a ship that fits the cyno has to commit a large portion of its resources to fill the role

actually there is a thread on the internal pl forums that basically says i will raise your pet issue to the csm if i dont think its stupid and i just went down the last few pagesmazzilliu public servant defender of the public good
is that all you have to say about bookmarkshow about overhaul the whole system so you can give bookmarks to corp mates without having to jettison them as an item or even bookmark a place that you arent at in space somewhere inside the solar systembut yeah i guess this post is a good start
id prefer a shortcut tbh rightclick menu can be cumbersome enough if you have lots of spots in system already and stuff like clicking capacitor is hardly intuitive
god yes
supported but only if ccp reorganizes the right click menu into something usable read bookmark current location should not be placed next to self destruct
this would make game better so they wont do itinstead theyll nerf autocannons or something
and now explain why you joined the fleet in first place thank you in advance
inviting people to gang only to exploit the mechanics like gang warping them to a sun or other celestrial because they lack the skill to kill them using normal mechanics has long been needed to be changedsupporting
again what does this one man corp have with this freaking case to do when its all about you joining his fleetdoesnt matter if the corp have one guy or 5k guys you joined his fleet and did a big ass mistakebefore you explain to us on why you joined the fleet your on deep waterand also explain to us why you didnt left the gang right away if you did know that the fleet boss can move you around to other squads
the idiot accepted a fleet invite from somebody who was killing him everyone knows that when you join a fleet you cant dock for 30 seconds its also common knowledge that every time your position in a fleet changes you also cant dock for the same amount of timeif you are that dumb to give some one who is actively attacking you the power to prevent you from using a station or star gate you deserve what you gothell you might as well join his one man corp so he can shoot you on sightedit the only thing that was exploited was your own stupidity op
dear csmi would like to petition the council to allow moon harvesting in wormhole space it seems that ccp wants t2 ships to come from low security space but i dont think allowing moon harvesting would negatively impact the economy or give any pilot or corp an unfair advantage please let me know what you thinkthankyoustratologeo

griefing is against the eula yet it is very prevalent especially in empire space what can be done to combat it
please give your definition of griefing and attach your story that prompted this thread so we may laug err compare notesno seriously what most mmos consider griefing may not be what eve considers greifing
in this game griefing pretty much means taking extraordinary measures to abuse andor harass a player or players over an extended period of time ccp most likely decides whether or not an activity qualifies as griefing on a casebycase basisyou have to try really hard for what youre doing to be considered griefing though frankly its a bad term to use in the eula since ccp allows many actions that are griefing according to the standard definition of the word
dear csmsomething has to be done about the amount of help neutral pilots can give to other pilots of corporations at war corporations declare war on other corps so they can pvp in hisec which is fine except they use their neutral alts in battle to repair themselves these neutral pilots cant be attacked because concorde will intervene and they cant be made a war target because they are a member of an npc corporation it gives anyone with the money to buy multiple accounts an unfair advantagei recommend that any pilot who aids a corp member at war during a skirmish in any way that increases the fighting abilities of that ship be temporarily flagged as a war target for the opposing corporationlet me know what you thinkthanksstrato
i think youre either stupid or trollingtry reading up on combat mechanics before posting again
with remote repping this is already the case as soon as someone rrs your enemy they will turn flashy and become fair game not sure about other remote buffing modules tracking enhancers and such i do know that having a neutral command ship with active links will not be flaggedof course if you do attack the now hostile neutral you wont get very far as rring does not constitute as aggression and they can simply dock up or jump through a stargate whenever they want to ie when their tank starts to failthis is the cause of many a proposal here in the assembly hall as well as the features and ideas discussion board the proposals more or less saying that rring should constitute aggression to prevent nasty dockinggate games and such the matter has yet to be resolvededit and none of the above is considered an exploit just an fyi
apparently it is tooooo hard for new alliances to get into 00 so i guess they need a crutch to get those baby feet into the poolchange the anchoring and onlining time for an alliance that is less that 30 days old by 25 that way they are not too cowardly and will make an attempt in 00now there is no more excuses on why people still cower in high sec too scared for real pvp

did somebody call a troll
lolanyway im kinda sick to death of trolls especially cromo effect cant we just ban him already

where is everyone if you can think of a better use for the wormhole generator then give feedback
your threads hurt my eyes btw stop trolling with your altban cromo effect for severe trolling support linked thread and ban him
oh my godthat things back i couldve sworn cromo effect would have been banned from the forums by now
yes
definite quality of life improvement for cyno ships
the fact that noncorp members cannot pull out of a cha is not the issue and adding liquid ozone to the list of appropriate items to be stored in a ships cargo while in an sma is not the answer i will refer back to a previous example with the rigged iteron being packed with lo thats not an intended mechanic and would serve to shrink eve even further you would have an extra 30k worth of fuel to jump very far distances very quickly i think that logistics should be tough to manage and if you need more fuel to get where you are going then you should invest in black ops and transport shipsas to me not using my carrier outside of missions well i dont run missions and i most certainly dont use them for anomalies or complexes but that doesnt really have any bearing on the discussionccp changed this mechanic for a reason that i happen to agree with and while it may make life easier this change is not necessary
no one is trying to do this there is even a post above asking for the limit to be changed to a set 1k m3 instead of using an arbitrary whitelist of items actually i think you might just be trolling  no one sane would suggest the use of black ops bs and transports to move ozonei think the most ironic part is that people still use carriers  iterons to import minerals compressed as citadel torps ccps mechanic does not prevent that at all yet its exactly what it was introduced to stop
there are much better options available if you use a jf fyi
well i guess where i live in crazyland its not insane to use transports to move fuelim not trolling and my ideas arent completely unhinged i would just rather not see lo in smas there is a fuel bay inside of carriers specifically for the purpose of holding fuel and if you are staging caps at a pos then you better have a cha thereand just because there is one exploitable mechanic by bringing in torps and melting them does not mean we need another one
is it just me or all the supporters from goonswarm edit well all exept me one problem i have is that people will just cyno 50 supercarriers on your 5 man bs gang from fuel stashes in pos wait people are already doing thatactually i see no reason to not allow lo inside smas its put them in there or just leave a ton of iteron 5s inside the poss bubble shield and cuase lag
i even thought there were some people dislike it
truesorry didnt see the last post
hicurrently if there is something for selling 599999 isk and something for 6000 you will always get the cheaper item i think the only reason for that is the server load you would have if you can choose the seller of your choice if i click the 6000er item and want to buy it the guy with the 599999 sells his item to you for 6000 this imo destroys the market i think i want to be able to choose of whom i buy my stuffoh btw for me its not the 001 game which sucks the people who do the 001 are imo more feasible cause they dontt destroy the market prices the guys who go from 35900000 to 15900000 cause market prices crashes
translation selling isk is too hard now because i have to fly to the ass end of the universe to find a station to buy that unit of tritanium for two billion isk make it so i can do it from the comfort of jita ploxthank you but no
what is this babbleopen the market and shop for item xwhen you see one you like look over to the  right of the price tag and itll show you where that item is locatedthen you buy it and it will appear in that location waiting for youif youre talking about placing buy orders and having people in odd places then limit your order to a few jumps or to a specific station
no its not about bringing stuff to jita i havent seen this post
thats a bit more clear but stillif you are making a buy order which will sit for 89days waiting to be completely filled then you get to specify how far out you are willing to travel for goods if you select just that station then you will only be buying products located in that station if you select the whole region then anyone could sell you stuff from anywhere in the regionif you are talking about real time shopping for items then just make sure to choose the items that are located where you want them to be if someone is selling an item for 750 but its deep in camped 00 space and someone else is selling the same thing for 900 in jita you have to decide do you want to pay extra for the safety or pay less and risk dying
what possible reason other than insanity could you have for wanting to pay more than is necessary for something afaik the situation the op describes only happens when multiple sellers are in the same station
just a mecanism to be able to refit modules in spaceability to offline fitting modules from cargo and onlining the ship in space timing are about to be discussed ie i have many modules in my cargo and i need to switch some of them no stations outposts or ship array aroundso i can offline my ship it can take 15mn to do it then i can refitt and i can reonlining the ship it could take another 15mn to do thatso during 30mn your ship is defensless for refitt is it interessting 
1 pos with ship maintenance array2 orca3 plan aheadrefitting modules isnt like changing a tire its like replacing the motor its like climbing out onto the wing of the plane to replace the wing of the plane
refitting is a valuable resource within eve so planning ahead andor setting up infrastructure should be required for itthat said  it shouldnt work without either stationpossmacarrierorca

so with the amount of super capitals these days being fielded and with most alliances able to field 10 super capitals at a time it has come to the point where keeping 10 super capitals pinned down by hics and dictors has become nearly impossible so my idea is a capital interdictor which can create a 75km bubble so basically covering a battlefieldso why so large a bubble well when you jump in caps they literally bump everywhere so having such a large bubble will prevent a lot of them being bumped out of the bubble also i would like to see these ships be able to survive a direct doomsdayamarr capital interdictor5 high slots 4 guns 1 capital point4 midslots7 low slotscaldari capital interdictor6 high slots 5 launchers 1 capital point6 mid slots4 low slotsgallente capital interdictor5 high slots 4 guns 1 capital point5 mid slots6 low slotsminmatar capital interdictor5 high slots 4 guns 1 capital point6 mid slots5 low slotsbonus for all these ships should be 10 bonus to the armor or shield hit points and 5 reduction in cap usage of the capital point module
how will this survive 10 doomsdays and 350k dps and the 30 heavy neuts attached to itintroducing new super caps is completely stupid in the current state of supercap fleet sizes fix momstitans including their log off timers tbh and bring the paperscissorrock concept back in because right now one part is really missing
does not need to survive 10 when most alliances would field at least 10 of them so even if it could survive 3 dds it would be good also its not a supercapital just a standard capital

the sc epidemic is not solved by new ships we need to fix the ease of mobility issue and find a way to bring dreads back into the game the chic was interesting for about 20 minutes
1 this doesnt help in lowsec  scs are still broken there2 it will be abused and unbalanced in situations outside of supercap warfaresupercaps are fixed by tweaking supercarriers to be less effective vs subcaps such as limits on their numbers of regular drones or range of neuts and by buffing hics hics were introduced as a ship capable of suviving the old aoe doomsday but it has not since been rebalanced for holding massed supercaps with more hpnot supported
since last expansion there is this bug when u hit jump on a gate for some kind of reson it gives a session change timer while it isnt needed this happends in random situations where there are none or 100 people in system where u jump from and to this bug become only more worse when the load on one of the two systems is more heavier in example because there is a fleet there the session change timer makes u wait from 4 sec upto traffic control message 20 sec why am i posting here and not filling a bug report apperantly bug reports are slow and devs are actualy reading this section carefully there is nothing more annoying than gettting jump after jump the timer it interrups fleetfights form 10 to 200 people and splitting up gangs this is a bug that makes people think this game is brokenplease hotfix this bug i am sure it is connected to other lag related issues

working on teck post check back later
a full size carrier has only 1m m3 of ships available how much do you propose a light version would haveadd a slot and modifier module to freighters to allow them to haul 2x m3 worth of assembled ships guessing the planck stabilizer takes up a lot of roomadd a small 2x frigates maintenance array to black opsthere is your solution else use a carrier
and you dont consider the contradiction a problema change causes xb x already existsso what was the point of that i know its just unrealistic of me to expect you to explain yourself but ive got to wonder what aside from a hand in keepin plex price low is your angleyou asked why not for isk aswell and uh im just dumbfounded by that you do realize that plex and isk have a preexisting relationship yes
you forgot the bit where the change would cause morex and not distribute x evenly
its listed so people can consider this issue before making their own decision on the topicyou seem to be so caught up in your logic that you miss the reason why people dont like this in the first place the benefits from this feature are small but its where it could lead that could be an issuethere is two parts to thisis the fact that there is already an existing mechanic ingame that allows people a legal advantage a resonable reason to allow another that does the same thing albiet with possible lower impact if this feature comes in will the next microtransactional feature be allowed also and the one after that and the one after thati dont currently use plex nor have i looked into the effects of them rising in price although i have been watching some peoples plex posts on the market forum as there are actually some useful people in there from time to time i also havent made up my mind on this subject as youve probably noticed i havent posted my vote yet although this will be irrelevant  if i get to vote on this topic in the next csm meeting i will be voting with the majoritytamber
the underlined part proves that csm is a pile of junk anyone i know was pleased and excited about the upcoming incursions you obviously dont represent the players of eve anymore since ankhe left this sad bunch you became totally useless i hope ccp removes the csm soon and uses the money for more meaningful things such as the designing of a second beer ship for oveur topic i agree the black ops desperately need an improvement my favourite suggestion is a star map navigation without cynos and the need of cyno alts chose destination on the star map and the ship will land at a random point in that system or next to the sun
get the flying  out of here seriously anke did not leaveit was removed due to nda violations and being a general useless and take your ridiculous bobs idea elsewhere as well re somewhat coherent eveuni dude commentarywhile i respect eveuni and have often steered lost pilots to uni doorsjust leave this one alone eh whiteknighting where its not needed and inappropriate just gets you flamed
i disagree totally and if youll read on i will explainthe csm have raised a huge amount of player requested changes to ccp over the last 2 years some are pve some are pvp others are quality of lifeso when we heard that ccp had already committed to producing yet another new game mechanic instead of fixing the existing but broken ones we had a duty to stand up for what the players had requested this isnt a pve vs pvp issue even ankh was arguing for dev time to be spent on improving the existing mechanics instead of creating new ones the overall mood was that ccp have a history of implementing half finished new shiny content which is never completed and is left to rot epic arcs fw cosmos new sov etcthat isnt to say that the feature will not be good just that the csm were united in pushing for the existing mechanics to be fixed as requested by the playersi dont like this idea at all having to sneak a covert cyno fitted ship into the destination system is about the only real limitation on bridging right nowyes they are short range which could be looked at but can be worked around by bridging to a closer staging system and the bs themselves could do with a bit more hp but we are now seeing people frontlining remote rep black ops groupsi would quite like to see all blockade runners gain a second highslot and the ability to fit a covert cyno which would enhance their use as a fuel tender also allowing people to drop fuel into but not be able to take from the black ops fuel bay would be good
i am starting to wish i had never started this thread because of the sheer amount of annoyance generated mr dazeby your logic a titan should be tethered to a ing freighter to do what it does fuel tenders jesus  ing christyou knowits a good thing that ccp pretty much ignores lolcsm suggestions and the general public at large editwhile i really enjoy eveand still pay via sub to support the devsjust want you dudes at ccp to be aware that i will not be remotely interested in emodouche vampires online just thought id mention that in case you were totally losing focus and interest in evesometimes the bird in hand is better than the two in the bush you will never catch eh
im not comparing titans to black ops but even so a titan does need other ships to fuel it up at some point but it does have a far larger fuel bay for various reasons ccp decided the bo bridge should use fuel and if you want to go roaming with a bo gang you have to make allowances for that if you can make a case for that restriction to be removed without making them op then feel free to make it im happy to discuss bo ships because i am one of those supposedly rare people who fly them lotsmy suggestion above assumes that fuel will remain a requirement and that the fuel bay will never be big enough for some gangs im certainly not happy that i need an industrial char following the gang around but it does seem fair considering i can light a covert cyno and bridge into any 00 or lowsec system i like without being detected or cyno jammedas i said happy to discuss various ideas and there are a couple of proposals in the backlog so it should get addressed at some point
tldr retain flavour of lowsec leaving mechanics unchanged increase target density and likelihood of pvp encounter off empire gates by normalising population densities in the three types of spacethats actually not a bad synopsis apart from the first and last parts and the latter part of the middle could use work my suggestion would indeed turn low security space into a lowersecurity version of high security space thank you for clarifying this for those who mightve joined us late or otherwise missed my postapropos of nothing i did a pre dt tour of genesis lowsec with this toonother than a couple of halfhearted gatecamps on the empirelowsec interface i saw not a single soul not one in 9 jumps now granted im not a grizzled veteran with a list of killmails as long as my arm but i think this lends weight to the assertion that lowsec in genesis in my tz is a howling wasteland a hive of wasted cycles and rack spacealso when did they take the guns off billboards anywayive done some more thinking and suspect that ive a solution that should please everyone normalise the number of highlow00 systems exc inaccessible bits of null obv to maintain the same population density in each of the three maybe also bin gate guns since you can kinda permatank them they dont really achieve much of anything beyond irritating peoplelowsec retains its unique flavour and benefits from a higher target density simultaneously comparitively crowded space would get more systems lowsec mechanics are unchangedhigher target density in lowsecgreater chance of a pvp encounter either roaming or campingcome to think of it get rid of all the lowsec mins too that way we wont get threads constantly cropping up where carebears clamour for wholesale changes to lowsec that favour them at the expense of everyone elserun the normalisation on a monthly basis so if more toons migrate tofrom space name space name growsshrinks to keep the population density about the samei think that everyones now happy pvpers who dont want to get involved in null get bigger fights more often empire carebears dont get an excuse to visit null get blown up and jump on the forums to complain 00 just keeps trucking also the line in my original about concording sc was only written because i was thinking about sc farming of faction navy drops it wasnt and isnt my intent to have scs declared persona non grata in lowseceta dont like my suggestions omg sowoti as i said the first time lowsec and every toon in it can biomassemoquit for all i care im just making suggestions to salvage wasted space
no my description of your original proposal was 100 accurate your new proposal is worse however to begin with population density isnt determined by the number of systems nor is population density in and of itself a goal gate guns also eliminate the utility of ultrafast tackle landing the first point but the point remains that normalizing systems accomplishes nothing if people arent using n lowsec systems now theyre not going to use n3 or n5 the issue isnt the number of systems to say nothing of the utterly nonsensical mechanics youre proposing what established systems are going to be removed from regions the poss assets etc will just have to transitionbe lostwhatever new systems will just spring up randomly you were also looking into the wrong patch of lowsec check areas of high fw concentration of pipes like from purjola to the drone regions the fact that youll find people there is a good hint as to the direction lowsec can take people not using space is not in and of itself a bad thing its not a problem trying to solve something thats not a problem isnt a path thats worth taking making lowsec space into something thats worth holding is one issue artificially trying to balance populations just because is quite another
there is something you need to remember about low sec its not just what you can or cant do its how you play it is true that most 10 players will spend the majority of time in low sec systems but others wont stay there 237 many other players will go to low sec to do something but the return to high sec for other activities or just simply dock up in a station and go afk what i am trying to say is the low sec may seem less used than it may be i personally rarely dock up in low sec i will usually head back to high sec for thattake high sec for example you can pop your head into a high sec system and you might see 120 in system a quick tour of the stations you will find that 80 or more of them are docked im not just talking about trade hubs keep moving around systems and often you will see the same thing low sec doesnt quite work the same way
this is very true a lot of corps particularly ones in the factional militias will spend most of the time in high sec and only venture out for roams doesnt mean they dont have an effect on lowsec though
it also shows the nature of the beast in lowsec theres often not a reason to put down stakes and claim a patch of dirt other than to temporarily camp a gate or hunt belts to get some targets before a bigger force notices you and tries to farm you unless and until theres a reason for people to set up shop in lowsec and park there for a while theres really no change that well see the best we can do is to herd targets into pirates guns by forcing people to travel through lowsec but thats an artificial and kluged solution if however there was an actual point to holding lowsec space say fw participants who claim space in lowsec earn discounts on pos operation costs and earn loyalty points or what have you pirates earn the right to fire on anybody who enters a system without taking sec status loss drug manufacture clouds are moved from isolated pockets of nullsec to lowsec etc then there might be an actual reason for corps to make a claim to space in lowsec because after all if people arent willing to value the space and fight for it youre not really going to increase the number of people who want to be there and be fighting
1 to this idea
good god yes been living out of a pos for over a year and damn those things are annoying

great list of improvements fully supported
great idea
convenience in my eve surely notsupported though
oh yes please please please this would be epic
 thought this proposal sounded familiar still supporting
oki see lots of you made your bed now lie in it replies thats cool i can respect that but again i was kinda looking for a way to retain some people who after a few months of playing the game come to the conclusion after really starting to understand the complexity of this game that they want to head in a different direction id rather try to keep them happy then watch them leave my main arguement is that you can be really useful with a few million well placed skill points and you could also be next to useless with 5 million poorly placed skill points one time only skill remap with say a 2 million sp cap for the newer players would be helpful after all it might take sometime for a new player to find their way into a decent corp with the vast knowledge base that the player owned corp can provide being able to remold these new guys and set them down the right path and make them more useful and able to contribute in a meaningful fashion i think would go along way to keeping them in the game i say let them get into the game a little deeper before we lay the ungodly smack down on them there will be plenty of time to watch them suffer laterlol
i say this every time someone proposes this or the whole let us buy skill points thing and the reason is not thats the way its always been the reason is that quite simply unlike other games like wow in eve the choices you make have consequences  more importantly they are persistent consequences and they follow you throughout your evelifeand thats the way it should be
theres another good reason not to implement anything like thisif you could redistribute your sp on a regular basis you could simply learn high rank skills with maximized efficiency like racial carrierdreadnought etcand then once a year simply push your points where you need themi think this would be an unfair disadvantage to people who cant afford those skills
yeah it would be cool to introduce this mechanicccp is all about correcting your noob mistakes as evident in the neural remap mechanic that was introduced a while agoalthough make it come with a steep cost or limit it to lowsp characterslike a character that has less than 5 000 000 spor only redistribute a percentage of your total spor let you redistribute at will although skills cost 30 more when you train them by respec since sp really is one of the few things in eve thats hard to regenerate that cost alone would deter many people from swapping all over the place at least in the more expensive skills department
not sure if i heard correctly but i think plex were being used to remap as well as give game time on the test serveri may be wrong but its worth a look into
if youre trying to target someone as you come out of warp  as they come out of warp  as they undock youre often going to be spamming control click at them on the overviewproblem is this makes you approach them because it registers as a double click which isnt always what you wantsuggestion make holding now any shortcut key including the new ones that were introduced on sisi to warp orbit align etc disable the double click to approach feature
massive support for this capslock is even needed for this occasioncant tell you how many times ive been kiting a gang and then targetted a tackle burning towards me using ctrl click on the overview and then bloody turning around and approach them not wanting to
i think it was a good idea to implement them but for new players it is surely better when they start with learnings at lv4 so that they can conzentrate on there playing style sry for my poor english
this is exactly my and many others concernlike some other poster said this is microtransactions opening pandoras box tbh
there are a few main things ive heard from the wtf ccp this is bs side of the story and ill answer each of them here1 its an unfair advantage to players with rl moneyever since plex players with rl money can buy isk and isk has always been an advantage in eve implants expensive ships  mods you name itmoreover this is hardly an advantage if anything it can compensate for your lack of planning  common sense ie you didnt optimize your training and train skills that require one attribute for one year then skills that require another for the next year2 its a slippery slopethe slippery slope argument is a fallacyyou cant not want something on the basis that it might later lead to something else you dont wantyou would be right if you could prove that accepting this will have as a direct unstoppable consequence the introduction of plex for sp but you cant theres nothing to show that it wont just be plex for remap and nothing else3 microtransactionsthis is trueup to now for every 15 dollars that ccp received someone would get a month of gameplay whereas with this they will receive 15 dollars without giving a month of gameplay to someone in returnin that sense it is a micropaymentthat doesnt mean its a bad ideayou cant just brandish the word micropayment as some evil that will ruin evetheres nothing wrong with ccp selling other services than gametime and they already do it character transfers portrait changes corp logo changes but more importantly alt accountsselling an alt account is not selling gametime youre not getting an extra month by buying an alt account youre buying the ability to train double the skills during a month of gametime you already have and there is virtually no difference be having perfect manufacturing and sniper hac skills on one char and having them on two different chars except that having them on two different chars lets you move them  use them independently and simultaneously which is handyin that sense there already is something much much closer to plex for sp and nobody seems to be too angry about itif theres anything ive missed please tell me

oh dear lordno
its not nearly the huge philosophical threshold being crossed that people are making it is already huge alternative in gaining game advantage in far greater ways the advantage does not shatter existing character creation methodsan extra 10 or so in speed keeps character creation 90 the same  hardly enough to change strategy drastically explanations below the new advantage offered is also available through game play by earning isk as opposed to requiring real money like a portrait change or the 20 fee youd pay to transfer a characterpretty much already plex  advantage  game play  plex or rl   plexi like to earn isk trading is fun for me  ill be at over 100 billion isk 18 months in despite having used isk to pay for my  i might even pay to play the game just to trade i wouldnt pay real money for more than 1 account thoughrather spend the money on my kids than be that self indulgent extra game play  rl  for me because i wouldnt make the choice to pay extra  for extra accounts all of the advantages that can come from using  can also come from playing longerif the ccp proposal were to only allow  to get the remap advantage only people people paying extra would get that advantage and id have some problem with that at least it would be a changeour player abilities within the game are the sum of all my characters on all my accounts having a cloakie alt running dual boxed on the other side of the gate is a huge advantage  being able to use a 2 million sp character simalaltaneus ly is worth far more than an extra 2 million sp on a 25 million characterhaving tradercloakycyno alt in almost each region makes me a lot more isk  can be very efficient time wise and has large pvp advantages as wellsure sometimes there is an advantage to having more skills on one character 12 4 million sp characters dont add up to a nyx pilot  but lets face it there too most supercap pilots are peoples alts either groomed by spending an extra 15 a month or bought with isk earned in the game  or groomed with plex earned in game or bought with real  converted to iskwhat types of ships you have in your hanger is a major game dynamic flying more expensive ships can be an advantageoften paid for as it is with  by pvpers  essentially that also means a game option to pay rl  to avoid a part of the game that some find less funso the long and short of it is  using isk to buy remaps plex  350 million isk really only changes one thing it provides a very limited situational alternative to the character bazaar if a specific abilty is wanted in 10 to 30 less time training depedning on how wrong they were specced at the starti agree that it slightly alters a role play type of issue i get the point about characters have historiesand have taken real time and human efforts to groom   but the change is only slight there many characters for sale are already factory bred never having left hanger until they reach hulk or 55 learning or capship ablities and have no real history id also really dislike instant characters for all the reasons people listed earlier in this threadnaught  but characters would still take time to groom but a training plan could go about 20 quicker maximum  but in all reality if any player had been making even the most basic use of the existing remap mechanisms the advantage would probably be less than 10 thats hardly shattering the existing role play character development patternfrom a role play perpsective giving people a bit of and edge to hold on to a character that they blew a remap on rather than tradingbuying a different one to get to a ship sooner is probably has some positives too ideally from a rp perspective the person behind the chracter stays the sam
in your absolutely worst case scenariowith no implants and no changes ever in base attributes and perfect changes by the person paying for remaps  the person paying more would train the same stuff in 80 of the time it took mr no changehowever ive tried it on evemon  set up any logical training cue for over a yearand youll find that by optimizing attributes once at the very beginning and never changing the attributes again you will save 10  choose 5 years worth of skills even and find an optimum at the beginning the skill attributes applied are not evenly distributed perception and intelligence are far overrepresented as primary attributes with one initial change to mr halfaclue the difference goes from 2421936 to more like 2422129 mr moneybags is training at 88 only saving 12 days 100 now butis money bags really going to be on the ball enough to remap more than once a weekany time theres a minor change between a prerequisite and following skill  i gotta think hed slip up a bit only from laziness even if cost was no object say out of the 19 percent delta he got it 90 perfect that would knock off basically the 2 from 242 but still be highly ambitious with those changes to 212924 its only looking 11 days out of 100but theres still more to the story implants lets just assume a low common denominator of basic 3 implants we go to 242927  basically 90 10 days per 100 saved by mr moneybags over mr half a clueif mr halfaclue had closer to a full clue and used his first couple remaps to his advantage he could definitely save 3 extra days out of those 10 per 100  mr money bags would have something like a 7 advantage over mr hasaclue hardly a game breaker in a game where people with 8 months of play or even a few months as a scout or something play along side people with 3 years of trainingplayi really doubt that mr money bags would be smart enough to pull it off and if mr hasaclue sold some overpriced stuff to mr moneybags hed have enough to buy a extra remap every 6 months and probably cut mr money bags actually achieved advantage to a couple days per 100mr money bags might use his money in the game for a big advantage but the really big advantages would come from multiple accounts fancy ships bought with plexisk and character purchases hes not going to get far ahead of someone smart with a couple weeks a year extra trainingwhile thats certainly an advantage its hardly an unworkable advantage differences in sps are hardly game breaking or it would be impossible for people whod played 7 months to play along side people playing for years

i just checked some statistics i was interested in seeing if it was possible in eve to pull some dirty diamond business where you cut off the supply of one material to make it more valuable than it should be and ran some statistics here is what i came up withpro found in 29 regions all over the universedys found in 32 regions all over the universeneo found in 23 regions in a few areas across the universe now we are getting somewherethu found in 31 regions all over the universei kinda felt that was still a little too much for even a big power block with lots of friends to deal with so what are the chances that we could find a more common materialcae found in 30 regions all over the universetec found in 20 regions in one corner of the universe jackpothaf found in 38 regions all over the universemer found in 32 regions all over the universei propose that either the other minerals are grouped up into smaller areas of space or that tech is spread outor make those materials come from more than just moons my favorite option
i disagree that this subsystem giving extra drones would be overpowered remember youre sacrificing that long range scrambler and blaster damagetank for an extra mid and 120 extra dps all be it drone dps which can be easily removed also the remaining 60 of your dps is with blasters and as we all know unless youre holding the target by the throat with your bare hands sticking out of your pod window youre not in range maybe 50 mbit50m3 is too much drop it to 2525 perhaps but im still gonna stick to my original idea of additional dronesi agree that the legion is somewhat lacking but i havent tried fiddling with that ship yet i might have a poke around at some point
it would be nice if the drone system would actually be useful right now its not much better than a myrm
some effects in eve are extremly annoying they look terrible and also impair the lucidity in bigger engagements for my understanding this is the case with especially sensor boosters but also tracking computers eccms etc in fact all effects which add a disturbing aura of light around your ship of course the client allows to disable effects but this affects simply too much there are some effects which are important to see in fightslike doomsdays hictor bubbles or other tackling effects it would be helpful to either remove those auras or add a seperate option to deactivate them without disabling all other effectshere is one example how it looks like in fleetbattles its also bad for older graphics hardware
this the things dont even pay attention to me telling them to go away when i shut off effects before a fight
no whines like this are why we lost glorious engine trails get a better rig
i second this sensorbooster animations and similar onesare totally annoying and not crucial to know about just kill them or add an appropriate option to turn them offedit just watch this vidomg
they dont lag for me at all theyre just downright uglysigned 
i shal bump further
they never will be because you need the t1 ship  other stuff to make the t2 one still moon mining in whs is a great idea and can open serious t2 production to smaller corpsalliances

hi as a user i am not interested in seeing updatesprocedures of the client or the server it is enough for me that i know what changes are made so please have some thoughts about the updateprocedere from a user perspective i want to play eve as much as it possible i donUFFFDt want to see or even click update buttons  i donUFFFDt want to wait while downloading and extractingmy expection is updates loads and extracts in the background while i play eve ccp does a maintenance window  server update is done  my client starts with the new version and connects to the new server eve the two things i see are a new version number b patch notes the only thing i had to doa play eveno extra button pressing no additional sparetime 
yea ccp what are you doinwindows vista has been out for like 2 years not computers are easy and stuff if you cant do this then you must be teribllee programbers lolololi am in college for compunters and no aboout this stuffffyou should get morememory and stuff willlll workks1bye  mulitple ks are apparently baned words
you will still have to wait once the client finds out from the server that the server version has changedat the very least youll have to wait while it patches the affected files granted that might only take a few minutes but youre still waitingunless youre suggesting that it should just install a completely separate copy of eve and the launcher directs you to the appropriate version automatically which is overkill for a game this isnt the national defense security network were working with here it is ok if it doesnt run for a few minutes while it updates
well they could create an optional background application very small low memory that periodically checks for updates and downloads and install updates in the background when the player is not playing especially during expansion updates because those tend to be very largealso making updates available before expansions finish deployment for those with slower connections
i get it rightyou want to play with the old client while the new client i downloaded and installed
yes this is a great idea
would be very convenient and couldnt hurt
yes please and let the ccp care abput performanceand get back to us when if they can do it nbody here knows exactly how eve worcks only cpp knows exact innerworkings sometimes i doubt even that
supported if server strain is not an issue otherwise i expect bookmark spamming to become a staple grieifing tactic
youd only see your own bookmarks so youd only be able to grief yourself
weekly bump for attention
i have personally anchored 5 poses in the same system at the same time myself only minutes apart what limits are you speaking of
i wanted to propose a non log out when we switch characters with in our account i have to log all the way out to switch to my alts  i propose a character screen that doesnt require a log out now i know that 2 diffrent accounts require this but a main with 2 alts should be a faster switch i hope to get supported for thisty
i am simply proposing that the csm ask ccp to look at the current role and balance of dreadnaughts in evethe are multiple threads discussing the issue hp boost for caps threadbalance for dreadsnag needs more dpsnot all of these threads necessarily directly discuss the issues of dreads in the op but dreads and their roles and problems eventually come upthis is not to discuss or argue about super carriers this is simply to acknowledge that dreads currently are screwed their roles are filled by something else or just non existent or just plain not worth the isk to fill to the role if you would like the csm to push for a review of dreadnaughts as they are in the current game please support also i will be happy to add any other relevant threads to the list
i would leave out the chic proposal it is crap and not much related to dreads at all
done
id love to see a feature where offlined poss will unanchor or become unaffiliated with the corp that launched them make people take care of there stuff or lose it
ive had a few thoughts when it comes to abandoned pos1 make them burn charters to stay anchored charters represent factional parking permits so occupying a moon whether online or not means that parking space is used if they run out of charters they unanchoror2 do away with charters and instead charge a fee like office rent if a corp cant afford it or the corp ceases to exist the pos rent goes unpaid and unanchorsfor those who would say simply having the pos unanchor in place is unfair to the owners replace unanchor with impounded the pos and all modules are confiscated and stored at the station where the corps hq is located they have to pay a hefty fee for each item to be released from impound
if it s abandoned you can wardec them and blow it upchances are it is not abandoned and you are just too new to know how things work around herethis is not a new topic
think your missing the pointblowing up poss is boring i want to steal them if i leave my car unatended with the alarm off it might not be there when i get back

ahahahaha i thank op for the laugh i will be redirecting cp readers shortlyto be just a bit constructive i will say that in my oppinion this is not an exploit but a very clever use of fleet mechanics my reasoning for this not being an exploit is that its never possible to force anybody into a fleetif this is exploiting so is the cnr  raven contract scamed typo
not an exploit the op wouldve been able to see that there was a constant session change in the fleet management window if hed bothered to have it open either by seeing his fleet position being altered or by the small timer icon on the top right
in eve are no exploids thats an random feature
this is much of an exploit as apamming a dying ship with convo invites to prevent the pod from getting awayoh wait
i like all the people calling this an exploit i think ccp should deem stupidity an exploit and mass ban people like the op for the betterment of eve
im pretty sure it was both stupid and dangerous and that you cant count
dude thats not an exploit that is you not making smart decisionsjoining his fleet
first time posting on the forums so it goes without saying its also my first time posting in the assembly hall so sorry if ive missed stuffessentially i like the idea of evegate its a cool idea that i can communicate and interact with my corpalliancegeneral eve buddies from anywhere that i have a browser however there seems to be very little reason to do so i can check my mail and thats about it basically what we have is a poor mans facebook but for eve as we all know from the nickname spacebook so lets look to facebook for some of the things that cause people to use it alright so the modern facebook is a nightmare filled with unwanted friendeventgroupappetc invites but what about the original facebook that was strictly a communication toolhow about starting with simple things  like a chat service thats integrated with eve imagine corp chat being accessible from evegate as well as private chats i know that would get me logging into evegate a lot moreor even more simple how about the option to receive email alerts for things like events and evemail that way we would at least know when wed find something interesting if we checked evegatejust a few ideas kicking around im sure others can come up with better ones but as i didnt see anything in the hall i thought id start the ball rollingcheersnamy
look i no this gets emo rage touted everytime somthing goes wrong but i have to say in the real world if a company cant manage its down times effectivly and get them up and running after essentail maintenance within their own set times frames then said company would be in serious troublei would like to put it to the csm that ccp is far to rapped up in abitary deadlines stemming from its own general failures in the last few years i would like to put forward these points1 ccp should be made in some manor as deemed by the csm to be held more accountable to its client base ie game ussrs we pay for this game yes we choose to but ccp has adopted a very our way or no way attitude to customer relations in the long run this will loose player base support and could impact on the game we know and love2 ccp are wrapped up in so many arbitary projects and time scales it consistently finds it impossible to complete any of them a on time b in a manor that is fit for purposei would site the recent lag monstor and the latest patch as examples ccp failed to listen to its player base for too long when we told them about the lag in fleet ops the first month or so of eves response was not far of the oft touted line there are no bugs in eve only features when ccp did finally get around to dealing with it their response was too slow and undermanned  it still is imho ccp has not devoted enough resources to it coz they are busy with other priority projects  eg dust and ambulation which is resulting in a poor gaming expereince for many their latest patch is a clasic example it took hours longer than expected due to what can only be assumed to be a rush to get it deployed without proper vv processes to ensure its smooth transition and even after a failed deployment that could not keep to timescales eve is now riddled with more glitches and bugs than it was 12 hours ago before the patchwith reference to the twice yearly new content deployments am i the only one that would quite happily say to ccp look foget all new content in 2011 just concentrate on fixing the game you have it has been becoming more and more apparent that new deployments are not fit for purpose at the time of deployment and commonly result in a wave of addition bugs that need to be fixed again it seems that ccps drive to get 2 new deployments of new content each year is resulting in performancereliability issues for the game itselfin review csm please1 make ccp acountable for poor customer service and response and more acountable to us  ccps clients2 get ccp to stop rushing to meet deadlines it seems unable to meet whether patch deployment patch instalation or new content deployment its resulting in a gradually diminishing gaming experience3 get ccp to stop focusing on new in gameout of game content and just get whats there now to work properly  even at the expense of delays or cancelations of new contnet and deployments4 stop ccp from wasting time and resources on dust and ambulation and fix whats out there nowplease csm this is not emo rage  this is a problem and while many people might defend ccp if you did a straw poll of new content vs fix whats there i think ccp and csm may well be supprised with the results
since all his and drake draconis posts following chromos are either utterly ed trolling and absolutely annoying to read or a clear troll with no purpose other than to allow him to link to his thread in the assembly hall calling for a ban of chromo i would like to propose to ban him and drake dracons alongside chromo so that the assembly hall has three s less to read aboutdiscuss
what is this i dont even
is this what you are blabbering on about
just reported your thread enjoy your ban
can someone with a brain decent looks and a higher education please respond to my query it makes no sense at all to not allow moon mining in wormhole space thanksstrato
i was the first poster also it makes perfect sense not to allow it c1s through c4s would pretty much be free cash machines
so i guess ccp has no brainsthey are fuglyand have no higher education to speak ofcause they said nogo away troll and stay in your dank dark hole
well because wh space are relatively secure compared to true 00if you can tell my how it would be possible to cyno a cap fleet in and kill a heavily defended moon mining pos please do so you dont pay for sov in a wh either so all in all it would be a relatively safe cash cow if you would like to have the isk from moon mining become a sov holding alliance in 00 and defend your space earn the moon you want to make isk from but of cause you would have to do some pvp to defend your space not like in carebear 00 wh space
allow moon mining but only give the wh moons crap minerals no r32r64 to make bajilions of isk for little effort just a bit to offset the fuel costs or even better create something entirely new to be mined from wh moons
translation  you cant have any moons  when you show up near one moon my 200 titan fleet will insta kill you it is my gold and mine alone so gtfo 
there are several smaller alliances without big cap fleets that have moons they can mine they are often pets of bigger alliances or someone that have shown their worth in combat and been given space by a big power block or actually been strong enough to take the space themselves your corp could also join a space holding alliance and over time prove yourself so the alliance will give your corp moons the fact is that the alliancescorps that actually have moons have mostly earned them in some way or another if you want something in eve earn or take it
no
in eve griefing is a feature not a problem get over it
heads up op if i find you im suicide bombing you in a disco bs loss is a part of the game dont be a pubbie and deal with it
i wondering if there is a way to see on the potraits in allaince corp window when someone goes afk  like commandafk then i or you woulnd need to waste our time trying to talk to somebody online but afk  plus i be able to set my self afk  without having to click and read someone bio thank you
no unfortunately there isnt and this doesnt belong in the assembly hall for future reference questions like this should go into either general discussion or new citizens qa
now if he wants to start a proposal for an afk indicator he could fix the title and op but thats more lag and more lag  badbut i think it would be good i hate talking to someone just to never see a reply
turn on timestampsthen you will be able to tell when that person spoke lastif youre replying to something they said hours ago chances are theyre gone
well ive had this idea for a while that this weapon should have several difrent uses its supposed to be the ultimate weapon out there so i think it should be possible to have difrent uses so here are a few i came up withtargeted script dd is as it is nowaoe script dd do something like 50k damage over a large area like 200km around titan a weapon against drones and small shipsshield disrupt script a emp burst that takes out an amount of shield that and stops shield recharge for 5min sensorburst script decloaks everything in system cloak can be initiated again on the normal recloak timersenergynova script neutralizing cap for an amount of time say 30 sec any ship on grid gets neutralizedgravity script when activated it webs everything on grid for 60 speed lasts 1minjust a few ideas i had what do people think
i think they are terrible ideas and you should feel bad for writing them down
i think this will go well considering the reasons why ccp changed the dd from aoe to targeted weapon please next time read up on why things where changed in the first place
i think they need to change the name from doomsday to death rayit used to be aoe pain to all on grid now its pain to a single target
thanks shah i appreciate the lesson
not yet anyway and yes they do get flagged for a whole 15 minutes which would be more than enough time to kill them if remote support affected docking ability the thread is superfluous as the neutralrr issue has been brought up a billion times already and the csm are well aware of it as is ccp i reckon
difficult issue to balancethere is nothing inherently wrong with using nuet repsits just a bit lacking in risk
do you get ganked muchkeep posting on the forums like an ass  people remember asshats like you and i am pretty sure you will never be able to undock without someone trying to pod you
and people report me for trolling
im a bloody major carebear and even i am starting to want to shoot him lol
proposal implement a block feature on the forumsscrew it ill report him
i personally hate fowl language and would like to see some sort of filters incorporated into the chat channelsthis would also make the game more family orientatedsorry if this has already been proposed
im really not that fond of birds clogging up my chat channels either but as they are apparently paying subscriberssorry i had to do that the word you are apparently looking for is foul not fowlthat aside be mature and ignore the parts you dont like its pretty much what the rest of us do

im sure this is not the first or last time that this topic has been discussed however i see no talk of it getting any better or in the pipeline of fixesit is easy to complain about things that are missing or redundant in eve but let it be said that eve is the best mmorpg around and ccp have and continue to do a great job so thanks for thatbut back to the topic at hand we eve players need alliance hangers and offices now and it is well over due given the amount of time and development spent on endeavours to expand the game such as incarna i fail to see why this has not been fix yetlets ask the question which would you prefer being able to walk around stations in an internet spaceship game or having access to alliance assetspos fuelmodsmining materialsmodsitemslabsassembly arrays alliance shipsship replacementfleet loadoutsfleet lootmods these are just a few reasons why alliance hangers and offices are so important to the game alongside this would be logs of who what and when items were removed or placed in all hangers and ship maintenance arraysif im not mistaken alliance members have access to ship maintenance arrays should the pos owner allow it please explain to me why this cannot be extended to the alliance hangers perhaps a new pos itemagain i could be wrong but most if not all alliances have a central base of operations more than one if that said alliance holds a lot of sov alliance offices would enable access to the alliance hangers and can be managed using a similar ui to the corporation management window from such ui the alliance leader you can now allow which corps has limited or full access and what level of management is required at a corporation level to access the alliance hangersand finally logs the logs are there somewhere in the giant void that is the eve online database lets make them exportable evehq would be a great interface for hangerasset logs or perhaps in a similar way to character management page on the eve online main website i dont know how but there must be a wayin closing ccp we understand the importance of creating additional revenue streams by expanding on what is already a great game however there are things we want and things we need such is lifeif i am not the only one who feels like corpalliance management tools needs work or i need an education in know your place  please post herei look forward to a friendly if not frank discussionmike
see the problem is that you cited a thread started by cromo effect
if it es you off report itworks for me
yes when i repackage a ship i normally have other mods in my hanger that i dont want to repackage too like damaged drones and it is frustrating to unselect everyone of those by hand
wormhole space is supposed to be random you moronnot predictablenot supportedthis is why  why cromo shouldnt be allowed to post
ive been reflexively against this sort of thing i was against plex when they first camebut ya know im just not seeing why this particular thing is so nightmarishan rough equivalent would be selling a plex and then getting implants with the money the effect obviously wouldnt be as pronounced depending but the principle is pretty much the sameas it stands someone can sell x number of plex buy some hugely skilled character and be rolling around with 100 million skillpoints no problem and yes of course its a problem but it was sort of hobsons choice for ccp and id rather have them be in control of the whole thing than shady rmt people from uzbekistani just dont think this is the end of the world anything like this should be carefully analyzed however because it would be very easy to turn the game into a payperclick korean mmo depending on how the whole microtransaction thing works out for them this could be financially seductive for ccp as well
a true politician
somebody sold you a bitter vet status symbol and told you it was a specialised endgame ship sorry for your loss
i probably deserved that barb
this would encourage suicide by killing with alts
bounty schemes of all sorts are infinitely open to abuse any time you can be both the victim and the killer and make isk off of it players will find a way to game the system transferable kill rights that you can post on contracts might help but who knows
