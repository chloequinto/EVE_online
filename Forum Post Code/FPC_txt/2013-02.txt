where do i insert my isk i keep throwing it at the lock but the door to bouncy boobies doesnt seem to open
there were only 2 barriers to early acceptance of the dangers of low sec for me1 the cost of implants when i was inevitably podded2 the inaccessibility of jump clonesit took a while to learn how to avoid being podded there and i still have real life limiting issues regarding escape but thats just me id still prefer a jump clonelast time i looked they were awfully hard to get the barriers were just too high to be worth it it took a long time to look again i havent tried it yet but it appears to be much easier nowinformation dissemination is just hard to come by once youve read thru the basicsback when the basics just didnt tell you all you needed to know bye

unfortunately on topic and relevant questions regarding this proposal have been ignored and evaded no coherent argument has been put forward to justify its introduction on either a practical or moral basis and so the entire thread looks more and more like a poorly planned and executed attempt to troll members of the new orderunlike the members of the new order of highsec who seek to educate players on the workings of eve and to bring joy and involvement to many this proposal seeks to keep people ignorant and to disadvantage new playersas has been clearly shown with no cogent opposition being put forward against intelligent arguments from the many contributors to this thread proponents of the suggested amendment are simply seeking to muzzle free speech within the game i can only guess that this is for some purpose that suits their own agenda as it has been clearly shown that there will be no benefit accruing to other players from such a proposal

i have been on and off eve four the last 34 years i have seen huge empires come and go like cheap hookers it may not seem like it now but one day the big players in null sec now wont even exist one day what will be left of each is handful of good friends who sit and talk about the glory days when they had an empire
just thought this proposal could use another viewing hopefully by some csm membersdmc

it really is broken in a lot of ways granted drones were kind of mind numbing dps in a lot of ways but arent all weapon systems kinda like that drones should take a small portion of my concentration not constant staring and being afraid to blink because if i do 5 million isk can be gone by the time my eyelids come back upi think that we certainly should be fielding the correct drones for the correct situation but the solution to that problem was not to make them evaporate when you arent paying attentionid also like to point out for some of the above posters and a lot of the forum trolls that just because one certain drone is viable 332 seconds into a fight if youre an armor tank on a friday in caldari space with 473 capacitor remaining doesnt mean drones are balanced it means they have a ridiculously tiny niche and thats not what drones are there fortheres no reason for me to be able to let my drones out to 65 km when i can rest easy at night knowing that even if i recalled them as soon as they got there not a single one would make it back to my bay either take away my drone link aug or make it useful pleasesmall drones are vastly too squishy for the amount of aggro they generate and are overpricedmedium drones do proportionally bad damage are still squishy are overpriced and are probably all dead by the time you notice theyve been aggrod and try to recall themthe real people who are hurting are the big ships that arent drone boats but rely absolutely on said drones to take out the frigates that are endangering their ship i ran into a situation in my raven in worlds collide with the bug where the entire room aggros where if i pull out my drones theyre instapopped but if i dont im going to be warp scrambled into next month and im going to lose my ship this very situation shows just how broken drones are in this regard players in big ships and especially missile boats rely absolutely on those light drones to keep the frigates off of us but when their damage is mediocre and theyre killed instantly theres not much we can do but watch our ship get torn up by frigates and hope they all get bored of warp scrambling at the same timethat said i wouldnt mention all these problems without taking a stab at some solutionsmake correctly sized drones meaningful by changing their damage rather than their durability eg make sure light drones excel at frigates but anything bigger than a bc and you wont notice the effect the same for each other type of drone that way it still stops people from afking missions a heavy could never take out a frigate a light could never take out a bs and it would also make drone use more engaging for drones boats theyd need to pay attention and swap dronesas mentioned above lock on times for npcs targeting drones needs some fiddling additionally i think we would profit greatly from a little red aggression icon next to our drones that showed us when they were being target locked it seems like a fairly simple thing to add and a pretty understandable requestaggression really does need some kind of change as well id suggest having one or two boats per group that target drones of their size and the rest ignore them as stated in ccps blog post on the new ai their ai is in templates so this wouldnt require a redesign or anything just a new templatedrones need to slowly repair inside your ship it just needs to be that way not quickly enough that you can just swap them in and out mid battle and never have to worry about it but quickly enough that theyre at full health between missionsthis is my first post on the eve forums and i apologize for the giant wall of text i only post because i feel that this really needs a change and hopefully before i lose my raven because ive lost 15 hobgoblin iis trying to kill the frigates warp scrambling me
okay i know a lot of people are quick to react to such blasphemy but i would ask that you give my ideas a chance to prove themselves valid i strongly feel some work could be done to increase the enjoyment of the limited single player experience in eve keep in mind this is not to suggest any changes to security and is not a plea for making anyone safer or restricting any currently allowed actions in eve also when i say single player what i really mean is single player accessible as these suggestions should be available for groups of all sizes but remain capable for single players should they so chose many of us begin the game alone figuring out the mechanics and systems in which to work on and towards in our career is in some cases easier with friends but i think the option of being able to explore all of these elements on our own to a point of fully understanding them makes sense a lot of players dont stay forever but come back frequently like myself to new updates expansions and systems which need to be understood also a way to utilize our well above starting skills to regain some isk and get back on the board with all the new stuff would really help us get back in the swing of things lets not forget that in eve joining corps is not a menial and immediate process and it requires quite a bit of time spent building and rehashing old relationships and proving ones intentions and credibility that period alone is enough to have allowed my interests to sway onto a game i can play and still feel productive in pve has always been confusing for me in eve especially to someone who hasnt always played pve it would be great to have some sort of campaign with achievable goals that are kept track of story arcs have always been hard to find for me i cant see the harm in adding multiple new story arcs with each expansion that explain apply require and reward with all the new elements and systems of that particular expansion it would all work as a hands on way to catch up in knowledge and experience as well as acquire some of the new physical elements and isk so we can reintegrate back into the amazing world of eve you could make comparisons to the dungeon progression systems of many mmos exploration industry mining and trading also deserve their own subsets of a single player accessible pve experience besides the tired mission system that rarely captures the spirit of what motivates that type of player im not making the case that one should be able to play this content for years but beyond tutorials there should be a way to concentrate on these career paths to gain knowledge experience and assets before trying to demonstrate your value to a prospective corp without having any idea of what you want to do or are capable of a fully integrated tutorial system for all of these paths is paramount to their success although there needs to be more content to allow someone to continue past the lessons and on to gaining experience and assets some higher level content or even varied degrees of difficulty to allow access at various points in a pilots lifetime within eve would be a plus people want to try new things sometimes after years of playing and this would be a great tool for that i think in allowing solo players to become accustom with the world of eve and all it has to offer will only result in encouraging them to find other like minded pilots and exploring the extreme potential of the activities theyve found rewarding if some chose to continue solo they will surely see they are inhibited in the potential of their game but to each is own many im sure will see the proven logic in joining the social communities to achieve greater goals single player experiences should never be the aim of any development for eve but it shouldnt be overlooked ignored or neglected i believe a reworked emphasis on a limited single player experience has the power to open the world up to many mmo players that are so used to being pointed in one direction so that they might find a way to follow their own here in eve not to mention give a leg up to us old guys coming back and trying to find a new way to live in the old world of eve
i think the main problem with this idea is that it gets old real fast what i mean is that it literally can become obsoletewrong withing 6 months this means its going to be a constant drain on development resources but it doesnt give much value for that effort the current tutorials cover all the basics admirably at this point and are redone and tweaked in on a regular basis after that you can solo much of the available content just finei think youre overstating the difficulties of getting to the new content too when new content is introduced all you need to do is just try it you dont need a pve campaign to tell you about it in every little detail give new equipment and loads of isk to cater to returning players it can even be counter productive since giving that stuff out for free bypasses the gameplay mechanics that offer gameplay for other players or are part of balancing mechanic for the equipment instead you just need to play the feature for 15 minutes to get the basics down and thats it new equipment requires a few minutes to train to level 1 and isk youve made previously hasnt mysteriously disappeared from your wallet aquiring them is something every solo player is easily capable ofi do think it wouldnt hurt to ease the transition from the strict guidance of the tutorials to no guidance that comes after they end im just not sure what would be a good way of achieving that goal in a way that it does its job but doesnt drain too many resources away from actual game improvements and content

does not follow it is equally likely that the current skill system is actually helping to retain players because even though they are not currently interested they still log in to work their skill queue  and might get swept up at any time into doing something fun as they do adding a skill grind might create more of a feeling of blah im not making any progress anyways unsubscribe
so pirates who are equipped to catch fast aligning frigates can not catch and destroy a stealth bomber with a destroyer etc as for podding every indy that comes through the gate you might have to wait some time for it to appear which along with it being a potentially insta warp one andor having low value loot bombers having fairly low ehp bombs having a large volume along with the distance bombs have to travel could make gate camping with bombers alone be a waste of gate camping time they would probably be better off used to destroy gatecamps
people bombing station undocksinstant negative 10 standingits a 00 mechanic same as sov holding station ownership etc
theres nothing inherently wrong with lowsec the only problem it really has is its reputation and most of that reputation it gains because of newbies jumping into gate camps on their first time out that require a bunch of player skills to deal with that they have never been exposed toput some pseudogatecamps in missions maybe even a career agent mission teach a bit about how to read the dang starmap and people will not die on entry enough that they might start going there more
what game are you lot playing manually piloting ships in eve this is a point and click game with very little control over actually piloting your ship unfortunatelya better suggestion might be for the player to be able to fully control the ship with wasdx style controls the system we have now is from a time when the internet could not cope with that many inputs time has passed and servers can cope with things like thousands of players piloting ships
hay guys i realy need you to adress a new problem in new eaden ok i been in a lot of trade hubs over the last copple weeks and all i see is bots spaming gambling sites well first its aganits the game rules to use a bot second its realy anoying have to block them and not been able to report them so i am asking you guys if you could some disable them for local and with option to view like in ever quest 2 or second bring it to ccp attation to start baning acounts that are used for boting once againg it is given plaers a unfier atvange to say win a 8 bil ship when the main goal of the game it to have fun making it your self thanks for your time over and out
you can report them for spamming local iirc

there are plenty of goals that a new player can achieve straight out of the box with very few sps you dont have to be a subscriber for 3 months before you can start playing the game players that can dedicate more hours of gameplay are rewarded with isk which could potentially make the game pay for itself i think thats a pretty good incentive for new players to spend time playing the game versus time offline while skills train i doubt the folks at ccp would consider changing thisit wouldnt exactly be fair to all the players who already have the skills and if you are a new player dreaming of flying a titan i think the issue is a bit more complicated than simply having the correct set of skills in your character sheetif i could make the skill training go faster by spending more time on the game it would give me an advantage over most other players
the reason those games have far more subscribers than eve is because they appeal to a wider base  nothing more nothing less surprisingly there are vast swaths of the population that just arent into sciencefiction in general and wouldnt find a game like eve appealing no matter what you changedand its not a better game model  just different i think the fact that eve has had fairly steady success over the last ten years proves that the model works in the long term which is far more important that attracting a million subs in your first three months take a hard look at star trek online if you need more proofi dont play games like wow because i think its ridiculous that i have to bash on a rock for 20 hours to get better at bashing on rocks i dont have that kind of time to put into a game with eve i can put time organizing and helping my corp mates without ever logging in even when im not at homeit also does not follow that changing the skilling model would in any way impact the subscriber base there are a lot of variables that go into making a successful game and the skill system is just one of them changing one may have no impact at all except perhaps to make the game less attractive to the people that already like it its a far more substantial risk on ccps part than for instance incarna

you know you can already stop your undock right just click abort
i think the message should say something like by clicking this button you consent to be the unwilling target of pvp actions
i dont really agree with this i dont consent to be the target of involuntary pvp its just a fact of life in eve and people should get the hell over it already if you cant stand being shot at what are you doing there in the first placeas for the are you sure button no unless theres a checkbox that says never show this box again because im not going click again to undock ive clicked undock because thats what i wanted to do also theres this nice shiny cancel button and you have plenty of time to click itits eve people its the game of consequences pay attention the price of not paying attention is your ship andor pod going poof if that does not give you pause to pay attention to where you are situational awareness as it were then really youve got nobody else to blameplease dont ask for another helmet so that you wouldnt bang your head against the bulkheadpay attentionand im certainly not saying this to be smug because ive had my ass kicked more than once through inattention losing the ship is the price of the lesson this is eve she does not come and sit at your bed side and say pilot what you did just then was silly and a mistake and you should not do that bad people will come and they will try and hurt you its sad but some people do that maybe it was something in their upbringing father drank mother ate who knows what went on there so please click the shiny button here wait until the angels sing that everything is safe and then fly away while the rest of the station lovingly waves goodbye thats not how she rolls pilot you messed up time to pay the price a new ship type is n amount of isk on the local market people will sell you just as many as you need until you learn not to mess up anymore youre welcome idiotshut up and take the medicine
1 i specified above that the window should contain the same never show me this again option as all the others presently in the game2 the obvious implication of your argument is the removal of all UFFFDare you sureUFFFD windows iUFFFDm sure there are those that appreciate the ones currently present i simply request one moreabort button notwithstanding i believe this additional UFFFDare you sureUFFFD window to be more beneficial than harmful
that statement is a bit contradictory if its a fact of life in eve but you dont consent to it that means you dont consent to playing eve undocking is consent to pvp some people just dont realize that a little message that reminds them might help them enjoy the game a bit more
not supported1 low sec would be popular if socalled pirates would stop wasting time griefing people who are only here for pve all the time2 moved out to null sec took the shortest path possible half of it through low sec and didnt encounter a single pirate not even a small gate camp hell nothing even showed up on dscanput short the problem doesnt lay with mechanics in lays with the players same with null both have turned into an eve version of barney just about
lowsec is the zoo many empty systems therethis is not a problem of game mechanics this is a problem of players they dont understand how it works so they make it this mystical monster its true that lowsec pirates make it a problem to be there but its more than that you need to learn how to work in that environmentim fine with increasing the rewards of running the risk of working in lowsec but to make it safer we really need to stop asking to make it safereve does not need to be safer pilots need to become better thats all there is to it put in the effort reap the rewardsim having a real problem understanding how people could be so risk averse that they would never want to run any risk of a permanent loss because it would take away the enjoyment of their game reallyjust get better see what new eden has to offer learn how to turn it into a profit and get some good laughs out of it to bootif you cant accept a little risk is eve online really the place you want to be
i suggest remake this tool in some way in order it wont be so easy to access to that important piece of the char info activity maybe improving an option to abledisable this feature on your toon to be hidden is sometimes very important as a tactic and if u cant use it you are under a great disadvantage i know u can use the strategy of be online all the time but sometimes capital ships in troubles  thats not possible and on the other side when you want to hunt anyone there is always other options like spyes alts and so on thanks and cya
1 good idea
the whole reason i even bothered to train an orca in the first place was to move my own ships around without having to constantly buy new rigs part of the reason i stopped flying battleships is because they wouldnt fit into an orcafurthermore it seems that in the deep dark reaches of null there are logistics corporations whose sole function is to supply their respective alliancescoalitions with fullyfitted doctrinecomplaint readytogo ships brought to wherever the front lines are something like this perhaps might be beneficial to those effortsanyway a ship like this is very relevant to my interests and so ill definitely give it a 1
thank you for your support and i hope to see this as a reality this would not just change things for null alliances it would change the face of true logistics in new eden and anyone that knows me knows that i will not let this idea go away quietly into the night i am going to avidly push for the development of such a vessel until either it becomes a reality or ccp tells me to shut the  up with that in mind lets keep pushing to expand our sandbox into something even greater than it already isi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
easy update do ithrolt ceo live free die proud
the current system has both benefits and drawbacks for new players it rather is about playing styles then character agewith the current system the advantage of a 247 power gamer over someone else is quite limited the advantage is mainly a monetary and experience player not char one but the more casual player can still bide his time and use his chancesthere are many games out there that prefer the grinder over the one who uses what he has to best effect eve beeing different here does have some appeal to me
did i derail this thread i would have thought people would be replying
ive lost a few drones since the change its not so easy any more not sure if its broken though but certainly more difficulti dont see the point in making pve more difficult pve needs to be made more like pvp smarter ai less is more
another solution put a rock scanner on your barge use it from time to time and know how to read it have some vague clue of how much yield you pull per laser cycle stop your laser manually once the cycle has run long enough to finish off the asteroid in question by doing this you still gain the minerals youve extracted so far and the depleted rock vanishes on the rare occasions when i do mine this is exactly what i do and it works very wellalso dont use all your mining lasers on the same asteroid
while the people above me did give good examples of how to work around the issue they need to fix the issue instead of having people work around itits small things like this that really display how clunky eve isits almost as if when a ship was destroyed your computer still had it locked and you continued shooting rounds at its wreck until you ran out of ammo only less important cause its mining
liked being able to to add my own tracks small gang pvp to panteras vulgar display of power was da  and now its gone oh sure i could alttab away to some other means to play it but thats when something juicy comes through the gate and im three seconds behindat the least i miss a spot on the killmail at the most im halfway to blown upthis is like pulling abc sites from wspace nobody shoots at a statue or anything you just change it because dont you have enough real work to do without messing with the sweet sweet minutiae what did the jukebox ever do to youa bit of advice for ccpsleeping dogs leave em lie
no this was in eve early on and it was abused if it is possible then people will automate it and abuse itif you add a system that means you gain sp from an action it becomes a grind mechanic as it stand right now the skill system is fair and open to all with the removal of learning skills and the inclusion of attribute remaps we now train far faster then ever yes im aware of the slight drop but this only affected those with 55 learningyour idea will punish those without extra free time and reward those with any mechanic like this doesnt solve any problem but creates manyeve is a nongrinding nolevel classless passiveability realtime progression game so you shouldnt be able to train things faster no matter what repetition you do if faster speeds are your thing buy implantsdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
you can jump in an uberbattleship in exactly the same amount of time as it took me or any other vet player probably quite a bit faster as i started out in an industrial corp learning those skills i dont understad why you have such a problem with thisjint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
mining actually requires a decent amount of player activity to get the most out of it i fill up an orca in roughly 2 hours by myself how well a couple ml ii upgrades crystals and a survey scanner i know roughly what each 14 cycle gets me and usaully break in down like that i would say at my best i am 8085 efficient an afk miner is lucky to get 30

this isnt even slightly viable in normal situations he has 5 computers and takes hours to set this up maybe you want to say i dunno get your eve on wardec the  and pop him a few times just  maybe its free money i would if i could afford the wardec this is like the  biggest pile of cash ever its blocks of isk in space shoot it already stop whining over the most emergent gameplay and shoot it already
not seeing a problem tbhas has been said already wardec him if you have issues with itdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
ice isnt even worth mining the profit per hour is lower than kernite and veldspar looks like gold compared to kernite

the mission is to locate and eliminate x ships within a period of timethe npcs arelocatable with locator agentslocatable with dscan ship names provided in mission description probeable sig id provided in mission descriptionthey will avoid being destroyed level of difficulty is based on agent levelthe npcs will use some of the tactics players use includingwarping out to other celestials on player warping to location requiring use of the dscanwarping to safe spots requiring the player combat probe them outplaying station games requiring organized alpha or bumpingusing gates jumping and reapproaching and jumping or warping off based on aggression timersnpcs will escalate and deescalate their tactics based on level of interaction take on a cruiser in a belt with a kiting frig and take too long it will start jumping to celestials then perhaps dockup and warp to random sites then start docking up and insta undocking giving you a chance to probe it down to the point where it will bounce between safe spots making it almost impossible to get that rat till it starts deescalating its behaviorofficer rats warp off so code is already there to an extent it would take some time and effort to write the ai to provide this type of mission but i believe it would make peoples transition from nonpvp to pvp less problematic if they at least have some skills developed via a npc mechanic like thisit would all make for a fun mission that individuals and small groups could do and there are a few variables in there that could be tweaked either way to prevent excessive farmingnpc dont post km and they dont pod you  public presentations of your stupid deaths is something to be avoided so having a mission system that teaches these elements of pvp style play will relieve the would be teacher of the player once they decide to get into pvp
a few things come to mind first this idea goes way too far replicating exact player behavior for a large number of pvp scenarios isnt what pve developers should waste their time with teaching pvp is all fine and dandy but the best way to learn it is to go out and pvp its development cost free does the job better and allows pve devs to focus on actual pve content in the end pvp is about dealing with other individual people fighting npcs is never going to fully prepare you for itsecond why are you worried about excessive farming in a set pvp tutorial missions are you suggesting some heavy rewards for a system that is primarily meant for training players arent supposed to do them as a profession the point is to do them until you get the basics then get out and pvp there is no need to give incentives for people to keep grinding them so give them below normal missioning income potential or no income at all third it seems like youre just afraid to pay the learning fees of actual pvp im not talking about just the isk cost but the reality of having to repeatedly lose to other people in a competition your pvp learning missions arent going to change this no matter how many of them you do actual players arent in it to teach you and offer a predictable challenging encounter theyre in it to win at all costs they will post kms and pod you they will laugh at you mistakes and tease you about them its just part of the game and youre going to have to grow a bit thicker skin if you ever hope to get into pvp fourth tactics change replicating the commonly used tactics of the current game will only be useful for so long many tactics that ruled the battlefield of the past are bad or impossible today i question the rationality of trying to replicate them with a npc mechanic that is a poor imitation of the real deal and will be a constant drain for dev resources it will also teach bad habits that wont work in actual pvp or you dont want to teach to people is station camping basics really something you want to show and teach to everyone when you create a tutorial for it youre showing people its the way the game is meant to be played no matter your intentions im not saying there is anything wrong with the tactic but im saying its lame enough that you dont want to give hand holding guides on how to engage in it
in truth a pvp training mission should be very easy to dotwo parts first part you warp in use a gate restricting ship classes and have to quickly tackle a target to prevent it warping away have it try to run from you and generally require a scramweb to stop it from getting away  allow the mission to be repeated indefinitely although giving no standings boosts and very little reward  to complete successfully tackle and destroy the target loot it for a gate key and return to the agent to complete the mission  require 50 dps to break the tank of the main ship second part you warp in use a gate which requires  consumes the gate key from the first part and restricting ship class to t1 frigates only you land in the midst of 20 npc drone frigates with crap 5k bounties no loot and crap salvage they scram and web you and gank you  when your ship dies your agent convos you to explain it must have been a trap like most pvp in eve it then completes the mission and pays you a solid reward 510m isk when the mission complete trigger is finished there are no new spawns  to prevent you from escaping after you warp in each rats get 90 longrange webs and have long range scrams  to prevent you from blowing them all up every time you destroy one of the original frigates 100 additional npc drone frigates spawn with the same name and attack  if perchance you attempt to farm it 100 npc frigates giving 5k in bounties is only 500k isk if you somehow manage to kill every ship you would only earn 2000 npc x 5k  10m isk in bounties crap salvage ideally no salvage and no loot it wouldnt be worth your time to farm it  it would be a challenge type mission and people might bring in fleets to take it down let them they dont earn much isk doing it and requires some effort on their part to ascertain all the gate keyes not to mention things can go wrong pretty quickly upon completing these missions they learna how to tackle a ship and b to die then they are ready to start pvping as a newb in eve

cloakers keep the way they are they are awesomebutthey are somewhat scannable something like a disturbance in subspace frequencies  or something will be scannable and can be warped to but those things are rather something like a new grid which will be made anyways when the cloaker is in his safe spotthe peeps going to those grids have another way now to really get close to the cloakerspace depth chargesbasically bombs  charges that can be shot in general directions with a range of like 30k and will explode with a radios of like 750m 15k or 3k small  medium  large chargesso theres a way to get rid of afk cloakers online cloak pilots will always be able to just warp away  as the whole scanning process is still too slow to detect them they will always be one step ahead but the afk cloaking stops you have to actively search form them maybe even work together to be more effective one scans a couple of others bomb some others stay alert for sniping duties
so nerf cloaksok wheres the nerf that brings local down to go along with it  since you cant nerf one side of the coin and not the otherand what about wormhole space
would work the same way as it merely is an added feature to scanning plus a new module  chargecloaking in and by itself is not touched in any way you can still hide away but have to be active not just log in and go ut with your friends and expect to still be there when you get home drunk
so on top of the instant infallible local intel you also want the ability to find and kill cloaked shipssorry no thats imbalanced and it utterly destroys wormhole space mechanicshighsec is that way bro 
i dont know what game you are playing and what you are reading i want a cloakign mechanic that requires cloaky pilots to be actively at their machines palying the game i disdain any afk activity that has direct or indirect effect on the game and  or activities of other players
1 we dont need your depth charges when we have smart bombs with bigger explosion radiussand even stealth bomber boms with a 15 km explosion radius 2 while i agree that a specialty set of probes with long scan cycles 60s and would probably be optimal for scanning down a cloaked vessel in a manner that doesnt disrupt their primary role you completely missed the point of gunslinger42s posta if you can scan down cloaked ships you can basically purge a wh of hostiles or at least purge the system of online and active hostiles which breaks one of the fundamental principles of a wh in a wh you never know you are alone so there is an everpresent danger with your suggestion a pilot can always just scan a wh and determine if any unknown players are in system you might as well add a local count to the delayed chat window if your going to implement this b local chat is an infallible omniscient intel tool that instantly provides you with information on everyone in system this near perfect intel allows you to determine how safe a nullsec system is by identifying potentially hostile pilots in system with the ability to purge those pilots even if they are cloaked from a system we end up with 100 safe nullsec systems this might sound like a wetdream to the average nullbear but it is not how nullsec should function living in nullsec is not about removing all dangers from your system its about adapting to the dangers and living with them people wouldnt use afk cloaky alts parked in your system all day if the intel system was nerfed enough to allow a roaming gang to actually catch more than afk pilots afk cloakers are the only means by which to undermine local as an intel tool yet you currently have many options to deal with afk cloakers if  you didnt tempt them with blingy targets you adapted to them and became difficult targets for the afk cloaker to attack you adapted to them and operated in a system without an afk cloaker
whilst pilots are cloaked and afk what mechanic are they using to interact with you destination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
oh look its that time of the week for the wah afk cloakers thread
psychologythough i am not sure that counts as a game mechanic
i see it almost the same as afk mining but thats just me i guess seems the big shots love it
also what i dont understand i am not proposing a ever hit weapon and surefy way to kill cloakies its not its a way to find afk cloakers thats all active pilots can and will get away very easilyso you think players not actually sitting in front of their pcUFFFDs but are something the game needs and that it should be a viable tactic props to thatwhy not make eve playable while surfing forums and postingstrange
you didnt answer the questionill clarify itwhilst they are cloaked and afk what game mechanic are they using to interact with youdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
no you misunderstand the intentions herewe think there is a problem with local and the workaround is to park an afk cloaker in a system so they are always present thereby diminishing the value of the local intel and allowing for sneak attacks of a form your idea is a tool to eliminate the work around without addressing the fundamental reason people are employing it
see and thats why i though not about and i do understand and see your point still afk pilots are just apain in the arse and i dont like poeple playing a game being afk
many of the games core functions operate whilst we are afk but how someone chooses to play is not your concern they pay and play how they wish as long as its within the eulathis situation is about cause and effect cloaks only show an effectthe fact you can cause the same psychological effects without a cloak should tell you youre barking up the wrong treedestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
cant say i agree pvp is combat whereas pve is a way to grind isk like mining or trading personally i found the ai changes just made missions even more tedious than they were before rather than challengingi did like the suggestion earlier in the thread to remove the ai change but make drones manually controlled before the ai change you had to manually control them a lot of the time or they had the habit of wandering off rather than targeting as a group so just make all drone targeting manual and that also removes any issues of afk missioners
if you like this idea please vote for it clicking on the thumbs up icon at the top right of this pageheya guysto start off this is my first topic on assembly hall and one of only a few times posting on the forums but there comes a time where every person feels the need to speak up and this is mine im going to do my best to bring up factual and concrete points about missiles and propose solutions im sure people will disagree with me over some of my points thats fine lets try to keep things civil and work through this issue for the good of the gamethe general point i feel that missiles have become underrepresented and much less effective than other weapons platforms in their current incarnation with a focus mainly on medium to large weapons systemsfirst lets take a look at what kind of representation we get from missile boats in different categories im sure ill miss a few if i do please remind me of them and ill add themmissionswhs  on the whole missile boats suffer the least in missions the corax and caracal are both great at lower level missions the drake had bridged the gap in the middle but with the recent heavy missile nerfs and the upcoming changes in 11 go read them if you havent ill wait its taking another significant loss in every aspect except base dps loss of 1 hardpoint is somewhat made up for by gain in kinetic damage bonus although it does continue the painful trend of being locked into 1 damage type while the drakes missioning days certainly arent over its much less effective than it was the tengu is a very spintensive boat but its another good one then we have the raven and its variants and the scorpion and its variants the golem is arguably the best mission boat in the game so we can say that overall missile boats are decent in missions although at the higher end killing smaller boats is painful and requires multitudes of target painters to pull off especially after the recent npc ai changes causing drones to get popped consistentlysounds good so far right well this is where it goes downhillpvp  previously the drake was one of the biggest goto ships in pvp unfortunately after the heavy missile nerf and the upcoming massive roundtheboard nerf coming in 11 it will likely no longer be the gained mass and lost agility will see podla drakes being much less effective and theyre losing shield and well everything else on top of that so the drake is out that leaves essentially just the caracal the caracal is a fine pvp boat but its not that great and that essentially makes 1 viable pvp boat for missilesincursions  well nuff said here okay fine missile boats get laughed out of incursions the tengu is somewhat viable in incursions but basically theres boats that can do anything the tengu can in incursions but better raven and scorpion variants are just bad unfortunately the flight time means sniping is out even if youre timing really well or just plain dpsing the tertiary targets and for close range torpedoes missiles are on the low end of being competitive with the added bonus that were vastly less effective against smaller ships than other platforms even if we have target painters crammed into every orifice of the shipat the end of the day where does this leave us we have a few ships that are somewhat viable in each category but we dont excel at anything in many cases were last choicelets have a look at why going through each of the missile typesheavy assault missiles  hams are fairly decent right now at the low end the range is bad the ability to hit small targets is bad but the damage is alright and because of the lowish range the volley time isnt too much of an issueheavy missiles  while heavy missile dps may appear to compare with other weapons platforms on the surface it doesnt between very slow missile travel time meaning we lag on initial dps and often fire extra volleys before ships are destroyed even with careful timing and the recent range and damage nerfs theres no real reason to use heavy missiles anymore take into account that one of our 3ish viable medium missile platforms is shoehorned into always using kinetic and you have a fairly losing combinationcruise missiles  cruise missiles are where everything starts to fall apart cruise dps is low on all of our ships we can almost get competitive enough to do the same paper dps as other snipers but we all know it cant compare in any given fleet op our dps is slow to come to bear and we almost always lose a volley with our last shots this means that on any given target if we arent going ahead of the normal kill order were losing 2 volleys this is not only an expensive waste of resources its also 2 useless volleys closer to having to reload and a massive chunk of our paper dps gone add to that our inability to hit small targets even painted ones effectively and cruise missiles are 6 feet under at least a skilled pilot can maneuver his or her ship to hit small targets with other weapon types we cant ive seen it said before that at least you guys always hit but hitting for damage so slight it can be repped away by a frigate isnt really consolation in my opiniontorpedoes  for starters theres essentially 1 ship that can fit torpedoes the golem its a great ship too bad it has to waste 23 midslots on target painters huh its great damage is perfect for lvl 4 missions and nothing else in the game which essentially means we have an entire weapon type thats used on 1 ship for 1 niche thing not including covert ops of course on which its essentially an entirely different weapon so what do we do to fix itproposed solutions in the next post
one of the biggest problems is obviously the flight time of missiles but thats also one of the most distinguishing features of missiles and id hate to lose that if we take away the flight time they become retextured hybrid turrets so proposed solutionsmissile speed increases exponentially with itUFFFDs flight time this would have a big impact on the longer distance weapons especially it would keep the feel of UFFFDmissilenessUFFFD intact by launching slowly but reach longer targets much quicker itUFFFDs an especially elegant solution because the farther the target is away the better of a buff it is this would help long range missiles have a place in the world again sniping it should be possible to make the missile travel time out to 45 km vary and anything higher than that have the acceleration so fast itUFFFDs nearly instantaneous still looks like a missile still feels like a missile but doesnUFFFDt suck like a missile the added bonus to this solution is that it also doesnUFFFDt devalue any other weapons platforms by buffing the missiles directly it just brings them closer to the normships gain better bonuses for missiles first of all damage specific bonuses need to go the way of the dinosaur ccp keeps agreeing with me on this and keeps delaying it on so many of their ships they even recently added the corax which has a kinetic bonus while at the same time making blog posts and talks about removing these types of bonuses velocity bonuses could be increased and to be brutally honest either the golems target painter bonus needs to be given to almost every medium or larger missile boat or something needs to change internally with missile accuracymissiles gain smaller explosion radii with more flight time this could tie in with the missile speedsUFFFD increase this would not only make life much easier for us it would make missiles feel more special and different instead of just making us do crap for damage to any small boat we could have an advantage by being farther off from them this would allow small ships to UFFFDget under our gunsUFFFD somewhat like they do on other ships and force us to fit less target painters and rigs to hit said smaller ships this is another elegant solution this would have a much bigger impact on long range missiles than it would on torpedoesrockets keeping UFFFDunguidedUFFFD missiles better against larger ships and UFFFDguidedUFFFD missiles better against smaller targets but also giving a buff to bothlastly and i know people donUFFFDt want to hear this missiles need a straight damage bonus in a lot of cases because of the flight time and lost volleys of missiles they should in my opinion be 1020 more dps than comparable sized weapons this sounds huge but itUFFFDs something thatUFFFDs been missing for a long time long range missiles should be closer to the 20 mark and short range closer to the 10 mark this would push missiles to being likely the top platform for solo play which is fine someone has to be on top and get us up to at least the viable mark in other situations straight damage buffs are always hard to convince both ccp and the player base of but honestly itUFFFDs timeapologies for the massive wall of text please donUFFFDt forget to post and 1 if you agree and hereUFFFDs hoping i might see some of you guys in an incursion someday in a missile boat
supported 1 though im not so sure about buffing the dps by the level you are suggestingthere has always been a trade off between lower dps and flight time but a guaranteed hit which should be maintained imv however the last nerf went a bit too far and should be looked at again
rock scanner is a goodnear perfect example of eve design imoie if you are solo and you bring it you are losing a midslot from your tank for your yield optimisation good eve designif you have an orca then you can use it whenever you need info and then put the tank back  ie further benefit of having a gang foreman in the foreman ship with its refit in space capabiility good eve designif you wish to fly manually around not having it  i put it on the iteron alt thats hauling the cans or i take a frigate through and derive a notion of how big i expect the average rock to be and just mine 1 cycle short of that average might overrun a few times per belt mehagain good design because i can stupidly or intelligently work around it not being there
if hes not in npc corps id be surprisednerf npc corps imo
in response to b you learn how to die in the tutorial missions as is theres a mission that has loss of your ship as a requirementdestination is right the best way to learn is to fly out there and start losing ships left and right
only if you dont read the mission briefing or look at the warnings in localmost newbies ive come across always assume the destruction of your ship in that particular mission to be a glitch or bug and not part of the mission itselfwhat is needed is a mission where losing your ship is clearly stated in the briefing and is more or less an actual goal

an endless battle er i dont think that a mission that cant be completed is a good idea i dont want to be still fighting this endless battle in a hundred years
well thanks for the bump even if your whole intention was to trollanyway that mission was a single engagement thats easily and quickly completed however the battle against the pirate factions is always ongoing thus making it endlessdmc
i ike the idea one extra suggestion instead of maing 4 factional version make one faction version available throguh interbus all the best mining ships come from ore why arent their any specialty ships from interbus
because the interbus would absolutely not be involved with something utilized for warfare purposes neither would ore for that matter even in a logistical sense asthey aim to maintain their neutrality so they can continue to do business with all four empires that is the primary reasoning behind the four racial faction variations each race would develop one and the others would step up to create competitioni am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
i put my isk in the jukebox and the whole thing disappeared  why cpp whyoh the clonemanityuntil you have a real physics engine so my spaceship does not float like a souped up camino and gravity in the game the only reason i log in is to look at the pretty colours and listen to the juke
listing to it on youtubemy lordy it was such a beautiful part of the game why dismiss itdismiss the characters swishy walks instead
needing a 3rd party app just to listen to eve soundtrack does not look like an improvement not even in the most favorable conditionand just in case ccp developers need a hint on how it is to play eve without a jukebox mining in a system and listening the same 3 tracks for 40 minutes is not a favorable condition
any attempt to address cloaking as a mechanic must meet 3 prereqs1 address the omnipotence of local as an intel tool and the extreme advantages it gives to the defender2 address stations and their perfect 247 protection for the defenders anytime 1 provides them with intel on hostiles3 in no way shape or form ruins my wormholes i mean it you break our holes well come after you and you dont want a bunch of angry wormholers having a vendetta against your alliance doesnt end well
ohh look another i suck at eve and want you to nerf something because i suck thread
i like these changes and it makes sense too since a missile has an on board engine itll keep accelerating which is something that always kinda bugged mealso these changes might make the nighthawk worth a damm again

this thread now delivers with added ironydestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
so im going to lay out a major problem that is happening around the warzone in fw i know others have had similiar problems trying to catch ratters in combat sites but please refrain from posting about it here as these two ideas are not the sameas it stands one of the ways to acqure lp in fw is to run lvl 4 missions thoughout lowsc for those of you who dont know these missions spawn a beacon in space for everyone to see and anyone to warp to an element of risk that justifies the rewards earned but since the npc ai mechanics were changed that element of risk has become a joke in fw youre on a choosen side of the war fighting for your faction in plexes the faction rats on your side will help defend you if well call that and will not shoot you working as intenedfast forward to mission sites when you go into an enemys mission site meaning youre going into a room full of your own faction rats they immediately begin to shoot you working as intendedi think notwhat good does it do to provide mission runners a full room of rat aggro to protect them from wts and neutrals that is risk free lp making a noton that i thought ccp was trying to curve something has to be fixed here and fixed quickly call me crazy but i dont think your own faction rats should switch to you in mission sitesregardless of the new ai mechanics a safegurad needs to be set in place so that faction rats from your own fw faction do not shoot you in plexes and in missions
except they dontrat ai aggros on ewar point counts as ewarproblem you have a point fitted your dangerous opponent doesnt therefore rats aggro yousolution dont fit a point your dangerous opponent isnt why are youif both of you have points rats aggro the guy whos been there shooting them longer if both of you have no points rats aggro the guy whos been there shooting them longerif you have point and your dangerous opponent doesnt he cant point youyou cant loseoh wait you were just looking for riskfree pvp i have a better idea why dont ccp just give you free km
youe missing the point in your trolling this isnt everyday combat sites where i want a tasty km i signed up for fw where i can freely shoot my wts and i fight to defend my factionby fighting for my faction that implies i support them and they support me in teturn its a benefit to being in fw it makes no sense for them shoot me i hve signed up to help them and receive help

the most challenging part of the game is pvp and you have won the fight before you have started if the opponent is ignorant of the game mechanics pves job is to teach game mechanics pve should be a challenge the better the ai the betteri would like to see missions that emulate a large number of pvp scenarios this is what i think pve should be all aboutim not i just added it so people wouldnt respond with some long winded argument about farmingno but i dont see a problem with providing an against the computer challenge for players of the game if the timefun ratios are right they will be another choice for pve playersi wont quote you directlyyou simply argue that pvp tactics should only be taught by pvpi think your whole argument revolves around pve being pve and pvp being pvp and never the twain shall meetwhy should against the computer be a completely different to pvp in play stylei would like missions that let me experience these tactics in a pve scenario in highsec against rats which dont pod dont loot your wreck and dont post km
on the fourth point i actually agree with destination skillqueue computer ais are inherently predictable once you understand how they prioritize things even the much vaunted sleeperincursion ai is predictableplayers on the other hand are fairly irrational and make choices based on what they thinkfeel they can pull off and that sometimes requires you to play a meta game of sorts with cannot be coded into an npcfor exampleyou are in a cruiser looking for a fight but no one wants to fight you even though they are all in cruisers too how do you remedy this you can ship down into something that looks innocuous but can take on a ship lager than it like an incursus breecher merlin punisher etcnow people seem more interested in engaging you but they are still holding back probably because you have a bunch of corpmates in system this means you have to get most of your people to move away to another system for a small bit just to get the fight rolling and you still have to contend with the threat that anyone who engages you might have support just in case so you have to get your guys to hang around in another system ready to jump in and warp to you an ai cant teach you this kind of stuff no matter how advanced
reviving a thread i made several months ago to spark new conversation this is something that desparately needs to be implementedseveral years ago i heavily advocated for an ingame display of when time was less than 10 days it was welcomed with open arms ccp even took interest with one of their dev blogs for a winter release however we still do not have any visibility of when our game time will end when paying by cc or any service other than plex the plex status does nothing but give you words of encouragement that your account is in good standing even though its going to end in 10 minutes because you paid with a credit card and there are no funds on the card when i pay with plex i know 2 weeks in advance when my account will endi hereby propose an ingame modification to show exactly when your game time will end and the last method used some of you will say wahh use the account management site noob and i will kindly direct you to the door this proposal is for the transparency of when your account will end no matter where you decide to check on iteven if you use autopay your bills in real life you still receive a statement of when it is due each month
there already is a statement when your account expires in account management and in the api how much stupid proofing does your world need
supported
thats like going online to view your cable statement because they refuse to mail it to you
no its going online to check your expiration date when youre already onlineunless youre asking a paper statement of when your account expires to be mailed to you in which case your analogy is correct and even more laughable
hey what can i say some people really enjoy jumping through hoops to find out when their account is ending personally i dont want my account to end during something importantnot to mention that even using the ingame browser you have to not only log in a 2nd time you already logged in to the game but you now also have to type out the name of your character then navigate to find when your account endsmy proposal allows you to click the character sheet click plex status and see account valid until x date a method much easier and faster when you have multiple accounts
if the information is available and bridgeable by ccp into an in game display presented in the character sheet then why not present that information in game why make it so that you need to log into another interface entering the same login details again to check out when your account expires they have already done it to an extent they need to finish the jobthe whole point is if it can be done why not do it arguing that its not broken because there is a method already is just being obstructionist to innovation
quick fix use evemon it picks up when the account expires from the api
when you inject plex in game it tells you the date when sub runs out in a popup window there already is a plex tab but for some reason it doesnt tell you how subscription time ending date the notification is already in game the plex tab is already in game put the notification in the plex tab
after a 45 year hiatus from the game one of the first 5 things i looked for when i returned was the jukeboxbeing able to select your own song at will was one of the more unique aspects of the game in fact the music in this game helps to add to the immersion the music is almost hypnotic in that it helps you forget you are in your chair in front of your computer and perhaps actually out there in space with your shipalthough it could be the cannabis helping as wellthe music in this game really adds to the atmosphere in my opinion so perhaps instead of a mp3 player a play list that you can put on default game settings but the player will always have the ability go to the play list and pick a song out that you want while in game or a setting that just goes through the play listpersonally i would keep that in game music player right at the bottom right of my screen so i could see what song is playing after all how else did we learn what songs we loved now new players will never know lower or increase the volume this was helpful in those mission where this obnoxious loud music starts to play that is in total contrast to what you have been hearing prior to that its all about player choicedevs can do their thing make it default and allow us to choose if we wishplease add this back the jukebox and the music really stood out for me and did cross my mind when i was thinking about resubscribing

for a long time fleet miners have needed a survey scanner that matches the mining range of their bargesas it is essential to have the scanner on the barge itself in order to mine efficiently by lockingunlocking on asteroids directly from the scanner having the scan bonus on the capital ship is ineffectualthis is especially so now that hulks are purposed for fleet mining theyre likely to always have an increased laser range their laser range is 26km and the best scanner is 22 leaving a sizable hole proposala role bonus for hulks to boost survey scanner rangeorextend capital ship bonus to fleet members perhaps as a leadership skillorincrease range of survey scanner iiorfleet shared survey scanner results added per buzzy warstl
or have an orca in fleet that does this for you
thank for for your reply but please do read the thread before making a kneejerk form replyas it is essential to have the scanner on the barge itself in order to mine efficiently by lockingunlocking on asteroids directly from the scanner having the scan bonus on the capital ship is ineffectual
a mixed bag here but there are some definite wins i think especially for long range missile types and the ships like cruise ravens and cerbs that are built around themactually itd be a steady linear increase as deltav  adeltat but the concept behind this idea is sound and even having velocity linearly increase with flight time would be a major help for controling the flighttime woes missile snipers currently facemaybe not better but the idea of deleting damagetypespecific bonuses could be workable longtermyou have the explosion radius mechanic backwards unfortunately increasing explosion radius actually decreases damage to small targets and this would be such a major change to missile mechanics in any case that i doubt i could support itunfortunately i think that this last step would make missiles too overpowering which would be quite aggravating for 00 fleet fights missiles should not be a dominant weapon at that scale
op is referring to fw missions so 1 besides this is very bad behavior from fw rats in general think of it like being awoxed and youll get what i mean
in other words fw ppl are special and thus exempt from rules the rest of us have to follow
so your theory is that ccp gave all fw mission rats shipscanners so that they attack pvp fitted ships exclusivelyreason why it must be ship scanner the second you enter grid you are locked and fired upon by the entire room  no module activation no movement nothing  greatest awox mechanic in eve historyquestion i need answered since ccp has yet to fix what must be a massive bug is whether people exploiting it will be punished or if they get the blind eye is customary for gm handling of fw petitions what is to stop me apart from my unwillingness to use alts me from taking a mission and tanking the entire room with a hostile alt as npc literally stop aggressing the mission runner when a friendly entersthankfully it is of only minor import today as mission lp cannot hope to compete with regular fw plex farming lp but still annoying that such an obvious bugoversight has survived this long or even made it out of testing
your riskfree km farming is now no longer easy such injustice we are crying tears of blood for youhave you ever thought of fighting ships that has a point but wait thats dangerous you can lose your boat
precisely this
thishave the orca broadcast the asteroids for you
i did read it as shah pointed out it is not essential for a barge to have an ore scanner to mine effectively the tools are already available in game to allow you to do this efficiently hint it requires teamwork
the entire premise of the thread is fleet mining with a capital ship restating that a capital ship should be present when mining with a capital ship is a fairly clear indicator that you didnt read it and are trolling
but you arent a miner so you dont get it and are just trollingminers lock and unlock asteroids directly from the scan result window not the overview  where the status of each asteroid can bee seenthe capital ship having a scan result window does not allow the miner to lock on asteroids from it so barges must have the scannerhulks being fleet purposed barges should have a scanning ability at least equal to their laser range
just because i disagree with the reason you think you need this additionalteration does mean im trolling and i have mined in the distant past the orcarorqual scanned stuff and broadcasted the best roids we targeted and minedand you can do the same using the broadcast windowno they dont the orcarorqual simply needs to broadcast which asteroids are best
last i checked a hulk is not a capital ship i read your post  understood it perfectly i just disagreed labelling anyone that disagrees with you as a troll doesnt help your argumentif wed never mined at any stage we wouldnt be giving you solid advice on this just because we choose to no longer mine does not mean that we know nothing about it we get where youre coming from but the tools youre asking for already exist in the form of orca  rorqual bonuses as they are mining support ships
having the orca call targets is fine with 2 or 3 people but add in 5 or 6 and its a nightmare letting the miners decide how to mine is best way to ensure max efficiency no missed cycles no burning crystals and no doubling up on rocksif the orca had a way of assigning rocks to people that wasnt a fleet broadcast then great but the current method sucksadd in that offgrid boosting exists and there you are survey scanner ii needs a range boost
and if you have three toons and only one monitor wtf then
window mode
the nonminers really dont get it do theythe point of the scanner isnt to know which rocks are best its to know when to turn off your mining lasers so that you dont waste 50 or more of a cycle on a dead asteroid this is not information that can be transmitted from the support ship as they dont have all the data necessary to make that calleditwhat would be really useful is to have ships in a fleet share scanner results for any type of scanner automaticallywe have that whole subspace network thing going it would make sense for such primitive data to be shared out along with general telemetry and such
they tell me i dont pay attention then proceed to not pay attentioni used to mine i did it for a couple of years the thing youre asking for is easy to manage with other people if your orca pilot cant give you a number when he scans the ore  do a tiny bit of math that takes a split second to process then you need a more competent orca pilot its kind of like fcing a fleet only much easiernow this is a far better proposition one that i would actually get behind
the barge pilot needs to be able to see how ore levels have changed in order to unlock asteroids before they deplete from the scanner window so he unlocks the correct laser otherwise he wastes cycle time on empty asteroids with many asteroids having only 12 cycles in them this is a constant process and not doing it can cut your m3hr by upwards of 40the only way to mine efficiently is for the scanner to be on the barge
i actually support this sort off i want option dto explain increasing the range of an asteroid scanner isnt a big game breaking thing although i dont want to boost the t2meta 4 to do this so i propose option d d add an ore faction survey scanner mod with the appropriate range this will fullfill the needed range but cost you appropriately why this option 1 it creates an additional piece of bling to be fit on the barge piUFFFData 2 it uses up a valuable midslot thereby weakening the potential tank of the mining vessel
the op is correctscanners must be on the hulks hulk pilots need to constantly monitor asteroid levels in order to efficiently manage their laser cyclesonly trolls and nonminers give the dur an orca kan du eet dur answergood idea long overduethe hulk role bonus is the most selective of the proposals with the least auxiliary impact1
no no need for a role bonuses just make a faction mod to get that extra 20 range you covet
the role bonus still takes up the tank slot you covet
but a t2 scanner isnt worth much an ore faction scanner might actually be worth 2550m which is an important piece of the gankvaluetolootvalue ratio

op how about learning how to use search seeing a 1001st genius coming up with that idea gets well mighty boring
tarunik youre right i meant to put the missile should have a smaller radius with its flight time not a bigger one i edited the op for clarity thanks for the typo noticecan you expand on why missiles shouldnt be a dominant weapon on the fleet scale im not saying any one weapon should be i think ccp should try for as close to an even representation as possiblei wouldnt go so far as to say that all of these proposed solutions should be taken its more of a jumble of ideas out of which the best should be refined and worked on until we have missile feeling missiles that are still viablethanks for the upvotes heres to us using missiles in the future
a painfully bad thread even by ah standards
if you have a problem with the post please bring facts to the table or refrain from posting putting something like this is inflammatory and unhelpful
addressing the guaranteed hit issueit is certainly nice that missiles never miss but at the end of the day guns get the better end of the bargain by far with skilled piloting and a good fit guns can do full damage to smaller craft meanwhile missiles will always do trivial damage no matter how good the pilot while i agree that missiles shouldnt do full dps to small craft they should do a bit more than they do now for sure
a well flown small ship will negate all the dps of bigger ships ive speed tanked small guns in frigate hulls and easily speed tank medium and large guns the drake is still good at pvp especially in smallmedium gangs also its not getting supernerfed in the upcoming expansion like you are implying i personally think you are exaggerating the missile nerfs
have you ever flown interceptors against a rack of large guns what do you do move carefully so it doesnt get the low transversal at any given time on approach and oneshot youagainst a rack of large missiles what do you do oh thats right you ignore them
i solo vagabonds rapiers hurricanes and cynabals in a taranis even dual webbed i can get under their guns and solo them but against a hm or ham drake the drakes constant dps will brake my tank before i can break his assuming im webbed and the pilot has good missile skills
the main issue with missiles being a dominant weapon on the 00 fleet scale is the kind of damage it inflicts on server hampsters if missiles werent a major lag source i wouldnt have mentioned this 
yeah noticed it alsoin past rats would not engage you at all if you had good standing with them this created the standing tanking problem where missioners could run the mission without being shot at it seems ccp solved that by making the faction npcs friendly fire but well the priorities are a bit wrong 
you can run those missions with pvp ships warp out and fight the guy at the gate you are not forced to use pve boats and cry every time you die to someone while you make your isk thats the main balancing mechanic in eve risk and profit if you can make a large profit without risk its not balanced
oddly enough this does seem like legit oversight by ccp if a gallente fw player warps into a caldari plexers site and opens fire on said plexer why would the fed navy open fire on one of its capsuleer bros no omfg he turned on an offensive ecm module shoot him disregard that friendly fof doesnt defeat common sense
no im not expecting the ai to deliver that level of experiencenpc escalation may be predictable but the celestials they warp to and safe spots they make dont have to be static in fact it would be a lot more complicated to make it like that there has to be a level of randomness else there is simply no pointteach the mechanics of eve and put them to practice in pve so when players do attempt to pvp they dont sit there thinking its because i dont have awu5 that i failedim not suggesting these missions give the players a green line in space  to manually fly along im suggesting a simple interesting mission which develops skills relevant to the game generally

i hope ccp is looking at this thread this is an awesome idea
cmon ccp i hope you are watching this thread
id be perfectly happy if they left everything exactly the same and just removed the hard cap to refining waste
pro tip dont mine multiple rocks at the same time focus on one mining at half cycles if necessary mining 23 rocks ar the same time is over complicating it but the scanner could still buffed a bit
harden up and take it like a man teamwork organization and communication should be the only tools needed to accomplish effective mining
lol 99 of the mining in eve is done solo even if you an see orca with a 34 hulks chances are it is the same person
even with me and one other pilot in a belt together it can be hard simply to determine what rocks the other is mininghaving a system in place to tag asteroids  the current system blows best option make it so you can see fleet locks in the overview next to the target
completely support thisa completely decked out hulk  with faction strips max boosts can get up to 40km out  if i remember taus post on it correctlya survey scanner ii can currently only reach 22kmsurvey scanner iis should be able to reach out to a maxd miners range  about 2930 km  with appropriate ship  skill bonusesadding a faction scanner to reach out to that max range around 40km would be perfect  i know id use one100 for the op for you harden up  use an orca folks  go troll elsewhere lets see you tell 30 miners what rocks they need to target and how much ore is left in themand youll need to do it sitting in the belt in a rorqual because the orca doesnt have the range to reach the farthest rocks in those really big grav siteslearn to understand what youre talking about before make posts that are otherwise nonconstructiveeditanother good thread here about this in fihrolt ceo live free die proud

ehh why not just say something like natural phenomena prevents your probes from detecting cloaked ships or already present spacial distortions makes the results of the scanning prosess uselesstho removing local wud be awesome
about the lag maybe its just me but i feel like players shouldnt be penalized for the games flaws if ccp cant make missiles viable they probably should just take them out i know id appreciate having all my missile sp transferred over to gunnery after realizing how bad they areim not implying that the drake is getting super nerfd really the fact of the matter is it doesnt take a super nerf to make dramatic changes in the balance of power the fact of the matter is though that other than pure paper dps the drake is taking a nerf to every single thing cap tank speed and agility gizznitt while youre absolutely right that in your situation a drake is a great counter the fact of the matter is that after 11 youll be in the vast minority of players that will be in that position i should also remind you that pointing out that a ship is effective in one situation doesnt imply that its a good or viable ship

sucking it up does not mean putting a scanner on the orca as the miners here have explained to the nonminers its impossible to fleet mine efficiently without scanners on the hulks themselves or otherwise being able to directly lockunlock directly from the scan result windowso sucking it up means not utilizing hulks extended laser range and being limited by the 22km scanner range this means you suck the meat out of the center of belt and leave the fringes before moving on to a new belt to do the same to itthis leaves fewer worthwhile belts for other miners people mine less ore prices go up and all you nonminers pay more for everythingevery orcahulk pilot worth his salt already has a scanner on his hulks this proposal just allows these fleet miners to ultilize their laser range bonus
how about a modulated strip miner iii that has a reduced output compared to modulated strip miner ii but includes a asteroid scanner that has the same including boosts range as the strip miner iii does that is accessed via the existing ship scanner interface which should be where any scanning results should be anyway imho
i support this completely those that use the standardunoriginal reply use an orcarorq are just arguing to argue i dont think they realize yet that its not convincing anyone who mines regularly either this change is such a nonissue to anyone other than those that mine its also stupidly uncontroversial incredibly easy to change and completely benign to game balance the benefits would be very welcome to anyone who mines with orcarorq booststhe two options that work the best increase the range of the t1 and t2 scanners its simple seriously this is changing a number right and gets the desired effect add a ore faction scanner with the 3035km range this adds a new item but creates a market for something useful keeps within the spirit of the game conflict in ore ring ore is the provider of the top quality mining gear etc and creates a positive incentive to obtain itanother option that might work but is harder to change is to link the range to the survey skill its not like the skill is incredibly useful now anyway say have a base range then with each level increase by 5 or 10 in any case this change really is a nobrainer no over thinking required
id rather see them add a volume column to the scanner before they started messing around with the range of the scannervolume is the only real piece of information i want from my scanner not units not distance but volumeget me a column displaying volume then ill give a  about the range

if i recall from the earlier days in eve we used to have on the job trainingonce per day or some other such timeframe you had a chance to gain skillpoints towards skills you were actively engaged in using so you might get a few hundred bonus skillpoints or some such on several skills a day if you were actively using them it wasnt much in the grand scheme of things but at the time it felt awesomei am a supporter of this as using a skill both should make it easier to learn if you are actively training it and you should gain some benefit from practicing skills that you already have some knowledge of i think it should be limited to one bonus per day per skill usedso if you were operating your t1 ship spaceship command could get 100250 sp if you were shooting your small beam laser i at someone you could get 100250 sp in small energy turret or controlled bursts or sharpshooting etcbut maybe limit it to like 510 skills per dayand give it a 5 chance per skill being actively used each time it is usednow the devils advocatei do not support it if it would decrease performance in any significant way
sigh forum ate my post so im going to tldr this since i really dont feel like being eloquent twice sorry if this comes off as rudeshould this be done no absolutely notwhy would require tens of thousands of if statements in code in order to cover all the possibilities of what a player is doing actively while not exploiting the system this will make it very likely for something to break in the code and would add stress to the server thats not needed would cause a huge number of petitions of players complaining they didnt get their xp when they should have again adds stress to ccp thats not needed would kill a number of nonskill related professions such as running events organizers of frigate free for all anyone helping rookies via local chat players spending hours at a time cloaked watching for enemy movement and so on would instigate grinding mechanics into the game which would turn off a huge number of players i for one left wow because i hated grinding to level 90 and hated grinding for better and better gear eve has enough grinding from isk generation and standings and the former can be solved by plex worse eve would have what would considered to be infinite grinding where theres no limit to how much you need to grind to complete all the skillswhat do i suggest instead ccp released 2x training speed for new players at one point in that until a character reaches a certain xp level say 5 million that they train skills at twice the speed stackable by implants this will give new players that edge you speak of without ripping off veterans
greetingsas im sure everyone well knows as this point the availability of the mining foreman mindlink has become ludicriously poor i remember a time when mfms were 50m now 15 billion i know that this is because a they are no longer available in complexes and b theres a slim chance theyll drop in the special shipyard theft mission and a slimmer chance youll even get this missionthough this issue also applies to the other links the mfm has become so costly that i personally never use that implanted head anymore because its too costly to risk to fly in spaceit should be a fairly simple fix by either adding this link to more special missions or to add them to rare complexes though it will still make them pricy they wont cost nearly as much as they are now which is more than pretty much every other implant currently in the market today the prices of these mindlinks are dramatically hurting largescale mining as a profession thank you
supply and demand nothing wrong with it people fly with far more than 15 bil in their heads all the time in ships more fragile than an orca in space more dangerous than highsec parked in grids less comfortable than next to a posits fine as is some incentive for people to do missions in gallante space hoping to get that particular storyline not everything in game has to be dirt cheap especially something non combat related thats essentially a one time investment
well when you get into the blob meta its hard to avoid these sorts of issues i agree that the drake ought to be just as viable as any other ship at small scale pvp its just that its hard to do that without turning it into a dominant piece in blobwarfare which causes the distinct odor of burnt hampsters to waft over from london to iceland
the drake is perfectly viable for smalltomedium gang warfare before and after the changesfor fleet warfare well see i dont do a lot of 100man fleet fights the tengu is also perfectly viable for smalltomedium gang warfare and im pretty sure its still perfectly viable for large fleet fights toothe caracal is a niche fleet but still used in small and medium gang warfare to excellent effect go look at what the cfc did to hbc this last weekend in their caracal fleetfor small gang stuff the corax condor and hookbill are all decent missile boats i really just dont buy your woe is missile attitude cruise missiles are going to be revamped come next expansion with the bs changestorps now that they get bonuses from all missile skills are much much better since the release of retribution hams are awesome and hms are right where they are supposed to beyes you are right they are nerfing some fo the drakes features but so what the drake was one of the top two most useful bcs in the game and both the top bcs are getting nerfed while the other bcs are getting buffed to make all ships useable overall you should be putting ccp frozzie on a pedestal washing his feet and giving him divine praises for the excellent job of balancing hes been doing to all ships in this game your thread here is nothing but a craptastic whine about how your niche is changing without even considering the bigger picture do us all a favor and thread
i disagree thats like saying that someone that lives in a 3rd world warzone consents to being potentially killed when they step outsideeve is brutal yes but it isnt wow in wow you explicitly consent to pvp depending on server of course in eve its out of your hands but it does not mean tha you consent to it

here here agreed 100 i loved that jukebox because it allowed me to play music i wanted and that whenever im doing something that has special event music kick in it would seemlessly stop my music to start everything elsesure having an external jukebox makes sense but it was so much cooler dif theres a way to combine the new system with the old jukebox kudos
i also completely support this it should be easy to implement and does not break any other features in my opinion there are no real reasons not to
just increase the survey scanner iis rangebuffing the hulk even more would just introduce an even bigger incentive to gankerswe mine well enough in a retriever or a mackinaw
pro tip put 3 lasers on an asteroid that has less than 1 cycle of ore in itif thats a pro tip then i must be giving out godlike server hacksgenuine pro tip that pro tip is awful
another approach id prefer to see would be to have the mining laser field enhancement gang module increase your scanner range as well as laser rangemakes more sense to me that way rather than adding another ship bonus or increasing the base scanner range when those are perfectly fine as they are for mining when youre not fleeted
hmm its both
i disagree if youre in a hostile system your very presence there is interacting with them they have to be mindful of the possibility that they might get attacked youre interacting with them in the same way that a hostile fleet x systems over does it forces people to be mindful of their actions as things stand taking this option away would only serve to make nullsec safer which most people will agree should never be the intent if you want to live in 00 you have to deal with the consequences thats why youll get comments like highsec is  that way those people are making the exact same point as i amput yourself in the afk cloakers shoes for a minute they have to invest a fair amount of time into it if they want to get any kills out of it they have to park their character there for extended periods of time time during which they cannot use that character to do anything else sure they can go afk for a lot or even all of that time that still means they are paying the opportunity cost of not using that character for anything elseas others have said with local in the current state afk cloaking is a necessary evil it is one of the few options you have if you want to disrupt your enemies activities effectively until this is addressed you wont find many people that will support your position
average player retention time for eve is 6 month longer than some but shorter than most one of the reasons for this is completely passivity in xp progression systemmajority of mmos have a completely active xp system based purely on ingame activity minority eve perpetuum etc have completely passive xp system based purely on rl timerecently more mmos have begin a move onto the hybrid system from either extremes as a way to achieve longer player retention in every case player retention improved players who found themselves with less time to play are less likely to cancel their subs as the passive aspect is there players are less likely to never log on resulting in eventually losing interest and cancel sub because rewards for active playing is therea hybrid system doesnt necessarily make eves bitter vets happier it does do well for ccps bottom line
oh gawd yes id absolutely love this option as a novice i experience a lot of trouble with being at low tech and this would greatly encourage me and the likes of me to play more aggressively in order to approach the highclass players asap
i hope to god your being sarcasticgrinding would ruin eve all this woudl do is require all players to spend 3 years in highsec grinding skills with missions sicne their would be a new minimum level to be allowed into player corps since no one woudl tolerate a lowbie and then those same players would either quit from boredom or never leave highsec again eve needs more incentives for pvp not less
that 3 year minimal level would then be 6 years of docked andor logged off waiting for sp to train you pulled that number right out of your ass of course so might as well run with itof course in reality the real minimal sp to get in a decent corp is currently around 6 months combined with active perhaps we can shorten that to 3 monthit would have be a lot shorter than that had we have active sp recruiters know correctly that sp merely represent time subbed the player may very well be docked and dont know how to read an overview so they artificially rise the barrier just to compensate
this is where you re wrong by undocking you explicitly consent to any and all risks that the big bad world might hold i dont see how this is different from wow eve is simply one big pvp server and yes it can be compared to someone who lives in a warzone by continuing to live there you take the risk that you may potentially get killed not everyone always has the option to get out of that situation but thinking ive never harmed anyone so nobody will come to harm me is just terribly naive
seriously you are comparing eve to a 3rd world warzone way to much drama right therebtw your comparrison is waaaaay off that person does not choose to live in a warzone and most probably does not have the means to move somewhere elsein eve undocking is consenting and as for an are you sure you want to undock message omg how much handholding do you want in a game sheeshjint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move

good uh nighti recently found out about the character trading concept i asked game masters whether name change comes together with the transfer and found out that character rename is not an option at all this surprised me because even softcore mmogames often provide a payable character name change option while this game does notpoint is when a person intends to buy a character he literally pays for the amount of skill points and probably the set of implants however that means that new owner has the certain chance to perform some scamming attempts by impersonating the previous owner to prevent this previous owner has to personally inform all his lifetime contacts that he intends to sell this character and he is no longer in charge of anythingsecond the possibility to change name of a brandnew character would encourage a lot of people in this feature personally i would be really happy to buy some 10billion character but the only thing that stops me from doing so is that character name would most kilely be some typical xxxpwnkillahxxx thats just gross do not wantso here is the idea you may allow those who buy characters via the service to rename them say once per year yeah justl ike those stat remaps to prevent some criminal scum 3 from abusing this service to clear his name of some pesky deeds that would encourage people like me to use the trading service by hundredfoldalso this would advertise some more new players seriously take a look right now people think about joining eve community but amidst the pros and cons the concept of new player can not compete with a player with six months played time period well it was for me when i first found out about this game this reason pulled me away from registering here approx 25 years ago silly silly me qq with the option i offer newcomers will be ebcouraged to  register new accounts and pay monthly fees immediately  pay for the character trading itself  pay for the character renaming option if you decide to make that an extra charge option  pay for some more plexs to sell them to obtain some isk to buy a ship for that character    profitand for those who would deny this concept because newfags must stay at the bottom that is the point do you really think a newcomer could beat a 2yearold character who has a lot of gameplay experience even if he has the same shipfitting oh please he wont even be able to fit the ship properly that i can assure you of for i personally deem myself a typical n00b yetplease please please consider this proposal as an option please to be honest i am just tired of these waaay toooo looooong skill training days so i would rather buy a character or two to actually have some fun instead and assuming that this concept would be of quite a profit for ccp please pretty please
you buy a character you buy more than skillpoints you buy a history and reputation its part of the dealand on another note im personally against the character bazaar on principal ive personally seen too many noobs who think if i dont have x skillpoints im worthless so they go out and do exactly what you do they spend the money on the character on plex for an uber ship and then immediately lose it in some ridiculous ubernoob move then they quit eve out of frustration and tell their friends that the game tricks you out of your money and takes your stuffthe character bazaar is there for a reason for players who are too slow in the head or impatient to see the value of training skills on their own players that buy a character often feel compelled to only use the biggest bestest ship they can which will cause them nothing but grief that is ebcause these players may ahve caught up in the sp race which doesnt exist they are still and in some cases mroe so gimped in personal xp since they will be flying highrisk ships with little experiecne to mitigatethe current system dissuades most players from buying a character in favor of training up one sicne they would ratyher not be known as dumbnutz1414 if the ability to change the name of the character to anything you want became available i would forsee a small but significant enough influx of new players buying older chars that we coudl possibly see a drop in player retention rates again due to the frustration of them losing the uberexpensive ships they bought the character to fly because they didnt actually know how to fly the shipmy 2 cents as the recruiter for both a highsec indy corp lowsec pvp corp and currently an assistant in a wormhole mercenary corpedit i apologize for any ranting or bad spelling im tired sleeping in my car at work sicne im on a 16 hour shift with a 2 hour break and on a mobile device

or i may not or i may do so honestly did you even read the entire wall of text i am quite positive that you saw the string character renaming and immediately ragerushed to the bottom to write an answer like that typicaloh dont mind me just passin by
the problem with such a feature is exactly what you mentioned criminals will be able to easily clear away their bad rep and go on their merry way on to the next hapless victim in this case the advantages just dont outweigh the disadvantages
right thats exactly what i mean you didnt read anythingproblemnot to mention that this additional option must be a chargeable service if a socalled scammer wants to waste his one and only once per year charge hell still have to pay the fee
if you have to caveat an idea with you can only do it once a year and it has a cost to limit its use is it really a beneficial idea in the first placejint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
it is for those who wish to buy a character to play it is not a good idea though for those who intend to resell it and they dont need that rename anyway
cost and the limitation of once a year is laughable it would still be open to all and abusedthis is not a new idea maybe a search and some research first would have given you the heads updestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless

so kelduum had himself a big ol whine nothing came of it and now im supposed to believe this is all somehow noteworthynaaah
no one cares what a 2011 high sec scrub wants either posting with my forum alt
who cares
why should he leavei would seriously doubt ccp in this caseas in many other cases they end up being comunism its all in the name i guess
shouldnt this be in assembly hall or somewhere where people actually care about the lolcsmalso dont vote for malcanisccps motto if it isnt broken break it if it is broken ignore it improving npe  dynamic new eden
just who do you think you are to say i shouldnt vote for malcanis ill vote for him just to spite youmuahahahaliang
carebears represent a large portion of the eve player base as such carebears need a rep on the csmno taxation without representation 101
i dont think anyone here doubts that ccp presented the facts of the matterwhether his need to pester ccp about it stems from his position on the csm his position as the leader of a well known noob friendly training corp or his own personal ego it really doesnt matter this was a trivial matter and something of a wake up call for him with no harm doneeveryone can make mistakes and everyone can get a bt full of themselves from time to time that is hardly cause for a call for resignation of either his csm postion or his ceo positionpeople that get worked up calling for his head are being just as stupid as those who got worked up at ccp for banning the botter and confiscating the isk to begin withseemingly the main industry in eve is turning mole hills into mountains and the main pass time is starting tempests in tea cupsview the latest eve online developments and other game related news and gameplay by visiting ranger 1 presents virtual realms
kelduum doesnt need to resign but he should be embarassed at the way he tried to blackball ccp if a player gave me 500 billion isk and ccp took it id do everything humanly possible to get it back too if he truly believed that the actions in question didnt violate the eula and that he was wronged then who are we to judge him or call for his resignation was he acting in the best interests of his corp by trying to reacquire assets and the player base by questioning a because we said so grab of assets probably ive learned more about cache scraping in the past week than  well ever its what came next that sucks the vindictive 3rd party negative press is inexcusable and for that either his corp or the next csm election will decide his fate without need of any pitchforks and torches from usyk

reposting again because something needs to be donenote  these arnt all popular ideas but something to work upon lowsec could be an awesome place if it was given some attention rather than simply a place outlaws hang out simply because they can not fly in hisecthis is my old post unedited from when we lived in lowsec back in the old forums it never made it here but it drummed up alot of support and criticism i think its time it was looked at and discussed again maybe if something along these lines were implemented all the people who left lowsec and went to 00 maybe some would return maybe more would live thereafter this a lowsec improvement committee was set up approved by ccp it disbanded very fast as no one was interested in listening really maybe its time to look againnot all the ideas will be popular not all will be realistic but lets start a new look at lowsechere it is in its unedited form though lots of additions and edits were done at the time as new posts were put inproposed lowsec expansion underworld i changed this from outlaw to reflect that it isnt all about the criminalsi renamed the thread titlelowsec needs some serious attention to make it the great place it should be and im not talking about fw which is pretty much unrelated to real lowseclowsec is about criminals its about piracy its about the dark underworld of new eden i think its about time it had some deserved attention it would take a lowsec patch to really turn it into the place it should be i suggest ccp do just that the update should be called outlawi have the following proposals for this and by no means are these all my ideas so thanks to all the people who have put ideas around before1 criminal underworld recognition should be given to the overlords who dominate systems some sort of benefits may be bought with underhand payments to authorities such as the rats in a system may not engage unless fired upon or reduced facility rates offices etcmaybe something similar to the new sov mechanics with a hub pos using modules to upgrade the system this would need to be less impacting than 00 so the best you could upgrade should not be as good as an unupgraded 00 system possibly only available in the lower security say 01 and 022 criminal faction agents for missions better rewards for missions in lowsec generally these agents would be at pirate stations that can only be found by probing3 the black market have a market that can only be accessed when in the lowsec system or region you are in and with items that can only be sold on the black market all illegal items moved onto this market maybe with npc smuggling items too create more illegal items to load onto the market more drugs maybe illegal implants see also 4 the black market panel only becomes available when in a black market station which would only be the piratecriminal stations4 pirate faction ships and items become illegal in hisec so whilst usable in hisec become available only through the black market5 make better smuggling opportunities with these illegal items make a smuggling profession more viable so some ships need to be able to evade customs officials or at least have a smuggling low slot cargo upgrade6 crooked cops have random faction npcs for that region wander lowsec looking for payoffs hand over a little isk to go free or fight themmaybe the overlord can see to it that these crooked cops dont interfere with their people this isnt popular but i wont remove it in case it inspires a better idea7 have lowsec borders between all the empires or at least the empires who are at war so there is no safe route for people this way people would actually hire escort personnel to protect haulers another career opportunity smugglers would also be employed in such places so maybe hisec borders exist just fine between amarr and caldari and between gallente and minmatar space8 new pos modules such as pleasure hubs and so on could be you need to supply it with drugsfoodalcohol etc and in return it earns money would need to be limited to like 1 or 2 per pos though to avoid large pos super brothels being built enmass in systems to make huge isk this income should be small in comparison to moon mining etc9 some form of cyno jamming as in 00 lowsec is becoming blobbed with caps possibly only the system that an alliance has godfather status could be cyno jammed would be part of the upgrades available to system overlords this also isnt popular but as above i wont remove it possibly a way to avoid supercap use in lowsec instead dependent on security10 better ore better missions etc to keep the isk warriors coming in despite the riskalot of people are saying how there arnt enough people coming to lowsec but people need to have a reason to go there im not interested in getting more carebears to wander in to get ganked yes im a pirate but i prefer a fight what id like to see is more organisations fighting for turf gang wars pirate factions fighting each other or real opportunities for anti pirates to go in and wage war against their hated enemieswe need a deeper immersion for lowsec bring it on please make lowsec the dark and dangerous underbelly that society loves to hate lowsec shouldnt be a dangerous version of hisec just as 00 isnt a no concord version of hisec it should be a seperate experience in itself
congratulations on an offensive attitude and a worthless post
this is a suggestion to augment the current sov system and completely replace moon mining i originally posted this on the pl internal forums if you are confused the example should helpthe requirementsspace must be easy to understand for new players offer daytoday conflict and content offer interesting opportunities for counterplay accessible to large and small groupsto do this it will have to beeasy to take from others see justifications below valuable to hold because it has intrinsic value like a tech moon valuable to individuals in the alliance bottom upUFFFD like rats differing and uneven in value creates conflict accessible to any number of players in any shipwe shouldaugment existing mechanics wholesale replacements rarely workthe mechaniccapturing sovereigntyholding at least 50 of the inbound stargates captures a system systems are captured from the outside to capture an inbound stargate an alliance ship must enter UFFFDcapture modeUFFFD within 100km of the stargate  a player must be in capture mode on the gate for at least 150 minutes to capture it more players do not increase the speed a player in capture mode cannot warp jump or cloak and stays in this state for 120s after exiting capture mode leaving 100km at any point removes exits you from capture mode you may not reenter capture mode for 120 seconds entering capture mode in high or low sec globally flags you criminal not concordable just shootableany defender on the stargate in capture mode cancels out all attacking ships in capture mode capture speed is reduced by a percentage equal to the percentage of adjacent systems held by the attacking alliance  the attacker may remove this penalty if the dust players capture the majority of the planets for themwhile a gate is not being captured its capture timer falls at 2x real time eg 2 minutes fall off for every minute that passes you may not start a capture of a system without adjacency excepting if  you capture the ihubstation the system is bordered by npc spacecapturing stations and moon mineralsstations and ihubs are taken through the old systemUFFFD but loosing sov disables any upgrades and the passive income source  systems where sov and stations are held differently are freeports for dockingminerals are now obtained from a customs agency on the moon in a compressed form minerals are mined as in mining barge mined from the moon at this waypoint only a player of the holding alliance may gather these minerals they build to a maximum with in about 3 days and are depleted completely within about 4 hours for a single player intended to be a group activityexampleexamplemapin the above picture g73 may not be captured as all adjacent systems are owned by the same alliance tilch in the above picture brick may capture tjmjj or ad5b8 since it has adjacency to capture ad5b8 brick must hold 2 of the following 3 ad5b8 gate in ubxccUFFFD ad5b8 gate n g73mr ad5b8 gte in 54mf6 brick cptures tjmjj at a 50 rate 24 adjacent held taking 300 minutes 5 hU043Eursjustificationssov should be easy to takeeasy provides conflict and content when space is hard to take like the current system little groups are butted out and so are little fights this is why there are a bunch of  pot alliances in npc space and low sec the current sov system encourages a fight once a week for a given system and it is generally not because the system is valuable moons on the other hand easy to take if undefended encourage huge fights and frequent ones at that requiring active bottom up investment in gathering moon resources offers great opportunities for small gang harassment and fights like the eve of old you now need to protect your mining op ratters etc space that is easy to defend encourages the most brutal and effective tactics in eve boring the other guy out when you have to constantly defend your borders against the solo rifter there is very high incentive to say  it to space you dont care aboutcapturing a system from the outsidea system being captured from the outside provides great counterplay possibilities and also adds a whole new element of geography to eve it also helps break up le blob coalitions also loose some of there oomph when a fiveman gang can capture your system you need to actively defend space border regions would become conflict drivers i sincerely hope to see border regions in a constant state of fluxspace should be inherently valuablebecause that creates incentive for both taking and holding it there needs to be great risks and rewards in eve it is what makes the games so rewarding to start with this said players need some sense of security which is why stations are captured through the old hard to take system

just a little idea that would make my life as an industrialist easier because i am lazy when i want to build an item i click on the show info of the bpo to see if ii can realy build it example how it is nowmanticore blueprint  industry 5 frigate construction 4 caldari starship engineering 1 rocket science 1let us say it is effective to build this if you have caldari starhip engeneering at level iv because of the little green  and red  symbols i can see that i can build it but i do not see the skill level i have nowso i have to visit my character window to look up the skill level so i would like to have my current skill level shown in the show info industry 5 you v frigate construction 4 you iv caldari starship engineering 1 you iii rocket science 1 you ivthat would just save some time looking up skills as a second thing i would like to see for what i could use an itemi already can see that for skills and would like to have same for production itemsitem x is needed to build a b c or d
the better ui thoughts put forward are the best ideas i have seen from the community to improve eve since i started playingwell done and a big thank you to all who have suggested ways to improve itlets hope ccp act on them
so let me get this straight you all want to see a ship that can haul rigged ships not launch them and possibly have a jump driveis there some reason a freighter or jump freighter is out of the question by making this a variant it will still have the same material requirements if not more making it even more expensive than current freighters and not to mention you can very easily fit rigged battleships inside a freighter
well heres the thing currently the only way to fit assembledrigged ships into a freighter is courier contracts which requires either someone you trust or an alt it is a colossal pain in the ass for logistical purposesthis ship will streamline the process and an eventual tech 2 variant would be jump capable but have a ship transport bayi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about

i totally disagree for a simple reason why should miners be ripped off from good mindlinks when pvpers get theirs for a much cheaper price 50m back in the day was reasonable with other links 510m 15 billion makes it so rare that no one will want ita side effect of making this link cheaper is lower ore prices as mining fleets will mine faster and more efficiently
miners dont need it and cant use it its for fleet booster when you run a mining fleet supposedly in leadership position of an industrial corp a 5 mining implant for individual miners cost 120 mil each its not unreasonable for you to spend 12 bil jita sell price not 15 bil just one time for a noncombat fleet booster when your miners spend 120 mil for each implant in their head you dont have to get it not everyone is ready for leadership position
everyone can make mistakes and everyone can get a bt full of themselves from time to time that is hardly cause for a call for resignation of either his csm postion or his ceo positionguess you would say the same about the ceos of lehman brothers and aig
i am sure hitler was full of himself too would you excuse himalso the directors of the fake moon landing where probably full of themselves would you forgive themalso the first person to screw a monkey and give humans aids was probably full of himself would you just let that off the hook too

when you start making real life comparisons about a video game and expecting the same standards of accountability in a video game designed for backstabbing extortion and so forth then youre clearly taking it a bit too seriouslyif somebody gave me 350000000000 isk and ccp took it all away id bloody well be asking them if i couldnt keep just a little bit of it too even if just to keep on putting bounties on clear bad poasting forum alts
please dont try to compare apples to orangesceos of lehman brothers and aig began their endeavors with criminal intentkel was put in an awkward position by the real culprit at what point do you stop defending a friend and take the side of the prosecutioni truely dont feel kels position was out of greed rather than over the deviation of process and whats considered based on the limited info he had on hand whats breaking the rules and what wasntthis petition does not serve anything however kels recent experience should be looked at as a learning experience not just for kel but all corp leaders regardless if they are csm or not

1 to the missile speed and making sniping more viable its sad that guns can snipe at very long ranges and hit well with instant damage while a missile boat cant 1 to cruisetorp changesfunny useless boats cerberus another one is the corax raven i
ive been a missile user for years now but i then switched for hybrids and now i have more sp in gunnery than i have in missileswellthey need a buff thats certainthe solution offered of things increasing exponentionally with distance fits perfectly with the longrange caldari style create counters and solves a lot of issues with missilesi entierly agree with op except for the fact that stealth bombers are also using torpedoes with some efficiency not only the golem but t2 torpedoes are still useless
im a carebear at heart and i no longer have a problem with this i skills up enough to where i could use a t2 survey scanner and i just keep an eye on my cargo hold to know how around how much ore is left a little subtraction is all thats required to keep your lasers on task 
this is debating the meaning of a word hereconsent is explicitly engaging in an activity like having sex you and i agree on a course of actionfor me clicking the button is not consenting to pvp i dont see it that way i dont agree that i should be on the receiving end of the ammunition you so generously send my wayhowever although i do not consent to pvp per se i dont have a problem with it i can and do accept the consequence you emerge from the murky depths of space and start shooting me hey its living in the big city it is what will happen that is why i consider the boat being lost when i click undock i dont need an are you sure reminder its a given that someone is out there waiting for the opportunity if you know they are out there whats the point of complaining about iti dont believe im contradicting myself i can accept a consequence of an action without necessarily consenting to it you came and blew up my orca did i consent to that no sir i did not does it mean im going to mope in a corner and mewl about all the bad people in this place and how they should not be able to do that to me poor space miner that day will never come dont even remotely hope for it ive lost ships before ill lose many more is it convenient not is not whats the answer to that problem get a new ship and carry on what else are you going to do a lot of whining in coms moping in local shaking with rage sending mail i cant believe people do that to the guy blowing up your boat complaining about the fact they attacked unprovoked it does not change a damn thing you lost a boat you need a new one get a new one carry oni dont have the slightest problem with that however clicking the button of and by itself does not mean i consent to that course of actionthats all i wanted to say im just using many words to do that
i like this idea though its been so long since ive played them that i barely even remember it that said having that extra faction increase would be handy 1
jalxanyeah those agents definitely need to come out of retirement and get a promotionthank you very much for giving support to this proposaldmc
man we could have so used this earlier today when we had over 200 targets on screen1 for me i wish i could plus it more
josef djugashvilis  thanks for your nice commentsjalxan  i know i know the more time goes by the more i think that devs should really start thinking of these ideasguys keep supporting my ideas thats the best we can do for the moment since i doubt the csm helps much 
that and you may be able to fit in more ships rather than less as for launching into space you can technically do that with unassembled ships already i remember someone with an orca jetting about 60 ships at a time as part of a massship giveaway spree and of course theres the fact that ive jettisoned 50 packaged shuttles into space for my fellow corpmates to participate in a special exercise either way what im saying is that having the ability to jettison wouldnt be that special
agreed especially when you consider that if someones willing to invest the ridiculous amount of isk and time to build a capital ship fleet inside a c1c4 wormhole they should be allow to enjoy the safety of their defenseas well if we remove the caps theyre going to cause problems with capital ships entering highsec and we already know what happened when capitals first showed up in high sec p1
1 supported i rarely go into wh space but i would not want it turned into another version of a nullsec blobfest
supported no changes to wh mechanics they are one of if not the best designed and well balanced components of the game
right but lets not forget pvp leadership boosters have it much much cheaper also lets not forget that i believe the mining foreman mindlink is the most expensive implant on the market period and that is by a wide margin even more than those legendary snake sets
not true snake omega is 15 bil and thats for just one implant out of the whole set some cosmos implants cost upward of 3 bil and thats for combat ships the cosmos mining implant cost over 12 bil for 5 mining amount and thats for individual miners not 1 for the fleet relatively few people run cosmos missions so supply is low but that aside pvp mindlinks are cheaper because demand for mining mindlinks are larger in comparison supply is the same information warfare link in particular is dirt cheap because information warfare is currently a joke its just market adjusting for itselfimplants can cost a lot mining foreman is far from being the most expensive one especially since its one for a whole fleet instead of per person in the end theyre optionalyou can take comfort in knowing that for every mining fleet not running mining foreman mineral prices is a bit higher regardless of whether this one time investment is worth it to you you benefit from the resulting mineral prices
i dont necessarily agree with 100 of the suggestions you make but for the most part this is very interesting
these are suggestions from various places some mine some othersjust put into some context and hopefully for more people and ccp to build on to create a great lowsec gameplay so all comments and ideas are welcome
this is still the best compilation of lowsec improvements
oh wow missiles to hybrids why do you choose the worst weapon systems instead of the fotm onesthat aside yeah this would be one way to give cruises a reason to exist although something needs to be done for these rage torps you mentioned between their short range and newly increased explosion radius they have issues seriously i never know why ccp decided rage torps needed even bigger exp radius then they had
it seems to me that boosters are rarely used outside of pvpthis is a shameif there were noncombat boosters a lot more people would be using them early in their eve career making a lot more people more familiar with boosters generally and hopefully increase the turnover of pvp boosters as they progress from indy to pvpso i propose that new boosters be created for noncombat usage to encourage booster use generallythis may also increase the value of null space which contains the good gas  which would be a good thing generally
not a terrible idea though of course they would still be illegal in hisec
synth boosters are legal in hisec but demand is low because of where most of the combat takes place why use synth boosters when you can use improved or stronga lot of indy takes place in highsec so synth boosters for noncombat would be far more popular because of this situation
still relevant

1 but only for cancel job  changing delivery isnt needed only cancellingdelivery puts the item into a hangar and there are already ways of securing hangars so delivery opening it up to theft is finerestricting delivery would just open up a diffe
the biggest shame is that its been like this since pos was introduced and no one has ever really considered the impact this has on new player retentionjust imagine is a corp could recruit some guy whos trying out eve give him access to blueprints and let the guy build frigates and cruisers from the corps bpos get people involved in an entirely different aspect of eve that otherwise requires either their own investment and finding public slots or creating their own alt corp
as someone with an orca alt that is maxed out except for the mindlink i have to say it really is just an issue with supply and demand like others have said there is a lot of demand for those things because they are very very effective pvpers do get implants that are similarly expensive and miners have much cheaper implants available to boost their mining effectiveness if they really must have themwhich they should if theyre worth their saltdont get me wrong i would love mind links to be cheaper so my alt could buy one but thats purely for selfish reasons besides my own want of the mind links i see no reason to make them more available miners need end game implants as well after allin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
kelduums an utter tool but he wasnt acting from any kind of csm position just from a im a bloody tool position
1but hes teaching them how to create dramas isnt that how to really play eve 
i agree with the concept but very little of your applications making faction ships illegal in high sec would break the balance of the game tremendouslyim giving a 1 for the idea of revamping low sec hopefully we can see some more fitting ideas come into play
many people think it says pirate ships and mods illegal in hisec what it says is illegal to sell them in hisec also if people like the concept but not these specific ideas please post some that is the point of this thread get ideas built up
at the end of the day theres no one who can say that cruise missiles are balanced they are comparable in every way to any other weapons platform but lower damage against small targets and the delaybut its even more simple than that the delay just the delay without something anything to make up for it cruise missiles are and will always be a bad suboptimal solutionedit another fun fact for everyones digestion i was informed today that the incursion group ive just joined doesnt allow any caldari ships in ther inucrsions except the naga or rokh in emergencies when they cant find anyone else this is partially on overall problem with caldari ships obviously but you can see that this is just another loss for missile boats
i like it 1ocd booster  for market traders devils hand booster  for idle hands while afk mining eagle eye booster  for pi related matters the list goes on
hesitantly supported its another market for people to exploit so long as the resources for making these new boosters cant be gathered in highsec i am game for the ideain the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf

hi guysmy propose is to have us being able to haul our other clones eg you are in talisman clone and you have other clone with snakecrystalnomadhalo which you might wanna move it to other systemstationat current state in order for us to move our other clones we have to jump into said clone even if we dont want to use it and than 24hrs later for the other clone and again 24hrs later for the rest so i say in order for us to haul our other clone we need a clone vatsm3 that will be able to input in the hauler blockade runner that is all m asking for do comment guys much appreciate it thkz for your time
proposing a change to the game because a lone pilot made a mistake is bad game designsummary of eves last four expansions
the barriers to entry into the booster business are high consider the followingdrug labs can only be on pos in 03 and belowgasses for illegal boosters are only available in limited areas of low and nullsov spacethe bpcs for making all boosters do not drop in hisecthe skillbooks for reducing side effects of booster use are only available in nullsynth booster gas can be found in very few hisec ladar sites in small amounts but the gas still needs to be processed and the boosters manufacturedadding boosters which are more useful in hisec will hopefully create more demand generally across all types and strengths and perhaps give this excellent component of the game the emphasis it deserves
can you give some examples of noncombat boosters other than for mining yieldcycle times and propulsion boosters which would be hard to justify due to propulsion being linked to the shipmodules not pilot sobriety i cant really think of cases where a drug booster would be implementable

having read pretty much the full account i dont agree with the opkelduum has legitimate concerns with the way the security team operates he is well within his rights to question their lack of oversight
dueling mechanics are now up and running so why dont all the current csm members grab a battleship fit it out the best they can with expensive mods etc form a fleet and try and take on all the playersthey pick a system form up in secret on the agreed day and at the set time undock and accept every dual that comes their way and see how long they last podding allowed of course
because it would be far too much effort 
and because one person in a well fit caracal can kill a battleship as long as they have enough ammoin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
effort is bad thing
i have always thought this is a fantastic idea especially if you could haul other peoples clones aswell it would make life for n00bs trying to get to nullsec much much easier you would leave one clone in a corp mates carrier and they would move it and then you could just jump clone to it later not whilst its in the carrier of coursethen your encroaching on the rorqual and other caps territory imagine the hilarity of killing a ship that had multiple other peoples clones in it it would be fantasticin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
i would like to get my mouse over a ship  pod for quick info back please it seems it was removed in the retribution 11 patch and i used it a lot it works for planets etc but not ships anymore
and miss the hilarity that ensured by your error neverin all seriousness though weve all made mistakes some that could have been avoided by an are you sure window however because eve doesnt hold your hand every step of the way interesting and unexpected circumstances can arisefor instance an are you sure button would have prevented a titan from jumping on his own rather than bridging his fellows the result one of the biggest bouts of carnage yet p
sorry no theres already an abort button explicitly for this purposeif you were proposing a pop up for when you were about to undock with an out of date clone i would be cool with that in fact i would support it readily but no to this you already get plenty of warningin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
mining related boosters as you mention for yield cycleindustrial related may be higher chance of a t2 bpc faster manufacturing mepe boosts for bpo copyingtrade related may be a reduction in sales tax on completion of trade perhapsperhaps in highsec missions a booster could effect the missions offered or provide additional lp or iskmaybe boosters which help both ends of the spectrum like ship warp speed scan probe deviation duration in space strength increase perhaps lower costs  increased speed of locator agentssome of these would be trivial to do because they fit within the archiecture allready applied to boosters others would be more complicated and there may be issues with duration and overlap say with a 10 run job that lasts 10 days but the synth booster only lasts 14 hours do they get the whole run boosted or would only the first item be produced with the bonus etc etc etcthe vision is to bring boosters into the mainstream so even if there is only one or two boosters added and they really only help players below five million skill points that may generate enough momentum to take boosters from being an elite pvp niche to what i think they should be up there with implants
nice idea lowsec need more deep atm i only recognise lowsec when im travelling into 001 thumps up
no actual words to add so 1
1 not being able to haul clones around seems like a technical issue rather than gameplay one especially as this would create more traffic for groups that do logistics work
it happened with the recent patch wednesdayi cant remember the number but my info window says version 821486727i have my drone list so both the in space and in bay drop down lists are open  expanded it used to be when you launched drones they would just move down into the in space plane now when i launch drones the window vanishes for a second then comes back with both drop down lists collapsed the drones are under the in space section the section is just now collapsedmanaging drone aggro is a pain since i am having to re open the drop down menu every time i launch drones i currently do not have drones grouped on the ship i am currently using not sure if that mattersi wanted to check and see if anyone else is having this problem before i open a ticket if other people have been having the problem or there is a work around let me know glitch or not it should be addressedthanks
locking this because it belongs in the issues feedback thread
agreed
bug will be fixed at downtime
shameless friday bump
i hope this gets put in game
i was fortunate in that when i started i joined a group of folks i played a different game with and therefore had already earned their trust i my main would not be the industrialist i am today if not for early access to build stuff i mean its not really that hard to make it beceo  director  can cancel anythingregular corp member  can cancel their own jobs onlyis itocellydont mistake fact for arrogance supposition for fact or disagreement for dismissal perception is unique in that it can be shared or singular run with the pack if you wish but think for yourself a sandwich can be a great motivator
1 from me as welli have been the ceo of my own small solo corp for a while as well as a part of one mid sized industrial corp while i did gain their trust over time and am still on good terms with them i have felt that its hard for new players to get i
totally agreedon a related note can you maybe add a full role revamp to this for example i would love to get a role that can boot members from corporation that arent directors or ceos in multithousand person corporations this significant flaw in corporation management makes it hard to deal with troublemakers
id really rather get this very easytofix focused issue fixed first which cant be hard to fix as described in previous posts and then sort out the mess that is roles in general which will no doubt take ages
here are a few of the ideas that ive posted about recently the description of this forum section leads me to believe that i should also link them here for council review i hope everyone likes ingame api integration and time logged auditinghelioscovert ops balancingexplorer class ship between frigates and cruisersthanks
corporations declare war individuals declare vendettai hope to get a discussion on the possibility of ending war evasion by having concord allow us to declare vendetta on individualsthis would allow privateers to legally shoot botters and carebears hiding in npc corpsmechanics would be similar to the existing war dec system1 aggressor pays a fee to concord to be able to engage in hostilities within a 24 hour wait period2 only applies to individuals outside a player corporation3 a war decced individual who joins a corp transfers the war dec to the corp just as a corp joining an alliance would transfer the dec to the alliance 4 the war decced individual who joins the corp should still be war decced himself5 corp members leaving a corp during a war will not carry the war dec with them unless they are individually war deccededit a noobexception clause could be added6 a character younger than 1 month cannot be war decced just as you get to close rookiechat after 1 montheveryone else should have no reason to be able to escape conflict they keep telling me in the ads that this was a cold dark place and thats why i subscribededit 7 individuals in a corp cannot wardec others without proper privileges to wage a personal war without the corps permission the individual must leave the corpform his own corpjustifications1 wardec evasion is an exploit 2 this allows players to kill players who hide in npc corps3 encourages more team play and possibly revitalizes low and nullsec industry4 brings back the old industrialist who takes risks and ventures into dangerous regions for high profits discourages and effectively ends riskfree gameplaypossible consequences1 to escape highsec griefing players will have to band together join alliances move into low and nullsec where rule of law is playerenforced2 antisocial players who refuse to have anything to do with others will be eliminated3 better organisation of highsec piracy and counterpiracyid like the communitys thoughts on this and i hope to refine this into a proper proposal over time no anticarebear swearing please
other possible clausesoutbidding a wardeclore wise the war dec system is essentially bribing concord perhaps it should go 2 ways so that the defender can outbid the aggressor and have concord declare the war voidso it could run like thisassuming it costs 500m to dec a certain partyparty a pays concord 500m to war dec party bparty b sees party as 500m and matches them 500m in protection money to concordparty a then raises the fee by paying concord another 500m the war continues no refunds for anyoneparty b can pay concord more protection money to block the warand so onof course blocking a war from a does absolutely nothing to stop a war from c or d
do you envisage any kind of limit on how many times or for how long a single individual can be wardecced in this way
this mechanic will only dramatically push up prices on a variety of services we take granted red frog and other corp hauling oreneeding manufactured modules meta 25 modules you name it hulkageddon will become a serious problem with this and in case you havent noticed lately prices have heavily inflated over the past couple of years because of a combination of hulkageddon and with the reduction of highsec botting if this game becomes too iskexpensive to play semicasual and casual players will stop playing as well it would turn off a lot of nonpvpers from playing since some people are happy enough with mining and missioning with friendswe should respect those who dont like pvp and should limit the ways they are put into danger if people want to fight they should go to low or nullsec the wardec system and the new bountyhunting systems are more than enough
the primary reason for the price increase is because ccp didnt increase the drop rate when they added a bunch of missions waybackwhen as a result the price has steadily gone up1 for actually understanding the issue1 to ccp for borking up the loot tables think faction tower bpcs anyonethe supply  demand argument is only valid if there was a real steady supply of thesehrolt ceo live free die proud
this 
seems like that entire article was written in the ccp is right instead of the ccp is probably right but has been wrong before way that most articles talked about this
heres a simple thought rebalance the shielding resistances on the four different racials of the existing drones based on their damage typefor example hammerhead iis have a default resistance of 60 exp  40 kin  20 therm  0 em with the changes since the hammerhead does thermal damage it should have base resistances of 60 therm with the others determined by both relativity to existing npc tanking amounts and relative to their historical prejudicesproposed resistancesamarr em 60 em  40 kin  20 therm  0 expcaldari kin 60 kin  40 em  20 exp  0 thermgallente therm 60 therm  40 exp  20 em  0 kinminmatar exp 60 exp  40 therm  20 kin  0 emthis change would affect how these would be used in pvp but most importantly this would give a huge boost to drones and their ability to resist traditional missioning npcs damage toward drones this will mean that if youre facing caldari npcs theyll be dishing out and be receiving mostly kinetic damage and thus your kinetic drones will be more effective against them
its a promising idea which would help alleviate the issue of players hiding in npc corps to evade consequences however you need to build in something to avoid it being abused or else it will be used for simple harassment of players rather than true vendetta also see malcaniss post above
we should just be able to wardec npc corps
pretty much what my thread title says i just had a random thought enter my mischievous mind a module that turns a ship into a oneshot massive bomb in sizes based on a powergrid need in other words it would be a superpowered smartbomb that destroys the ship instantly in addition it should also destroy the pilots pod as a consequence to make it less likely someone would use an expensive clone to do this withalternatively a specialized suicide ship could be used however i feel that any ship with fitting slots should be permitted to fit one or more of these into a high slot it should be balanced in such a way that one could build a fit with a single kamakazie module with a regular tank or a full rack of such but with little to no tank in other words the person would need to plan their use the modules should only work when activated and if the ship is destroyed prematurely the devices will not go off they should also be groupable so that way you dont fire off just one when detonating as it would be an instant effectyes this could be used for suicide ganks but this could make lowsec and maybe even highsec warfare much more interesting it could have the same amount of damage as a stealth bombers bomb for a bssized module as an idea of how much power the larger variants could be also keep in mind that if this module also destroys your capsule it would make it hard to respond to the current firefight in a fleet fight and useless in a solo one except maybe as a lastsecond  you gesture when youre about to lose making such use of these devices a very strategic onewhat are your thoughts and if you like this idea a capital ship version of this module should definitely be made which would be awesome to see in a massive fleet fight d
i think this is too much of an i win button it will simply decimate highsec with gangs of suicide gankers killing everything in sightif it had an automatic 10 sec hit though it might then be used more as a strategic weapon though i have doubts a capital version would be a more viable option i would have thought it would certainly liven things up a bit
brilliant idea 1
it hink that once you get high enough drone skill you can handle the active drone swappinghowever at lower skill in drones this becomes a problemdoing blockade l3 mission can result in drones beeing 1shotedthus its impossible to swap them without loosing themand while drones cost more then mission reward its just not worth itim not saying its broken im just saying it might need a slight tweakuntill i can skill up to use more ressiliant drones i will go back to my gunboat
hi assembly halli would like to propose a small addition to the current game mechanics that will help drive small gang pvp fix afk cloaking and complains local this will also stop bottingi anticipate this to be a confict driver and isk sink for eve having a significant impact on all players in high low and nullsec it will drive emergent gameplay and full utilise the sandboxadd oxygen bays to all shipseach ship will have a new specialised type of cargohold this cargohold will only be able to hold oxygen to prevent exploitation of this systemevery minute 1 unit of oxygen is depleted ie each unit of oxygen allows a ship to be undocked for 1 minute when a ship runs out of oxygen the capsuleer suffocates and dies at this point another capsuleer may board his ship granting killrights as this is like stealing a car from a dead man irlthis will really boost industry isk faucets and conflict mechanics and create exciting new situations for playersplease upvote this proposal and help this change be bring in for the summer expansionthanksl33editthis will also tie in with dust you will be able to deploy commandos to assault an enemy ship and attack their oxygen bay by swapping the oxygen for a deadly nerve gas you will be able to effectively neutralise the enemy ships crew allowing it to be stolen
this needs to be done

how about we bring back the afkauto log off feature but this time with an afk timer of 20 min this way afk miners dont get kicked when the afk mine  i usually change asteroid every 15 minthank you
i think local should become like a wh local only see people that speak therestoryline concord had installed some scanners next to the gates that broadcasted the entry and exit of pilots in the systemsorconcord have them at there pos cloaky pos off grid of the gatesitem used system scanning arrayit would bring it backthat item would basically broadcast to alliance members corp members or blues the intel to there channeledit after reading myself i see that my solution my not be the best to counter afk cloaky but joe zetskis might be good and would also reduce server load but if we remove local we will need another tool to scan down a system that wont work in a wh due to star radiation or what ever
just saying when you title3 it interesting ideas and all the links are to your own threads it comes off a little conceited and that can subconsciously alter someones opinion of the ideas themselves as a negative impression about you would reflect on all of your ideaslike communism on paper it is almost the perfect government lesser only to maybe a liberaltruedemocatic socialism but because of some of the atrocities the soviet union conducted many of which the americans actually did too but lets not egt itno that everyone associates communism with eviland as for the dieas they are soso and incredibly lowpriority since there are viable alternatives to all adn covops ships are horrible anyways anyone serious uses t3s so ill support your changes whenif ccp makesw meaningful changes to immediate needs like poss or corprolegranularity
i personally do not condone griefing players out of the game that is all this mechanic would truly be used for if you want to shoot someone so badly go find someone who is willing to fight or unwilling in null  low sec
ccp you dec a corp not a playerperhaps the longest running and most quoted dev statement in evethread
yeah this wouldnt be abused at all no siree
even though i understand the op i have to agree with most of the posters here bring a scanner have a look at how much yield you get from your lasers look at the volume of the ore youre mining add your cycle time and with a small mental calculus youll get how much time you should keep your lasers running afk mining can be comfortable but if you want to be efficient youll have to keep an eye on those cycles and know when to press f1f3 again hope this helps you and remember mining has maths involvedhoweverid like to see an animation of the asteroid  gas cloud ive just drained vanishing in a cloud of dust  reducing size until fading away instead of just instantly dissapearing
do this do this do this 
i suggest a wifflebat fight at the next fanfest in iceland
easy enough to make them like bombs  cant be used in highsec no jita bombs for you
this is even worse than that all ships should have fuel bays and operate at 110 capabilities when empty idea
this would ruin longhaul courier contracts unless freighters had ridiculously massive oxygen bays similar sort of problem for miners terrible idea
i fully endorse this idea whoever does not approve it supports botting editps in particular mining ships should have small oxygen bays to fight botting like 15 min of oxygen so they cannot bot with those mackinaws with huge ore bays
yes please lets force all wh players to live out of highsec so they can get their oxygen fixlets just hope something like this doesnt actually happen since some wh player somewhere would dig up this thread blame you and then grief until you quit forever

ideas for sov change mechanicUFFFDUFFFDUFFFDi have been playing eve now for a 6 years plusUFFFDUFFFDi have seen many alliances come and go and some i created myselfUFFFDUFFFDthink its time for a new approach to sov and repopulation of 00 and thus good fightsUFFFDi want to throw a few ideas out there to get the communityUFFFDs view on this jumps into fire proof suit in anticipation of the flamers and gramma policeUFFFD1 corps should be allowed to hold sov2 the amount of sov a corp or alliance holds should be determined by a number of factors and ultimately capped per alliance registration the skill of the ceocurrently the ceo skill determines the amount of players that can be held in a corporation the amounts of players in the corpalliance see above skill linked the more sov that is held the higher the monthly cost sliding scale  multiplier aka you hold swathes of eve space you pay a higher price for it something similar sliding scale like war deck system  the tax system is shifted to also allow a maximum of 10  alliance tax if alliance is in effect in conjunction with lowering the value of moon goo with increasing availability across null alliances should be limited to the space they can hold aka as above there should be defence bonuses for small entities that hold sov as prior to latest sov changes your home system would be defended my swathes of towers and thus would be your UFFFDcapitalUFFFD this in turn formed a defence bonus within this system what i am proposing would be that the UFFFDhome systemUFFFD comes back into effect not via poses though but via a new module developed that doubled the amount ofUFFFD defence capabilities of that system for example this way you would give a bonus to smaller entities starting out and also the home system of the entity would get a bonus for defence after all most home systems are usually last to be taken would make for a even more interesting fight other than a straight oh well lets simply UFFFDabandon the spaceUFFFD attitude could also be scaled dependant on attackers something like a increase in the amount of hit points a defence structure has dependant upon the amount of dpsUFFFDUFFFDUFFFDokay so what would the above do  achieve UFFFDit would encourage more corps and smaller alliances into null sec spaceit would encourage smaller to medium size fights hopefully moving away from the large scale blob warfarecorps  alliances could get a foot hold and develop in nullwould allow for UFFFDpactsUFFFD to be made and more skirmishes over spacewould help UFFFDmanageUFFFD the issue of some alliance UFFFDowningUFFFD multiple regionsthey would be limited via skillsplayer countwill put UFFFDdiplomacyUFFFD and cooperation back up there in eve politics and diminish the blob warfare as a i win buttonwould help ensure more of 00 is actually utilised rather than simply UFFFDheldUFFFDUFFFDthe above is not a total roadmap but more of a discussion view point i realize that the above could upset some people especially those alliances that hold multiple regions and i guess initially some UFFFDallowanceUFFFD would have to be made for those and iUFFFDm also sure you could get some UFFFDpower playersrangersUFFFD saying there unhappy and treating to burn jita or some other such event hmm think i heard that one before but those would be replaced in time by smaller corps and alliances wanting that element of null sec that would be limited yes there would be more UFFFDcoalitionsUFFFD and this could be formal and informal mechanic but overall i think it would create more opportunities for small to medium scale conflict whilst allowing smaller entityUFFFDs to financially viable in nullUFFFDUFFFDthoughts i would also like to get the views of any devs that read this not on the validity of the proposal itself but on the viability to implement and develop the mechanics of doing so
interesting
well if i had called this ideas i want to stay bumped  you probably would have had even more negative things to say
im not sure what this is but it doesnt sound like an improvement
it means more than jusr corp roles basically instead of being given access to hangar 5 and being allowed into every hangar 5 at every alliance pos you could be assigned hangar 5 at only the pos on moon5 planet8basically allowing corp roles to be divided up more precisely and carefully so that new members in for instance wormholes can still live and participate in the same space as the older members without the older members being forced to make their assets available to theft it would also make new players more open to the idea of wormholes and pos living sense it wold mean they could feel safe putting something into their hangar since that particular hangar would be open only to themselves and those they trust enough to share with instead of the entire 300 man allianceits something almost every lownullwh group has been asking for for years
perhaps timelimits and dec immunity mechanics could be worked out to prevent permadeccing but i think what we really need is a way to reach out and touch someone who hides in an npc corp and uses it for easy mode gameplay
im less concerned about npc wardec immunity than i am about how cheap it is for instance a player corp may have say a tax rate of 5 but for a measly further 6 you get total safety which puts player corps at quite a disadvantagei would say a a npc corp tax rate of around 40  50 would be more in order to pay for wardec immunity and maintain a reasonable differential between npc and player corpsif you were to apply the tax to all transactions missions and mining yields that would also address some of the imbalances between high low and null
one of my friends just posted this to me 
i feel like thousands of others gms fail to do there job in supporting us as gamers of eve online if you feel the same here is where you can voice it so ccp will then check out there gms and do a over hall of there gm staff members i for one want better service more reliable gmsbetter customer service and for them to stop saying they cant when they can i would also want them to be more aware it is us the gamers the pilots and dust soldiers and mercs who pay to play who keep the company ccp running thru us buying plexs and for us paying the monthly or yearly time remember all we run the game ccp and gms are there to support us in how the game should be will be and has been we make the game we can ruin the game just as easy biggiyceo torvalandcorpinspace

actually if you cancel your miner midcycle it only takes a portion of that cycles worth out of the asteroidthus it should be actually fairly simple for a bit of programming that should be something like thistranslation to noncoders add a simple script that once a second checks to see if the amount of ore the module can collect in a full cycle divided by the full cycle time then times all that by the current cycle time is greater or less than the amount of ore remaining on the targeted asteroid if theres less the script exits shuts off the module and announces the module is completedthats all there is to it of course i dont know how the coding actually works but this should be a fairly easy to add code if ccp decides to try it 
ccp please use jalxans code love you  joe
1i fully support your proposal the overview as it currently stands can be a pain at times and not user friendly at all i love the fact that it is as customiziable as it is and you do nothing to take away from that and you are still able add many usefu

what an awesome idealogged off bittervets should also require oxygen when you log in your titan after 3 weeks inactivity it is only fair that you should persihfrom lack of air
jeebus what a crap ideajint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
this is either one of the best trolls in here or a ill thought out tedious game breaking change suggestion destination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
i dont know how you hacked into ccp unifexs computer but im telling on you
nothing wrong with any of this exceptafk cloakers do all this at zero risk to themselves so who exactly are the riskadverse carebears here
supportedfw is awful and the hate i feel for it oozes from my every pore reset to zero
indeed i also think these ideas could help players during big battles beeing able to quickly target an enemy can sometimes be the key to the success well i think soi would love to hear from developers that they are working on it but they remain silentlets hope these ideas will be added in the summer 2013 expansion
so take cloakers off localif they dont appear in local then they cant dissrupt anyones nullbearingthen the residents would just have to be a little more aware of the signs of an active cloaked vesseljint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move

maybe we have to go back to the basic of this discussion i for one donUFFFDt think any place in eve should be 100 safeeven though i am probably more of ferenghi at heart than a klingon i am against putting too many safety switches in thegamebut this game as every good and balanced game out there is nothing more than a very complicated game of rockpaperscissorlizardspock but with spaceships almost everything can be countered except cloaky stuff i do respect those cloaky pilots that invest their onlinetime to be in system and wait for their chance to strike i tip my hat to thembut the major difference is the afk in this whole scenario a mmo should be played not merely activatedi mean you could hide a complete fleet of thousands of ships in local i am exaggerating of course basically by just losing one highslot on all of them and just leave em there at a safe spot no chance to find housands of ships cUFFFDmon and please of course this would not be a viable tactic but it serves to make a point why should it be possible to hide foreverwhy shouldnt there any tool  method in the game to find cloaked ships that are just there forever it is not a matter of local chat or whatnot this might be a problem but it obscures and bloats the starting point of this thread the fact that cloakies cannot be detected and found in any way if they so prefer they can stay cloaked forever theres no way to force them to even play the game i repeat what i said earlier being afk does not mean you are playing the game but it should be vital for any success in the game that you are required to be active and playing thus the proposal of a tool  device  whatnot to find and expose afk cloakies hell if there was another tool to see whos afk or not in a exhumer or barge i am all for it this is the proposal nothing more the rest might have to do with it but its not the topic that would be saying to fix railguns you have to fix lowsec just because they are used thereimagine a cloaky in a wormhole no way to defend against it how balanced it that and again an active cloaky pilot should always be able to easily avoind getting detected and caught an afk pilot  not so much
im still pretty new but my experience so far is that when i do level 4 missions and bring out my light scout drones to kill frigates the frigates will immediately switch targets to the drones i can then order them back into the drone bay but that defeats the purpose of using them to counter frigates im not saying those drones arent effective but its almost inevitable that you will lose some drones in a mission with lots of frigates unless you have crazy micromanagement i think if ccp wants us to think of drones as being expendable like ammo they should bring the pricecost of production down a bit
problem a player who has returned from a security mission offered by a locator agent receives a confusing message specifically they are told something to the extent of paraphrasing you realize you have not yet completed the mission i assigned you and offered two choices view mission and locator service this may lead a player who has achieved all of the objectives to believe that there were objectives left incomplete this can be frustrating especially when mission objectives can already be confusing to new playersexample new player on trial account is assigned a mission to kill the npcs and bring back x item player kills all of the npcs and warps off thinking the mission is complete after making two jumps back to the mission hub he tries to turn in the mission to the agent who happens to be a locator agent the agent asks you realize you have not yet completed the mission right new player checks the mission objectives and realizes their error player makes two jumps back to the mission space and retrieves the item then makes two jumps back to the mission hub player receives the identical message from the agent you realize you have not yet completed the mission right player checks the mission objectives the look complete theres a green check player rants this game is broken and logs off one less potential subscribersolution change the message to be neutral on the subject of whether the objectives have been completed or not for example hello name have you completed your mission yet this way there is no text which may imply that the mission objectives have not been completed
dont you have a check symbol when you finish a mission objectif in the mission log 
yes but i think you are forgetting what its like to be playing eve on day one
1 improves game check2 no downside check3 effortless implementation check4 provide entitlement for bittervets not checked but thats alright1

itd be nice to see the starbases come into line with stations as a whole actually this whole thing of preparing members and people for lowsec 00 and wh space should revolve around living out of a pos and not just waiting to get ore back to a real stationpos as progression goes you start in a station were you can get to 100 and then go backwards to 75 if you move into 00 without an outpost really doesnt make sense only answer for 00 is ccp want more outposts p
this thread is completely sexist and i am offended by the suggestion thatnah just kidding 1
as long as the oxygen bay holds enough oxygen for about 28 days of being online because alot of people like to go on trips deep into hostile space alone and without backup and stay there hunting for long periods of timewhat a dumbass idea
even if you get afk cloakers removed the problem will shift to leaving some sort of insanely fast frigate or interceptor that cant be caught in a random safe spot
as someone who has been on both ends of the cloaky in wh equation i can tell you right now that there are ways to flush a cloaky out of ones system under certain conditions
