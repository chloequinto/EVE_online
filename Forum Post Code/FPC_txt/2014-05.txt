am surprise its not in game already  name change history is all the safeguard you need 
i thought use of macros was banned by the eula isnt this player macroing his goons via this multi boxing application
if its automated then its banned if it requires physical player input that its ok
the philosophical difference is that the player is directly controlling all of those characters no ingame action is being automated
this technically he is within the letter of the eula since the actions being transmitted have to be initiated by a human element there is no program making any decision of what to do when
i remember those photos ah the good old days
so you are saying that would be jumping at a gate all of his alts one by one my understanding of is boxer is that you click jump on one all the other windows receive the same command so they all jump through as one which is an accelerated rate compared to the ordinary as per the eulathe eula saysyou may not use your own or any thirdparty software macros or other stored rapid keystrokes or other patterns of play that facilitate acquisition of items currency objects character attributes rank or status at an accelerated rate when compared with ordinary game play you may not rewrite or modify the user interface or otherwise manipulate data in any way to acquire items currencyobviously he also uses the multiple boxes to accelerate the rate of his mininghow is this legal
because of the thing i just said and more importantly because ccp have repeatedly publically confirmed that it is allowed since its their game and their interpretation of the rules is the authoritative one it is ipso facto gamelegal
just a thought i would like to see eve manufacturers and merchants given access to eve convoy transport system this will do a few things 1 it will give an outlet for excess isk in the game 2 a more secured shipping for eve merchants and manufactures3 another target for eve pirates 4 help players move to system when they have large amounts of property 5 get low and null security sectors markets better equipt6 open up low and null security sectors to traders and manufacturers 7 did i say give pirates a lucrative target if they can take it down 8 more insurance could be sold to players for their property to be shipped the possibilities are limitless on what the game designers could come up with this was just a quick list
good idea already exists theyre called redfrog
so at the moment with the introduction of yet more clothing options to the new eden store previously nex store numerous threads on avatars and things you could do with them and an almost two year old thread that was recently closed on the exploration prototype i would like to request that the csm ask ccp for a state of play on the featurethe main questions that come to mind are will it be anything more than a display cabinet for clothing purchases is project legion meant to satisfy players wanting meaningful avatar gameplay what does ccp see as the future of this feature hopefully more than a micro transaction display cabinet im sure other players have their own questionsthere is certainly interest in the expansion of this feature it would be appreciated if the csm could at least ask the question of ccp i have no expectation as to when they deliver the feature but it does seem that the new development cadence should allow at least for something other than clothes
flamespar wrotethe main questions that come to mind arelist will it be anything more than a display cabinet for clothing purchases ccp unifex said 2 years ago that ccp had completely suspended development of the incarna codewhat have you heard since then to make you think that anything has changedi mean i dont know how to make this any clearer wis has had zero priority since 2011 which is essentially forever in development terms ccp have a whole bunch of other development priorities and given that developing wis is not significantly different from developing a whole new game which theyre already doing with 2 projects right now anyway whats their incentive so that some people who are already paying them for a game can go yeah thats pretty cool i guess

as said in the title multiboxing only really works for mining and possible missions if you know what you are doing however it presents a huge problem when one player can eat an entire belt singlehandedly in highsec with minimal risk often in or near newbie systems depriving new players of a reliable source of income in the first few minutes of the gameif all multiboxers were forced to stay in a player corp then it would assist in letting older players help in stopping people with money ruining the mining experience for new players
this is actually a pretty good idea and only helps with temporary dps while still having a trade off i support it though i kinda would like to see the role bonus also incresed to 75 per level to let it have the dpstank bonus for a little longer
to clarify ccp took the interpretation of at an accelerated rate to be a by account basis so an automation that allowed you to automatically stop your strip miners when a roid was dead and swap to a new one would be an accelerated rate since no human could achieve that accuracyefficiency however having all your accounts target the same roid and begin mining doesnt get you the ore any faster per account so each account is still earning money at the same rate as if it was being controlled alone
ah ok thanks for this clarification then this is the piece i was missing to understand the interpretation for is boxer
actually i believe their most recent stance was we arent saying its 100 ok but its not something we ban overwhich while its basically the same thing as its legal leaves them wriggle room to come back on it later and say theyve reviewed ban policy and this is now included so cease  desist
whatever hairsplitting makes you happy v0vthe op asked if it was legal not for a discussion about whether it is right or good game balance or will be legal 5 years from now or anything else its not forbidden ccp have repeatedly refused opportunities to forbid it ergo as far as they are concerned it is currently legal
putting trade and marketing in the hands of npcs was gotten rid of years agoviva la playerdriven economy

the biggest meeting places ingame are the trade hubs jita amarr  we all know em have you tried making a conversation in chat there than you know its flooded with scammers and advertisement bots dont worry im not going to plea to take action agaist these so called isk doubling services that would take too much moderation and debate what to allow and what notthe easy solution as suggested by many rightclick  block i respectfully disagree because there is no end to it nearly all of the time these spambots are freshly created alts or perhaps even trial accounts whom are only a few days old read disposable so you can start over again each time you log inmy solution is a generic oneonce a system has over 500 locals in it everyone is muted just making up a number scale it as you want for all i careto unmute yourself you need a certain character age there problem solved wasnt that easyconsidering everyone loves scaling these days and you want your developers to have a challange add another line of codeyou want to do it the eve way add new skillbooks there a new moneysink also discourages disposable characters due to training and cost example
i have 8 accounts with characters just sitting around maturing just in case this happensi have already beaten your changes before they began
and how do you expect ccp to monitor thisjint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
i agree to protect newbie systems against veterans but like jint said you cant monitor that i think it should even be extended beyond multiboxers considering new players dont mine a lot of mUFFFD perhaps the solution can be found in setting smaller ore amounts in the roids  discourages veteran players who need to swap target every 15 seconds
here is a statement made by ccps fozzie around 5 months ago in an interview to usgamer sounds pretty official for me and expanding the game content far further than simple 10 years old gameplay of ships pewpewing in a space should be a priority in fact just binding some external project of casual mmo shooter with bflike mechanics as if casual wasnt enough to eve universe wont do for thiswisincarna could be a great step to these new frontiers if done well if it offered new tools allowing players to modify visual appearance of new eden from their clothing to stations designs this would be it if it allowed completely new forms of interaction between players other than already starting to become boring shoot him in face while in space  not just strategic minigames and interactable soft chairs more like games of chance fully inegrated into the game client so allowing you to bid any ingame object or asset in your possestion including ceo rights and your own characters mental health and guarantee its transfering to the winner without constant need for some third party even if you just want to bid petty 500m at 3pm and chribba apparently sometimes need to sleep too assasinationsduels on stations under the mechanics other than ships battles ability to transfer some high valued assets only in person while on station and ability to intercept such deals  it would be it too

thats why ive contributed some time to write this piece linked in my signature though judging by the amount of support it met it isnt so important of an issue at all
they told me i shouldnt feed the trolls but im ignorant so ill bite true but do want to pay for 3 accounts just for that reason if not they arent disposable
they do other things like siphon goon moons in supercapsbut if you have the alts lying around not doing anything why wouldnt you use them for a scam or 5
now lets hope some developers will notice this thread it seems almost none of them are aware of ithow long do you think it takes for an idea to be considered
the developers are aware of it but they are aware of a lot of great posts i think they wait for the csm to bring it up and the csm will bring it up if it is catching attention in the community or if they think it would catch attentiontry getting some csm members to look at it i might start with mike azariah and sugar kyle
i beg to differpvpers can multibox as well without 3rd party apps like isboxer that effectively debunks your primary reason for this topic multiboxing miners who are not allowed in starter systems anyway asideso your real problem isnt that you dont know how to use multiboxing to your advantage its that you1 dont care to have more than 1 account2 cant afford more than 1 account3 dont agree with the concept of multiboxing in the cruelest mmo game on the planet4 cant be asked to bump them or shoot them5 are jealous of people who have overcome 123 and 4 and would like ccp to nerf them so you can play your gameas such eve online is not the game for you1 to your op1 for your tears
if you feel they do it with minimum risk then add risk yourself silly limitations that would be hard to police are not the way to add risk especially when war avoidance is so easyalso i find the whole source of income and ruining the mining experience for new players argument rather weak and hard to quantify seeing as there are still many many belts out theredestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless

i had posed the following in a thread named UFFFDwhy freighter bumping in high sec is an exploitUFFFDwhat say youi will state right here and now that i believe the bumping of a freighter with the intent of holding it in place while your fiends arrive to perform the gank is an exploit here are the reasons why1 the only reason you bump is to avoid the wrath of concord2 there are other ways to hold a ship in place all of which come at a cost in training time and equipment if bumping is allowed to replace the need for this training and equipment the bumper has the advantage of now being able to forgo the needed equipment and fill that slot with something else this in effect will unbalance the ship by giving it the ability of the modules skipped over and the ones used in their stead3 every intended mechanic has a counter and this does not donUFFFDt even try to say bring friends as that is not a counter to any mechanic other than being out numbered when was the last time you told someone asking how to fight a faster ship to bring friends4 there is no skill to train for bumping nor to counter bumpingin the end it comes down to this you are bumping to achieve the same results or better with no training time or investment in equipment that is achieved by a player that makes those investments you are doing this with the solo intent to avoid the wrath of concord that the player who has trained and bought the equipment is subject to

2 add new more interactive type of missions to the game with following featuresa should be offered after completion of a few typical missions based on new mechanics described in 1 they could become some sort of fleet storyline missions with perhaps equivalent frequency of appearing moreover it or its derivatives could be used in final pockets of high level combat sites or wh complexesb cant be possibly completed singlehandedly in one windowc highly resistable to multiboxing botting and legitimate scripts using due to higher level of interactivity they offer and due to the necessity to perform large number of different operations in different windows simultaneously so it requires cooperation of several human playersd offer significant level of challenge accompained by substantional increase in rewards per participante profits from such missions must scale only proportionally to number of gangsfleets members which are in the same corp as that who took the mission from agent but difficulty should scale proportionally to the whole number of group members so its much more profitable to form group with corpmates only to run this kind of missionsappendix why we need something like that while there are already incursions in the game1 incursions are still a high end pve content moreover to participate in it currently you dont have to be a member of any corp at all while proposed new mission type designed specifically with corporation activity in mind it will offer additional income only to groups consisting of members of the same corp what should serve as incentive to create longliving social groups even in highsecs incursions dont do the trick you could sometimes take a part in it without saying more than a couple of words2 profits from those new missions still somehow lesser but they always readily available from your agent and more familiar to those accustomed to oldfashioned missionruning3 offer new unique challenging content due to introduction of new interactive fleet storyline missions4 many people just run missions lets just take it for given they provide the games economy with influx of fresh isks and full the market with lp store gear they often are forced to run them solo due to substantional drop in profits in terms of iskhour and additional risks coming with running them in groupwhile being a member of player owned corp this impoverishs their game experience and could be one of the reason why many new players drop the game on first months of playing5 some variety and ability to choose have never hurt anybody in case of forms of group pve activities in highsecs there is no such thing currently its either incursions or soloing
further ill outline several schematic and quite crude examples of such new interactive fleet storyline missions simply to convey approach to their design i want to propose as before suggestons on other similar mission types as well as argumented criticism are welcomed1 hostile takeoveron warping into mission grid the first phase begins in which a bunch of slowly moving assault barges must be protected at any cost the main source of danger to them are cloacked turretsbombing vessels they are just spawn randomly around barges which have enough ehp to hold even focused fire of a group and able quickly wreck a havoc with barges so the best approach would be first jam them or supress their locking range and only after destroy them but there is one peculiarity with those turretsvessels  they wont appear in overview at all some hint to their whereabouts displayed in form of arrow pointing to the closest border of the games screen and player must rotate camera to find a very noticeable marker in space designating it then lock onto it using this marker some voice notification about new threat appearing would be useful tooat the same time endless waves of tackling vessels warp into close range to barges and try to slow down their advance ewar vessels try to deny you ability to protect barges and damagers meantime try do destroy them if assault party made it in one piece they switch off stations protection field and second phase begin you have to split your team in 23 4 and more this could scale up depending of real number of participants and each team must follow to their designated destination and try to stop a swarm of little unarmed fast moving vessels intending to crash onto station to demolish it the distances between said spots chosen so wisely that they all cant be covered by fleet of sniper bs at once from certain position no matter what so splitting up a team is a must moreover its very hard to hit those vessels from a distance and best approach would be to webify them and deal with them in close if you wont stop at less several vessels at each spot you will fail the mission for certain even if youll cover all spots you still have to stop most of incoming threats to complete it each one you wont be able to stop will reduce mission rewards2 artillery bombardment with a spotterto complete it youll need one to many bsbc fitted for long range sniping and coverig group covering group protects arty group from endless waves of ewar vessels and damage dealers and keeps some undestructable ewar structures constantly jammeddamped to prevent all this threats from interfering with bssbss mission said ewar structures keep switching off and on alternately and can be locked on to only while powered up they also wont appear in overview exaclty how it was described for similar threats in previous modelarty group granted with instalock ability like they are assisted by designated spotter and some region of space wide enough assigned to them this location cant be reached by any other means separated by clouds of overheated plasma andor mine fields andor threat of certain death resulting from enemys opportunity fire scripted events etc and its swarmed with different objects including moving ones any of this object at any time can be designeted as a target by a spotter randomly chosen by a game enginetargets are assigned to each bsbc individually aside from times when coordinated fire mission on sequence of targets is requested and all group must hit them with least possible delays between shots simultaneously by combination of huge rectangular frame encircling some group of objects large enough and a text message concretizing the actual target by landmarks text should be as much various as possible so the same object could be specified as fast moving dull coloured vessel or frigate moving to 3 hours from the abandoned laboratory or unknown vessel between asteroid and drednoughts remains moreover those targets can appear simultaneously and be of different types designated by said frames colour differing by their priority some will require immideate attention other will wait and some of them will be able to introduce a change into the waves of attackers on spot if left unattended those targets wont appear in overview as well most of them require a single accurate shotmissed or incorrectly guessed targets will reduce mission rewards and can lead to its failure
3 assault of automatic line of defenceyoull need at leat 2 bsbc fitted as snipersits a dead space pocket and so mwds arent available on warping in you find yourself in the middle of a passage going through higly hazardous cloud plasma energy radiation mine fields etc intersected with rows of defense drones at each 120150km you see first row at around 120km ahead and its control node much further away cant be even locked on from here or even if it can be you wont be able to break its tank from that distance additionally its protected from rush tactics by overpowered light missiles launcher arrays protection field generators are scattered along the passage at about 2030km from each other some defensive turrets were dislocated there before but now they are powered off and you have access to them alreadythe moment you reach the closest of those fields first row of defense becomes active all control systems have been already breached and shuted down so it reverted to primitive emergency logics it chooses its targets simply a initial one will be chosen randomly and fired upon untill it destructed drones will prefer targets unprotected by fields though b if fired upon defense will return fire to last attacker untill his destruction those fields effectively stop drones fire but accumulate damage over time and will switch off eventually you still can engage them from under the field without damaging it much like ships shield worksthe focused alfa and dps of those lines are so enormous that it will obliterate even most hardened hullsfits that can be granted access to the mission by a couple of hitsdrones those lines are composed of wont appear in overwiew either moreover different drones could represent targets of different priorities some will unlish devastating rain of fire if not handled quick others will be grouped together and will trigger massive drone spawn if not taken out all at once by coordinated fire and some may even shift their fire to moving party after some time to make sniping part of gameplay more excitingyou have 2 main tasks a engage drones with your covering sniper group striving to reduce their numbers to lessen dps been poured into protection field new will indefinetly warp in to substitute for destroyed ones but there is a delay to their appearance b send part of you group which must contain at least one sniper bsbc too ahead to the next field while other part are drawing to itself and trying to reduce incoming fire while staying under the field has to be mentioned that moving party cant help covering one with their task  the moment they engage the line of defense it will switch to its new attacker and definetly will blow him up to shreds upon reaching next field moving party becomes covering one and waits until group reunites again then the sequence will repeat itself if field is breached before it happens covering party will perish for certainall the time both parties are staying under attack of inceasing swarms of ewar equiped smallmedium vessels warping in close range to them which try to jamdampenslow them down and need help of those who can deal with such threatsafter you advanced close enough to the line you finally will be able to target andor destroy its control node switching all the systems at once but several of such lines can still wait ahead each harder than previous one

most agree that the current sovereignty system is awful sovereignty has the potential to be a huge conflict driver but in its current state it is more of an inhibiter my own idea is influenced by others that i have read about and is driven by what i feel sovereignty meanstldr in the simplest terms sovereignty is about control control of what happens within the borders of the sovereign territory if you can control a system militarily guard it against hostiles exploit its resources and live in it you will gain sovereignty over it if you abandon it or fail to protect it from harrassment that sovereignty will be compromisedoverviewall claimable systems in new eden are in one of two states claimed or unclaimed when a system is in the unclaimed state alliances competing for sovereignty over it build up sovereignty points sp which are gained via a variety of activities once one of these alliances gains a specified amount of sp they will achieve level 1 sovereignty over the system the name of their alliance will be displayed as the owner of the space and the state of the system will become claimed when a system is in the claimed state only the sovereign alliance has sp for that system the sovereignUFFFDs sp decreases at a steady hourly rate depending on which level of sovereignty they have beginning 24 hours after levelling up there are five levels of sovereignty each requiring an increasing amount of sp to reach in a similar though less extreme version of the five skill levels if the sp ever reaches the maximum amount the passive decrease ceases incursions and sp related activities performed by rivals count against the sovereignUFFFDs sp if the sovereignUFFFDs sp ever decreases below the minimum specified amount required to gain sovereignty over an unclaimed system it will be flagged as disputed the alliance still has sovereignty over the system and their name is still listed as the owner but the disputed status is listed with it there is no passive sp loss at this level of sovereignty but all other sp losses and gains count double their normal values if the sovereignUFFFDs sp ever reaches zero the system will revert to the unclaimed statesovereignty pointssp are earned by residing in using and controlling a system most activities have an sp value related to them sp changes are calculated and updated once per hour what follows is

ensure the total sp an alliance has truly reflects their control of the system or lack thereof control primarily means military control which is why pvp combat is weighted quite heavilysovereignty levelsan alliance needs to be the first to earn 500000 sp in a system when it is in the unclaimed state in order to gain level 1 sovereignty over it the total number of sp needed to gain higher levels and the passive sp loss at each level is as follows as mentioned the passive sp loss begins 24 hours after the last level uplevel  minimum sp required  passive sp loss per hourbdisputed  1  01  500000

alliance to gain more sp the benefit of having more sp is that it becomes more difficult and more time consuming for an enemy to conquer the system it also allows longer periods of low or total inactivity in the system the passive sp loss per hour values have been chosen such that an alliance which abandons its system entirely will lose a level of sovereignty per week unless other hostile entities move in in which case they will lose it faster maintaining maximum sovereignty will require every hostile element to be eliminated immediately
public standings and hostile activityanother important element of this system is in defining hostile sprelated activity in a claimed system in order to do this effectively a new type of standings is required in addition to the current one UFFFD public standings these are identical to the current standings except they are made public for all to see public standings can be different to actual standings all pvp kills count for or against the sovereign entity regardless of public standings other sprelated activities performed by nonalliance members within a sovereignUFFFDs territory only decreases its sp if the entity is classed as hostile an entity is classed as hostile if either the sovereignUFFFDs public standings towards that entity are negative or the entityUFFFDs public standings towards the sovereign are negative all other activities performed by entities with which the alliance holder has mutually positive or neutral public standings do not have any effect on sp whatsoever but if they are trading with sovereign entities the taxes and fees paid by the sovereign will have a positive effectimproving spacei am personally not a fan of UFFFDimprovingUFFFD space i think that space should be what it is and that the only benefits of sovereignty should be those listed above and bragging rights isnUFFFDt building an empire and having your allianceUFFFDs name written all over it reward enough i also think that the limitations placed on the building and deployment of certain structures eg capital ship assembly arrays are arbitrary unnecessary and remove potential conflict drivers anyone should be able to build anything in claimable space whether it is claimed by their alliance or not if an alliance doesnUFFFDt want a player to build capital ships in their space then they need to enforce thatif as i suspect they do most players disagree with me on the upgrading of space it can be easily incorporated into the new system sp earned in the pve combat category count towards the security index renamed from military index sp earned in the industry category count towards the industry index of the system the other categories could count towards their own indices with pvp combat counting towards the military index which could have different affects but i havenUFFFDt fully considered what they could be i like the idea however of a high security index improving the quality of mining while a high industry index improves the quality and quantity of rats that spawn as mentioned here
one of the biggest reasons why people control as much space as they do is because to acquire any reasonable amount of resources you have to even the best ratting systems only support a few ratters at a time alliance level income sources such as moons are spread far and wide and are actually worth relatively little isk when you look at their value in any reasonable way this provides an incentive to spread out and gobble up as much space as possible everything else  sov mechanics power projection etc  merely provide the meansin other words your idea seems very focused on the fact that big empires do exist and shrinking their holdings down with no regard for how or why thats the case in the first place in fact you seem to go completely the opposite holding space should be about establishing your domain and turning that domain into a place you want to live in and use and defend  you seem to be under the absurd notion that it ought to be all about name on the map who cares if its worth living there you can make money elsewheretheres nothing wrong with the high level how and how much you use your space determines your control over it concept necessarily your specific implementation just misses the mark on several problems
it seems you are talking about the value of space which is not something i am trying to address population density is something which can be adjusted by fiddling with the numbers i have given in my proposal if space is not valuable enough for a given system to support a certain number of players then that is an issue that needs to be dealt with separately sovereignty is more about war and politics it should be stand offish enough to allow for varying and inventive tactics and strategies there is no agenda here to favour one alliance size over another or to shrink down big empires though that may be a necessary consequence  i honestly dont know the current sovereignty mechanics do favour a particular size of alliance  very big ones  because they require great numbers not only to grind down the huge numbers of hit points on sov structures but to counter the massive fleet that will be waiting to meet you at the arranged time this restriction on game play styles is what needs to be addressedperhaps you have misunderstood what i have written or maybe you are seeing something in my op that i myself am missing because i completely agree that holding space should be about laying roots and building a home an empire that is worth defending something to be proud of when i wrote about name on the map what i was really getting at was that sovereignty should be a consequence of your actions and of the reality on the gro out in space not a means in and of itself in fact it is the current system that makes it more about just your name being on the map since all you have to do is plonk down a structure and then leave  as you say you can make money elsewhere under my proposal if you leave it you risk losing itthat may be the case but other than the value of space what am i missing
well as this topic fails to attract interest of englishspeaking community for what i probably have to blame inter alia my crude language skills and im very sorry for that  ill at least will do my best to translate snippets of ongoing discussion on russian speaking boards for those who will may be read it laterwhat this proposal actually pursuits is a creation of generic pve framework which will be able to dynamically on the fly create mission the moment you receive it from an agent or warp to the complexs gate based on some initial parameters like power index and composition of your fleet proportion between your overall numbers and numbers of those belonging to the same corp as that who received it from the agent mobs npc faction type of space mission complex are in name of mission so worlds collide will have some distinguishing features while within their bounds it will be randomized each time you will receive it  like it is done in many roguelike games out there where worlddungeon is created anew each time you start new game session comparing to implementing and supporting a huge amount of static pve content like its being done currently and like its being done in wow and other similar thempark mmos this is as it appears to me a significantly less tedious approach and still it will offer very diverse fun and challenging pve content to games playerbasesome missions could be more static than others to make them offer somewhat more unique experience  like fleet story missions proposed above but even those can benefit from randomization to some extentthe question remains is that possible for dev team to create such framework in the first place of course
while i agree that the transport industry in eve needs some help most certainly for less than redfrog sized jobs this activity should be done by playerssome of the reasons it is not margins are already very narrow for many goods anyone can get into an industrial for relatively little cost collateral risk is high for the players who would be most attracted to relatively low effort low sp and consequently low reward game play
ccp hilmar spoke at fanfest 2013 about the possibilty of opening that door its a valid question csm 9
sohow do you actually take sov if the holder doesnt undock
they are essentially handing control over to you so sovereignty will flip eventually rather than fly over to their system for a fight that you wont get a good way to take sov would be to organise an invasion and occupation force the invasion force will keep them besieged preventing them from maintaining their sovereignty level and keeping up with their passive sp loss it can also destroy any ships that try to pass through and destroy infrastructure if it has the ships numbers and inclination the occupation force will be industrial and pve players who will set up poses build mine rat run anomalies etc in the scenario where a small alliance wants to take sov from another small alliance in a different time zone who also docks up and doesnt want to fight the above is still relevant but further strategies will need to be employed to speed up the take over off the top of my head have spies infiltrate their alliance observe their behaviour and habits so that their normal operations can be disrupted point out key infrastructure to be destroyed capitalise on weakness generally wreak havoc recruit a small corp into your alliance from the relevant time zone to disrupt their play hire mercenaries to do the abovethe best way to defend your space is to defend it militarily there may come a point where an alliance realises that they are losing and just runs they can stay in system and slow the takeover down at that point but they are merely delaying the inevitable unless they have a plan in place to launch a second defensiveedit to clarify what is happening on the mechanical level when a sov holder wont defend its space and you do the above minimal sp gain for passive industry pospoco presence docked in station presence this is 1 sphour passive sp loss sp loss for presence of hostile ships in space sp loss for nonsov passersby or friendlies being destroyed sp loss if any infrastructure is destroyed sp loss for hostile industry and pve activities sp loss for hostile pospocos presencei think it is also important to note that any alliance that simply docks up when trouble comes knocking is unlikely to have much of a presence in the system to begin with meaning their sov level is unlikely to be higher than 2 which means taking sov from them should be relatively easy if they are a large alliance waiting for reinforcements from some distance away they will have to keep those reinforcements there to defend their space or else they will have to keep running backwards and forwards to counter you every time you launch an incursion
ok so months later ive given some more time for things to work themselves out
why have a limit at allis it a data storage issuebecause i cant think of a gameplay reason to put a 24 hour limit on escalationsin my case its 1030pm on a sunday night and i was about to hit the sack im in the middle of crunch at work trying to make beta im sure ccp engineers will understand so all week long ill be working at least 12 hour daysi pretty much have time to sleep commute and workand of course on the only site i do tonight i get an escalation with a 24 hour timeri dont see why that timer needs to be so short or even exist at all if theyre worried about having to store the data then put a limit on how many any given pilot can have active at any one time

hopefully this has not been thought of yet because it seems like a very easy thing to implement and thus should have been done alreadymy corpies and i were joking about the usefulness of the cq tonight while we were getting camped in station one of the guys mentioned you would think in the future there would be a damn port hole on the station to look out good point it is thousands of years in the future and we cant tell or look outside a station through a windowit got me thinking and thus why i propose here why doesnt ccp do just thatthe idea is that in order to see outside the station you have to enter the cq  thus actually adding functionality and reason for the cq and also adding a neat should be realistic beyond belief edge to the game to counter campers versus the not so fair undock and redock quick method it is a good counterbalance to station camping and not 110 skewed towards the defender the guy hiding in the station either due to cloaks and lag from the time it takes you to look to undock in your podsimple to implement as using this cq tool would just look like what you would see outside the station in a ship but say with a fixed perspective camera from on top the station you chose the tool and you are absorbed into the outside view when done the cq reloads and you chose to undock or stay ini cant think of a flaw csm  and i hope you read this idea and at least respondotherwise  flame on forum warriorsaliath

unfortunatly some people are harder to educate than others on such a straight forward issue its kinda like marriage equality or pot legalisation its a good idea but its hard to pass
having more space obviously generates more income but your use of the word reasonable doesnt seem very reasonable its a completely subjective term who knows maybe youre talking about an income of several trillion per second maybe youre talking about 100k per year it seems strange to base your argument around some peoples perspective on what you want vs what you needwhat is reasonable doesnt change the issue that its far too easy for big alliances to hold a lot of space they dont actually use in the current system whoever has the biggest fleet almost automatically can hold however much space they want as the effort required to defend space you already have only lies in the logistics of getting a fleet together cyno alts jump bridges and titans completely trivialized travel as well of course there are breaking points  the reason one entity doesnt own all of eve  but the problem remains in that the current sov implementation doesnt require anything to maintain it even prevents pvp up to a certain point as sov level warfare is an allornothing affair where you either have enough supercaps to kill your enemy or you dontfollowing this the current sov system creates the very need for wealth you mention where it becomes obvious that in actuality its just a viscious circle perpetuating itself the link has to be broken somewhere and the sov system the op proposes seems like an as good a place as any its nowhere near perfect obviously but a sov system based on activity is still far better than a sov system based on relative inactivityedit forgot to mention you also note that the sov system should be about creating a place you want to live in the proposed system does exactly that  even rewarding you for living in a system whereas the current does not as it promotes passive activities far more than active ones you dont live in a system when you only ever go there to refuel a pos and take some cargo from itedit i did miss the point about supporting a population as far as the available possibilities in systems go but with a system which rewards activity i dont see a problem with giving higher sov levels access to more or better ratting spots to name an example as far as moon mining goes imho its overdue for a complete overhaul anyway its outside of the scope of this particular topic but id suggest moons deplete like asteroids do without them dissappearing of course and replenish afterwards though with a different resource moons have to be 100 depleted before the refresh can begin so people cant just mine down to 1 tech and let it grow again after which the resource will be queued to appear in another random moon or it can replace a current moon at 100 which has not been mined for an x amount of time 50 chance of both this makes moon scanning relevant again as well as incite more fights over precious moons or even just to scan it also adds another layer to information warfare as its not 100 clear who has what resource anymore the available resources per moon would have to go up of course to accomodate the loss of mining time when the resource is depleted and a new moon has to be found it could even create an entirely new layer of economic warfare if done right
i firmly believe that sov should generally switch hands via pvp actions that being said i also believe that system vulnerability should be based on how much the system is utilized on the one extreme an unused system should have no rf timers on any of their sov structures so any small entity can come in and destroy all claims on that system anytime they want on the other extreme a heavily utilized system should require significant effort to conquer with many rf timers and perhaps other defensive bonuses i dont have a particular standard to measure system activity but i like how your sp system attempts to quantify this with both pvp and pve aspects
how about hiring npcs to guard your claim these npcs could exist in a variety of plexes and would have to be destroyed in order to take sov massive fleets could come in and hit massive plexes small fleets could hit smaller plexes and small frigates could be used against various support npcs essentially well tanked haulers unlike faction warfare the only timers involved would be on the spawn timer of plexes which would give the sov owners a chance to build a counteroffensivean alliance would have to bring in their own fleet to counter it andor pay to replace losses this would also make a fantastic isk sinki could see how concerns would arise about the profitability of null being harmed but with the extra cost involved you would likely see a rise in the cost of moon goo and the bpcs that drop from the ratsthats my guess for a solution
agreed that is exactly what i have aimed to do here if you want to defend or take sov you need to pvp do you think my system fails to do that if so where how what could be changed to improve itthe problem i have with sov structures is that they are totally arbitrary a little like putting a flag down and saying this is mine with the sp system if a solar system is not used it is automatically vulnerable because total sp will be low perhaps even low enough to have the system flagged as disputed an alliance who wants to take sov in such a system should be able to do so easily because there is little or no opposition if the opposition is elsewhere and is willing to defend their system from the aggressors they have the opportunity to do so by sending in reinforcements the required response time of this task force will depend on how low their sp was and the nature and organisation of the invasionoccupation force but i estimate that it will be at least a few days even for disputed systems to revert to unclaimed status without pvp if instead low sp equated to nolow rf timers on the sovholders flags you are forcing the attacker to bore themselves destroying structures that dont really have any relevance whether the defenders are willing to fight for what they have or notthe opposite is true for a heavily utilised system sp will be high so an attacker will need to blow up a lot of big ships and relevant structures with rf timers without losing as many in return in addition because the system is so heavily utilised there will always be plenty of players ready to defend it from hostiles thank you i know there are definitely things that could be added taken away andor changed to make it better
i dont see a lot of concrete objectives to complete when taking an enemy system prevent pve by harassment destroy poss if deployed attack outpost if it exists but these objectives arent present in every system furthermore in a wellutilized star system you really need some critical objectives that can reasonably be defended like ihubs with rf timers while fw certainly has its problems it does some things very well there are very concrete takedefend objectives that even a solo pilot can accomplish im kinda rambling now but i feel like claiming sov should entail more than just system activity and im a big fan of investing to improve your space
agreed the addition of sp boosting stuctures that are necessary to move forward or keep from sliding backward as far as the sov level is concerned would be a nice way to add conflict and would be a good balancing point for ccp to be able to track and change sp gainslosses
i think youre underestimating the scope of this by doing this youre provoking fights of all shapes and sizes a good alliance would respond to an attack on minersrattersexplorers by sending in ships to defend them any such engagement has the potential for escalation then there is the influence system which makes things much more complex in border wars what happens in one system has an effect on nearby systems so alliance leaders and fcs need to set their own strategic objectives based on what they think will tip the war in their favour choose the wrong objective focus on the wrong area neglect areas of weakness and you risk losing groundhaving said that headshotting a large alliances core sov level 5 solar system is difficult under this system all there is to do is hit the outpost though these types of attacks could lead to massive fleet battles thanks to rf timers for objectives in a single solar system i think part of the answer is in changing poses and outposts so that they can be improved and destroyed piece by piece but that is a discussion for another threadas for allowing solo players to be able to achieve sov objectives im not sure they should be able to do much more than annoy taking space is something that should only be accessible to groups unless a given solar system is so undesirable that only single players would ever be interested in using it
overall this is a fantastic idea activity based sovereignty is what i have been advocating in a recent thread and in my opinion is just what 00 space needs as far as needing to spread out and claim regionwide space in order to maintain alliance level income moon goo this is simply a matter o ccp reworking the way moon mining and the like work it again seems arbitrary that only a single structure can be placed at a moon and only that structure can pull out moon goo the simple fix for this is to revamp moon mining to resemble pi and moreover have efficiency of the new mi moon interaction tied in some way to system sov
that is a very interesting idea id prefer them to have additional uses though so they are not purely sov structures player owned stargates of limited range and gate guns are the first things that come to mind
or perhaps they facilitate the next better way to gain sp from the various sources you listed in the op they would make the gaining of sp easier so their destruction would make the loss of sp easier as well again they would be targets of opportunity for guerrilla warfare but not absolutely necessary to destroy perhaps ownership of them could even be transferred to the new sov holder and that group would want to protect them to speed up the sp gains
so i am in fw while being outaw in average i am agressed once every roam from a friendly noob who didnt have the ov set up correctly i simply dont want to explain them every single time how to fix it after usually contracting their stuff from the wreck back it makes me feel bad for having to kill them it makes them feel bad after they realized that the first thing they did after joining fw was to shoot at a friendly it wastes everybodies timethe ov default is horrible the priorities are simple wrong not only the sec status settings if ccp cares about npe give noobs a proper overview default and dont tell me that everybody has his overview completely different i bet that 90 of all in pvp involved players have the ov priorities sorted very similarly you can even see it from the fact how popular those overview packs are since they work for almost everyonesuch fixes improve npe more than freaking tooltips its not rocket science
there is no right or wrong only awesome or crap depending on what youre doing for example i have 14 different overview setups because there is no one size fits all
well i disagree i think you can find a setting which is a good default for most use cases if you are a fc or in a fleet with 400 others you will modify it of course if you are mining you will add rocks the current setting is wrong not bad the priorities how it sorts standings sec status militia highlighting and crimewatch flags does not make sense if all you do is flying around in nullsec you wont see most of it since you dont even have crimewatch but noobs are not spawned in nullnot to mention that you have 1 priority setting how players are highlighted in your overview not 14 you might have different bracket profiles or tabs but thats not even the point of my postthe first thing what people told you as you joined goons was probably to fix your overview with a link to a guide

no i literally have 14 different overview setups which can be switched in  out with a couple of button presses i only use 3 seperate bracket profiles the overview is far more customizable than you seem to be willing to believe  i stand by my original point of there being no single correct setup
this thread is not about finding the correct setup its about a good default nobody wants to take your 14 profiles from your client
ok instead of saying proper overview setup you could perhaps provide an example of a proper setup for ccp to look at im sure out of the limitless variations that you can find at least one proper setup that caters to anything a new player might find themselves doingwhat id actually like to see is a tutorial module that describes how the overview can be modified to suit peoples needs
suspect criminal low sec status outlaw should all have lower priority than in your corporationalliance militia etcpilot set custom positive standings should be above outlawsuspectcriminallow sec status but below letpilot set custom negative standings should be below outlawsuspectcriminalthose are just a few examples after looking at a fresh char on the test server and its only the priority setting on the appearance tabvelocity for example is a column which would not hurt to ad as default since for a new player its hard enough to see what is moving and what is notand eve hashad a tutorial section which explained the overview and even forced you to add a tab and a mission object to the overview i could imagine its no longer there to increase the new player retention of the first 20mins configuring the settings of a table is not what you want to do when you are new to a spaceship game if you play it for a month you might want to customize it but you should not be given bad defaults when you start typical new player activities like trying out fw should not start with you firering at friendlies because the game displays them in blinking red
the problem itself lay with the way the tutorial is presented in the first place instead of shoving the whole thing in someones face perhaps it could show the very basic principles of moving around in the game  allow people to choose extra modules of their own free willas for the standings priorities i respectfully disagree that the ones you have laid out are the only correct ones
your corpmatesfw mates should not display as outlaws just to pick one issue of the current default since thats not what you care about crimewatch should not overwrite positive standings otherwise you will shoot friendlies earlier or later while let should stay at top priority and keep in mind there are distinct settings for the background and for the icon so in controversal cases you could have different settings for both the default has identical setting for bothand if you disagree then please say why noobs dont know what those flags are not to mention when they occur for that exact reason good default are needed till they know what they are doing
the overhead module is used in a very few set ups by very few i mean one that i know of i like the idea i dont know if maybe just adding a 5 bonus to weapon damage when over heating per level would also make this sub useful
personaly i think having to wait 1 year between remaps is a pitai am slowly running out of stuff to train at 178m sp i have trained all sub caps trained all caps apart from rorq and titan i would like now to be able to use a plex to purchase a neural remap instead of having to wait a couple of months for the next remapso i would like to propose that we are able to purchase 1 neural remap per plex and no limit on the amount of neural remaps we can purchase
when remaps were first announced they were coming with a 6 monthly allowance but many players didnt like it so ccp changed it to 1 a yeari doubt they will change their minds and i doubt the many of the players will eitheri have over 200 mil sp and have a training plan that will be on going for another 3 to 4 years if i renew my sub that isdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
yes im actually created similar topic myself in the past ill drag their related snippet from my outlines of wis hypothetical features also
wis is actually very useful it stops anything else from actually being worse than it  i have no problem with it staying that way
any of these wis features could be hangar features without wasting time and energy on space dolls even gambling
the most useful way to make the cq useful is to remove that 4gb of bloat from the client unless  until they actually follow through with walking in stations
it has been asked for along with a channel that shows in cq that would be from a station camerathough i could just see some joker parking in front of said imaginary camerayeah it would be nice thoughmmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
i already have please refer to earlier posts
i think that since the default overview hasnt been touched for a long time except to add new ship types its plausible theres room for improvement and i dont see a reason not to have a review of the default settings to ensure theyre useful to a newbiei think it might be outside the bounds of the tutorial but an visible and easily accessible resourced be great
yeah exactly esp since it is not much work for ccp to tweak the default setting and it has good potential to spare noobs a lot of trouble in the beginning
i assume that because ccp approve it dont mean they will support it or fix game issue that happen only with multiboxeri recall blizzard make decision for purpose to stop bots that also break multiboxer they disable follow in battleground
you know what would be funnyif ccp knows and wants to do this for the reasons stated in this thread but cannot because doing so would reset the overviews of every single person in eve and the devs still have not figured out how to enable people to save every part of their overview settings because it is running on ancient code from the times of the elder gods and people get really pissy about their overview settings it took me 2 goddamn hours to set it up just righthey based on what many know about ccps coding this is entirely plausible
that doesnt sound funny
its not supposed to sound funny
thats the joke
this would be cool for sure esp if you could switch between multiple cameras eg station sentries undock etc but i could imagine that it is more coding work as we might thinkhowever if you mean that you would see a stream of the camera on your cq screen or any kind of window i think this is very unlikely since you would have to run both engines at the same time the spaceship one and the cq one seing the exterior fullscreen would be much simpler to implement from the graphics standpoint at least
purchasing a remap with a plex is not going to make any difference to the problem stated in your request that being i am slowly running out of stuff to train at 178m spso no there is no need to make changes to allow the purchasing of extra remapsjint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
no thank you it may be somewhat trivial but it is a pay to win scenarionecessity is the plea for every infringement of human freedom it is the argument of tyrants it is the creed of slaves  william pitt
ok folks anyone who has had a pos thrown into reinforced knows that they instantly become a slave to the reinforcement timer how many times have you tried to get your corp mates up at 3am to start the logistics needed to get your pos shields back up to 50 so you can actually do something with it againproposal 1 early exit there is really no reason whatsoever that the person who puts pos fuel in the reactor should not also be able to remove the unburned strontium from the strontium bay which means that the pos exits reinforced mode at the next 1 hour fuel inject cycle this allows the defending corp the option to exit reinforced mode early and start the logistics at a time of their own choosing instead of being a slave to a fixed public timer that is screaming out come back and kill me in 1 day and 16 hoursi mean really folks  if ccp is going to give a time option on when to exit reinforced mode for the owner of a poco  the owners of a pos deserve the same consideration for their hard spent isk this allows the defenders to start the logistics and then work on their pos when their corp is online instead of trying to get everybody up at some godawful hour the attackers if they are watching and who have the responsibility to watch since they are the ones besieging the place can always show up in a huge fleet and go to work on the pos as normal if they are so inclinedproposal 2 reinforced timer lets discuss the fixed public timer for a moment is there really a reason why my pos is broadcasting to the universe the exact minutes and seconds remaining until it runs out of strontium you would think that exactly how long we can maintain the emergency defense shield would be a carefully guarded military secret i am not saying that the attackers should not have some indication but a minute and second timer is ridiculous i dont have that precision fueling the pos so why should an attacker have that precision when trying to bash iti suggest that that exact minute and second timer be replaced by a percentage power indicator  start off at 100 reinforced and drop by 5 increments as the strontium fuel bay is consumed attackers can still figure out when to come back if they watch and when the thing gets down to 10 reinforced you know you are in that last 4 hours of that 41 hour reinforced timer on a medium pos and can act accordingly if you do 5 increments then the exit can be timed to a two hour window same as a poco
so basically you didnt time your pos right so now you want ccp to make it virtually impossible to kill the things
no  i did not time it wrong i am just damn tired of getting up at 3am to jerk around with thiswith all the tools available watch lists alts in system etc do you really think the attacker wont know what you are doingthe only benefit the defender gets is to actually have his corp online when the pos comes out of reinforced allowing the selection of reinforced exit on pocos sure has not made them indestructiblethis becomes even more critical with the pos changes coming in crius ccp  do you really expect people to lay out billions of isk on all those arrays and a pos just to watch it get popped by pos looters 5 time zones ahead who will be there at 8am while your corp mates are asleep at 3amgood luck with that
you can already time your pos to come out when you want it to being able to push a button have it come out and rep it up before the guys attempting to take it down can scramble a fleet to stop you is not the same at all your idea gives the defender every advantage and hell ensures noone is going to take an r64 from a coalition ever again before you say that never happens go ask mordus angels black legion and the guys who live in npc fountaindelve what they get up tonot only that but it gives csaas a truly stupendous buff making them a hell of a lot harder to kill and thus making supercap production even easier
the main reason i wanted to add an extra gun is because of how overheating and heatspill works by making extra highs that arent necessarily used for weapons mind you you increase this configurations versatility a bit and also stretch the risks of chronic overheating further out5 per level is very reasonable but not for this sub i think based on my research in to caldari missile boats they typically fall short on gross damage put down field and this is before looking at other missile intracacies like being speed tanked or having missiles outrun the additional high slot and the loss of a low for examplemeans you can lose a nano or dcu ii which in the configuration i run is nearly 40k ehp lost or otherwise find it harder to run away however it does mean that i can volley pesky frigatesdestroyers off me a bit faster to drive that second point home i invite you to run a couple of exploration sites or level 3 missions with rlml and see just how bad this weapon is for that kind of environment while i understand that acblasters and to some degree pulse lasers are mostly balanced around pvp ie 24km combat the cruiser missile systems are not and are affected very heavily by even the basic speed of the target its not unreasonable to assume a frigate might be dualprop and sit at 20km orbiting you at 1200ms which places them far outside of web range otoh maybe the oher sub could instead of granting an extra high or raw damage or whatever it increases the oh bonus from modules similar to new t2 transports which covers quite effectively the need for more damage and doesnt necessarily change any current balancing as far as slot layout is concernedi personally still favour the extra highslot to bring the damage output up to spec especially for a tengu but perhaps an almagimation of our two ideas could be appropriate as well
no what you can do is take a guess and put in an odd amount of strontium in the bay and hope that you miss the attackers peak time when it comes out of reinforced  not really the same thing at all being able to remove strontium from a tower in reinforced is not all that different except that you are guaranteed to be able to pick your peak time within an hour or two again  you take the pos out of reinforced the defender then has to rep it  which is not done at the push of a button yes the buff is to the defender but it is a needed buff and will not stop a determined foe who can keep coming back to put it in reinforced again camp the system post cloaked scouts etc
op do you not understand the advantages your proposal gives to defenders it takes 6 chimeras one 5minute triage cycle to repair a pos that is 10 minutes for 3 carriers which isnt all that hard to come by i point this out to show you that repairing a pos can be done within minutes of a pos exiting rf now you might wonder why a big alliance ever loses poss then especially those with supercapitals building a 100b isk titan is certainly worth enough to sacrifice half a dozen carriers the only reason these poss are destroyed is because the attackers can reach the field first and prevent the carriers from repping the tower with your proposal the attackers no longer know when the tower exits this means they have to monitor the tower for the next 40 hours and instantly form a fleet to stop someone ninjarepping it when we are talking alliances and coalitions with 20k members each the only balanced manner for pos defense to work is for the defenders to set the rf exit time and for the attackers to be told when that rf time is allowing both fleets the opportunity dominate at the tower if you find tuning the pos rf timer by controlling the amount of stront in the tower is inadequate a much more logical and balanced approach is request ccp alter pos rf mechanics to mimic poco or station rf timers with those structures you get to designate an exit window like 01000300 and the structure will exit rf around or during that time window there will still be a countdown and everyone and their mother can show up at the publicly broadcasted exit time you just have to micromanage the pos less to get your desired exit time
i know there has been a lot of talk and a good bit the threds asking for this change i would like to see this happen for a caldari navy warp disruptor you need 38 federation navy fleet captain insignia i 61 federation navy fleet major insignia i thats kinda insane just to get them
ccp is planning to rebalance modules in the upcoming future now this might mean 6 months or it might mean 2 years but winter is coming im very certain they will examine the build costs and stats at that time
it is obvious that the way the patches are happening and not the frequency is the issue at hand it is very annoying not too mention amateurish to click my eve icon and it responds were still not working proper let me try to fix myself for the nth time this weekccp should implement background patching that constantly keeps the eve client up to date so it is ready to go when youre ready to play
because of falcon of course
 1cant find any fault with this idea everyone wins o
while it is well understood that highsec sovereignty is notionally held by the empires practical control is often held by other entities this is similar to rl where a particular hood might technically fall under a city municipality but local power is practically concentrated in a gang family club or social networksovereign nullsec and lowsec faction warfare zones already have mechanics for recognising this its time for highsec to join ini propose that highsec constellations andor regions display some indicator of the alliance that wields control there be that through monthly player kill numbers player kill values or some other meaningful measure of force projection this need not convey any game mechanic benefits to the controlling alliance although the designers may wish to consider that even just the status of practical ownership would drive emergent content for everyone and limiting it to player alliances would help drive players out of npc corpsi feel this would be very useful as code and the new order of highsec are regularly subjected to complaints about our not holding sov in highsec when we do hold it for all practical purposes it causes a lot of confusion and could be fairly simply rectifiedthank you
this is a wonderful ideatheres a hell of a lot more to controlling space then just nullsec sov and this would offer some fun positive feedback to corporations and alliances that spend a lot of time pvping in nonnullsec regionsa good side effect would be a warning system for the risk adverse perhaps some miners would think twice about afk mining in a system that lists code alliance as the top power projector in that areaanyway wonderful idea 315 to you op
first lets not call it power projection power projection is a different thing than system control next having a highsec influence map to identify the most influential corps within a highsec system sounds pretty awesome but im not sure the best manner to measure this it could be kills in a system the corp with the most kills however this is only one of the measures of system activity and dominance we could measure industry in system or mining or missioning or market volume or 
i think having recognition at corp level devalues alliance membership in my own example it doesnt matter if the recognised power is the conference elite or experimental fun times reloaded corp what matters is they are both members of code the lower the level the more easily outlying events can affect the result similarly individual systems are not so important and recognising at that level would increase exposure to irrelevant outliers  better at constellation or region level these reward concerted effort and cooperationi agree there are many measures of dominance but running industry jobs and shooting red crosses and rocks are not among them let the criteria be pvp related pve aficionados are in it for isk not for metagame dominance and recognising particularly efficient multiboxing ratters as dominating an area would be meaningless
you only want it to be pvp shooting ships related cause you would be butthurt otherwise when your alliance didnt have there name anywhere if its based off anything it should be market pvp lots more of that happens then ship pvp
why not all of them take an average of all of the events pvp trading mining industry movement categorized them into a 100 point scale for each treating data points that occur between corp members such as corp members trading with eachother or shooting at eachother as nonindicators they arent counted that way practical control is equally possible to any corp regardless of stylethe 100 point scale and where you fall on it would be based on averages for your region so each constellation is based on regional averages average across all corps active in a region will be a score of 50 someone whos 10x that in say trade volume will be 100 within their constellation in control points of course the exact number scale and number ratios are completely arbitrary and for theoretical purposes this way even a corp who only station trades could have practical control over a constellation against even a pvp corp if theyre relative station trading amount is vastly disproportional to the relative pvp of the pvp corp aswell a corp that does everything averagely could steal control from a corp that only does one or 2 things if theyre overall points add up
this is a serious thread maam please dont bring your barely literate trolling here nobody could seriously believe that market pvp could be a measure of player control
primarily because most of those things have no effect on any player other than those who are doing the activity and are thus not a measure of dominance nullsec sov and faction warfare control arent determined by who afks the most veldspar why should highsec be any different
because it does its providing market material an activity countered by pvping if you dont want their dominance pvp more then they mine or just plain kill them why should highsec only cater to pvp play styles for recognition low and nullsec doesnt low rewards semiafk farmers and null rewards people willing to pay for space
maam you are using strawman fallacies at no point have i said that highsec should only cater to pvp playstyles players are welcome to conduct any codecompliant activity in highsec and of course the same activities occur in null and lowsec but  and heres the important part  those activities arent tied to control because they arent a measure of controlyou are welcome to start an assembly hall post about recognising industry and botaspirancy in highsec but this thread is about recognising power and dominanceheres an example lets say im an adorable newbie flying through lonetrek in my plexpurchased providence full of red frog contracts is it more useful to me to know that there is a highly efficient afk multiboxing ice miner resident in the region or that code is actively targeting non codecompliant pilots
t2 guns with max skills give more damage with same ammo as faction guns with max skillsonly missiles are an exception here where the faction launcher are better with max skills than t2
at sustained dps using faction ammo otherwise theyre outperformed by speciialist ammos
glad and not glad to still see this thread around only reason i am not glad is because the idea was never implemented ttttthere will be neither compassion nor mercy nor peace nor solace for those who bear witness to these signs and still do not believe  the scriptures book of reclaiming 2510
being able to distinguish between similarly named channels would be really nicefor example the channels alliance blues and alliance intel are right next to each other when grouped in a box itd be nice to have their tabs colored either red or blue depending on preference
i think you need a measure of the different activities in each area the prominent missioning corp in osmon may have a direct influence on the value of sisters lp the prominent mining corp in constellation xyz may have a direct influence on the value and availability of ores in the area the prominent pvpers in aufah may have a direct influence on freighter services through the system the prominent industrialists in itamo may have a direct influence on the si lines available or in the next release the teams available within system now you could say it doesnt matter influence that control is something different blowing up a freighter that enters aufay prevents the freighter from freighting perhaps mining all the roids in a system prevents another player from mining in that system but thats not direct interference my counter to this is i dont care about control as much as i care about influence thats because your control is very limited so much so that i can still mine in code ice belts i can successfully send a freighter through aufay and more you dont control  in highsec but only yield various degrees of influence
sir you are posting about oranges in a thread about apples please create your own thread if you would like to propose recognition of botaspirant activities you are detracting from the purpose of the csmfurthermore this is not the place for chestbeating about your opinion of code you could try cp for that and i look forward to seeing your freighter in aufay
i was using code as an example not attempting to chest beat about the organization i just used them because of their name in the thread immediately brought their examples to mind noncode example i know pilots that ran courier missions through jita all weekend during burn jita events my point is that control in highsec is a misnomer as the game mechanics provide lots of tools and workarounds to circumvent control this is especially true in highsec to quote you this is similar to rl where a particular hood might technically fall under a city municipality but local power is practically concentrated in a gang family club or social networkin civilized areas the local power wields control not by combat but by other means a politician might deny building permits the business monopoly might undermine other businesses attempting to form in eve the local industrial power might use all the mfg slots in the area another group may control towers on all the moons someone else may own all the pocos another group might mine all the roids every morning suicide ganking freighters and miners is simply one aspect of this to put it another way you might suicide gank 10 freighters a day in aufay but redfrog sends 500 more successfully through during that time frame against your desires who is winning the control race there if you only measure it by pvp your dominating redfrog but perhaps their business is successful enough that they can write off those freighters as a business expense and will continue to operate without difficulties or perhaps you dont successfully gank redfrog freights because they circumvent your ganks using webtowarp if all you want is a pvpactivity map thats fine but it is nothing like fw or nullsec sov influence
personally i side with the all activities count camp but overall no concord still holds control of hisec they would not advertise their ever more tenuous grasp of that control by recognizing their competition you want to mark your territory do what the gangs do tag the walls drop some cansnot to mention the fact that if i were a mining operation i would not want my name up in lights no more than   well this
sorry op but this man is winning the thread thats not even counting your blatant admission of self interest or the condescending fauxpolite rp nonsense youre using to deflect attempts at debate neither earn you points and both made me struggle to care despite the fact that your concept at least is somewhat interesting
damn  that is a fast pos rep too bad it is not available in hisec where a pos rep typically takes us all damn day with basilisks maybe that is why hisec is littered with the abandoned small and medium towers of the small 510 man corps ok  now i understand that big objection from nullsec  with a 10minute rep nobody would ever lose a pos this is definitely needed in hisec tho  the exit window approach would be better than nothing the hisec war dec pos bash for profit business is doing quite well and running out all the small corps with poses even with this approach i think we are going to need some kind of hisec pos shield repper that is a serious cut above the old basilisk  ill have to do the math as to how much pos you can rep in a 2 hour window using hisec equipment onlywould the exit window approach radically change nullsec  lowsec would the change be bad
yes towers would never die
i wouldnt say that if both the attacker and defender know when it comes out of reinforced it will make the battle harder as you are coming in on the defender with his guard up this time but arent we all interested in having those huge epic bigfleet battles i thought that was the reason you folks all spent all that time building capitals and supercapitals  so that you could use them to blow up the other guys capitals and supercapitals giving us an exit window for poses reinforced in hisec is the least they could do  if it is good enough for a stinking poco it is good enough for a 2b isk dread guristas pos
1seems like a fine idea to me

simple stuff
how would you expect them to enforce it short of not allowing more than one client to open from any given ip address at a time which is another nightmare due to shared ips how are expecting them to stop people from multiboxing remember isboxer was against the eula until some inventive chappie demonstrated a totally hardware way of doing the same thingisboxer became legal simply because theres no way for ccp to tell when people are using it versus when theyre notinh otherwords op please demonstrate how to tell when someone is using isboxer versus a couple of these
no
simple 1 client can check to see if the isboxer program is installed or running2 automatically flag ips that have 5 simultaneous accounts coming from them and ban them until they can prove that they are using hardware methods
for every complex problem there is a solution that is simple neat and wrong  h l mencken1 is troublesome  wows own warden anticheating program often gets false positives and frankly this is pretty easy to circumvent for anyone with half a second to do some googling edit circumventing this is as simple as wrapping the isboxer process with an innocuous or mandatory appearing process name  you just need one that a large majority of the player base are likely to have running chromeexe 32 or svchostexe for example2 is just ridiculous  youd essentially just ban every major university for example out there since they pretty much use proxies so it might look like a hundred or so accounts coming from one ip not to mention the de facto banning of your customers on a guilty until proven innocent basis is probably not a sound business strategyand the simple fact is  youre mad at the program not the results  your own response shows that how is using isboxer any different than using a hardware method of achieving the exact same result your suggestion treats the symptom not the supposed disease and so would in the long run be a waste of time and cost ccp customer loyalty and goodwill to boot
my question would be why for most activities in the game having 10 individuals controlling 10 characters is far more effective than having 10 one individual controlling 10 characters these are some exceptions these are the reasons i could think of 1 isboxers artificially bump the population engaging in an activity for something like mining which is a quasifinite resource this means more focused competition in the classic example of highsec ice belts gathering ice before someone else gathers it is basically a race and the bump in competing characters diminishes the gains of an individual player 2 isboxer allows several characters to coordinate some actions far more effectively than 10 nonisboxer players could achieve this has been utilized for mining ice bombing runs suicide ganking and even running incursions however this is also a major weakness of isboxer especially when they game mechanics encourage spreading targets out the benefits of isboxer are a more accounts which results in more money for ccp b emergent gameplay that keeps niche players playing the game i feel like im missing some pros and cons i honestly dont care all that much about isboxers mainly because the areas of game play they impact the most are the areas of game play that bother me the least that being said i do occasionally mine ore and ice but the local isboxer just doesnt bother me
why
q why ban multiboxing software a because as far as i am concerned it is violation of the eula which as players we are supposed to abide bya because however you see it it is having an effect on the in game economy which affects everyoneq why has ccp not banned ita because they are making money from it albeit indirectly
so you are going to ban tens of thousands of people because you want a lazy mans solution im sure ccps customer support would love the huge influx of support tickets im also sure that players will love waiting weeks for responses about any problem in gamealso my solution for your solution is to use a proxy for each machine a little added ms doesnt matter a lot in eveedit  universities is just the beginning of the problem apartment complexes condos isps with certain nas setups all kinds of areas have many people under one ip from the point of view of ccp
multiboxing works in all parts of the game i multibox myself but i refuse to use third party software to facilitate this as that is nothing more than bottingcontrolling one char and relying on third party software to control x amount of chars is basically against eula and has an effect on the in game economy which affects everyone in gamewill ccp ban multiboxing softwareno because they are making money from it
im not really concerned about winning forum threads ms mynnna in the end the real winners will hopefully be the citizens of highsec  i do appreciate the opportunity to participate in the political process though and was a little thrilled to receive replies from csms especially two for whom i voted its almost like shaking hands with obama please accept my apologies if you feel i have wasted your time i do know you are both very busy with csm matters as well as your own ingame responsibilities
you could also run with this and have civilized groups who have the power projectcontrol to put pressure on the hood or gang element to maybe have there docking rights removed in that system then follow it up with a sort of pub watch idea where if your naughty in one system fighting illegally the civilized people ban you from docking in all the systems they have control of
when winning the thread is shorthand for convincing anyone to champion your idea you should be concerned
luckily ccps interpretation of their eula which they wrote and police is the only interpretation that matters
noid rather ccp look at common uses for isboxer and come up with inventive ways to reward individual players or individual players working cooperatively
your concerns are irrelevant as far as ccp is concerned its not a violation of the eula and they have very clearly said so many many times furthermore there is nothing in the eula that even remotely suggests that it would be a violation to control multiple clients at once as for your second answer so what a single person doing a single thing with a single account affects the economy UFFFD should he be banned too because of it whats so bad about isboxers affecting the economy same as everyone else that makes it particularly heinousso again why why should they ban something that very clearly does not violate any of their rulesso laughably incorrect that it borders on the absurdthey havent banned it because it doesnt do anything that is banworthythe idea that they dont ban because the number of accounts a person has is instantly proven 100 idiotic by looking at how they treat botters
firstly i have no problem with multiboxers i am onewhat i have a problem with is someone using third party software to control ingame events which is tantamount to botting and btw if you are using multiboxing software you are not multiboxing because you are controlling one character and relying on the third party software to control the x amount of characterssecondly under the terms and conditions of the eula ccp state that you may not use third party software to change how the game is being played and also you may not use third party software to gain ingame currency or items at an accelerated rate whatever you think of multiboxing software it is in violation of both of these and if ccp doesnt think that then i think they have been taking too much of their own blue pill and crash simply put if ccp want people to take the eula seriously then they should rethink and rewrite large parts of it
unfortunately for you anyway ccp doesnt agree and frankly since their interpretation of the matter is the only one that actually has any impact on the situation id say youre probably soli will ask my question againhow is using is boxer any different than using a hardware solution that has the same resultsuntil you can come up with a legitamate answer to that question were pretty much done here
im just seeing but ccp says its legal over and over anyone mind trying to explain why its actually beneficial to the game op isnt doing a good job of justifying why it should be banned but its proponents arent defending it very well either
maybe because we dont feel the need to honestly im not for or against it  i could care less either way but as with suicide ganking and afk cloaking ccp has repeatedly constantly and directly said its not against the rules of the game and therefore is ok to doin the case of is boxer they even specifically made it legal  it used to be bannable offense how much more clear do they need to be
just because ccp says its legal doesnt make it the correct decision its a shame that so many people actually take the side of cheaters
does it mention anything about using hardware to gain any form of advantage in the eula because it does mention third party softwarethe big problem with this is that it is open to interpretation and if the eula is legal as ccp says then it should clearly state what is acceptable and what isntthat is why there are so many posts regarding this because the way it is worded is open to interpretationif you want to play the game with blinkers on and agree to something that we are told is legal without fully understanding it that my trusting friend is up to you
cheaters get banned it happens all the time so how is ccp taking their side exactlytake your time ill waitso the method matters more to you than the actual resultsand yes eulas are open to interpretation  they have to be or they would be so specific as to be unusable just like modern day legal codes eulas are as vague or as specific as they need to be to get the job done some things theyre very specific on though shalt not reverse engineer thy client others not so much asshattery shall be punished but who defines asshattery ccp does they serve as judge jury and appeals court in their own little legal enforcement zone otherwise known as the game environmentand let us not forget isboxer is ill say it again legal now because that process works someone appealed it being bannable and ccp agreed with that specifically allowing it be used because in their opinion it doesnt violate that clause of the eula you keep quotingediti realize that i am either preaching to the converted or i am spitting in the ocean depending on which side of this particular topic youre on i dont expect to change anyones mind but its important to me that we a have all the facts presented and b get people to realize this is not a new discussion  its been hashed over repeatedly and ruled on by ccp repeatedly at least i have company while im tilting at windmills
because isbox is cheating regardless of what ccp claims ccp might allow it because it makes them money but it is still cheating
yeah just like buying plex is cheating cause like it totally gives you an unfair advantage pay to win  at its most basicalso apparently owning more then one account is cheating having pi alts on one account is cheating reading about the game and using that knowledge to make more isk then the complainers in this thread is also cheating
really by that logic ccp would not be banning botters who i suspect run far far more accounts than isboxers which they clearly are
multiboxerrs are ebil thread  2907876802987421this must be the whine of the week  all i see are these threads
you are never completely safe anywhere in eve and will never be this would just create an easy dodge to war decs the whole corp would then just hide out for a week in 8 or higher system most corps i look at havent had a war in nearly a year it should be impossible to drop corp during a war dec dont want to deal with the unsafeness of eve stay docked up
this argument again im not even going to restate my opinion on this instead ill quote from ccps policy on client modification since no one ever bothers to quote or link to the appropriate policies and rulesafter quoting section 6a2 section 6a3 and section 9c of the eula the policy concludesthe sections ive highlighted i think are usable by both sides of the argument although im not hopeful the discussion will get any better
i dunno about banning multiboxing software especially without stats on how prevalent it isid rather that pressure be put on ccp to come up with fun gameplay that rewards playing with other humans rather than by yourself with multiple clientsthe loot scatter thing was one attempt that failed so they need to keep trying
not even pointing out the one glaring fault in his arguementit is literally ccps game they determine what is cheating its like your best friend bobby inviting you to play bobbyball if the goal fo the game is to hold the ball as long as possible but any redheads or girls who touch it are disqualified and hes the only notginger dude playing they are still his rules and you either have to follow them or not play hell its like going into a casino and saying the dealer is cheating because he isnt playing by the same rules as you well no crap he plays by the houses rules which are different from the betters rules because its their game
um no ccp decides what cheating is within the context of this game not you you may choose to accept their rulings appeal their rulings or stop giving them their money  but you dont get to define what constitutes cheating regardless of what ccp claimsif you want to make a rational argument of how is boxer actively harms the game environment and puts other people at a disadvantage in a way that is different from or worse than using any other method of acheiving the same results then by all means please do sountil then your argument is basically i dont like it and that makes it wrong this argument cannot get better because it is exactly that an argument theres no discussion theres no debate and the few people who try and point out reasonable points are lost in the frothing sea of whinging
its so blatantly obvious that i didnt feel the need to even try to argue that angle i just took their arguments to the logical conclusion figured that might have more of an effect then ccp says its legal deal with it
probably because wildstar basically banned isboxer just like guild wars 2 did then again wow allows isboxer
watchlisting is one of the most used and easy intel assets at the momentpeople just have to put you on watchlist and provide free and easy instant intelthere are alliances that have every single super and titanpilot watchlisted and it makes it almost impossible nowadays to log in a super or titan pilot without the enemy instantly knowing itthis makes boring gameplay and prevents covert capital operationsthis will also generate bigbloc power projection since nobody wants to fly his super or titan with smaller alliances because they know that big blocs like pandemic legion have them watchlisted and will hunt them down as soon as they log inso there is only one choice left and that is to join a big bloc or loose your super to them because they have you watchlistedi propose that people can only watchlist you if you accept it in other wordsif somebody wants to watchlist you you get a message wich asks you if you agree to have that person watchlist youthis way people will actually have to do more active scouting and less metagaming in stationand it will provide more capital action since people will be less scared to log in their capital ships without having the danger of being ganked by big alliances with lots of capital ships that are waiting for you to log in and see you on their watchlist
i may not agree with the reasoning but i dont see the harm in having watchlisting being an optin thing for that matter make it a general setting so i can just autoreject watchlist requests like i do dueling requests
i think thats an interesting argument that people may not log in supers because of a watchlist i think its preferable that someoned feel comfortable logging in without feeling that basic actd get them killed but i also wonder if itd be too difficult to catch a super without a watchlist its silly to expect someone to camp a logoff point for months big news stories in mainstream media come out of having supers be tracked for months and its a playstyle a notable number of people enjoyshould supers be caught with watchlist games or should they be dying in battle e a big fight would a restricted watchlist cause more people to log on their supers would it result in people having more fun in their supers more supers in fights is that a good thing or a bad thing whod it benefit and whod it restrict ive seen less supers in space than i have fingers havent been in a fight with more than two hundred people and barely log on so ive no bloody idea
supers should absolutely be dying in battle the real issue is theres no pressing reason to risk them and even if you do pl will hot drop on them like a fat kid dropping on a toffee eclair super carriers are seeing a limited resurgence thanks to the drone changes specifically drone upgrades affecting fightersbombers but titans are glorified mobile jump gates and they have been for a long time theres just no reason to put a a couple hundred billion isk in hull fittings and implants at risk and that actually sucks in terms of eves end game state for those players its one reason i refuse to tie myself to a super at this point  i have the skills for a nyx but once i strap into my metal coffin then what why would i fork over that kind of isk for a ship i will never or rarely ever use when i have a lot more fun in ishtars and bombers
the intention was to make farming plexes harder for people only interested in farming however ccp threw the baby out with the bath water and now plexing is so difficult and pays so little for the amount of time it takes that finding fights is harder than it used to beheres my suggestions make a plex rat spawn when a hostile ship warps in to a plex and there isnt already a plex rat there not every minute or so this way gunless farmers have no way to offensively plex but a 10 minute plex can actually be completed in 10 minutes if unopposed this also rewards people for staying on field when a pvper shows up to try and force them out if you regularly run from fights then you will have to kill more rats ease up on the dps check the rats have for the sake of condors and newbros everywhere double the amount of lp all forms of plexing yield this stops missions from being the obvious best choice for making isk
nopenopenoooooooooooooooo
why not im interested in changes that would increase the amount of content for everyone in faction war so im very curious about the perspective the opposing militia has on these changes so id really appreciate it if you went into detailalso i know that youve probably been running a lot of missions lately wouldnt you agree that theyre kind of boring and that plexing is more interesting
the mistake in your approach being of course the thought that the might respond to logic as epictetus said you cannot teach a man what he thinks he already knows theyre convinced is boxer is bad wrong and should be banned without really examining the logic of the situtation or being able to provide a logical reason why it should be banned other than the fact that they feel like it shouldnt be allowed
well as you already said it supers should die in a fight and not die because pl has every single supercap pilot watchlisted and as soon as they log in they run a locater on them and no it is indeed silly to have an alt logged of in the system like i said they use locaters after they noticed it log in this is way to easy intel1 for the idea
ok lets face it messing with sov or challenging it is a pain and for anyone small basicly undoable so here is my idea all the sov upgrade mods the entrapment arrays and so on are pulled from the ihub or tcu which ever its pluged into now what you do is take 1 mod say entrapment array that using ie doing sites and such upgrades lvl 2 3 4 and 5 are mods you plug into 1 now damaging it will be easy this say doing some dmg into armor disables it meaning its like its not even there now this forces people to undock and fight to defend italso they cant be out around pos has to be some random spot in system ill let them be probable not just automaticly show up like the tcu does the damaged unit keeps its lvl so if its 5 it stays 5 you just have to come repair it but and this is a big but if the fleet has the dps and time the entire thing is destroyable no reinforce basicly so you as a sov owner have to defend your space now some ideas on them they are not targetable by capitals or higher this stop people from just being dicks with capitals and isnt needed anyways if you go for the sov and claim the tcu the old system upgrades auto destruct so they dont need to be targetable by capitals anyways the idea for the changes comes from as it stands small groups cant do jack against sov nor can you expect to get fights a lot if you roam through renters and so on can and do just dock up since a small group cant threaten them
price of tags is dictated by players it is like moon goo why r64 are so expensive people should be selling it cheaper
read the thread properlyi said tag sources have been nerfed while lp store costs are too highthanks for playing
lets just remove the concord and allow players to sort their argues like in normal sandbox
i vote for option 2 it makes good sense to have that type of tutorial balance and the chance also once again to start improving standings in enemy faction territory in what seems a quicker route than what there is presently
ok so ill attack this from a pvp perspective how is one guy with 100 domis fair to the 1 guy with 1 domi ccp changed how drone assignment works for a reason isboxer is one way to circumvent that change
thats a ridiculous argument 1 domi against 100 of them is going to get fubard in short order regardless of how many people are controlling the 100 domis
outside of their main purpose in game  capital ship tackle  lets up the anty make it so a heavy dictor bubbles stop interdiction nullifiers and intys
you are rightand at the moment it gets even worsepeople are watching the forums to see who buys a super or titan and then puts them on watchlistas soon as the char logs in they will run a locater on them and send an alt there to wait until the supertitan is soldyou read it almost every week on evenews or tmc that a freshly bought titan got killed by this metagamingand losing ships in eve because you bought it on the forum and people can watchlist you is bad for this game1 for this idea
my question should supers die in watchlist games or in battle in my previous post is very poorly worded as it suggests that these two things dying in watchlist games and dying in battle are opposed to each other i see no reason to assume that reducing one would lead to an increase in the other i think its called a false dilemma im sorry for asking such a bad question id like to stress that these are actual questions and not questions designed to convey a message  i am almost completely ignorant regarding supercap meta and am not qualified to comment
its easy to mitigate that risk if you arent terrible at eve we have alts for reasons1 buy titan on alt through forums2 log alt in in jita for hours at a time3 have 3rd party transfer titan to actual pilot who does not post in that forum thread
zonaxioni agree and thanks for showing supportthe original albeit wrongly named tutorial agents were an integral part of the faction standing repair plan despite ccp removing those agents from the game the plan is still the fastest way to repair negative standingsthanks again for postingdmc
he posted it so he must have a valid argument to back it up or it could be a tarp destination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
still going since the only people who are going to read this are the couple of people posting forum mods and the csm ill drop in a proban argumentone argument for banning isboxer is that people in pvp dont like losing to software the number of accounts owned by unhappy people could start to outnumber the number of accounts running isboxer that could be a bad thing for ccps profits but can a person use isboxer in pvp and get better performance that then same amount of individual players in some cases yes on csm representative xander phoenas website crossing zebras pl member forlorn wongraven argued back in january that gangs of isboxing stealth bombers are bad for the gameone of the things that makes isboxer so effective in making bombing runs is the coordination between the bombers in an isboxer fleet compared to 6 individuals in forlorns example is the ability to broadcast the same command to 6 different ships simultaneously a human fleet no matter how good can obtain that level of performancejust as a side note i thought the rule was that one keystroke or mouse click could perform one action in one client it sounds like the people using isboxer arent following the eula some might even call that cheating but ccp currently allows that so i guess it isntone could argue the effectiveness of isboxer gangs of stealth bombers is due to poor mechanics stealth bombers used to decloak each other if they got too close to each other before crucible if ccp allows cloaked ships to decloak each other again that problem is solved no more oneman stealth bomber camps and all the isboxer users get to keep their softwarei guess i should add the thoughts of our csm representative xander expressed in the thread of the article i linked to on crossing zebras
had to kill two friendlies today and spent after that 30minutes explaining them how to fix the overview since the ccp given defaults are unusable its all unnecessary and not fun for anybody involved esp the noob
so we would use nontargeted interdiction to counter the counter to nontargeted interdiction
sounds like he has it all worked out develdrinif only ccp could makes those mods sort of changeable you know with a sort of script like those pesky sensor thingies we could then carry it and make it so it becomes a targeted interdiction destination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
and this is exactly why i like the ops proposal it will reduce metagaming that is ruining this gameyou shouldnt be able to get kills through easy metagamingas i recall ccp is removing apipulling for wormhole data for the exact same reasonpeople can see how many npcs are killed in each wormhole by an api pull they are removing this because it is too easy inteland in my opinion the watchlist is just as gamebreaking to supers and titans
have you ever actually tried to fly stealth bombers with isboxer its incredibly difficult and infuriating you need save spots and such to even get aligned properly and if the people youre bombing move at all youre screwed the issue is each client desynchs quickly so you cant just click in space to move to line up things god help you if they figure out the main character which can be easy if you know what to look for the problems with pvping with isboxer is so numerous i dont really feel like listing them all right now the biggest though is damage being switched and having your main character blown up once they blow up your main character generally youre screwedid much rather face an ixboxer fleet over a multiplayer fleet in pvp theres been isboxers in the alliance tourney and they get beat for a reason
ashley that was an interesting response lets see if i can address your points since i live in lowsec i dont have any experience with bombing runs so ill have to take your word on the difficulty of setting up a bombing run using isboxer so if i understand correctly your argument is that the difficulty of setting up a bombing run offsets or more than offsets the increased coordination between the bombers in an isboxer fleet when releasing the bombs compared to individual pilots conducting a bombing run thus the use of isboxer does not give the isboxer user an advantage that still doesnt address the point that isboxers ability to broadcast commands to multiple clients simultaneously seems to violate the one keystrokemouse click performs one action in one client rule thus violating the eula but if ccp doesnt care then mehfrom what i know about isboxer except in some specific circumstances the person running isboxer if not part of a larger fleet should get pwned thats why in an earlier post i wrote some cases since my last post i found another source that extolled the virtues of isboxer for another use case gankingsome may not consider ganking real pvp but that isnt going to stop the carebear who was ganked from complaining about someone cheating by using software to kill him as i posted before people dont like losing to software if that carebear and his 36 accounts then decides to not only quit but then go around and post on forums and the comments of articles about eve about how people use software cheats that could hurt potential sales especially when other mmo companies like arenanet and carbine ban the use of that type of software in a standup fight youre probably correct im pretty sure that you are referring to the isboxer team in the second new eden open and not the alliance tournament but your point is the same but does the alliance tournament really reflect the reality of pvp on tranquility im pretty sure that anyone using isboxer to pvp on tranquility will only engage a foe in favorable circumstances like in a gate camp with stealth bombers or tornadoes if thats still a thingbut your reference to the use of isboxer in a ccpsponsored tournament does highlight one thing ccp doesnt see anything wrong with isboxer including its ability to broadcast commands to multiple clients using one keystroke or mouse click so its not cheating because ccp makes the rules even if the written rules in the eula seem to indicate otherwise
i would use such a function
if the measure is to be player ships destroyed then wouldnt influence actually be concord as they destroy more player ships in a suicide ganking system
man that would be awesome mags we could put those scripts in there and use it like a warp scrambler but with a super long range
i think we may have stumbled upon an idea that ccp may implementso at least this thread wasnt a waste destination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
i love people who take thing too literally the point is that the program can be used to circumvent game mechanics that ccp has implemented the example was greatly exaggerated to demonstrate how it is an unfair advantage not just for miners but for the pvp community as well
to clarify the point what you are suggesting is that isboxer is a way to circumvent the game mechanics that only allows a player to control 50 drones at one time what an enterprising fleet commander can do is form up a fleet with 50 domis and then have 5 fastlocking ships controlled by someone running isboxer the fleet then lands on grid and drops sentries assigning its drones to each of the fastlocking ships according to a prearranged plan as a result 250 drones are under the control of one player who can then use one keystrokemouseclick to send the command to 5 clients to focus fire on a target that focused fire would be more coordinated than that done by 5 individual players or someone multiboxing 5 ships without the benefit of isboxeroriginally ccp was going to remove the drone assist mechanic totally csm 8 convinced ccp to instead reduce the number of drones that a single player could control down to 50 due to the effect that a total removal of the mechanic would have on incursion runners but if the meta turns to fcs or a member of a fleet having to run isboxer in order to act as a drone bunny i can see ccp going ahead and removing the drone assist mechanic after all does ccp effectively want players to feel they are forced to spend real world money an inner space subscription costs 15  3 months or 50  year in order to compete in pvpof course if ccp does remove the drone assist mechanic then there is no issue and one less objection to people running isboxer
youre making up rulesi could do the same thing as isboxer with some simple electrical work since i can do it purely with hardware youd have absolutely no way of detecting it hell i could make isboxer impossible to detect even just look at all the creative ways bottershackers got around wardeni can run 7 gank accounts fine without isboxer i mean come on its gankingfrankly someone that is going to be that big of a crybaby will complain the first time they get ganked by a blob anyway it wont matter to them if its one person or one person per account so it doesnt matter at allwell then that doesnt matter because isboxer or not only engaging in a favorable circumstance always gives you an advantage in real pvp an isboxer is at a disadvantage if the numbers and such are the samei dont remember which tourney it was but i used to chat with the blatant one at the time the drone assist comment is a good point though i dont see that happening at all so i hadnt thought about it do you know people who are actually doing that
and i love it when people miss the point  that whooshing sound as it zips past them makes me gigglewhen you exagerate an example too much it ceases to be an effective example and becomes ridiculous a 1 v 100 fight or even a 5 or 10 v 100 fight is so lopsided it wouldnt matter if one side was using isboxer or black magic to run their clients  numerical superiority at that level has one result assuming the numerically superior side arent complete and utter tools hell 100 noobships against a dominix is probably a pretty forgone conclusiona better example would be  for instanceside a has 100 domis all run by one pilot side b has 100 domis all run by individual pilots all ships have the same fitting since side a can acheive perfect fire control on their applied dps instead of the odd wandering target the is boxer fleet has an advantage in the application of dps in this situationof course in this caseif you headshot the fc of the isboxer fleet youve essentially killed all 100 ships instead of just one i argue that isboxer actually has some severe limitations in the fleet warfare department also because your ships all respond in the same way every time its hard to bring a flexible fleet and spread our things like points and ewar a la effyou fleet
its cheating plain and simple it copies commands to multiple clients if i do that with any other software its cheating but isboxers is ok they can detect it they decided not to ban people for it a mistake on their part since there are plenty of bots that run on isboxer only if its not giving u a huge advantage multiboxing why are you using it i tried it out with my 10 accounts for about 5 days and decided it was cheating and got rid of it cuz i expected it to be ban worthy by now if you cant multibox wo isboxer you got too many clients simple as that 1 command per client that is the way a game is ment to be played you take away all the disadvantages of multiboxing when you automate the most annoying part having to actually command individual windows if you dont see how perfectly coordinating 10 accounts is an advantage go fight a multi boxed bomber fleet or arty just let me know one way or another cuz if its not cheating its gonna be pretty much required software for multibox pvp thats the kind of advantage it gives drone assist lol you dont assist drones in isboxer you hit f and it has all your drone boats attack that target no matter if your flying 1 or 50totally no advantage there over someone not cheai mean using software to play for them
how long do you think it will be before we get accused of being each others alts
you may have a point there although its far from being an insult destination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
true truedo you think we have spun this thread far enough off topic that it can be ignored now
oh yes i believe we have pull victory from the jaws of defeat destination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
