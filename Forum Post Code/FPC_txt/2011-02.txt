supporting for awesome
im not certain if ccp should do this but they should definitely look at the idea and consider it1
i supportwe want to change our bloodline ancestry even school like we changed our portraitabout race changei think that if we can redo our origins and appareanceit is best to be able to change everything and not just a few minor details i liked caldari deteis when i created my account but now with the new charachter creator i prefer sebiestors or intakis i really would change

there is something strangely appealing about this
supported as well though personally i would also suggest increasing the redock timer from 1 minute to 2 in some casesbasically combat support actions such as rr remote sensor boosting etc will give you the standard 1 minute redock timershooting however saddles you with an increased one making deagressing quite a bit harder
too many unrelated ramifications to such a change and i say this having been on the receiving end of this tactic far more often than the giving sidenot supportedrepping is not an aggressive action which is why it doesnt force a session timer for dockingjumping and it shouldnt as far as neutral rr goes the only difference is when you can engage the rr hell its not like its even a big surprise if you see a bunch of logis sitting on undock you might as well just assume they are neutral rr and have them pretargeted for when they go flashy so you can drive them off neut or jam themin the end it doesnt matter if you can kill the logi just whether you drive them off the field or remove them from the fight so you can finish off your main target simple solutions usually arent if you think the solution to any problem is simple then the odds are you just havent considered it enough
i endorse this there are a lot of excellent ideas here hell ccp should open up the apis more in general as long as theyre working on them anywayedit posted on my blog and on twitter and encouraged others to support this
supportedthe proposal speaks for itself with better contracts will the eve community be able to do easier business

lets get this done
bumpi had originally wanted this thread to have a 100 support rate to illustrate the concrete need for the change i suppose i was being too proudduring initial testing ccp found they enjoyed using shield buffer tanks for their legions allowing them to fit excellent damage and speed with their high medium slot count however the lack of any shield bonuses makes this a bad idea that should have been dropped instead of clung to even then getting 5 medium slots isnt worth the terrible damage output of the drone and covert ops subsystems the curse enjoys the most medium slots of any amarr ship only because it has excellent ewar bonuses perhaps a tracking disruptor bonus was intended for the 5th legion subsystem but with the apparent cancellation of that project the 5th medium slot needs to goedithirana yoshida im suggesting the legion be balanced with other t3s not overpowered 8 slots would be clearly overpoweredas for 2 med slots the only case where that would happen is a commandrr defensive sub with a scanningneut electronics sub an incredibly rare combination
wow so baisically ccp is saying it can not do much against botsso everyone should get a bot or change the game mechanics in a way that eve is so easy that you dont need a bothow much time do they dedicate every day to find a solution dont they realize that this problem grows bigger and bigger and destroys the gamedoes anyone from ccp reacted to this thread other then telling us nothing can be done lol botters you do realize that you will play the game alone someday may the best bot win
cheating is bad cheaters will ruin this game if they can continue without any action from ccp supported
part of the problem with this is a lot of pilots block chat requests ignore them or can at times be completely present but alt tabbed i browse websites between asteroids or look to my other screen with my other client and yes i miss stuff on my other screen at times if someone yanks me into a chat if i am in combat or as i said doing something else it has been a good hour before i even look at my active chat tab while not everyone may be as space case as i am at times or im simply in a condition or altered state of mind it is highly probably that such a purge like system would result in numerous bans and warnings to people who are actively playing the game as per the eulai would still not hesitate to page on a guy that has 10 miners all the same damned name flying the same ship activating the same time and the name alone is something that is a sjdghuy3a232dfs as the guy has probably been banned numerous times and just keeps making new characters
ive seem and heard many stories bots and their exploits but id never personally had problems with one until today i bought some hardwirings and put them on the market only to promptly get run over by the 01 isk bots people in this thread are saying the ccp might be looking the other way on these bots because they dont want to lose the accounts but what about the accounts they are losing because people join the game to do this that or the other and get run over by these botters my one experience with the bots today made me not play and go do something else with my day if these market bots are the rule and not the exception i wont be around to see whatever incarna looks like i also wonder how many people who are fed up with the bots tell people not to bother with this gameblizzard did a pretty good job of squashing bots as have other companies it can be done if ccp cant or wont than it does not bode well for eve or their future projects no matter how imaginative they are no one will want to play dust or wod if it is filled with botters and hackers
you cant really ignore a gm when hes trying to contact you plus its oxymoron to argue about the guys reality when hes been playing for 20 hours straight every day for the last 3 monthsanyways a little more effort than the unholy rage when planets are aligned would be great
they need to find ideas to solve this problemwhy not randomize some dropdown menus for exampleif they dont sovle this problem it will spread more and more and people in mmo land will realize that eve is a bot and macro game then ccp can make it a bot championship cause no casual player will subscribei love eve but the botting problem lowers my motivation ccp you will looose more subs cause of this then you win cause of botsubsanyway the bot subs pay with plexwake up ccp now or you will have a big marketing problem in future
they do change the drop downs from time to time then again the latest bots dont even use the client anymore so im not sure how much good that does nowadays start doing something like gm chat checks and see how fast the botters have their bots relaying chats to their iphones hell as i understand it they already have the ability to send text notifications to the user so its not like thats a stretchhell a month after implementation youd be more likely to ban a legitimate player by mistake than to get a boti often miss chat requests even while actively playing because the pop up window ends up buried behind some other window in that screwy uihonestly i wish all you idiots would stop with these posts all they do is raise the visibility of just how easy botting is in this game and more likely encourages more people to bot whod never have considered it otherwise
while botting currently impacts my gameplay in no way i have concerns about how much of an impact this could have on various eve mechanics in the future its been a growing problem since i joined the game and while it is yet to affect me the frequency of complaints has increased im ported in motsu  a system with no belts yet i see no fewer than two deliberatelynamed bots a day whether theyre a mockery on alreadyexisting dirtbags or legitimate botters is irrelevant perception is everything and i perceive that ccp turns a blind eye to botting the way border patrol turns a blind eye to drug smugglingfood for thought from someone on the fence about the matter it is a matter of principle not whether or not you agree with it
the idiot is youcause you dont use a macrobot eve players arent dumb bots in the markets bots in roids fields makes no sense to play these parts of eve even when you like it cause reward is to lowi hate it cause eve is the best mmo out there but it will get destroyed by bots makes no sense to not talk about it yeah dont talk about crime dont arrest the murder cause we may get more murders lol doesnt make any sense at all we need to adress it solve it make it no1 priority to fight against bots sure they will fight back but make it as hard as you can for themim no software producer but there are already enough ideas out there which can give relief to the probleminappropriate link removed spitfiresoftware developers what can you do against bots please share ideas and provide them to ccp as they are not able to solve this problem it seems
naturally
all work the lag just right stuff in eve such as timing the overload of that first mwd boost is not goodwhy
signed
why has this not been done yet tsk tsk ccp
you are not activating the module just toggling overload there is no heat produced from an inactive modulewhynormal cloaks have very long locking recalibrations plenty of time to toggle overheat on an offensive module only thing you will be harming with your proposed change is black ops ships being able to decloak and instantly fire overheated weapons
obvious support
not that it is really hard to slip in the overheat hotkey after decloaking and before activating the mod but still it definitely annoyed me a lot of times you couldnt toggle heat before decloaking
if you actually read any of the ccp correspondence regarding the bots they spend copious amounts of time dealing with bots they spend enough time dealing with it and listening to complaints of players i am sure they are having nightmares about bots in their sleepif you use the search tool you should be able to find a particular topic in by a dev explaining just why bots are so difficult to spot i can name a few because for the past 2 years i have had these damned emails trying to sell bots because a forum i signed up on had a security leak and a cn originating user began spamming all userswhen you actually look at what ccp is trying to fight these things are ridiculous you would think rails that run you through diablo were hightech these things make those older bots look like a tandy next to a 8500 gaming righowever i know since the first mmo i played in 97 bots have existed do you think out of no where ccp is going to develop a antibotting system that hasnt existed in the 14 years its been a prevalent trade do you think you pay enough for them to try and develop that considering just how much program developers make in a paycheck i can sum it up pretty simply ccp has spent more money in antibot development than i have made during my highest year of incomebut please dont tell me because you pay a subscription ccp is required to make you happy they dont force you to subscribe neither do they do nothing to try and make you happy they do what they can with the money that is there they have jobs they are not subjects of the amarr empire treating them as such shows no respect for a group trying to make an earnest attempt at correcting the issue
bump supported
ccan you please tell me what did they done against botsonly thing that is done and not only on paper is unholy rage and it was not against bots it was only against rmtthey can spend trillion dolars on taking care of the problem like thismany other mmos are doing things against bots things that work more or less bots are adapted and now are much more  than before and in a circle but they are workingand ccp cant say that we dont see anything they are doing against bottingi can wrote that i am constructing nuclear power plant and only thing that i did i wrote that and ppl will be deceived untill they see that there is no new more powerthat like we all feel deceived becouse there is no result only wordsand if ccp cant or wont becouse its too much dolars at stake anything against bots well ok just say so then remove that part from eula and we will all use bots and no more threads about thisand that will happen sooner or later 90 of players will be using bots if ccp dont do anythingwe are building nuclear power plant but we cant give you new power just pay for that in contract but new power you cant get you know we are working on that we are working but untill then lets make one new factory and sell it to you and new ppl but we are workingpsthis is harsh version and sorry if i am too harsh but when you tell harsh version then all ppl will see what you are talking aboutand sorry for bad english didnt have time to check the text at all
supportedan antibot program should be multilayered like ccps antiphishing program1 modify the client so its harder to bot stop code injection2 modify the content so its harder to bot interfere with simple timer macros3 add methods to flag botlike play both coded methods and easier player reporting4 gm challenges to flagged accounts modify the eula to make it a violation to not replay in an understandable way to a gm challenge worried about being afk give the gms tools so they can tell if the client is being operated while ignoring them5 ban name and shame name the actual player not just the pilot the corp and alliance
1only one more thing put on the list6 modify the server and client so that server can know what is original eve client and what is not so that server accepts only original eve client connectionsbecause some bots emulate client
bumping for more support
1right so we can do our part to solve this problem this problem needs to be attacked from every angle its destroying the game
oh look the clueless are out in force againim getting so sick of these antibotting threads im half tempted to start botting just for the tearsonto your idiocy though if ccp actually had some sort of system for identifying bots they would be stupid to tell the whole fracking universe cause then the programmers who make the bots would just tweak their code to counter it what you think botters dont read these boards too
not a bad idea keeps players aware and reassures confidence in that something is being done also reports can help on the fight on rmt rmt players themselves will think twice if they see ccp playing an active role in the fight against rmt and how much ccp cares for us nonbotters maybe like a semiannually report that describes security measures new  old scams up to date information on account protection numbers bots banned how much isk was removed from the game via banning rmtbots players types of botsccp you are doing something about them right
how about ccp also release their credit details real world addresses and home phone numbersthe stupidest idea yet even the worst of real world 3rd world dictatorships dont publicize identity information without severe backlash from all over the placea blog detailing numbers involved as was done with the rage thing is more than sufficientas for alliances policing themselves make them at least partially culpable when a botting ring note not an individual bot is found operating under their bannerhave gms talk to leadership to find a solution if none can be reached or leadership takes the fifth  ban the ing lot of them
means stop fighting bottersyou a botta
i mean you arent accomplishing  by filling up the forum with 15 million posts about how prevalent botting is all you are doing is advertising how easy it is to do and get away with which only encourages people who might not have thought about it to give it a tryand no im not a botter i value my accounts and fun too much to risk them just for some easy isk even if the chance of being caught is remotethe fact is that ccp does catch the occasional botter typically because the botter screwed up in some way or got greedy and over confidentraising visibility of the issue actually harms any efforts ccp might be making towards combating botting because it raises the paranoia levels of the botters so that they are more cautious and become even harder to catch telling how to identify a botter simply gives the bot writers the opportunity to adjust the behavior of their programs to avoid what ever triggers are used theyre already sophisticated enough that a stop watch isnt an automatic way to spot any but the stupidestin my opinion the solution to botting is to address the problem in a more holistic manner avoid gameplay options that tedious and repetitive these are tasks at which bots excel why are so many bots mining bots because you practically have to be a fekking robot to stomach the activity think about it mining in a hulk you warp to a fixed belt target a few roids turn on your strip miners and then wait 3 minutes for them to cycle at which point you either move your ore to a can for pick up by a hauler or dump it in the corp hanger of your orca ratting is not much more complex warp to belt if rat target orbit rat optimal shoot rep if shieldarmor under x cycle repbooster rat dead cycle tractor wreck 2400km loot cycle salvager  all rats dead yes warp to next belt and repeat else repeatstatic content  boring gameplay  incentive to botso the solution is to eliminate static content and boring gameplaywhich is a winwin as it rewards active players and discourages botting at the same time
a report botter function would work just fine people seem to assume that it would behave much like the isk seller in all actuality it would likely behave as it has in other gamesstep 1 you think you see a botter named bob mining missions whateverstep 2 you report bot on bob much like isk seller through the rightclick menustep 3 gm staff that watches for bot reports sees that bob has been reported possibly multiple timesstep 4 for added effectiveness you ask folks in local to report bob toostep 5a based on traffic on the bot list the gm staff directly contacts reported bots using a simple set of questions that could be based on visuals for example is my ship closer to the sun than yours or be too difficult for a bot to respond to automatically what is 2  3  6 equal which requires the bot to recognize and calculate commands from the chat window generated by a gmstep 5b in the event bob does not respond at all within 30 seconds gm deactivates bobs ship modules if the ship resumes its activities without responding either bob is being a prick or the bot is resuming its activities this prevents the potential i was afk argument as an afk player wont resume activity there is still a loophole in which a bot could be programmed to simply wait 5 minutes or longer if a forced deactivation occurs before resumingthus fooling the gm a possible workaround could be a time out function in which the gm forces a logout of the character if they are afk and fail to respond this could actually hurt afk people though though i loathe afk miners they are legal thus this excuse remains troublesome as always the time for miners given the simplicity of how they work could be extended to several minutes to account for a typical afk break unless an indy another telling sign is if the miner switches roids without responding only industrials mine slow enough to stay on one roid mission running bots would be much easier to detect as they wont just sit there suddenly afk when approached by a gm and have their modules forced offtheyll still be under attack to do this would be suicide and thus not profitablestep 6 gm can determine within a minute or less if the person is in fact a bot if a bot then eula takes its course if not a bot the character not account is cited as being a player and could potentially have temporary immunity from the report system until dt or longerin all reality only a single gm would really be necessary though the work would be more boring than playing pingpong with two titans and a pod the point of this simplistic system of direct intervention isa players cant abuse it as only the gm can negatively affect the player in questionunlike the isk seller which mutes the player some bots are players some players are bots they are difficult to separate sometimes jfggaeth as a name is a good hint but not all bots are so foolishly named as stated many times before some of eves bots have incredibly advanced tech behind themb players can help gms potentially locate and identify bot behaviorc low cost doesnt require lots of development botters cant create an effective program to answer the questions as if implemented correctly the questions simply change monthly if not weekly based either on ccps or the gms discretionthe biggest benefit is that while this system is progressive and thus there wont be mass bannings it does put the hurt on botters rmt or not and will deter it over time as it becomes to annoying andor not profitable
another step that could help to minimize the problemi think there is not one solution the problem has to be attacked from all angleswhat about randomizing some dropdown menus
it is the only realistic option there is what comes after a report is up to the powers that bewell duh under threat of immediate permaban is it any wonder that it actually worked as intendednow local in the hubs is filled with honest scams and noobishness just what goddess intended wrong it is the only step that has any chance of alleviating the situationall the ideas of captchka menus and other random crap will end up being a pain in the arse of everyone whether they are a bot or not  difference being the bot doesnt give a crap and wont drop subscription due to game being unplayableno fun
i agree ccp is going to have to assign more people to the problem1 gm is more people than they have now  but when they do so they should make it easy for players to help find bots
this would never work this would be abused endlessly frankly there is no need for this ccp knows who the botters are already
im gonna try my best to keep this briefin regards to the impending threat of the macro bots many of us capsuleers have grown tired that very little has been achieved or done in the ongoing war against bots we vent our anger over this on the assembly hall to ensure that you the csm go tell ccp that its time to put on the elbow grease and start swinging that ban hammer many of us have already posted multiple ideas on how to deal with the threat so please make sure you read each and every one of them to see which idea is best for tackling the botsplease dont let eve get taken over by bots dont let the economy fall into the hands of bots we dont want the suffer the same fate as other mmos did i love eve online too much to let that happeni dont want any long replies to this thread with the exception of a bump and support to ensure that the counsel sends the message and its made loud and clear
ive said it before and ill say it again i can deal with pirates gankers scammers can flippers and the likebut i can not stand getting worked over in the wallet by bots i got worked by the bots earlier and now i dont even want to log in and do anything odds are mine are 4 accounts lost over bots when it comes time for me to renew my subs in 20 daysalso in case someone asks you cant have my stuff
because we dont already have enough threads about this
problem is you dont hear anything about this from ccp nor the csmprobably cause some csms are in alliances who use bots themselveme to have 3 subs and will cut this down if i dont see that soemthing is happeningcant be enough threads of this sort to find a solution this needs to be no1 topic cause if they dont stop it will destroy eve
have you read the minutes of the last csm summitthey raised this subject with ccp then they have already done what you have asked
counting this one i count seven threads on the first page of ah about botting one would think this was important enough to mention in the sticky thread hot topics of the assembly hall updated jan 24i guess not
you guess correctly believe it or not spamming threads on any topic does not raise its relevance all it does is point out the fact that people are incapable of understanding the very simple rules for the halldecisions are not and should not be based on whomever can scream the loudest people are sheep and indignation is infectious  that is primarily what we are seeing
well arent you just little miss opinionated i bet youre the sort whos got so many opinions nobody wants to hear that you resort to expressing them though dozens of bumper stickers
let me assure you that ccp is very much awara of this and has several people working on it fulltime i agree however that more information about numbers caught and banned towards the playerbase would be a nice extra
that would be wonderful feedback is always a good thing always better than nothingedit oops check
vote support if you want ccp to give caldari ships a long overdue skinjob overhaul especially the tengu looks fugly with that unfinished aluminium lookweve seen the noctis ccp we know you can do it make it look like someone was actually willing to spring for the paint on a t3 ship  doesnt have to be all colorful  a touch of style however would not be amiss nighthawk pianoblack and red leaps to mind or something else distinguished
agreedeve is a sandbox you make your own future except you have to wear a shirt  eves new ad campaign
supportedthere is a blog called eve travel that actually shows just how many tourist attraction there are its pretty cool but more would be great
supporting more cool lore stuff in space and general improvement of exploring
the evolving battlefield fleetsccp has expressed their concern that fleet fights in eve were getting too blobby while i love the fact that fights in eve get more players involved than any other mmo i agree that the blob is too powerful as isunlike other games blobs in eve suffer very little inefficiency as they grow 1000 people can all receive instructions on teamspeak warp around to exactly where they need to be and focus their firereps on a single ship and with the removal of aoe doomsday devices and the recent war on lag there are almost no disadvantages of having a massive fleet assembledso what makes this overpowered in ways that blobs in other mmos are not first and foremost its a lack of aoe weaponrysince ye olde days of starcraft and total annihilation aoe weapons in games have been rare expensive and incredibly useful they are a tool used by game developers to weaken spam or cheese strategies most importantly aoe prevents a large army from steamrolling a smarter smaller army without taking any casualtieswhat does this mean for evehaving more smaller alliances taking advantage of nullsec is ccps dream but its happening much slower than they expected after the dominion sov changes this is because while a small alliance can now negotiate a tract of space from a bigger alliance they still cant defend their space with any realistic hope of success there is simply nothing they can do against a larger enemyone option thats been investigated is the removal of jump bridges to make nullsec fleets harder to move and ruin the fun of several thousand players i believe that fleet mobility should be reduced but not starting with conventional fleets they should begin their study of mobility with supercapitals and work their way downso what changes am i actually suggestingmake bomb launchers available to t2 battleships black ops and marauders with area bonuses this will give these ships an actual role in fleets while preventing aoe spam from getting out of handalong that line give us a t2 bomb launcher and t2 bombs perhaps make it impossible to fit on a stealth bomber if it can be fit make it so the sb can barely fit anything else t2 bombs can be made to track a target like missiles as weve seen recently with the siege of 6vdt a gang of 30some bombers can be used by a small alliance to harass its invaders despite being overwhelmingly outnumbered just like ccp wanted who would have thought the small alliance would be itas ive explained or will explain in other episodes grant black ops access to aoe electronic warfare marauders should receive bonuses to smartbombs by limiting aoe effects to t2 battleships they receive a new purpose and provide alternatives to capital spam however this in turn gives dreads and capitals a better position as aoe effects will do very little to thembring back the area dd although perhaps with lower damage and higher fitting costs dont replace the existing dds just add aoe alongside them it should take at least 2 or 3 dds to take out a fleet the way an old dd couldreduce the mobility of supercarriers this will also get its own thread so i wont go into detail here but since they became more difficult to kill they need to be more difficult to retreat or ccp will continue to see supercapitals not dyingthis post is part of the giving eve a tuneup project if you are interested in reading more go heregiving eve a tuneup introduction and links
as stated give us a skill to remotely accept missions radius should be equal to the equivalent trade skill per level also with the same training multiplier
not supportedpeople will start asking every agent within the radius for a mission and pick only those missions they likethis leads to more mission farming as it is some players already use shuttles to fly from agent to agent and to get offers this skill would make it worsemission running pays quite well it has got skills to increase the income further and it gets supported by the map with a filter for available agents mission running is probably the most lucrative profession already another skill to make it even easier to find the best missions will only bring further imbalance to the professions in eve
isnt that exactly how it happens nowbut they cant very well mission in said shuttle they have to slow boat their mission ship to wherever the agent sends them usually near the agent so one would have to think about going 20 jumps in their marauderive always cherry picked agents one would be dumb not to and with mission distribution and the 4 hour window i do not believe that this will be as much of a game breaker as you think o by the way trade is the most lucrative profession in eve and it way out balances any profession by far
i have to agree with whitehound on it making missionwhoring way too easyyes people currently cherry pick missions from multiple agents but at least they have to actually move their lazy arses around to do itback before invention when i ran missions for dollardollar i had multiple mission ships stationed in a target area so no matter where i was sent the maximum travel time was negligible ps missions are subpar in overall earnings the reason they are good is that the relative safety per isk earned is higher than most other occupationsmarketeering is by far the safest easiest and most lucrative thing there is only negative is that it takes an already healthy wallet to do properly
will just cause people to sit in target systems 247 and maybe even promote botting
would fly brutix then
it sounds like people just want better ships with less skill required to be trained while i can understand what everyone wants when they play a game it just comes down to someone wanting diamonds when they dig a 2 hole in the ground and expect it to made easierto begin with any command ship can be fit with an insane tank why would we improve it it took 35 people to down my damnation a while back do we need to make it 4045 as it stands the ships that typically have a bonus to active repairs are not primarily meant for prolonged tanking instead their bonuses give them such nice damage andor speed etc that their goal is a massive dps strike and to repair as needed improving an astarte to the point it can now active tank as well as dish out some of the highest dps when in close range is such an imbalance its not even funnysomeone mentioned above the logistics reps are more then enough i did as well adding even more logistics rep hp just makes something that has the advantage just become overpowered hacs would be useless against a remoterepaired astarte fleet who could come in out dps and out repairyou cant have the best of both damage and tank without giving something up this would remove the thought process that is put into fits the smart ones anyway
a resist bonus provides 175  13rd better local repping 175  13rd better received remote repping 175  13rd better ehp it is totally capless it is not stacking nerfedcurrently an active tank bonus provides 1  375  375 better local reppingunder the proposed boost 1  375  375 better local repping 1  375  375 better received remote reppingas you can plainly see resistance bonuses would still be much more powerful than an active tank bonusim sorry youre completely delusional and didnt even bother to read the thread your damnation doesnt have the appropriate bonus and thus would not be improved and frankly none of the situations you even mentioned were of any relevance to the proposed boostin the end i think this was a good lineindeed  and you will note the rather large set of bonuses that resistance would still provide over an active tank bonusliang
snip
a whipcrack went her whippy tail and the newb was done
command ships with resist bonus are at least as tough to kill as one with only an active repair bonus when solo and in a gang massively outshine them so saying dont change astarte cause damnation is hard to kill already or is irrelevant this change would simply put the gang tanking ability of the gallente and minmatar command ships closer to the level of the caldari and amarr ones  though with their tank still being less powerfulthe only people just want better ships with less skill required to be trained is in terms of racial cruisers and leadership skills its about bringing ships across a class more into linebut this isnt solely about command ships the change is proposed for all ships having an active tank bonus so including maelstrom claymore sleipnir brutix cyclone and so on currently their active rep bonus is very underpowered compared to a resist bonus when operating with logistics support
actually this change is for any ship with an active tank bonus like the hyperion for example
this would indeed be pretty nice change and make more ships usable in current metagame envinroment cyclone for example would be reasonable alternative to shield hurricane more tank less gank
that oughtta do it thanks very much ray
i dont think this is the solution to active armor tankings woes since my problems with armor repair seem to go away when i am specifically receiving remote armor repairi dont know what the problem is with it maybe its the backloaded repair effect shielders can just hit it when they need it armourers have to think ahead is that the issueis it just too hard on the cap because armor tankers tend to be out of cap just by firing their hungry weaponsis it therefore because they nerfed nosferatu to the point of ridiculeid normally support active armor proposals but i think spider tanking is already far too meta to get any support from ccp spider tanking would need pre nerfing before this measure be introduced
although i love the idea and it is an idea i have tried to push myself in other threads im a little worried about the balancing issuesi was just looking at ways in which you could fit t1 1st teir bcs for rr fleet work i set myself some rules for the fittings these were simplei must be able to fit an mwd i figured you would want to be mobile when in a bc gangi must have sufficient buffer as close to the minimum of 60k ehp as possible was the figure i thought was appropriatei must have some form of eccmi must have a pointi plugged the fits into eft to see what they could achieve and i decided to compare them i was able to achieve roughly similar buffer tanks across the range of ships ferox vs cyclonesimilar ehpsferox has better resists ferox defence is greater unless 375 rr received bonus is applied to the cyclone in which case the cyclone tends to be 10 betterferox has better sensor strengthcyclone dependent on cap transfer chaining so very vulnerable to ecmdps appears balanced as the ferox has roughly 25 more but is heavily restricted by range and the cyclone has selectable damage type and is faster so it can kitethe cyclone requires fitting modulesbrutix vs prophecyboth of these ships compared tanking wise in a similar fashion to the ferox and cyclone and the 375 bonus also applied with similar resultsthe prophecy is faster and has far better range but the brutix has better dps brutix could do with being fasterboth ships have fitting issues and require fitting modules and or rigs to fitshield vs armoursimilar ehpssimilar capacitor endurancesimilar sensor strengthsarmour has slightly lower tanking abilities than shieldbalance issuesferox is the only ship which does not require fitting modulescyclone could use a little more pg 5 maybeprophecy could use a little more pg ferox and prophecy would require a little more base shieldarmour to balance out brutix is too slow and lacks sufficient pg and a utility high slot putting it at the bottom of the pilei think it would work out but there would need to be a fair bit of rebalancing going on to make it workthe biggest problem with the active tanking bonus is the fact that you only get that bonus when you have an armour repairshield booster fitted and it is active the resist bonus is applied always and carries over to active tanking as well as buffer tanking
bow before your new sleipnirscimitar overlords mortalsgood idea although i am not sure repair amount can be calculated on the receiving end without some extra calculationdata going back and forthwould necessitate a revision of slotsfittings of affected ships as well they are all geared towards local tank and straight switch to buffering you know that will happen will probably break some of themno accusations needed when nothing to accuse of  see how it works
eve does not need more rreve doe not need to encourage blobbing over small gang even morenerf passivebuffer tank until active tanking starts looking good
a few comments theres nothing about rr itself that encourages blobs any more than all mechanics encourage blobs in fact rr stops scaling before other mechanics do rr can be used in small gangs quite reasonably without being overpowered there is and should be more to the game than simple tanknspank you must have missed the huge discrepancy in benefits given by resists vs active tanking bonuses nerfing buffer tanking doesnt address many of those overall ship balance is pretty reasonable yes there are some adjustments that need made supercaps for sure drakeshurricanes and other bcs are a bit too powerful next to bss capital projection the tier system should be removed etc but those are on the whole fairly small youre talking about nerfing pretty much every ship in eveif you want to more small gangs and less blobs id say we should encourage ccp to create mechanics that encourage small gang warfare there are lots of ways to break up larger gangs  from the mechanics of getting a blob into a wormhole to making targets need to be attacked in multiple systems simultaneously pretty much anything that makes for strategy instead of bring moar pplliang
how about this since gallente have trouble fitting good guns alongside their other stuff what if the bonus read75 bonus to armor repairer effectiveness and 10 reduction in armor repairer and remote armor repairer powergrid needs per levelthe current bonus may be too specific but ccp is very concerned about it becoming overpowered
give players a drop down menu option to report macro users similar to the one used to report isk spammers get players involved in helping ccp police this problem give them a way to quickly and conveniently report macroers not really my idea borrowed it from hirana yoshida but it seems like a good oneregardswindjammer
support
and then ccp hires all of china to investigate those claims
note that chinese players from china cant play in our gobal server coz of the country firewall and their government policy thats why they have their own eve server last i was told
or maybe admits they cant or wont allocate resources to investigate the reportspetitionsdespite your exaggeration it wouldnt take much in the way of resources but it may still be more than ccp wants to spendwindjammer
in regards to the recent csm summit in iceland the issue of 00 sovereignty logistics and pvp were raised as a future problem for ccp to deal with there was a response from some who opposed one particular change that the agreement between ccp and csm for a possible removal of jump bridges circumvented their opinions not everyone is opposed to the discussed changes to 00 mechanics and the general consensus is that things need to change however the pilots of new eden need to be consulted and feedback given to ccp before any hard code changes take placein my real life line of work campaigns we often propose citizens conventions a citizens convention is a deliberative assembly of ordinary people who are given information on a particular subject or issue and come up with what they think is the best possible solutioni think that the csm could chair a similar convention of capsuleers they would however need to select a more balanced group of players from several 00 alliances and a number of play styles which could then take all the evidence and proposals from this forum and elsewhere and present a report to ccp via the csm the csm could make the report themselves however i would suggest that they include a more diverse group of players from 00 backgrounds discussions could take place on eve voice eve mailing lists email and here in the forums for us all to see this process will provide ccp with an idea of player opinion on changes they want to see which could guide them in improving 00 mechanics rather than disappointing or inflammatory changes being shown to the csm or player base without much warning i humbly submit this proposal
sansha should siege poses too
an incursion in venal would virtually eliminate the tech supply that would be horrifying imagine all t2 manufacturing in eve comes to a crashing halt oliang
good more interesting market trends it would also eventually force ccp to even out resource distribution in all honesty that wont happen though the goo farmers would beat back the incursion fast
as sanshas want this systems there should be an impact to the owneras sanshas are able to manipulate hole systems there is absolut no reason they shouldnt be able to manipulate pos modulslowered resitences and regenertation of pos forcefieldslowered quality of production moduls longer build times lower refine quality lower moon goohigher energy need more fuel need for pos modulssame effects for player stations as for npc stations
i like this idea after all if they nerf highsec isk income during incursions they may as well do it during null ones as well
if as you say there are some null entities who can flat out ignore an incursion then that means that effects are not enoughread up on the wordconcept of an incursion it is not something youd want anywhere near youlets look at what penalties are applied bounties cut in half pfft move to neighbouring constellationcyno jammed pfft offline own jammer to save a few isk and add a temporary redirect bridgemission rewards cut lol as if there are agents in the first placeresists compromised who cares if you ratting elsewhere and just avoiding area in generalall but the cynojam effect have huge impact everywhere but null so people are encouraged to clear the damn things same should be true for null if current penalties are not enough to do so then we increase them until they are  hitting the single biggest isk faucet in eve is the obvious solution
cyno jam is a benefit not a penalty
sanshas jam affect jumpbridges as well i think so yea for the bridge addicts read all of null it is a penalty  just easily mitigated
good idea id go further still and support the ability to split out any tab from any window for example id like to be able to keep open dscan and the exploration scanner at the same time when i am exploring in lowsec i am sure that traders would appreciate the ability to seperate marketwallet tabs to seperate windows as well
i would love to see this implemented
alright a while back i saw a post that lead to a link that mentioned that the greater part of the csmccp council is for removal of jump bridges while i dont understand why if the whole gang agrees chances are its going to happen that said this idea is for if it does happen a new capital ability known as parade formation any sub capital ship can right click on a capital ship and  assuming its in fleet click on parade formation with this done the ship takes up a position to the right or left of the capital ship and maintains it as if under autopilot heres the kicker any ship that is in parade formation jumps with the ship its parading with ships that are not fleet supportive such as dreadnoughts can take a max of 5 ships skill dependant with them ships like carriers and sc can take a lot more starting at 10 for both and going up to 25 and 35 respectivly the transport of the sub capitals does not increase the total io needed as its simply pulling them along  not opening new portals for each ship
alternatively just give everyone the abilities of instant teleportation
somebody played the original homeworld
so your response to limiting the ability to project force using bridges is to add a jumpportal to all ships with a jump drive  and at no additional cost on topand this is a good idea why exactlyor put more simply you madthe formation thing is one of the things ccp have already voiced interest in but that is for warping and generally flying around on grid
i didnt think that the obvious needed pointing out but i will anyway moons orbit planets ya digthen we will have to put on our thinking caps and rework the idea until we come up with something that is fun challenging solves all the problems and is a viable alternative to ice miningregardless of the particulars of the solution a revamp of the ice mining  pos fuel mechanic is a wonderful opportunity to add a new dimension to the game personally i still think that is still a great opportunity to add depth to pi and another way to disrupt a corporations activities imagine how much attention players will give to dust when they realise that it threatens their continued space presence
to be honest the idea of making it passive removes the required dedication of operating a pos otherwise everyone including suzzieqs grandmother grandfather dead dog horse doll and step brother will have a pos that is passively fueled yeah ice mining could be a little more interesting maybe we can find frozen junk in it like iceman but leave the requirements alone its a slap in the face for people who actually manage to run a pos let alone several of them by either buying minerals or mining in fleets like i do
i was not suggesting that we make it passive though i would argue that the current system is passive and macrofriendly the point is to recognize the opportunity that reevaluating pos fueling presents having to protect your installations on the ground whilst adjusting reaction rates and alignment whilst ensuring that enemy fleets dont jam the transition of power to your pos would hardly be a passive experience my suggestion was intended to prompt discussion rather than be the perfect solutionim going to go ahead and assume that your suggestion for random drops of iceman sic was not sarcastic but surely you have your own suggestions based on your own experience on how this situation could be improvedthankyou for raising the point that a lot of people do benefit from the current state whilst i dont think that this is an argument for leaving the system unchanged i do think its important that any suggestions put forward do consider the skill time and isk invested in their pursuit
if youre looking for an improvement to ice mining ive written a great deal about it in my depots documenti do like the concept of finding stuff frozen in the ice like a faction item or decryptor or something like that my idea is far from perfect but it should work well and can constantly be improved
it sounds to me that the core problem with this mechanic is that it takes too long to recapture the plex once they leave even still id rather they fix it wholesale instead of tuning it at this pointliang
maybe in another 35 years maybe
should definitely be classified as an exploit until the wardec system gets completely overhauledas for the gms response thats another thing that really should get adjusted we need more congruency in the rulings of gms right now they each have their own opinion and act upon it we need a general ruleset about the different topics and how they should be handled for the gms to use
agreechoices must have consequences when you rep someone has neutral you take part of something and must assume the consequencesthere is no reason that someone can rep without being flagged1 make them be flagged has long has the agression of their target if its a wardec he should think twice before repor2 make them be concorded the rep system should work like weapons
so why cant people play the game not as it is supposed to bewithout bots  without macrosthey all have an unfair advantage to all casual players it makes no sense to play the game in a normal fashion the macros and bots take away profit from normal playersi read about the idea about random menus and buttons this would kick out most macros and botsi hear more and more about macros and bots the bot scene is big and makes up a significant part of eve they cheat the gamethis has to end or ccp has to allow bots for everyonei have 3 alts which i pay with real money if ccp doesnt do anything against bots i may cancel my subsyou hear from ccp now and then in threads but their silence in threads regarding botting is defeatingits also our game lets clear it from the bots and macro users let us keep this topic up until it is solved
greed is one of my favourite sins
you get my full support for thisand i really want that queue for setting up a pos cause some take about 8 hours

well to be fair for the most part we eventually just crosstrain minmatar and get all the cool angel ships working on large autos atm myselfbut ogogovs point stands there have been countless threads discussing the problems with hybrids and while there may be some disagreement on exactly how broken they are and what could be done to fix them the general consensus is that they are broken that the concept of a short ranged high dps ship that cant actually close range with its opponents is stupid something needs to be adjusted and its the job of the developers to decide how to do sooh and its really more than half the player base that gets the shaft here because hybrids are technically the primary weapon system for 2 races caldari have about as many hybrid platforms as missile platforms oh and both those races alternate weapon systems have major flaws as well now personally i like the idea of faster ammo changes instant sounds good to me since it would give hybrid users the option of using lesser damage ammo while closing then switch to facemelting dps if they manage to actually get into hull bumping rangehell the best solution may not even be to adjust hybrids it might be better to adjust the bonuss on each ship individually say velocity or agility bonuss on blaster boats so they can get into range better or a web bonus or any number of different thingsthe point is that the developers have to recognize that there is a problem in the first place and the most recent communication that came out of the csm meeting was that blaster are fine which anyone who actually uses them knows is bullas it stands now hybrids get every disadvantage a weapon system can have fixed damage type cap use ammo use high fitting requirements this combined with a much smaller engagement envelope than their competitors this in the case of gallente combined with supposedly active armor tanked ships another problem for gallente which are by nature going to be slower if ccp wants ideas or specific proposals they can look through the boards for those ideas are legion but first we need them to recognize that there is a problem
everything ive read suggests theres a problem with hybrids and atm im using autocannons on my myrm sosigned
all i can do to avoid rookies to post here in a few months is to advice them to stop train gallentehybrids100 of the rookies that have listen are capable to see the difference between both and are happy because they didnt lost months of trainingccp devs or manager cant this is the bigest problem of gallentehybrids keep dev roguecraft on heroes station at aions system its more important

here are some thoughts on the mattersansha shipsthese ships are almost decent  but theres a reason everyone just buys a zealot you can really feel the lost shields and the ships are obviously meant to be all out gank machines even more so than the serpentis ships which have the awesome web bonus but then when you look at the ships you see those two utility highs they might be reasonable if your already extreme cap dependence didnt all but preclude neut usage or nos was actually worth fittingid say fixing the sansha ships should focus on the lost shield hp and those two utility highs  perhaps trading them for midslowsturretsblood raider shipsthese ships are also pretty close to reasonable it seems to me that the cruorashimmu are pilgrims that traded away the covops cloak tracking disruption capless damage and part of their neut bonus for a web bonus and cap hungry turret dps i think this is a slightly unreasonable trade given that the pilgrim draws so strongly on the covops cloak to pick targets and the tds to mitigate damageid say the fixing the blood raider ships should focus on survivability to compensate for the loss of the tdcloakcap reliance i think id personally experiment with sprucing up the neut bonus  by increasing its range amount or making it also apply to neutralizer cap requirements zomg almost free neutsguristas shipslet me start off by saying that im not overly fond of the concept behind the guristas ships the missile range bonus just completely killed the mood set up by a shieldmissiledrone boat i am rather strongly in favor of trading the missile range bonus for a missile rof bonus itd turn them into brawlers true but thats ok i also admit that i lust after a worm with a 10 drone damagehp bonus and inbuilt drone bay bonusangel shipsi think everyone pretty much agrees that the angel ships could use a drone bay and agility nerf a general reduction of ac awesomeness by a little wouldnt be a bad move but i admit to being fearful of an unnecessary sledgehammer approachserpentis shipsim gonna say to leave them alone pending a thorough looking over of hybridslianged formatting

bots are maintained largely by plex personal player bots or stolen credit cards rmtersplex not bought by bots will cheerfully be consumed by players at a lower prices its no loss at all to anyone if bots maintained by stole cards are removed in fact its considerably to ccps gain if they are since chargebacks are very expensive for them  this factor alone probably explains why they focus so heavily on rmt ringsthe idea that ccp need bot accounts to survive is a popular fallacy that does not hold up under scrutinythe fundamental solution remains what it has always been ccp need to bite the bullet and remove significant sources of isk generation that do not require intelligence andor risktaking the many many addicts of easy riskfree isk will scream and wail but the fact is activities like mining ratting and missioning are currently pretty much designed for bots not humans since they reward patience above inteligence skill or insightthats a fight human players will always loseincursions are an encouraging development in this regard  theyre vastly less susceptible to botting than ratting or missioning i suspect they ccp is testing the water with them

definitely supported while were at it lets name all the modules in a pos as we wishwhen you have multiple different reaction processes in your pos keeping track of which silo is linked to what floating in space can be a pitawith naming all items you could do stuff likegeneral silo reaction 1 in ageneral silo reaction 1 in bgeneral silo reaction 2 in ageneral silo reaction 2 in bwhatever silo reaction 1 outwhatever silo reaction 2 outright now the only way to do this is by putting them in specific positions and memorizing what you put where
while i have no experience with reactions i can see how painful that scenario could beso how about it csm can we get this raised with ccp you cant say this wouldnt make your members lives easier too
agree with 37
supported so long as some measure is taken to prevent sleeper levels of drone instapwnage everything else is i think critical for pve to develop beyond the shallow level it is at now just dont make gallente more useless than they are already
let me know how those lvl 4 missions work out for you if they are made to be sleeper like
i admit that i care more about the lowsecnullsec implications more than the highsecmacro related ones anybody involved with rmt the part ccp really wants to stop is probably in nullsec where the money comes a lot faster and there are fewer people who would write petitions about themi liked an idea i saw a few weeks ago penalizing nullsec alliances for bot miners in their space the truth is player organizations know about 90 of the macro miningratting in eve and simply ignore the problem or even endorse it there should be consequences for groups that allow it to go on
supportin
hopefully this wont cause a bug some totally unpredictable elsewhere
disagreewhen cloaked any action on a module should decloak the pilot even if its something like toggle overheat
there is plenty of empirical evidence out there that ccp takes action against bots every few months people will make a post on the forums sayingwhat the hell happened to all of the bots in system xwhich will be confirmed by multiple other players who claim the same thing and say that the bots on their watchlist arent logging in anymorethis is what ccp does when someone petitions about a bot or rmt they research into it before taking action they collect as many related accounts as possible and then ban them all at once it is inefficient imo but this is evidence that ccp does care
useless thread useless request people have made all sorts of suggestions on how to solve the problem and those who dont respond about how a bot can get past the idea respond by whining about the solution making their game more tedious or time consuming iow its a problem everyone wants solved and nobody is willing to deal with the hassles of anything that would be needed to solve them im sorry folks but you cant ing have it both ways what makes the game easy for you makes it easy for bots and what kills the bots makes it hell on earth for the playersthe republicans said it best you wanna be safe youre gonna have to give up some freedoms
i saw that threads appear only when there was some change to the client update fixand about banning yes they ban small number of them but thats only temporary ban and they get theirs accounts back so they dont have to worry about absolutely anything
absolutely however not to bring your mood down but a properly programmed bot is almost undetectable from a player that just ignores you at least to the server how can you differentiate a bot that has random number generators for the click locations and timing built it from a guy that just has no life and mines 23  7  ratting same i support this but really this is going to be an uphill battle
you are right in making things more exciting and harder to exploit by bots but you cant reach this with not talking about the problem i think the people who use bots will use them whenever they can i dont want any of these people in this game they should have no right to play it anymorenot talking will led us to even more bots there are only two possible ways of playing eveyou play it within the rules oryou a cheater who should gtfo ban lifetime
you think they know how and why dont they do anything against itthe report isk spammer button is also there so why not a report bot button
recurring themes are certainly an indicator of people wanting something badly or being fed up with something badly when you attach no judgement to why people repeat certain topics all over again you can simply look upon the multitude of similar threads as something ccp ought to be taking seriouslyor you can quote the rules for the hall
caldari ships look fugly because thats how theyre supposed to work if you read the backstory caldari are more interested in utility than appearance contrary to their gallente brethrenthere are many other ships that could use this overhaul moreso such as the aeon or the navitas not supported
not supported because ccp has already stated that all ships are going to be overhauled and reskinned over time also the tengu already has the current textures like the scorpion and i have no idea what you are complaining about
i agree that some caldari ships are butt ugly the raven comes to mindhopefully the raven gets a sensible look at some point in the future
yeah raven should get bulkier with small wings and visible launch tubes
i doubt the raven will see significant changes other than a texture rework due to the fact that ccp sell the models on their online store to alter that would be to obsolete not only their stock of those models but also screw everyone who bought one lol overi can see it getting a texture update but i doubt the shape will change significantly

suportedits not a lore that affects eve directly its lore that affects the depth of eve beyond the mere depth of playstyle possibilities some rp would do good to all players except bots of coursemore difficult is to make these events anomalies artifacts whatever unfarmable  unbottable while still giving more casual players an incentive to look for and do themmaybe add a chance for each agent to give such a lore mission in the form of hints  meaning no rewards for completion but rewards for finding this special place and its contents over their regular mission agenda maybe also have the agent hand out a passcode or gate activation key or soor just make storyline missions fill that role by making them fore challenging than your normal courier or easy kill mission add hackable stuff to them add some items that give a random bonus mission so many options
so just for fun these incursions are giving concord lps rightwell it turns out concord has an item that id really like their cruisers have a 1012km radius smartbomb that decloaks cloaked ships doesnt do any damage just decloaks youupdate the item would not work on grid with a stargate100000 concord lp for one of this item sound about right lets get this item into circulation ccp right now in the eve battle between submarines and destroyers the submarines have it way too easy

member of terrible alliance has terrible idea because mean people gank him with cloaky ships and its sooo unfair gtfo and take your terrible idea with you
are you kidding i have just as many cloaky ganks as the next guy maybe more i love my recons and my bombersbut now id like some more kills on the cloakies more seriously this would put a bit of a dent in the botting ravens in dronelands if they couldnt immediately cloak up when a neut enters local locals never going to be deleted so this is an alternate possibility

gate camps with decloaking bombs really what then is the point in training for a cloak let alone blackopsrecon a decloaking bomb would be sop for every gatecamp and lownull sec mining op it would render both the cloak skill useless in the vast majority of circumstances
look again short range high cost unless youre willing to commit 15 or 20 of these to a gatecamp youre not going to catch a thing you can do the same job in a gatecamp much more cheaply with drones or jetcans
theres 1 major problem with this ideagate campers could use this smartbomb to decloak all transports recons cov ops that jump thru and try to warp outthis feature just gives too much power to gate camping with overwhelming force while very marginal benefit for all other tactical situations it is my opinion that gate camping with overwhelming forces is strong enough as it is
the op proposes 1012 km range that means for nonregional gates 2 people could cover 70 of all jump ins 4 people would cover 90the bottom line is  this idea benefits strong 5 people gate camps while offering almost no benefit to all other combat tactics does eve need this why do you think eve needs stronger gate camps
in case of missile target being destroyed mid flight the missile will home in on a closest enemy that is being target painted what do you think works only with guided missiles
its a decent idea and im certainly not against it a few points come to mindtarget painting just highlights the target point being that changing targets mid flight should be a characteristic of certain type of missile a module or a ship type so either a missile with a laser seeker or a system that guides them to a new target having all guided missiles be able to do that isnt the only option to go with it is possible for example that having your missiles automaticly attack a target you didnt fire the missile at isnt a desirable thing but you still want to use guided missiles and target painters this is propably a minor issue at best but it might be worth it to take it into considerationwhat exactly is the server supposed to consider as an enemy this is an important detail so better make it clear what you are suggesting im assuming it only goes to targets the ship firing the missiles is already painting this is of limited utility but wont cause problems with the aggression system or did you have something more ambitious in mind
good points point 1well this could a characteristic of t2 missiles only or you can actually make fof missiles useful this way say that this is some kind of t2 fof missile that will require lock and painter but can be guided around with the painter point 2 how to determine the enemy would be a target that is painted either by a ship that has fired the missile or a a ship that is painted by a member of your fleet and is closest to the missile
i like this idea especially as it would make fof missiles a much more useful item although i have no idea how difficult or costly in server usage it would be to implement if it was implemented i think it should probably require a high level of skill such as target painter 5 and be a function restricted to t2 target painters
i dont think it would be that hard anyway it could server side be a alternat form of locking the opponent  the server would consider any one under the effect of a target painter is treated as having a type 2 target lock this lock would not show on screen and instantly locks and unlocks in tune with the activation of the painter any fof missile  or what ever new missile that comes of this post will seak out only targets that have a type 2 lock that are not allies
drake blob requires additional pwnage
ill throw in my insights into what encourages blobbingthe 1 reason long range weapons combined with no line of sight limitationswhen you can pack 50 ships into 6km radius sphere and that fleet can deal damage over 150 km blobbing is the best choice blobbing is a fleet where formation doesnt matter where even most maneuvering doesnt matter if you look at tackle tactics theres the 24km and 10km tacticsblobbing is least effective for the 10 km scramble  web tackle tactics due to its short range the shortest range tackle puts greatest emphasis on individuals formations within the fleet and maneuvering abilitylong range weapons encourage blobbing also by allowing people to quickly switch between multiple targets regardless of their position and distance short range weapons have much poorer support of blobbing tactics because of greater need to maneuver and greater difficulty to switch to new targets  if they targets are spread apart therefore increasing effectiveness of short range weapons would automatically discourage blobbing  on some level2 reason for blobbing high defense over offense ratio theres 2 effects happening at same time first stronger defense means longer battle duration which in turn leads to greater escalation of small fight into larger fight every time combat is initiated it acts as a magnet for opposing forces in the area even if things are very one sided where 1 side has many people and other side has very few the battle will pull people from the stronger side until combat ends even tho their additional help wasnt needed at all to win the fightbattle duration have to be carefully tuned with strategic mobility speed warps and jumps naturally reducing battle duration by increasing damage and reducing defense would automatically reduce blobbing due to less escalationsthe second side of high defense  offense ratio is that effective killing of the enemy requires more concentrated fire eve is a game with high defenseoffense ratio in most eve battles opposing fleets focus on primary targets which are called one at a timein most online fps games and even rts games such tactic would be considered very stupid precisely because the defenseoffense ratio is low in most games its more effective to split into smaller teams and attack several enemies at same time so focused fire is still effective but the groups are smaller where larger and fewer groups would be simply inefficienteven in a battle with 100 vs 100 if there are separate fights between groups of 510 on the same grid you can say that many small scale fights are happening simultaneously instead of just 2 blobs picking each other 1 at a timethese are the main 2 reasons for blobs aoe dd does not effect the main reasons behind blobbing it merely effects how often the battles happen with high threat of multiple aoe dd the frequency of battles is reduced but not their blobbinessbombs of stealth bombers also dont effect incentives for blobbing  what they effect is concentration of forces into small volumes of space so bombs encourage people to spread out and split into different groups but those groups still fight as one also stealth bombers effect short range weaponstackle more significantly than long range they encourage use of long range weapons which in turn encourage blobbing
good idea what this game really needs is more ways for a small number of people to destroy hundreds of ships instantly its not like a skilled bomber gang can destroy a fleet as it is so what we need to do is make bombers with a range bonus and that cant be killed before the bombs land that will make the game more fun for everybodybig plus on bringing back the aoe doomsday just because everybody and their granny can field 10 titans and they have many more hp than they used to doesnt mean they would be used to drop on every subcap gang in jump range like they were before dominionwait did i just get trolled 810 at least
i like the idea of bring old dd aoe effect with current number of titans in game we can clear red fleets in home systems a lot faster by dd all of them bring our titan alts much more actions and no need to assemble hd fleetsoh btw if and only if a titan got tackled log in our 200 man super carrier fleetsuper caps ftw

yes there are no bots in sov null agents only give missions in one system and chaining sanctums 237 is one fewer hour than 247
i can accept the fact that we have a 100km minimum warp distance makes sense what i dont understand is why we need a warp to target of an object or a fleet member why can we not just engage our drives and hop a distance the proposition is simple add a button with similar characteristics to orbit  you can set a custom distance or choose from presets if the feature is engaged you activate drive and hop in the aligned direction bigger ships longer spoolup time so there is a balancesimple game changing fun and adds a whole new variety to combat and tactics like never beforesuggestions ideas

i have not taken the time to see how this could be exploitablethumbs up
its called thinking ahead and setting yourself up for success simple things like ancoring or having someone with mwd at just the right angle so rage all you want about being popped mid jump but the system works its a little annoying how people keep screaming about how theyre forced to use a little strategy and tactics and expect ccp to take out all the challenge you create your own upper hand simple as that
basicly its because ftl travel in eve doesnt work like it does in star trek the nature of ftl travel in eve means that there is no way to accurately do what you propose what the real reason behind that design is i dont know it does allow for a totally different tactical environment since people cant just warp around without worryi could see this working but you would need to prenerf this heavily so target based warping would always be a preference otherwise you make catching targets extremely difficult since the align time is often the only thing preventing them from warping away before you can point them and you would screw up many existing tactical elementsfor example there should be a minimum distance you can warp without a warpable target so you cant use it to travel on the grid such travel should be mainly done using afterburners and a microwarp drive if you dont have a warpable target available on the grid warping without a target should never be an accurate science so it shouldnt allow the choosing of a specific kmmaybe au amount and there should always be random variation in the end result there also should be a spoolup time that is longer than the normal align time from zero velocity this way bookmarks and static locations would be preferable warp to locations in emergency situations since you could avoid the spoolup timerall that is basicly to make sure that ongrind fast travel by warping isnt made easy the fact you have to actually travel the distance and be vulnerable to enemy fire and ew during that time or sneak a covert ops in their rear to provide a warp in point is preferable and more interesting tactical environment
1 any shippod on grid in fleet completing the incursion plex should receive payout for completing incursion plex2 loot from the final incursion plex killing the sansha mom the only loot in the whole incursion should be locked to the fleet that is awarded the isk and lp for completing this incursion plex maybe even locked to the fleet commander2 simple changes that make a massive difference 3 like most pvp that this simulates maybe the sansha should remove easy dps from the field first such as unfleeted  small fleets like any decent fc would that ship cant get reps kill it that ship has no backup kill itthe third idea is optional
supportedas it stands they are not worth doing
1 seems sensible some people will get killed and they shouldnt be excluded from the rewards im sure people will try to freeload and exploit the system but they will get kicked from the fleet very quickly and will find it harder to get to future fleets2 no it is counter to the sandbox ideacurrent loot rules and your reward for the completing the site is the lp and isk no special rules or mechanics should be invented for this one specific loot dropa kind of compromise might be to have it drop in a locked container that requires a codebreaker module to be used on it before gaining access to it this way it would be open to a fight and stealing but harder ninja loot3 no seems like an unnecessary mechanic designed purely to protect the biggest fleet doing the complex the sansha already have a decent ai it might need tweaking but this seems uncalled for

1 is already the way it is you get rewarded if in the fleet might be excluding pods though which should change but then the sansha should target podsofopportunity as well 2 makes no sense anywhere but highsec and is a little carebearish lownull anyone not in fleet should expect to be nuked rather quickly if suspected of wanting to loot 3 like most pvp the sansha have no way of knowing who is in fleet and who is not do you want them to get banned for spamming fleet invites to find out

i had been contemplating if a resist bonus would fix this instead but i must say i like the creativity of this one it pretty much takes pve bonus and makes it pve and pvp like a resist bonus this would bring so many ships in line with their counter amarriancaldariparts
with reference to my earlier post in regards to the brutix being a pig to fit for rring compared to the rest of the 1st tier line upif you go all mental and use armour rep drones instead of a rr module you solve a lot of the fitting problems however in order for this to be well balanced the 375 bonus needs to be applied to rr received from drones too and the rig drone repair augmenter needs its bonus increased from 10 to 20 for t1 and 15 to 30 for t2 to be fair this rig is pretty useless anyways and needs to be buffed up to be worth using

hello i pass this idea on to people to keep adding on to this topic i would like to point out if caps need to be changed then dont why not add more things on to it to do more in combat or other things thats right add more modular types this will save ccp from making new ships but adding more options to caps ccp wants to make the ships more different they can now will your idea help ccp change capsi will start this topic off with caps changes or added ons to itwhat ship why if anychange to go on itskills books maybebonuses changes if any

if you combine it with the inability to create bookmarks then yes good idealets face it if you can warp to anywhere at any time you dont actually need bookmarks rightif on the other hand bookmarking remains possible then youll be back to square one with deep safes for everyone without having to actually work for them
you could find people by dichotomy pretty fast and take them off guard as theyd never see probes could gank those unprobable t3s at last too
hey ccp its been how long since eves been in existence and only corporations have wallet divisions why not show some love to the traders and industrialists of eve give individual players wallet divisions like corporations have bonus points for being able to have market orders come out of and go into a particular division this is only the umpteenth thread on the matter so its not like this is important or anything
definately its currently a pita to compare say a mega to a hyperion
if it works for isk sellers why not for this obviously ccp needs to be motivated to do something about macros and it seems like currently theyre not but this simple feature in conjunction with some analysis and banhammers could make a difference and let the players feel more in control

this may look as a pretty abstract subject but it has to do with game design and with the minutes of the december summitthe thing that prompted me to post this thread is herefrom the 3rd part of the minutes of the december csmccp summitthis actually shows the problem how can a structure be designed so thatthat structure is reasonably at safe that is it can survive long enough to allow amortizations of cost and some net gain thus allowing the related activities to be profitablethat structure can be attacked with a small gang without much effort if its not defended by real playersthe present game design paradigm is that every structure in the game must be protected by a huge amount of hps and some invulnerability timers by this reasoning the request 1 is satisfied while it is not possible to satisfy the second one just because it seems to conflict with the first so the question iswhat are the possible designs to make a structure in space safe enough give it one or more invulnerability timers lot of hps and very strong damage capabilities in three words make it tough it will only be vulnerable to large fleets or small group of powerful vessels of course it will cost quite a lot in terms of setup maintenance time required etc make it almost invisible so that hostiles will not know about it eg it will be invisible on scanner and unprobable but some random days of the week you can probe it down make it so that it can only be attacked by small ships and give it some defence without making it invincible ie place it in a deadspace complex with ship restrictions or make pi stuff nukable only by stealth bombers this does not make an asset safe just forces the attacker to organise a fleet of small ships to destroy it it may be good make it cost just a little and easy to set up so that if it is blown up its not the end of the world and it can be replaced easilythe only design that is used in eve is the first ok eve uses a pretty expanded version of it but there is no way such a design can be tweaked to allow both the safety of assets and small gangs to attack it actually the first design is pretty conservative and stands only on the owner side but of course it demands a lot from the owner refueling huge amount of time billsmy personal opinion is that a mix of the 234 designs could be the one that allows small gangs to attack stuff in space while it will be safe most of the time or better profitable to run and thats what actually matters on a side note being profitable to run means being profitable even from an opportunity standpoint ie if i can run lvl4 missions and make 30 mil per hour per account while the net gain from playing with structures in space is less when taking into consideration all the benefits but also the inevitable losses i may prefer to run missions this could be applied maybe to the nuke it from orbit idea for pi whenever it will be implemented or to some new other stuff im not going to discuss the specific feature ideas here the goal of this thread is just to discuss a general mechanic safety of structures in space since that topic was discussed with ccp in the summitedit grammar and stuff
pretty sure that you can use macros on a gaming mouse or keyboard not sure about latched keystrokes just put a book or something on your f1 keyreference botting in general for non rmt purposes people do it because they dont want to waste time making isk either because they dont have the time or because well its bloody dull there needs to be a fundamental shakeup of all pve content to make botting hard and the activities themselves more interesting a mass banning wont do anyone any good
1 a very big 1 do iiit
i would actually use tactical if had this
just replace all ship graphics with an appropriately sized arrow
as a player who flies almostexclusively with the tac map up ive gotten quite good at guestimating most of this info from what little we have on the screen but i must say that this idea gets allkinds of support from meimho a simple vector segment originating at ships center at a length proportional to the tac overlay itself in kms makes the most sense to me ships that move at 3kms dram yaay would show a 3km long segment pointing in their realtime direction it would be up to me to evaluate my targets changes in direction and maneuver accordinglytbh i see the merit in quite a few of the suggestions in this thread vectors relative absolute semicircles and triangles transverse velocity radial velocity acceleration target envelopes innies outties i dont care i just want more tac info on my tac overlayso long as all the options are generated clientside deselectable and customizable on the esc menu i dont see how is this not a good thing a veritable treasuretrove of information to help us pewpew each other into spacedust and not a single bit of it adding to server lag ftwst

supportedi understand that concord doesnt pay out insurance state farm isnt going to payout on a van you wreck while doing something illegalit just makes sensei dont wanna hear how there are too many minerals prices are steady going up oh and guess what normal players ones who stick to highsec also gank macro miners because they mess everything up ive never not once seen someone gank a hulk and say  i did it for the market  no they were all griefing s who cant handle fighting something that can fit a gun
no in the most emphatic terms noas for cosmetic onlyno that starts down the slope of new features double dipping into the pocketbookwe already have plex as a way to spend real money for things in game i dont want to see more
it just makes sense to me on too many levels1 there is no longer a game mechanic tied to racebloodline and so balance or power is not an issue2 there were three different reasons people chose particular racesbloodlines in the past a roleplay value unchanged b mechanical benefits no longer extant and c appearance now vastly different those who chose them for reason b may have not liked their choice before but felt constrained so why not let them change to what they really wanted in the first place those who chose for reason c are among the most maligned here as some bloodlines appearance has changed drastically now why not give them the chance to pick again since they werent responsible for the change3 its just good customer service since ccp made changes that players may or may not like why not give the players the option to make the most of it instead of changing what they had and simply telling them to suck it up4 new players get all options available to choose from loyal long term customers get 112th of the options is this fairnow i know many say that you should stick with the decision you made andor it doesnt make sense that you could change the way you were born but think of it this way the decision was made under different circumstances than we have now and many would not have made the same decision had the situation been different at the time second this isnt real life so why try to enforce things that people dont like about real life eitheras for a justification in game and in character for it thats simple the sansha assault concords central genetic record database in an attempt to wipe all cloning data for capsuleers thus preventing them from coming back after death fortunately a quick thinking computer ace in concord managed to stop the virus before it did too much damage sadly though some of the data was corrupted and so some capsuleers may notice a fewchangesanyway just trying to keep the thread alive and contribute logical points in the hopes that the devs take a look i chose my bloodline as a compromise that i could live with i wanted a different racebloodline but they looked terrible to me i went with what i had though it wasnt the perfect look nor the best rp fit but it was as good as i could get now the racebloodline i really liked looks quite good and what i have looks vastly different from what it did im not terribly pleased really 
multiple people have explained the flaws in your idea here in this thread hopefully the developers will read the arguments against as well as all the lemmings who are supporting your proposalyou on the other hand are so focused on your playstyle that you never even thought to consider the ramifications for others the way rr works today adds a level of complexity to the game allowing for the use of more creative tactics than simply overwhelming the enemy with superior firepoweronce again the only difference between neutral rr and in corp rr is when you can engage them surprise isnt even really a factor since as i mentioned before if you see a logistics ship on grid if isnt your neutral rr its probably your opponents plan accordingly and pretarget them so you can use the appropriate counter when they go flashyyes rr can change the outcome of a battle thats kind of the friggin point of its existence its why people bother training logistics skills in the first place and one of the ways it changes the outcome of a battle is it allows one to mitigate losses to a superior force during a withdrawala large part of why it works is that rr doesnt cause aggression meaning that when what ever ship the rr is repping deaggresses and docks up the logistics ship can follow imediately a good logistics pilot has already invested significant isk and time to gain that ability your proposed change would diminish the value of that investment with no compensation in returnthe mechanic is working as intended and can be countered sohow is it said againoh yeah htfu or gbtwow

as far as rigs go it would have been much more reasonable to set shield rigs with speed penalty just like armor rigs speed penalty is something people actually care about in pvp nobody cares about sig especially on drakealternatively tanking rigs could have penalty to damage output  thatd make people think twice
i actually like this idea the main problems with gallente is that once they get people scrammed they either cant hold them there properly minnie or dont actually out damage them by a significant amount amarr
i agree with a small number of voices on this topic the dram doesnt need to be nerfedfaction gear is supposed to stand slightly above t2 in capability and we pay accordingly in isk when we fly faction gear and in shipsmods when we fly against it i personally do not have a problem with the drams capabilities as they stand yeah some of them dont make a lot of physical sense a 15m3 drone bay on something that small really but they are what they are suspend disbelief and have fun flying itthe rest of the faction ships however are a different story ccp just recently decided to balance them with specific roles in mind ok sure ill buy that no problem ccp even kept the majority of them in line with each others capabilities and within their specific roles the problem is that the dram seemed to get the role of superfrig with a good pilot it can do damnnear everything any other frig can do only betterso yeah the easiest thing to do would be nerf the dram to the same level as the rest of the faction frigs the harder thing to do and imho the right thing to do would be to boost the other faction frigs to where the dram is ccp you guys raised the bar with the dram how bout we bring the other ffs up to meet itjust an ideast
shaera taam do you agree that dram is too cheap for the power it providesconsidering its the best of all faction frigs it should cost 140 mil or so  which is still less than most faction cruisers
realistically yes i think so a ship with a significant advantage over the others in its class should be significantly more expensive but as the caldari are fond of saying the market is god and the current prices have sorted themselves out for a reason that said should some sort of nerfboost take place with the dram or other ffs prices will sort themselves out again and no i wouldnt mind seeing all ff prices go up by a big margin if some general ffboost were to be implemented i will gladly pay more for a ship that performs better why not
the bots issue is part of a larger problem called dumpingin rl the company i worked for just failed because of competition off 3rd world supermega cheap modern slavesin eve its no different you demand your income others kill it they use bots today if you add captcha they create captcha botsif the captchas improve enough they just hire a modern 3rd world slave to answer captchasif ccp devises a smarter system they force the 3rd world modern slave to also grind in place of the bot he will still be happy to earn 30 dollars a month while managing 1015 clients anywaythis is why ccp does not fight hard and just imposes some face damage control we and ccp cannot win the moderns slavers do
amazingly i agree with something youve said for a change of course the argument isnt quite that ccp cant win its just that the way to win is more complicated than hunting and banning bottersthe only real way to combat botting is to eliminate boring static repetitive tedious game play that is easily scripted or to level the playing field on activities for which this cant be doneconsider the suggestion i put out a few weeks ago to change mining to a passive activity eliminate exhumers and barges and replace them with mining poss that operate mining drones on an automatic basis adjust yields accordingly and you eliminate the bulk of the use of bot in mining admittedly theyd still be able to gain some advantage in using them as haulers but a big enough ore bay to only require emptying every few days and that advantage would be pretty much negligible other bot friendly activities would require different solutions but essentially if you reduce the advantage gained by the bots sufficiently then you reduce the incentive to bot and there by reduce the amount of resources devoted to botting for instance a relatively easy counter to market bots would be to allow players to adjust their market orders when offline say through eve gate so that the advantage the botter gains of being able to 01 isk 237 is reduced compared to the poor  who spends most his day at work its similar to the solution to the dumping problem you mention i call it capitalists gone wild since i see offshoring as essentially the same thing as a sexual predator who travels to another country to avoid our laws regarding abuse minors so does the capitalist operating in a foreign country to avoid our labor and environmental laws you tax the crap out of imported goods coming from countries that dont match our local labor and environmental laws to the point where the competitive advantage of exploiting foriegn labor is negatedso the real solution to combating botters is for the developers work to negate the advantages gained by the those who try to break the rulesedit of course that assumes that ccp actually has a motivation to combat botting the truth is that theyd still be looking at a revenue drop so
dear csmi see nothing in here about a rather persistent rumor i heard about the csm wanting wrecks to become probeable i even filed a proposal against itif the csm has any such plans where can i read about them
im not letting this one go so bumpas a side note im sure its worth noting that the more controversial a subject is the more supportdiscussion is seems to garnerthe easy ones like this seem to die fast even though the majority of people agree with iti wonder if thats why we never see the easy ones get implemented
definitely support both ideas i would like to be able to change the names on all pos modules but ill take anything we can get in this direction
i have found its generally pretty easy to rat in pvp fits cant say about sanctums thoughliang
this
bots dont have a bottom line after theyve made their plex money its all gravy you could nerf their activities very badly but that will hurt legitimate players far more due to the fact that real pilots are playing for far fewer hours in the daya better idea for fixing mining and ratting bots has been suggested elsewhere 
its ccps job to enforce eves eula not that of alliance leaders
there are some downsides to thisi dont like macro miners myself but i do like to mine while i do other things read news email surf the web etc and even play another game while i mine ofcourse turning the eve sound off because those mining lasers make a terrible noisethis way i look much like a macro miner and dont get warnings minimized window it does take a while to fill up a hulks cargo hold so a minute will pass by easy when you are not paying atentionif somehow this can be incorperated into the design of the new mining idea i love the ideas to get rid of macro miners
id rather mining have some sort of minigame where i get to aim the laser or something
they really need to get rid of static belts the more analysis and critical thinking required the less likely a macro could do it and the more engaging it will be for humans
well i guess making mining a more interactive profession wouldnt be a bad idea to combat macros i know i know ive always been a stern advocate of the gank the living crap out of the macros policy but after reading so many ideas around here i realized that maybe ganking alone wont solve the problem hey i can be open minded at timesi dont know whose idea it was of whatever im about to talk about but after seeing how planetary interaction has developed into a complex process that requires quite a bit of careful planning adjusting etc perhaps ccp could adapt the same concept towards mining well the planning and adjusting part i meanlets say that when you engage the mining lasers or strip miners a window will pop up showing the complex process in which the mining modules are working at depending on their tech level and type the mining process would be represented by what looks like a series of circuit boards that need to be adjusted every 56 minutes for variations in the mining yields and amount these adjustments can be anything from rerouting the pathways of the circuits for achieving optimal yield to realigning the mining crystals to ensure the yields are maxed a graph much like the pi survey graph would show how your adjustments and tweets have affected the modulethis should create a big problem for macro developers as they wont know how to teach a computer to make these constant adjustments i am willing to wager that even the best macro software will yield inaccurate results with this setup as it also requires visually clicking and aligning the circuits to achieve maximum yield real miners will profit since they are human and can compensate for sudden changes while macros will suffer yield wise for a very long time because the computer cant compensate for the fluctuations as it doesnt know how to align the circuits every 56 minutesof course the time between adjustment can be debated as i know some players have multiple monitors with 35 eve clients running at the same time and have to constantly switch between monitors looking at the adjustments they need to makewhat do you think
yes please
and my support
yes
this looks nice
outpost destruction will unfortunately force people to nap even more than they already are do you want most of the 00 be blue to everything that has even a tiny chance of taking systems away from the said blob but im not against introducing vast amount of anyone can dock stations in 00 that helps the little guys so i suppose this could be a good thing or a bad thing depending on what kind of politics we have
im not a programmer im a miner so i dont know what kind of softwhere it would take i do know that botting is cheating and that ccp doesnt seem to be doing anything to stop it if there isnt softwhere for it then have one of those squiggly letter codes that web sites use when a minning ship activates it lasers if the code given is wrong 3 times make the ship flashy red to everyone around if they get it right then they are given a pass until they dock up againyou could limit this to just mining barges if you feel it it too intensive seriously though something needs to be done
signedwhy not allow players to police botters a kinda menu option like invite to fleet where a player can tag a botter and if that botter doesnt click on a confirmation button  enter a code whatever within 5 mins then that bot afk player then turns red and is open seasonshould the confirmation pass then it cannot be activated again for 1hsimple solution maybe but i dont know im not a programmer just an eve gamer
post here if you would like ccp to make the removal of botsscripts from eve online a prioritydo it noaaw1
they got one for gold spammers bots are just the other side of that im down
love pizza
haha wow this thread is still alive i love it
im well aware of caldari design philosophy thank you i think you may have missed my point though i didnt mention the noctis all for nothing i did so not because its got a pretty skin per se but because its hull skin makes it a realistic ship its got some black grills and a khaki canvaslike outer skin its probably the only ship ingame that actually looks like its real unlike caldari ships that are basically just wireframes with a cheap metal texture slapped on the sideso im not proposing allcolorful exotic designs rather id like caldari ships to become like the noctis looking realistic merely adding minimal texturecoloring just enough so you actually get the feeling youre looking at a real ship againalso keep incarna in mind i know the two seem unrelated but with graphics being beefed up considerably for it the crappier looking ships will only start to looking crappier by comparison
if contracts could be securely created through the api corporations would be able to create their own fully customizable storefronts using a platform that is already widely in use  the webadding the ability to create contracts to the api or to the igb javascript calls or a combination of the two would allow corporations or individuals to include sales directly on their websitesthe igb currently has javascript links for contracts already this is obviously very simple but my own corporation uses these to offer premade contracts in an easy to find format for an example check out
my question would be how many corporations would actually utilize this and would that number be significant enough to implement this
at present there are not many corporations that make use of the igb features however i believe that if the option were available to make websites more interactive people would use them also there are many developers myself included who would make easily installed packages for a shopping cart and checkout system to be used on corporation websitesi think it allows players to make their own commercial portal that is fully interactive with the game as ccp originally talked about with the storefront idea  but it saves ccp a lot of work and allows players to use their own creativity to make something unique and high qualitythanksdacil arandur
did ccp really intend for things to get this badlets have a breakdown on 00 including the mechanics1 well first of all those timers suck we went from pos warfare that involved activity in several systems with multiple timers not amazing mechanics but still workable to lets call cuddle up in a ball and lag the system out2 1 year after dominion lag is somewhat none existent but with every sov holding alliance in a desperate attempt to blue each other to survive just so they can get similar numbers as their enemies we will see lag return soon enough3 supercaps here there everywhere they are now used for ratting sigh dreads on the other hand are used for hmm where can i use a dread instead of a supercap now before you give me the but dreads are cheaper and can dock reply you should know carriers are also cheaper and can dock yet still fit a role dreads are somewhat useless mainly because of siege being too long but thats a different story4 lets shoot stations how exactly is shooting a station any better than pos warfare at least with pos warfare dreads could be used now supercarriers fill the role of structure dps and well everything else5 number warfare alliances are aware there is nothing stopping them from blueing all of 00 they also know this is the easiest way they can survive while their player base goes inactive or npcs they just get more blues this is literally bull yes i am aware ccp and csm are working on fixing this and want to get rid of number warfare i just dont want to see something as bad as dominion6 puppet masters pets renters and nips non invasion pact in other words neutral with benefits if you look at the sov map each sov holding alliance fits into one of these categories7 passive income why is it 00 criticise lvl 4 mission runners or people who work for their isk when 00 alliances get passive income through moon goo8 industry in 00 sucks the only pveing anyone does is ratting mining overall is bad what happened to making people in 00 live in 00 majority of the time free from mission altsi think it is time ccp focus on making a dominion mk ii no more empire stuff no more random stuff no one even asked forchange 00 to encourage smaller local wars that dont involve curling up in a ball in a single system shooting a stupid structurecharge alliances isk based on their member and corp count like a human resource fee meaning if you are going to recruit everyone at least be charged for it that way people can choose if a player is worth the upkeep and recruitment wont be as limited as hey we have space join and blobchange supercaps so dreads are useful again i personally think if dreads had a 2 min siege timer they would used more often make sov easier to claim that favours skill over blobbing for example introduce a beacon that can be anchored fast and easy the beacon will have about 2 mil hp and unless destroyed will claim the system for the alliance who deployed it the beacon will be 500 m3 allowing smaller alliances to have a chance at sov warfare a beacon can be placed at planets only and it takes 3hrs to online once online the system will switch sov for the beacon holding alliance this will encourage more wars yes people will be outnumbered but because it will be easier to claim sov people are more likely to put effort in defence  offence rather than spending days risking only to get boredomas for stations allow them to be incapped making it impossible to dock in them or use services if already docked this will require carriers etc to rep and encourage cap  supercap warfare also for the sake of industry allow 00 stations to manufacture invent copy refine etc better than anything else better than what they are atm
introduce a new ship which leeches moon goo from 00 whs lowsec yes im well aware of the wh comment p if moon goo is being leeched the harvester will send a message to the starbase defence operators letting them know there harvester is running at a reduced rate during this time the moon harvester will only harvest 20 of efficiencythese are some ideas and examples i am hoping small gang warfare gets promoted where we see more black op hot drops and more conflicts that wont rely on numbershow do you know people wont blob with this  well based on everything that has happened in the last few years i believe the major reason why blobs happen is because of timers allowing in advance planning of blobs and because one system is usually affectedthink of it this way imagine you had 5 days to defend a system and 5 days to organise a fleet can you really blame alliances for doing a cta everyone has 5 days to get to xxx 3hrs or lower timers promotes continuous battles active alliances benefit but due to smaller sov structures there will be more fleets more combat more destructionquestions you may askthats not fair when i claim sov someone can take it while im asleep  yes they could but then you can take it back one of the major things people complain about is timers ruining everything smaller alliances cant claim because they cant handle having mass numbers and larger alliances get bored due to spending more time shooting a station and less time shooting playersi have 1000 players in my alliance they are all inactive why should i pay a fee to have members  well managing an alliance isnt exactly easy it allows corps  alliances to decide who is worth having  not having that includes who and who shouldnt be kickedi have 10 systems ready to swap in 3 hours well done on this bad idea im going to lose everything  maybe you should go kill their beacon it doesnt require a lot you can even do it with a few sb or if you want you can go claim someone elses systemthe sov map is ruined everyone is trying to kill everyone people are claiming space everywhere and all you see is pvp in 00  goodi am in a 20k coalition we will be able to defend all these places that are going to swap sov  3 hours is a lot of time to kill something with 3 mil hp if you can manage to defend all 20k people good luckthis promotes piracy you are a   actually im the biggest carebear in eve  not by choice either sov warfare doesnt happen much and when it does its all about the numbers and who or what is blue where inactive alliances can sit back and have 50 supercarriers defend their spacehow exactly would this promote pve  imagine the huge increase in losses and pvp well players will need to buy stuff selling stuff in 00 npc stations will make a fortunemy supercap is useless now that i cant blob  nope supercap  cap warfare will be to defend a station huges fleets will be there but will be limited to defending  attacking structures smaller fleets will focus on sov you can always use supercaps to defend sov but that would be really inefficientwhat about the current bonuses we get from sov  those will be there too but i guess for the sake of things the current sov structures can be removedbwhahaha i will claim all of 00 mark my word  you really think you can claim and defend that many systems if you can manage that then great stuffblack ops warfare heh  yup once again these are just ideas im sure not all of you agree but since most people careless of epeen status are disappointed in 00 atm
id like to see some sort of convergence between sovereignty styles at present we have database sov defining empire space dominion sov defining nullsec alliances occupation impacting faction warfare and incursion where npcs temporarily invade some regionthe incursion and faction warfare styles of sovereignty encourage smaller groups and active pvp faction warfare is a little broken due to occupying bunker deadspaces with cloaked ships to cheese your way to winning so that needs to be fixedperhaps there should be a kind of grand unified sovereignty system empire space should be contestable all sov  sec status should be determined to some extent by the amount of pvp or pve action that takes place nullsec alliances could launch attacks on their enemies by paying off an npc empire to wander into some region the enemy controls incursions on demand pilots could choose to align with the npc empires providing the casual players an authority to work for because npcs dont kick you from their alliance if you dont turn up to ctas for a monthsovereignty would be determined by the amount of activity in a system with the benefits being bonuses to those activities ie sov based on indexes not structures contesting sov would require doing the activities that the sov holder is supposed to be doing go into enemy space and run their complexes mine their ore blow up their ratters blow up their miners engage in all available forms of pvpwe need working treaties too then the alliances could hire carebears to occupy specific systems to rat and mineconcord or local policenavy could then be installed with an ihub module or a simple treaty with the appropriate npc corp taxes not enough in empire space concord response time drops as indicated by the security status too many missions being run security index goes up mission quality drops more pvp happening security index goes down tougher rats appear better mission agents move in or existing mission agents become better qualitythus places like sasoutikh emolgranlan dodixie and motsu would end up as 10 sec with l1 agents  while places like jita end up becoming lowsec with l5 agentsa sandbox where half the sand isnt glued in place yay
i would also like to mention when people are asked why arent they moving to 00 or joining a 00 alliance i get the following replies in no specific orderlagtoo many naps blobbing everything that isnt bluesupercap blobbingshooting structures sucksexcept for weekends there isnt any targetsand many other criticisms now when 00 players are asked why dont you think non 00 players goto 00 i get the following replies in no specific orderthey are all carebears who like ccp to hold their hands which doesnt make sense non 00 includes whs and lowsec00 sucks no one really likes the current mechanicsbecause who really wants to spend hours getting ready and travelling just to die in a blob or get no combat
this is what i would start withrotate moon minerals on a 36 month schedule with the nascent vein being discoverable on a similar schedule should spur some more wars to secure future income for the bloated null entitiesallow small gangs to affect sovereignty upgrades by direct action as in external targetable upgrade modules on ihub makes patrollingusing ones space an actual requirement go figure encourages entities to diversify their roster across timezones and loose some fat restrict bridges titanpos to industrial type ship and boost null industry by a healthy margin increases gate use  more pew gives null the opportunity to become selfsufficient when it comes to common goodsincrease dread damage ehp andor change siege function to near toggle dreads are okish at what they do but have a ww1 pilots life expectancy against supers flip that and they may come out of hiding againfw cloaked timer capture was fixed ages ago you are behind the times
stopped reading at this point
i actually agree with the goon there lag is horrible in 00 as are lots of other things they havent come close to the lag levels from before dominion at all
im finding 500 man fleets quite fine atm cant really speak on a ncs 1200 in a system point of view but most alliances cant reach those numbers anywaythe very idea i am suggesting will reduce number wars exception to station shooting so there wouldnt ever strategically need to be a reason to bring more than 100 playerssaying that this conversation isnt about lag and while some people may feel lag is still present and some dont i for one havent heard experienced much problems with lag recently or heard lag affect average sized engagementsthe lag comment was todo with the nature and mechanics of 00 where people will just shove more players in a system until it lags anyway
on my alliance forums we have altered our software so that people in certain usergroups are only capable of seeing this for all posts the yellow squiggle at the left is normal sized text
also i know somebody will bring up greasemonkey scripts to bypass this i know greasemonkey can fix this but it also borks all the legitimate numbers and punctuation also not everyone can run the scripts and in the end the dude knows he got punishedwe have been using this for a couple years now and its a pretty effective punishment we can share the algorithm with ccp if they decide they want to implement it
turn that frown upside downwill you be applying for csm this year
im surprised you guys let for and you slip by with such obvious replacements to be hadliang
its just based on single letter replacements right now although i love the idea of using txtspkthis will show those greasemonkey scripts whos boss
im sure thieves and the like are going to flame this but read the whole post before you begin with the mouth diarrheaplexes that require a key are broken not the whole complex but the mechanic used to get in if you have to kill a named rat to get their key  card  passcode  left eyeball  whatever it should not work 2 weeks after you got it we assumepretend we play a game in which not all of the npcs are idiots just the ones in l4 missions who cant fit all their hard pointsthe key used to gain access should expire in a given amount of time say 30 mins or an hour anyone who has ever tried to do one that isnt a farmer finds that it is already gone and if one is lucky enough to get to one before a farmer say after dt a crash or maybe just pure luck its not uncommon to see a farmer burn thru a key they already had and come through the pelx and try and steal the swag at the end point is if it is supposed to be so special that they have a secure key that a named rat has how can they not figure out hes dead and make his key invalid simple solution is to make the keypasswhatever poof after 30 mins to an houranyone else feel this waybtw i looked thru 5 pages to see if this was here or not if i missed it link it please
why not make the key die either when the rat dies or when another key spawnsalong those same lines it would be kind of nice if the final room was instanced no respawns into the instance as people will often sit in the room for a silly long time
yeah ive heard of that happening but i honestly havent gotten into plexes enough to even see that happenall the same that is avoiding the mechanic of the key and youre right the room should reset somewhere else kind of like a mission once a new keyholder rat spawns
there has been several threads about this issue
of course i also would like to see command ships as a whole looked at again liang
 thiswith the advent of the tengu nighthawk just isnt worth it any more not that it no longer has any purpose but relative to the amount of skills required for a command ship the nighthawk just doesnt offer enough extra to warrant the high requirements nighthawk sorry to say currently is just a slightly better drake
im going to get behind this needs a look at least
it would be nice to see field commands able to run a link while doing pve or pvp fits as well as fleet command getting a better bonus to links because at the moment any t3 can run 3 links warp cloak warp through bubble and be unprobable while doing a better bonus in less than half the training time additionally it would be nice to see the armor rep such as the one proposed in another thread to give local tank bonuses the abil to bonus incoming rep change to resistence bonuses or shieldarmor health bonus on the minmatar and gallente command ships overhauled to get them more than just gang work as well as the few other minor tweaks needed such as falloff bonus for the claymore more bandwidth for the eos longer range to the damnation and vulture bonus flipped to missile velocity and flight time instead
im perfectly fine with this item not working on grid with a stargate itd be intended to be used in belts and sites to catch cloakies and botsupdating proposal to reflect that
i was thinking more of making the missile sniping actually practical more difficult to manage but not impossible compared to turret sniping drakes would not get too much of benefit since the range is lower this wold make cerberus and cruise ravens actually usable if handled properly
for guided missiles no you already get a huge range damage selection and cap free operationfor fof missiles yes allows for a way to have a buddy help defeat ewar used against the missile platformotherwise youll have cerbsravens sitting at near max range with launchers going nonstop using a logitank group in the middle painting stuff
tldr boost missileno thankcurrent fof balance damage is based on the assumption that they dont focus fire but hit the nearest target if playing with a friend with a painter allow you to bypass that limit and focus fire on a single target the fof damage need to be nerfedsimilarly you get a serious advantage in locking time if a frigate with a painter can acquire targets for a group of bs using cruise fof again it would be a valid reason to reduce fof damage
wouldnt that merely bring them closer to par with guns which can have the same buddy remote boosting the gunshipfof already have 25 less damage than regular ordnance and painting have range limit that is generally lower than the missiles themselves ie painter in harms way
ok i like we have some discussion going from some valid points that i have seen here the proposal then would be make a t2 missile group that would require fof to 5 with spec skills for each size like other missiles unlike the t1 fof missiles these will require normal lock to fire but have the additional homing feature base damage of fof is lower so would keep it that way
no remote boosting dont do anything similar this idea will totally bypass ecm and make fof a wondrous weapon if you have a friend it will remove one of the two drawback of fof for free as a target painter already give an advantage you really want to live in a world of fof firing drakes with tackers target paining the called targets
how about a counter proposal of fofs having a second function of hitting the closest target with a target painter on them this would effective make it similar to assigning your drones to a fleet make if you got jammed as well as give a reason for fofs to be used side bonus would be that this would make long range missile boats suck less in pvp
i have a suggestion to make with the new incursion patch i think if u dont save the system before downtime u lose the system to the sansha nation bc that would make more people fight them and also make the game more entertaing to play so just get back to me on it and tell me what u think miket213
no they dont stick around enough as it is if anything they need to stay longer
if not one day two bc i think it would make incursin more fun
incursion  short as in raid the bandits made brief incursions on the villageinvasion  long as in entrance as if to take possession or overrunany dictionary would inform you of the difference between the two
majid alamarr i dont get what ur saying
i completely agree with the idea im not sure what you propose can work but we definitively need to reduce fleet sizefleet should be limited to 40 pilots to maximumwith the current concept of fleet and 200 drakes flying together we dont need any pilot anymore fleet commander just need a big remote control to control all ships it will be better for the result for the players who can watch a movie instead of looking at the lagdo something regarding this pleaseguldi
ok so you might want to get ready for a wall of a text for this as i might have to explain this in detail so you can get a better understanding on what im talking about heresince planetary interaction is a passive source of isk income that requires some attention ie moving extractor heads adjusting cycles etc how would you guys feel if ccp did a little experiment in which you can keep an eye on your colonies via the ipad or any other tabletlike device like googles galaxy tab this could really be a benefit for those who dont have much time to head home log into their desktop computers and log into eve online to check their planets usually because of work road trips or whatever other reason like wife aggro but of course one might ask how this could be implemented lets start with a few suggestions feel free to pitch in if you like1 since devices like the ipad and galaxy tab are not known for handle much in the way of 3d graphics each planet that the pilot controls would be represented by a 2d rectangular map of each planet much like your typical classroom map with some basic data displayed such as survey data location of ecus and their respective heads as well as storage units2 to reduce possible lag on the server anytime you log into your account from the ipad the eve client on your pc will log out if you were still logged into the computer then just like how it happens today between two computers accessing the same account this should also reduce data corruption3 since the current pi system requires that your ship be in space to use the customs office you wont be able to importexport your commodities since a portable device like the ipad wont handle the graphics4 to reduce the possibility of loginlogout spamming of this form of planetary interaction i would recommend a cooldown time of about 23 hours between log ins so that the server can have time to gather the information inputted from the ipad or galaxy tab and apply it to the 3d version of pi that we currently see in the eve clientthis will obviously take a lot of time to experiment since this is quite a leap to try to connect a server to a portable device but then again ccp is already trying a big leap with dust 514
get a real tablet not trash you can only browse the internet in like an ipad wait they cant even do that right no flashi own a lenovo s103t multitouch tablet that runs win7 and eve at 15fps at 1024x600 in combat even systems like rensjita are completely playable on itnext time you spend some money get a machine that will do something your smartphone cant
well last time i checked flash according to symantec has the worse security record in 2009with the popularity of the ipad rising i doubt that the masses would go for the tablet pc anytime soon unless youre a true techie and besides i dont really own an ipad i only brought it up because i thought it would be nice to create a little app that links the players to their pi colonies in some way
seriouslya standard fleet drake has around 80000 ehp a maxskilled bomb deals 8000 damage unless you have covert ops 5 it does less the maximum number of bombs that can be used in one volley is 7 otherwise they destroy each other it takes at least 2 volleys to kill anything which means if you dont have conventional ships as well the enemy will get awayalso after insurance a marauder or black ops costs more to replace than a dread or carrier if an alliance fielded 20 t2 battleships against 50 drakes they would still be risking twice as much isk on the fight the drakes would only have to kill 5 of them to break even on isk destroyedlostthe main goal is to make weapons that are bad vs 50 drakes but good vs 100 drakes so that fleets are encouraged to split up into subgroups and more commanders are neededthe aoe weapons im suggesting would be rare and ridiculously expensive as for dds i acknowledge that titans are much more common these days and suggest their area also be decreased significantly
solution bubble fleet start waves of bomb salvos been there done that came away with a dozen bs kill mails it works especially on entrance gates with armor bsonly idiots fly marauders in combat that could have the potential of ecm which is pretty much any combat situation one scorp could shut down half a fleet black ops are silly expensive and equal to their t1 version again never seen in combat where the other side might field more ships than the one being gankedim a big fan of carrots personally rather than penalizing people from having too many give them reason to be in multiple places at the same time in current battles there are no supply lines to hit flanks to circumvent or weaknesses in the line to be exploitedrather than blobbing into one place to accomplish something the mechanics should split up fleets to hit multiple targets the current mechanic is little more than pound one structure until it reinforces then come back and do it again as many times as needed until it explodes as long as that remains it matters little how many penalties you put on the blob it will still remain the most efficient strategy in combatall that said calling fleets blobs is rather silly there is a lot of complexity in many of these large fleets and the efforts put into organizing them is near overwhelminggive carrots not the stick
im going to go out on a limb here and try a different way of thinking about itwhile i agree the lack of aoe weapons is maybe a pertinent point i also feel that there might be something to be said about adjusting the effects of having so many ships maintaining an active lock on another shipi would assume maintaining an active lock on another ship would involve some pretty sophisticated sensor telemetry so how about there being an upper limit based on the targeting ships sensor strength and target ships sig resolution on how many ships can target a single vessel the more ships locking a target the smaller its apparent signature radius becomes due to interference
such ideas are counterintuitive for players and it does nothing to change the root cause of blobby behavior which i described in my previous postit would just cause a lot of frustration and introduce all kinds of exploits with friendlyhostile locks
whilst i can see the mechanic possibly being exploitable like every other mechanic in eve i dont understand how the claim that preventing a blob from locking a target at once would fail to discourage blobby behavior or maybe im just unclear on the ability of a maelstrom fleet being able to oneshot a carrier as being encouragement for blobby behavior
the multiple locking thing is particularly bad because friendly and neutalts can take advantage to secure their important ships from enemy locksso not only you got idea that makes no sense gets people ed off but it also gets abused
how is any of that relevant for virtually risk free highsec missions
get ownedyeah really though highsec missions pretty much should get nerfed into the ground maybe left somewhat the same sure as hell not boosted
high sec mission running needs a nerf not a buff
red font is the new capslock
i would be happy with simply not having to dock to accept the mission in the system or perhaps allowing you remote accept a mission from and agent you had just completed a mission for instead of just any agentalso i believe as professions go wormholes are far more lucrative then missions
all this nerdrage about bubbles offlining when too close to a pos made me wonderwhy on earth do we even have infinipoint bubbles that does not even require an operator interdictors provide fast ondemand bubbling at the cost of short duration and near guaranteed death hics provides the bubbletackle to take over from the dic with a hefty tank to stay on targetcommon for both is that they require a person at the helm plus represent a significant investmentmobile bubbles on the other hand have a huge amount of ehp for their sizes good range lowish cost comparatively and require no one to actually be there  the only downsides are volume and anchoring delaysuggested changemobile warp disruptors cannot sustain the scrambling field without an external source of em energy said energy can be in any form and can come from any remotely operated device such as webs tps disruptors dampeners tds etcanchoring delay for all units is cut by 75 t1t2 s m l  30s15s 60s30s 120s60sall other stats can largely remain the same with a possible downwards tweak of volumes to allow for easier deploymentresult not counting tears from people stuck in pos bash eramobile bubbles become just that tactical assets that can be deployed rapidly to the field to provide semistatic scrambling or deployed before hand for later use
i always liked someones idea on this that a mobile warp bubble should require fuel like stront or something  not a lot  but someimagine like 2 stront an hour but only has like a 6 stront capacitywhen the fuel runs out  it stops workingthere have been plenty of times i have gone into a wh and there are like a million of these things setup around a pos for protection right now they dont cost anything to run and are just left behindthat and the damn things should be able to be scanned with combat probes its annoying that you cannot
maybe i am the only one with this problem but now that i have the ability to overheat modules it seems to happen frequently when i dont want it do also it can be difficult to tell if a rack is overheating or not at first glance what i suggest is some sort of safety like on a gun that you can latch or unlatch that will prevent any attempt to overload a rack when its in a latched position beyond that i would also like to see some sort of graphic that in no uncertain terms shows that a rack is overheating so that if you somehow accidently start overloading it will grab your attention so that you can turn it off before it starts to damage the modulesso that it does not upset those who like to overheat frequently there could be a default state setting that will set the latch to the users preference or even disable the latch altogether if that is what they wish
what you seek is the lock overload status menu point in the hud menu the little triangle near the capacitor also overload graphics are indeed in need of a facelift
i dont mean ship graphics space graphics etc theyre all very prettysome of the effects are terrible though here is what i wish for it would really improve immersionfor starters i wish when a gun missed it showed itthere needs to be variation to where turrets and missile hit on a ship or structure there is some but not enough let my guns hit in different places just randomize iti absolutely hate the little shockwave effects rails have when they hit ships clipping is never right it just looks cheesy a new effect smaller shockwave maybeblasters seem too big as wellrail sound effects are terrible compared to other guns they sound like they have absolutely no punch to themwhen guns fire the sound stacks are too strong 8 rails on a rokh can be deafening when a single one can barely be heard i find myself adjusting groups to make fighting more fun to watch to quiet down my turret firing etc and of course torpedos look rediculously strong and they arent my girlfriend the other day watched me play for a second and laughed at the fact that i was surviving the dozens of torpedos hitting my ship shields armor i dont care its a cool effect just far too strong torpedos arent the godly weapons they were when ccp first put them in game again they look cool but not when you have 6 npc ravens firing torpedo after torpedo at you for 30mins straight in a missioni would also absolutely love it if when you group fired they hit at the same time but had a graphic other than all turrets firing at once staggered firing just the visuals would be fun to watchi know this post seems a bit rude i dont mean it to be the list formatting might not be fun to read my apologies if it seems presumptuous as in here is a list i want you to do it get back to my when its done really didnt mean for that the game is beautiful the graphics are great in most areas but some stuff hasnt been updated in eons and i wish ccp would take notice it was my biggest disappointment when returning to the game after a long breakmost of the changes i asked for would only take a matter of hours at the long end if anyone agrees with me please support me in this
older thread covering the same issueta 
a lot of the changes talked about in that thread are difficult though im mentioning stuff that would take a single programmer almsot no time at all to sit and dothe point is very little investment of time could make a huge impact on immersion in this game forget ship damages and all of that that can be for a future expansion im talking about a simple 300kb patch not including sound effects of course that would add a ton of graphical improvement to the game
it needs to be fairly inaccurate to not be imbalanced however i would like to see it possible to get on grid with someone in a save spot or mission pocked by using the directional scanner and that warp function of curse it would have todrop you at a random distance off the target in a radius of at least 200km and all dead spacemission complexes have to be set so you cant warp around in themotherwise someone dropped at 200km could just warp to a wreck near the complexmission runner if those criteria would be met i think it would be doomsdayproof
actually they can its like fitting a micro warp drive it doesnt fold space or any other weird sf dipsht it just behaves like a superfast afterburner moving you thru regular space along a linear path very fast so i see no real impediments to the ops proposal immersion or otherwisesupported 1

people still a bit slow to realise the same bugs that fw players have been screaming about for years are now breaking incursions and sabotaging ccps efforts to release new content i wonder how long it will take 510 years

the sandboxcurrent loot rule is broken when you have a a percentage bar countdown to when a piece of loot will spawn that is broadcast to everyone with an exact location requiring no effort to have a go at ninja stealing it if every piece of loot had this with a beacon that spawns so that everyone could warp into anything to ninja loot with no effort then i would agree with you maybe even making so the mothership has to be probed out would helppoint 3 was made because it is quite easy to sit in front of this super npc ai and not get killedthe rewards and how stupidly easy it is to loose them makes incursions pointless
as if you and your carebears will go there in all those expensive ships and clones low sec incursions are just going to get powned by a big alliance when they spawn close enough to their homeslow sec incursions are a whole different set of pointless issuesya know

forget what now
ah well that is a different question i would not be surprised if the csm addressed a wellsupported proposal in ah regarding this issueit should be clear to everyone that poss need a ton of work
perhaps one possibility might be things that degrade pos operation that can be achieved by smallmedium gangs permitting hitandrun harassment operations against enemy infrastructure
the problem that any fixed hp system runs into is the one where if ten people can do it in an hour they will bring a hundred and do it in six minutes we saw it happen with poses and pos guns station services sbus etci am hugely in favour of more conflict drivers in all types of space but care should be taken to prevent situations where instead of the intended small gang you will find a roving band of 50 people running around nicking all the stuff in notime while certainly natural and according to expectations it doesnt exactly make the game more interesting
any news
seriously csm post something about your views on the neo neocom that was scd foreverthis is not a discussion topic the csm need to post more on current events so either csm members please post your opinion on the neocom and its fate so people can link to csm posts that have already address the issue so all of the posts can be in this thread

awesome ideas supported
3 i wish i could sell my ideas so eloquentlyonly one nitpicking i proposed to make the vectors constant in length to make it possible to see them when zoomed out this excludes the length relativeness to speed that you propose ideally we should be able to select between the two visuals
aww thxand yeah what you say makes sense but even a 1kmsec frigate will still have a discernible vector on your screen even if youre zoomed all the way out to a 100km wide tac display for my part i tend to drive the fast ships so the ones i really worry about are the ones that compare to my ship in speed or are faster but hey make it selectable relative and absolute radio buttons on the esc menu problem solved either way its a moreusable tac display o

wow
let me get rid of crap i never use
i was looking forward to this let the people decide after all it was optional
ok but make it optional like the new contracts systemi really dont want another buggy ccp release screwing up my interface and getting my ship blown up while my api crashes
supporteddidnt take the time to test it any on sisi but i was looking forward to giving it a chance on my secondary characters when it hit tq
i want it and im frustrated by the fact that its arrival was announced with trumpets a marching band and a devblog  its removal was that it simply wasnt there and later a vague post about player feedbacki didnt see any player feedback that said it was a bad idea  players just wanted it and moreat the very least we deserve a proper explanation  they clearly spent time and effort on it and hyped it up lots
supported im using the optional beta contracts i would be using the neocom if it was there
amen dominos use the most disgusting old rotten ingredients off the back off a crashed truck from the 20sdont worry though they listened to customers and updated a 50yo recipe rofl
would it be possible for adding an option to free a slave like the ones slave traders drop maybe get a small standing gain 01 per with the groups that dont like slavery as well
i feel sorry for them even though theyre pixels
the option would be fit nicely to the back story especially for us minmatar
freeing them should be an option but im iffy on the standings gain mainly i dont want to see a situation where you can buy standings and i have no idea how many slaves there are actually available for people or even know all the places they get spawnedsupport for free the slaves option with no rewardedit add a sound effect when you free slaves a cheering crowdperson should make for an appropriate effect
actually i like the idea of freeing the slaves do it in minnie space and you get a standing bump small but do it in amarran space and you get an imperial navy aggro timer and a standing cut notsosmall hehe yes this is a kind of click here to buy standing but would also start pipelines of slave smuggling to antislavery space slave prices in minnie space would skyrocket and your buystanding scenario would even itself outa new occupation would be born and a few more grains added to the sandboxnow where did i put those skillbooks for that prowleredit gah forgot the little thumbs up supported
this sounds tight
we in rf freight would probably use something like this to let our clients set up courier contracts directly from our trip calculator prefilled with values a very good idea that i have wanted for some time for security reasons the contract should be finalized ingame

covert cynos can only used by blacktopsshuppoteed
yeahlets make recon ships obsolete as well as command ships
i dont think this is really necessary id rather see cynohotdrop whatever mechanics improved first
i dont mind if ccp does this but only after nerfing cynosthere should be some delay between cyno start and ships appearing it should not be 3 secondsand there needs to be a short range mobile cyno jammer
so you get bubble immune ships that can warp cloaked and pop covert cynossounds like something eve really needs if and only if the ability to pop covert cynos conflict with bubble immunity and even then it should be a hassle and a half to pull it off fittings wise

oh no hired goons bumping treads with counter support guess i should support this one thenhmm why the heck would anyone bump a thread he doesnt support
i dont really the rounds stuff it sucks my screen so much
i would prefer it if they would just remove passwords all together to be honest if your not in the alliance then you dont in the pos shield or get to use the jump bridgeother than that your proposal is just another thing that encourages nap trains
yeah but seeing 700 ships lag out looks cooler than seeing 300 ships lag outmake dreadnoughts useful for shooting other capitol ships making them more agile with a bit better ship to ship dps should accomplish thisjust make a station a really big pos i think blowing up someone elses station would be pretty awesome personally also if a group of players can set up a station it makes sense that a group of players should be able to take one down in theory you could track the amount of stations that go up each month and calculate a time when ever nullsec planet has a station around iti like the lets get rid of jump bridges solution that keeps getting kicked aroundagain getting rid of jump bridges would reduce the ease of just shipping in everything from jita also ccp could just add on numerically more nullsec stars on the edge of the mapsure why notthis could be another good role for a dreadnought to encourage people to fly emthis would help 00 industry

some site i remember a while a go had disemvoweling as a punishment for crap posts in that case it was only for their posts instead of deleting them outright that was kinda fun
the best punishment is a bit of code which means that any posts or topics created by the  cannot be seen by anybody else on the forum he can still see make posts and topics and can see his own so he wouldnt even know anything had happened see how long such a person keeps obliviously talking to himself

who cares about static plexes nowadays anywayand dynamic plexes dont use the keys everything is unlocked or can be unlocked just by killing stuff
key is not a problemproblem is when you can just permatank in last room and keep collecting the lootlow level plex loot is not expensive or anything so economy is not going to fall however this is annoying and it is extremely ridiculous that eve still has this kind of content in there at least it isnt really promoting this new quality thinking much
i agree that all command ships need a review
looks obvious
this no thumbs up for just the nighthawk
powergrid is not only issue with nighthawk but certain other caldari ships also like cerberus theyre hard to equip with micro warpdrive when buffer tanking while equally buffer tanked minmatar ships are just fine since autocannons dont take so much powergridthis probably leads back in history when missiles always hit and you could fit multiple micro warpdrives but after countless nerf this and thati doubt it ever gets fixed
having gotten used to the flow of incursions ive noticed a few things the pickup group mechanic is working really well  and im really glad it is ive been in some really nice pickup fleets and had a lot of fun both just being a member and actually leading them people from corps that dont know each other and occasionally even from corps that hate each other are actually coming together and enjoying working alongside each other in fleets this is awesome people love vanguard sites vanguard sites ideally take ten people and ten people is a very cool number in eve  its easy to find people with leadership skills for this many people and its fairly easy to accumulate a fleet that size quickly vanguard sites are also easy to build for and arent a huge investment of time  they take about as long as a level 4 mission and have a decent payout for the time investment some vanguard sites are way more fun than others specifically im talking about the nation commander outpost these are very popular and if theres one available itll almost always be occupied very quickly this is mostly because its pure combat  theres no need to worry about logistics towers or mining there arent very many of these or at least if there are they get done so fast that i dont see them the mining outpost site is less popular due to the mininghauling aspect of the mission but its still 90 combat and all you need is a ship with one mining laser or five mining drones so noone complains all that much the override transfer array is the least popular of all and its not hard to see why  without playing the hacking minigame it becomes very much harder or sometimes even impossible to complete the combat section and including a hacking ship in your lineup either requires that you drop your dps or cut into your rewards when you look at most vanguard systems a few hours after the incursion shows up therell be a lot of override transfer arrays that people have just left there and very few other sitestherefore my proposal is twofold increase the frequency of already existing purecombat vanguard sites more nation commander outposts make more purecombat vanguard site types obviously we want to keep variety as a factor so having more purecombat sites to choose from when spawning them would also be cool
was great flying with you good team work and very efficientalso increasing van sites is a very good idea
just to clarify these missiles would require a lock to fire so if you are jammed you simply can not fire more until you are no longer jammed it would work like normal missiles just without the wasted salvos because of the delay heck my idea was not to boost drakes i wanted to make a raven long range missile combat useful i dont care if it is going to be only included with cruiser missiles group i would be happy
hes suggesting that your idea is illconceived since incursions are by definition short conflicts if the npcs were going to take over a system it would be an invasion not an incursioni like the idea of npcs being able to claim sovereignty since that means wed be able to take it back from them
mara rinn ok i got it now so then they should come out with some new pach where they try to take over the empires bc that will bring a whole new life to eve
that would suck the life out of eve
goose99 how would it suck the life out of eve
turning empire to npc null with stations roids and everything else being the same along with incursion penalties lolsec now with even lower population
heh yeah id forgotten about treaties good catch 
please do this right awayid allso like to see something like fleet bonuses only beeing applied from an active command ship on gridgood way to reduce size of sov capping fleets is to make it a capital ships job buff capitals through the roof in dps and hp  but virtually unable to harm subcapitals witch means subcap fleet can gtfo the tcu and roamcamp gates like they should do while the fewer more powerful capitals can eat structures and other capitals without the 1000 drakes crashing the server every time they shoot a missile
artifficial limits like that will accomplish absolutly nothing  it will only anyjoy poeple while your idea is noble  your implementation sucks
low sec
this would lead to a problem in lowsec with spider tanking around gate guns going unpunished
i think thats a great idea it would be nice on an ipad or android os to work on tablets and phones

oh man if they made a guardian dominix kind of like the guardian vexor that would ruleactually making t3 battleships subsystems and all would be pretty nifty
hmmm lets seebattleships arent supposed to be more affordable than classes smaller than thembattleships can reach way more firepower and range than the classes below thembattleships are used plenty often i see them demolish drake blobs all the timewhat are you smoking it must be good can i have some

csm are aware 00 is brokenccp are aware 00 is brokenplayers are aware 00 is brokenso why are we getting new stuff when 00 a major part of the game is broken and dislikedim not going to get in another discussion on whats wrong ccp csm major alliances are well aware of all the issues since the problems now so obvious that ccp even commented on the fail in the csm minutesfix timers make it faster and easier to capture space make it so small gang warfare is needed for sov warfare and blob warfare supercaps and caps for structure warsremove current sov structures like tcus sbus etc and make the sov upgrades be created in a stationsov warfare needs to be fast paced action thats fun different types of strategy not numbers  alllow sec is dead because there isnt any real need to be therein hi sec you are your own boss and know what you want and whenwhs mix of lowsec hisec and interesting risk00 is numbers blues and botsif sov could be captured with a beacon like item flag which can be put online in 3 hours or so there would be more wars more hostility more actionimagine the following changessov structures like tcu  sbu removed stations now control the bonuses of a system station also grants new bonuses too and have the best services in the game race dependant ofcsov warfare is as simple as anchoring a beacon which is 500m3 at a planet if the beacon isnt destroyed after 3 hours the system will swap to the beacon alliancewhen a beacon is placed the alliance who claims ownership of that space is informed they can either destroy the beacon which has 2 mil hp or ignore it and move onalliances can place as many beacons as they want and the beacon appears to all on the overviewdue to fast pace action and with sov flipping every few hours numbers would have little effect as an alliance can move fast to a different locationsupercap blobbing wouldnt work as alliances can move around fast this fixes the jump bridge issue too which can now be kept as it is since there would be very little need to travel far i know supercaps dont use jump bridges but my comment was also todo with titan jump bridgesif this was implemented all you would see is continuous combat new alliances in 00 not the same nc vs it vs drf crap we have seen for the past 4 years if someone dies they can form their own alliance and anchor beacons freelypolitics will still be there as there will be alot of sov flipping and wars occurringtimers are the source of inactivity boredom and blobbing in eve fix and change the timers and we might actually see 00 become fun againofc there should be more incentives for holding space nowas for blobs they will be needed to destroy structures or claim stations which will now have features such are stargate deactivation system wide effects similar to whs etc as well as buffing a system they can also nerf like cyno jamming or reduce the rate of npc spawning etctheres a lot of ways 00 can be fun again and have all issues fixed yet we dont see or hear anything on 00 apart from we are aware there is a problem
the csm continue to push for promised iteration on existing game mechanics there are a number of larger issues that ccp need to address  00 lowsec factional warfare missions mining the list goes onwhilst ccp are at least addressing some of the quick fixes players have asked for it seems due to the focus on avatar environments etc unlikely that 00 will be properly looked at for some time yet
whats wrong with poss this is a question of how corps are able to avoid war decs isnt it the op could destroy the pos hes writing about if it werent for the corp who owns it cleaning the war decs by joining and leaving an alliancewindjammer
yes but its an interaction with pos mechanics theres a lot of support for a real overhaul of poss and this might get folded in with that or used as another example of posrelated things that need to be fixedi apologize if insufficient serum caffeine levels rendered me susceptible to imprecise languageupdate i got some emails confused so i actually didnt get an answer about this loophole i actually asked and received an answer about another gamedesign question i have reasked the question

edit too angry p 3 csm
i rather liked the new neocom myself but deciding not to deploy something is not the same as removing it by a long shotill see if i can get a more detailed explanation but the most likely reason is a resourceallocation issue the feature needed more work before wide deployment and there were other ui changes that were of higher priority
firstly the new neocom was only going to be available as a beta featuresecondly there was an issue discovered on sisi that caused its release to tq to be delayed we havent had any information about when this is going to make a reappearance hopefully when it is readywe should be thankful that ccp were willing to focus on making it work correctly rather than as happened with various things in the past releasing a known broken feature
im more upset about the fact that employee pet projects are now being touted as expansion contentits find to have employees working on stuff like this on the side but please dont announce it publicly unless you have the full intention of including it into the finished product
features forum discussion threadwould it not be a good idea if there was some way to allow the creative community to expand the mission content in some waythe thread above is the discussion that was started yesterday and im not posting here in order to gain a wider viewpoint as well as the likely ccp outcome via the csm would beis such a programme possible would it not only be widely used but generate good quality missions for inclusion in to the game without squandering ccps time and efforts in creating pve missionsany and all feedback welcome
it would be used to create the mission with the best hidden tricks for a fast completion or to get high level reward it you kill that building that has nothing to do with the mission but drop faction modules not a good idea
ok so i am sure at one time or another we have all shown our friends the dominion trailer to try and impress them with eve the idea of hundreds of players getting together to have a massive battle sounds really exciting until you get into what blob warfare is really like so here is a question what is it that makes blob warfare badid bet its because of the whole calling primary focus fire thing it makes a lot of sense that if you want to drop someone fast you have everyone fire on one target and if you get in a fight the fleet that calls primaries will beat the fleet that doesnt every time but it starts to mean that you as an individual matter less and less it doesnt matter how much dps you do if a hundred people are all firing at the same ship it doesnt matter how good your tank is because if you get noticed youll pop its kind of like playing elementary school dodge ball except with laserstry to imagine a fleet fight without everybody shooting the biggest thing on grid then the second biggest then the third etc imagine if a fleet fight was actually a series of simultaneous smaller engagements more like what we saw in the dominion trailer or really any other scifi out therethe actual proposalmake the four damage types faction specific each race does primarily one damage type and is vulnerable to the damage type of their lore specific enemyok so for example lets say that since amarr shoot lasers they would primarily do thermal damage then minmatar use guns which could be primarily kinetic then since amarr and minmitar hate each other according to the eve lore amarr armor could be vulnerable to primarily kinetic instead of explosive that it is now and minmitar shields could be vulnerable to thermal rather than em then caldari missiles would do explosive damage and em is all thats left so i guess gellente hybrids do em now then caldari are weak vs em and gellente are weak to explosive so their resists wouldnt really need to change at allok so now imagine that you get in a big blob fight with two mixed race fleets and while calling primary would still technically work it wouldnt be as economical as everyone picking targets based on what their weapons work best against in theory a really coordinated fleet could have 4 fcs each calling 4 sets of primaries for each race but honestly i dont think most people could keep up with thatthe really interesting thing is what this would do to solo fights since the faction damage vulnerabilities mirror each other rather than a paper scissors rock set up every solo fight would be fair lets say someone in a drake is flying solo in lowsec or something he runs into a hurricane and they go at it since they both tank each others damage fairly well theyd have a fair if slow fight then lets say the drake runs into a brutix they are now more vulnerable to each others damage and the fight will be fair but now its going to be over very fastalso lets say you are in a gate camp or something and an amarr battleship shows up all of the minmitar campers are going to get a bit more worried than everyone else because they know that if the amarr bs pilot is smart theyll get shot at firstthis would make people care about who their faction hates because if you run into your factions rival in space then the fight is going to be over faster and therefore a bit more dangerous so what are your thoughts blob warfare good bad why
fiddling with damage types would do nothing for fleetblob warfare in eve a wounded opponent still produces full or nearfull damage output thus if your damage typefocused fleet wounds half of an enemy fleet while said enemy fleet annihilates a quarter of your fleet  youre losing your damage output is dropping far faster than theirs even if this werent the case alpha will still be king first its far easier to call primaries rather than let individual pilots  who often wont know wtf theyre doing  have a go at shooting whatever they wish second damage types are inconsequential for many priority targets nobody cares about the resists on random ecm boat they care that random ecm boat is being melted within three seconds of the engagementyes yes being part of a fleet means being a mere cog in a great machine thats kind of the point theres a reason fcs are titled fcs  they command you obey or not but if thats the case enjoy the failboatas for solo combat itd change little ship attributes pilot skill which has nothing to do with game mechanics modules and setting all have far more to do with victory or defeat than damage typesnow all that said im still kind of annoyed that glorious amarrian lasers are so freakin predictable to tank against compared to certain factions what with their three or even four damage types pah
i think people need to actually stick with one meaning of blob and i dont think the problem is blobbing people get baited all the time then hotdropped and dont complain so why should people complain in 00i believe what people have an issue with is number warfare but can you really blame alliance and coalitions from playing the nap gamewith the exception of roams every other type of pvp combat in 00 is slow when things are slow it allows people to form numbers because of how slow things are people have the chance to plan well in advance numbers that will last 5 mins in combattimers are so stupid i mean look at 00 today it are dead yet are still on the map because enemies will have to spend several weeks ing on timers why the hell would ccp think this was funthen if we look at standing coalitions like nc or drf they will be inactive until something goes in reinforced which is only when they will log in where they can match any opposition with numbersin short timers are the source of all issues d and because of these long annoying timers people put alot of effort into blobbing the systemccp need to make sov warfare fast paced and do something about those ty timers because right now 00 coalitions are mass producing supercaps and anchoring stations in other words sov warfare  supercaps  timers warfare which is why people like me are so bitter in 00 and get more enjoyment cleaning the house than invading somethingseriously though how do the csm feel about timers
to a single player 4 players is a blob to 3 players 10 players is a blob no one is going to play this game fair if they can win by outnumbering an opponent the game is complicated enough without some damage type scheme

despite people forgetting to check the box and some confused people i dont see any negative views on the neo neocom in this thread oo
oh god definitely when i first saw this i got pretty excited but they shelved it cmon ccp please

9999 of the time these modules are considered useless due to taking up a mid slot the fittings needed to fit them and the relatively negligable boost they give to overall capacitor performance i suggested awhile back that they should be buffed to be immune to energy neutralizers energy neutralizers needed a direct counter since the nosferatu nerf but many players think that counter is capacitor injectors which is fallacious thinkinglarge capacitor battery iicap increase  700 gjcpu  100 tfpg  275 mwthe change would give the fitting ship 700 gj of cap protection no skills to increase this no skills added or changed at allnow this wouldnt provide a massive amount of cap to say an apocalypse however 700 gj being entirely immune to energy neutralizers would significantly increase the viability of said apocalypse in a great many scenariosthis change would not effect nosferatu modules directly
no this is just a nerf to amarr recons injectors are the defense to nueting you got the time it takes for youre cap charges to run out to kill the attacker and even when capped out you still got the drones for defence
immunity for the full value of a battery is way too much
why ships that need that cap are still going to use it up and if they dont want to use it up they will need an injector anyway you could always fit some nos and just empty your cap with the neuts and drain them anywaybecause curse and pilgrim are the only ships that ever fits neutsand armor reps are the defense to damage so why do we have resistance modules and bonuses as well as platesever try killing something with lasers when being neuted
take a look in the less than 1 week old thread on this exact proposal for my pve sacrilege that will be a pvp god with this implementedfull value is too much even 25 is borderline criminal
theres no need for extremes i can kill a sacrilege without fitting a single neut most of my pvp ships dont use neutsthe cap protection is a strong feature but its niche it wouldnt be general purposeanyway ccp can put it in for a month and see how it plays out even if it will have unexpected results theres really no way for it to become godlikeedit one reason i push for this idea is because i personally dislike passive tanking and want to see more active tanking in eve right now passive tanks dominate on all subbattleship levels this new feature would give active tanks an edge in pvp
reallythis would give an apoc the cap of a cruiser when fully nueted which means it could fire a few guns or rep itself a bit
im not going to hunt for anything for you you bring it to the table if you want to use it to support your pointnone of this would be game breaking not even for ships that use neuts traditionally all it would do is add to the viability of cap dependent ships and setups in general pvp
this change would make frigates fitting a cap battery 100 immune to neuts and would make cruisers fitting large cap batteries extraordinarily powerful in the face of neuting it would be a huge nerf to amarr recons and any ship which relies extensively on neutsthis is a horribly bad idealiang
most ships would not be fitting neuts most frigates would not be fitting neuts the days when 1 heavy neut is a free get out of jail card against tackler frig are over
i hear battleships are all the rage these days having a battleship allows you to go anywhere without any fear of danger i hear i hear that heavy neut will totally protect you against a frigate that has a small nos i hear that the 24 second cycle time on heavy neuts makes them awesome against frigs ephemeron did you sell your account to someone that doesnt know how to pvpliang
until you elaborate on this and back it up im not paying any attention to what you say
the noctis looking real it looks like its made out of multi colored playdoh lol the caldari ships look real who would waste a million isk for a paint job that will get blasted to bits the first time the armor takes damage oh wait galente would btw irl i saw this crown victoria with a green and brown baby poop gradient high gloss paint job all i could think was wow that looks so galente im not trollinghonest i just think the caldari theme works well imho
caldari ships should look fugly ehcondor kestrel merlin heron hookbill caracal tengu drake ferox rokh charon and all caldari capital ships dont look fugly at all are they less practical then bantam moa blackbird and ospreyfugly ships are a clear minority so i guess caldaris do care about the appearance of their ships id rather say the moa and blackbird are obvious attempts at making ugly ships
lol if a caldari ship take armor damage a million isk would be the last thing the pilot worry about 
in my opinion while they dont necessarily need a redo i would like the textures to be updated if you compare the new ships to the old ones its almost like comparing the new tron to the old oneok exaggeration somewhat
caldari are proof positive that the form over function philosophy of ship design ignores the most cardinal laws of physicsif a spaceship is going to be utilitarian it would still have to be mass balanced aka symmetrical utilitarian is in the details not the overall form
all ships are due for reskins over time as previously statedand hopefully theyll think on this proposal as they do itmissile launch graphic updatesupport this proposal if youd like to see an upgrade from the poof missile launch from the middle of ships to something more reasonable if you think youd like to see a similar fix like the fighterbomber fix mention that in your post the proposal is directly related to skin issues with many ships not just caldari use missiles
i think slaves should be freed without standing gain its kinda expected in the factions that dont like slavery in addition you should spend some isk andor effort to free themim thinking something like the slaves would need vaccines for the vitoc running through their system which is available through pi and maybe a marginal isk expenditure to allow them to learn their way back into societyi was working on this a bit ago and came up with this very basic document which outlines the possibilities feedback is still welcomed as theres a long way before this becomes an honest proposal and even longer before implementationsupported
been requested and ignored many times but yeah maybe well finally get lucky
actually buying or redeeming slaves in order to free them is a beautiful thing how many abolitioners bought slaves with their own treasure for this very purpose i further support the small boost in standing but i believe once they are freed they are stuck livig in your cargo hold until you can find a station willing to accept newly freed immigrants

ive suggested this before so pleased to support again
you would need to remove them as npc commodities they are still sold i think first unless you want people to be able to buy standings which you dont riiight alternately instead of standings an rp angle could be used news bulletins at certain benchmarks and when x benchmarks globally is reached a series of actual ccp rp articles about the new life similar to what was seen post9thgenemancipationeither way anything that reunites the rpg to the mmo has my vote
thanksyeah i agree that there are many different uses for this ability and i hope it is something ccp would consider as it would allow us to develop our own tools without ccp having to develop any new uis
down with stylefascism i refuse to wear a shirt
sure thing
if they make it rated m this game will probly become over populated with 5 year olds who think we should add space elves or something also on that note please make it so we dont have to wear pants
thats a nice idea and would really spice things up unfortunately the current owners of high profit moons simply will not tolerate it and they can get quite vocal good idea as well but again the large empires expect their space to be defendable by a giant blob rolling around the necessity of patrolling space and engaging into small gang warfare is not gonna be accepted easily
nothing make me feel worse than have to agree with goon
i think that a rearrangeable watchlist fleet would be a nice feature since people are often dropping out of fleet due to server related problems its a pain in the ass to get the right order in your watchlist id like to see move upmove down buttons or an option in the context menu that lets you rearrange watchlist entries a drag  drop watchlist would be awesome but not necessary this might be a minor change for a lot of players but people that are logistic pilots might welcome this with open arms
also increase number of ppl allowed on list

indeed while for a long time ive moaned about the nhs anaemic pg the entire class of field cs is now broken and needs a rework
woot
this the whole command ship lineup needs a review with the nighthawk and eos being the most egregious examplesid say something about the astarte but people arent even trying to fly that ony more
im planning to fly one so they better fit it
i agree as well bb
i think a new module would be better or even an anchorable bubble that stops ships being able to cloak inside it but then we would also need the removal of local or delayed to go along with it
i see no problem with this now that its been editedthough in practice it may prove useless as most cloakers dont want to be that close anyway however the ones that want t be in scram range as opposed to just disruptor range will be hindered which isnt necessarily a bad thing
ships deserve at least as much customization as avatars since they are the real star of eve
i wanna fly around in the typical sauser ship differently sized for the different classes  so hell yes let us shange the look of our ships
after the fact thank you ccp for actually fixing it it wasnt particularly fast and it wasnt broken to begin with and i did have to delete all my settings completely to fix it all the way at the end but you did fix it which is more than you theoretically have to do so genuinely thank you for that
the drones engage target command needs to be right clickable on the icons and the overview instead of just the little drone dialog box and the little plus signs on the battlefield as well
1 so they arent fof but some new kind of missiles ok2 you want to boost missiles no wasted salvoes is a neat increase in damage what will be the drawbackless damage for missilea special launcher with higher fitting requirementslower speednothing it should be a missile buffso far you seem to want only the last option a free buffit that is the idea i want a special ammunition for my blasters with a shotgun effect if i miss the first targets i should do half damage to all enemy targets in a 5 km radius from himperfectly balanced
one of the major reasons people still play eve is because there isnt any decent competing sandbox people either quit playing or play until something good comes outworld of darkness will kill eve imo i mean bitter s have been waiting for 00 to get fixed for years well before dominion and now we find out that unlikely that 00 will be properly looked at for some time yeti cant wait to see the 2 expansions in 2012 no doubt with ccps track record it will be new stuff no one cares about or wanted and old stuff will still be broken
another way you should look at it is if timers were increased 10 times more than they are so stations and poses take over a week to come out of reinforcedwhat would happen to the population of 00 then would it increase or decrease waiting for timers suck but you may as well quit obviously ccp dont care and the priorities for the next 3 expansions will most likely be incarna dust and wodbut you are right the problem with 00 atm is the timers and so much time is given that allows players to blob sov warfare should be limited to fast small gang pvp structure warfare should be limited to blobsif they made it so outposts were the only things that could make supercaps people would fight over them where as sov would be about epeen much like why space is needed nowi mean lets face it major alliances have so much space within their influence unclaimed what they use for systems they have are jump bridges moon goo and csaas sure people can npc for hours but thats not the reason people ever claim spacestations should affect supercap production jump bridges and bonuses in systems this way people will fight over themsov should affect moon goo and epeen but should be limited to small gang warfare meaning fast action where sov can flip as little as every few hours
obvious reply18 months
to be fair it seems that common a problem that increasing the cooldown time of a wardec carrying over to a corp leaving a decced alliance should be upped to 48 or even 72 hours no need to mess with pos mechanics im sure that would make many at ccp people happy not to say that they dont need looking at in the futre as far as this issue is concerned and it might encourage a bit more of a fight rather than flight response
but here comes the problem enemy is going to shoot it when you are not online so basically if you want your asset to be safe you must have a consistent number of pilots logged in at any time this has never been a requirement and cannot be the current paradigm is that you dont have to play necessarily outside your primetime if you want to defend your stuff either we change this but it may soud quite harsh or just accept that having stuff in space that can be destroyed or damaged at anytime while you are away is not a good mechanic shooting station services or pos modules has always been possible its just very boring and i hope were looking for a totally different mechanic in my opinion a possible solution is to have several multiple small objectives around many systems in that situation travel time becomes important and an attacking fleet would be better to split into smaller groups so that they spend much less time warping around systems if there is no or little resistance but having small objectives with little hps means that they rely on active protection to survive or on invisibilitythe point of the original post is this in eve the security of stuff in space is achieved only though active protection andor firepower andor ehps andor reinforcement timers and this design has some clear limitations what if we add visibility to this scheme ie structures that become probeable only for random time intervals during the day of course those structures must be cheap and easy to set up and their visibility time must be tweaked so that it is profitable anyway to run them even if the enemy destroys it but the certainty that on aerage it will run undetected for a sufficient amount of time to amortize the cost is enoughthis is a pretty general concept with a lot of potential that comes true very seldomly in eve just thanks to the sandbox for example ninja moon mining ninja lowsec mission running ninja stuff in general its just trading efficiency for having less visibility thus gaining security why cant this become a well rooted mechanic in the game instead with great profit
lets have a look at this csm term obviously some csm will want a free iceland trip again will want to apply to become csm againlets have a breakdown on what the csm have achieved this term please note we had a discussion with ccp about xxx doesnt count because those discussions stop at discussions and nothing really ever changes unless you count the 5 min forum timer being 2 minso minus the micro transaction drama what have the csm done to help improve the game this term
i totally agree with you 100   and to be honest im not being 100 fair in saying there has been no csm coverage since you guys might not even know its been pulledthis quote popped up today and quoteccp explorerit has not yet been rescheduled for another iteration thats all i can say for now this was a project done in free time and the feedback was negative so we removed the codethis make it sound at least like it not being pulled for polish or that they are even going to fouc at all on the ui as a player i would of been ok with we deiced it wasnt good but we will be working on a different neocom for the next expansion or well release it when its readybut sadly it really seems like they are just dont with it also on the note of there might be an exploit with the neo neocom there was this quotealso in agreement that advertising a feature that isnt ready as a main feature of an expansion was kinda shady but it worked and i think started from scratch is a horrible move  i mean if it was the look of thing wouldnt be better to just change the graphics of it so it looks identical to the current ui as a graphic artist i know the look of the ui is just graphics that can be replaced
your disappointment doesnt properly take into account ccps statementsphilosophy about the delivery of some elements of the game in experimental mode as was described in a dev blog awhile back when stuff is included as experimental you have to assume there is a possibility it may be removed for whatever reason whether temporarily or permanently as for your belief that changing the ui involves nothing more than changing the art it is apparently a whole lot more complicated than that in eve for a variety of technical reasons as was mentioned in the june summit minutes
tongue in check maybe but you know what im saying play sanshas stop messing with me and my fleet of 85 miners we pay the rent in that house and car you cant afford

do we really need ingame treaties i mean seriously doesnt it work fine with oog measure so far i can see a lot of alliedbluedwhatever space on the maps without a single treaty option so far
yes people would create missions with their own loot table and rewards nothing to do with the fact that the story writer would have any control over the total bounty or the loot tablethe important aspect is getting an interesting story with the most applicable rats available both faction wise and ai levelshould level 1 missions be harder  ie could a new character understand a shield transfer npc and in order to complete the mission to take out the logi ship before the bigger shipwouldnt you like more of a range of missions
this was at a fanfest one year about walking in stationsplayer made inspace missions you could create yourselfthey went on to say you could create npcs in stations that would have dialog trees that lead to the missions you made this would make player made missions somethign you had to get out and walk around to find but i think that was a cool idea since it would make player made missions special without replacing or forcing normal agents into a feature some players might not ever use
my personal opinionpreserving the trend of development that now is ccp slowly kills eve as a project and inkarna will not help in no shape or formexperience of game 18 yeardear yours
alright folks whats next any news from ccp i guess theyre busy putting the pieces back together to what they call eve in order to harves excuse me to serve their customershave a nice day laxps i still love this emulation of a forumcharacter may only support each topic once  ok i removed the tick may i post my reply nowyou are going too fast wait two minutes and try again i guess not
still very little excellence ccp the continues breaking of the game by reintroducing a load of bugs each expansionseriously i dread expansion days often im always wondering what will be broken when i log on the first time

wow four pages of boob comments the capsuleers of new eden must really be concerned about thiswar on droop
way to show that you actually have no answers to any of the criticisms of your idea
supported
all of your criticism as you call it  have been brought up in the previous 14 pages which you obviously havent read  and have been addressed  but somehow you assume that gaping hole in your head can spout it out better than those who have brought up those issues before note in the previous 14 pages  it was stated  the csm voted to bring the issue to ccp  they brought the issue to ccp  ccp said yes there seems to be a problem and we will take a closer look at it said discussion has been long over for months  we eagerly await ccps look at it  the bump to the thread was a friendly reminder to ccp the issue hasnt gone awayso in short  your criticisms have been heard before and noted  and the issue still passed and went to ccp  so you can rest better so in the future  please try to read a thread in its entirety before you put in your 2 cents where its already been given by numerous others  save your money  theres a recession out there

i believe they are already doing plenty but they cant tell us everything because then they tell the botters everything but more effort in this direction couldnt hurti think they should look at people who are online and doing stuff whether its ratting mining market activity and so on for 235 hours a day 7 days a week no one can survive on 30 mins sleep certainly not for several days so they are either botting or account sharing either way its a violation of the eula and i would have thought could be an easy win even if it means botters only bot for 16 hours a day every little helps
yes please  gief new ui
not supportedneocom is fine as it isif they ever fix the real reasons for why the ui is a cluster then i will support this new neocom will not do this
idea is simple you made a courier contract ie and forgot what you did put in or the contract gets failedgive the owner of the contract the same overview for the contracts like in the window before you create it you should be able to see what you did put into the contract
tbh thats putting it lightly this idea is terrible enough that i cant reply to it because the whole post would just be censored out by the forum
cruisers fitting large cap batteries are sacrificing whatever else they need to actually perform reasonably well or do you have some kind of godship example waiting in eft you want to sharei already did but you dont need to post any morebut to humor you ships that need cap injectors to fight neuts needed cap injectors anyway or are you also one of those people that wants the curse to stay the second most versatile pvp ship in the game behind the drake simply because it can cap out any other sub capital in the game without any effort or skill at all
passive tanks would still be superior people prefer them due to the current pvp environment of gang warfare active tanks would make not much sense there even if you didnt need any cap at all for reppingbesides youd need to fit cap battery  injector to get any sort of use from it on cruiser size vessels given you need slots for propulsion and tackle as well its not gonna work out
ok im not gonna push it further ill just say that people who are opposed to the idea greatly overestimate the impact of this module on general purpose pvpi think any change to the game es off some group of people but ccp still do it even when its something as horrible as the great nano nerf or the nos nerf  that had much stronger opposition ccp heard the idea thats all that matters now
people dont fit neuts to have a good fight usually so any chance a player might be able to not instantly become helpless when neuted down is like asking them to give up killmails
they are the only ship to specialise in it as the primary purpose of the ship yes i also tried killing things while sensor damped tracking distrupted jammed it is all annoying but it is what seperates the small gang from the blob without these its just blob warfare on a smaller scale
and neither of them will be nerfed all that much if this does happenyes i also tried killing things while sensor damped tracking distrupted jammed it is all annoying but it is what seperates the small gang from the blob without these its just blob warfare on a smaller scalesensor boosters offer sensor damp resistance tracking computers offer tracking disruptor resistance eccm offers jamming resistance but there is nothing to offer energy neut resistance and cap injectors are not neut counters no matter how many times anyone says it cap injectors are critical in plenty of setups before the possibility of being neuted is even addressed
it is more useful to just fit capacitor booster on medium slot ships which actually need something against neutralizers active shield tank cannot spare a medium slot for thatcarriers and dreads are just another story they should really be immune to ewar too
if cruisers are fitting battleship sized mod could there be a problem nah i dont think so dua rebalance cap batteries can it get any more obvious and in pvp scenario cap booster will always be more usefull then a cap battery espeshially considering the fact that batteries take an enormous portion of cpusupport and rebalance cap batteries
and that is why this is going to fall flat on its face ah rules are very simple do research prior to making a suggestionproposalthis specific topic was raised about a year ago i believe and currently has a live thread in fiand yes eph you are such a pvp god being able to kill a hac using a draketengu  scimi as you stated in the other thread  not sure what moron in a sacrilege you expect to attack a ship where the passive recharge equalsexceeds the maximum theoretical damage output but whatever floats your boat it is not just a huge hit to amarr recons but amarr in general as they generally do not have the midslots to spare and when they do use cap mods its an injector to keep the guns firingthe suggestion does absolutely nothing other than remove one of the last counters larger ships have against smaller  leaving only more dudes and ecmin short not only a bad suggestion but entirely unnecessary
if you are going to argue for or against something you have to back up your statementsthats great so the sac being overpowered is a reason not to fix something that is broken for every ship in the game maybe that is a reason to fix the sachow can it be a huge hit to fit exactly the way you always have and gain nor lose any effectiveness doing it maybe the myth that everyone in a pvp ship must always fit tackle to get kills can finally dieit doesnt remove neutralizers from being effective do you expect most ships to fit these and if they do what arent they fitting even with this buff there are a lot of setups that a cap battery simply wont work on and plenty of ships dont need cap protected to begin with the simple fact of the matter is cap batteries are useless right now most of the time this change makes them useful but not overpoweredif you want to totally cap someone out fit nos with your neuts and cap yourself out to make it happen
i dont like this unless the curse and pilgrim get some sort of batterypenetration of 100
heres the old thread linkagelots of good ideas in itbut a rightclick to free option is not balanced enough imho unless theres a rightclick to enslave in amarrspacebut im still for implementing an enslavementrehabilitation program via pi manufacturing or whatevermake slaves militants scientists janitors etc useful
youre a ing minmatar how could you condone slavery after all the crap the amarrians put your people throughroleplaying time overanyways i support getting the option to free a slave rather than trash them
a toggle button for this when you have two accounts and find yourself in an amarr station the singing makes me turn all sound off and with the shortcut for remove sound being bugged its kind of annoying to have no sound half the time
self support
well it would be nice if we could fix the sound ourselves like switch it to something else i dont know how hard it would be what do you think ccp
i bet when you change it amarr will become a more popular market hub than jita
freighter get a disadvantage by learning the navigation skill as the max sub warp speed is higher they need longer to get into warp get freighter pilots a bit of speed back by a autopilot skilllvl 0  20 km range to gatelvl 1  16 kmlvl 2  12 kmlvl 3  8 kmlvl 4  4 kmlvl 5  0 kmganking game mechanic would be still possible but when the freighter uncloaks and aligns to the next gateeither implement it into the freighter skill itself or as a single skill or let the freighter simple warp from 50 max speed not 75
yes hauling stuff needs to be easier at the moment it is too much effort with freighters and jfs because you actually have warp manually if you wont want the ap to spend half a day slowboating the game clearly needs to get better at playing without player inputnot supportedalso webs and your complaint has nothing to do with your proposal
this is all well and good but im pretty sure that ships with identical mass and inertial modifier reach warp at the same time this is because the speed needed is always 75 of max velocity and the formula works in a way that the faster ship will also accelerate faster this basicly means differences in sub warp speed have no relevance in determining your time to reach warp its the inertial modifier and mass that counts
hm i havent thought of that well it was a secondary proposal anywayas for the charmin sarahi am sorry  did i take away your argument of not beeing able to gank freighters must be pretty hard to only be able to think of only one argument and then fallback into mocking the proposal either bring something constructive or keep out this is not a thing of the game is to hard for me its just a proposal
you should be happy the autopilot even exists its the only officially supported macro mechanism that lets you do stuff automaticallyafk giving people who are actively flying their ships an advantage over the afk crowd is more than fair
lol with all those passive income the game might as well play itselfwait its hardly a game at that1
only a fool uses autopilot on a freighter hauling billions of isk worth of cargonot supportedwtz ftw
some freighter hunters wait for the freighters not autopiloting as those are usually the juiciest ones
why not
that wont happen since its a crappier system than what we have now and nap train whinage is an emotional outburst and not an argument against this idea a more realistic alternative to your idea is a standings based system used in addition to a password system where the user decides if he wants to use either standings password or both as a requirement to gain access to the facility that would allow better ease of use in most cases so people wouldnt have to remember and insert passwords in most cases and still retain the ability to allowlimit the access people have to certain sites by allowing the placing of an optional password requirement but until ccp is willing to delve in to the bottomless cespool known as the pos system and actually fix things something like what the op proposes would make things a bit more convenient in the meantime
i posted a pretty comprehensive and longtechnical sovereignty00 proposal awhile ago the last post in that thread is a barebones outline in case the main proposal is too long the shortest version is i can manage is more sand for the sandbox that is eve

not that much logistics pilots in here eh
 yes
not exactly the first time this is proposed together with a load of other stuff for watchlist it should be drag and drop btwbut also want besides this more people in watch list ccp said it wont happen and either groups in your watch list or ship types
yes this would be great the current watchlist is way too spartan i understand not getting more people on the watchlist cause of performance reasons but it should still be modernised a bit
i dont like that idea either there should still be some broadcast discipline involved like not spamming broadcast after a bomber attack unless you are attacked by something other than bombs this shouldnt be taken away from fleet combat
fsck yes eves healing ui sucks and add current capacitor to the list too
i want cheaper boosters
i thought the ferox already did this lol ferox 
thanks for this gotta put it on our list of things to fix 
right now alliances can only build a single outpost per system this seems like an arbitrary restriction we should remove this restriction and allow alliances to burn their money how they pleasethere are obvious benefits to allowing multiple outposts in systems refineryconstruction as well as allowing smaller alliances to become more condensed within smaller areas or rented spacei know this topic only applies to like 2 of the players in the game but it seems like a relatively easy restriction to lift id appreciate if a csm candidate would propose this to ccp
supported only if theres a way to destroy outposts
now that would certainly help small alliances with one or two outposts about the op i dont think its time yet many systems still dont have stations let it populate a bit and then we could talk about multiple outposts in a system
i think there should be a limit of one outpost per constellation personally
nowai if you look at 00 now and at its state 2 years ago you will realize the outpost spam is already getting ridiculous not at least in part because it is impossible to destroydismantle outposts currently and the argument thatis either a joke or shows you have some severe lack of the grasp of game mechanics you are aware that you can install refining and manufacturing capabilities in a pos you can anchor basically at each free moon i mean sheesh how about you l2p or if that is too much effort howe about moving back to empire where you get tons of stations free of chargejfyi nullsec  empire despite ongoing attempts to change that gradually
yeah let us blow em up just make stations act like a really big pos or something with a load of hit points and a week long reinforcement timerif we can blow them up then i support people building as many as they want
uhmm just for the sake of the argument do you really think that a simple member of a nullsec alliance have enough roles to even consider using poses for manufacturing
i wouldnt know how rawr or other entities in the nc handle this but rumor has it there is still a bit of nonnc 00 space out there also the alliancecorp policies have nothing to do with initial argument that more outposts would be needed for manufacturing andor construction that simply left out the fact that there is a viable alternative existing already aka a manufacturing pos furthermore op stated specifically in second part of that sentence that it would help smaller alliances if an alliance forbids itself to use game mechanics like employing refining or manufacturing arrays that would be a bit silly wont it if it is so needed for them to have those i can guess where that idea came from though with the new ed sov mechanics it is several orders of magnitude harder to interrupt works in an outpost than in a pos unless you just stack several hundreds of people into the system so yeah nice buff to making 00 even more static and blobby why not call it an initiative to have 00 gradually become more empirelike straight away no thanks this is a terrible and totally unwarranted change in my book
every outpost is like a new barbed wire on prairie what next a sheriff
malcs outpost wrecking proposalid rather see 2 outposts in one system than 2 systems with one outpost
why care to back up your opinion
i think its an interesting idea
good idea
they dont exist the few that do are beholden to one blob or another so it matter little there is no independence possible with null system the way it ishave a gauge of activity in a system once a benchmark comprised a ratio between sovereignty holder size and rats killed goods producedreprocessed  other indicators is reached the system becomes eligible for a second outpostallows the mythical small entity his second harbour while effectively denying the lazy fatcats an even easier lifeto proposal no null needs a massive overhaul to make it the settled wildernessoutback it was supposed to be and sovereignty system needs to be less biased towards blobbage before any more luxuries are added
its an opinion
supportedand outpost shoud not able to be destoried anyhow
fully support the idea to have more than one outpost per systemcould somebody explain to me please what is the reason to have such it should be a good reason
such as
i support it only if theres a way to completely destroy these outpostsdestroy everything clones character podded to noob starting station all assets all ships everythingthat way we can have a self regulating dynamic system that will not push eve into crisis state  where space becomes littered with 1000s of unused stations
similar to highsec to drop pos it takes standings i have been cruising around npc 00 and theres nobody at all in them anymore especially so compared to 1010 static plex days according to the map outer ring is utterly dead 6 people in yva 6 in nm 5 in d5iw 1 in 2jj 0 in 4cb7x thats pretty friggen deadto rejuvenate npc 00 i think it would be great if corp standings with the home faction is what unlocks the ability to create jump bridge and cynogen chains this then gives the space gypsies like pandemic legion the ability to cruise around npc regions in addition to all the little guys whose home is that npc region
jump bridges and cynogen chains are really bad for pvp ccp already expressed concern about their effect on alliance sov space they arent gonna move in opposite direction by increasing their use
have you ever had something you didnt need couldnt sell and thought was a waste to trash my proposal is a public station hanger on every station where you could drop the items that you cant use but arent worth tossing in the trash or selling the hanger would be cleaned out once a week to avoid buildup and whatever is there an be taken by anyone who wants or needs it kind of like take a penny leave a penny
lol helpanoob should help with trial retention rate will probably need time limit on taking out item though theres gonna be some greedy person bulk reporcessing stuff otherwise
well if people put stuff in there and people want to take out what they can to reprocess thats fine its just a place to drop what you either dont want or dont need sure people will abuse it on occasion but thats fine too hell thats eve

personally i find that command ships are obsolete given the existence of t3t3 can do everything that t2 bc can do  better the only thing going for t2 bc is they are cheaper but still expensive to loseeven with extra grid on nighthawk id still pick tengumaybe if nighthawk had extra mid slot then id seriously consider it using as a drake on steroids
perhaps when ccp gets around to doing treaties for 00 they could create essentially vassalage right now pets need to get blued by everyone who is blue vassals could be a new symbol perhaps pink so when they role up in local they stand out more the a citizens sort of approach is somewhat efficient but doesnt allow for differentiation or full usage of having alliance petsthusly this change would make it far safer for alliances to take on pets which in of itself would cause 00 to become far more populated which means lots of stupid people in 00 that is easy to kill
wasnt that the plan they aired when last they talked about the treaties all those moons agoto give null a feudal system complete with obligations tofrom a liegedoubt it will happen though since the underlying sovereignty system has failed spectacularly in achieving their goal of less blobs and more skirmishingchances are they they will revamp the whole thing before pouring more gasoline on the smouldering wreck
the ease of moving blobs in modern eve has nothing to do with that im sure
all the other serp ships have green daredevil has orange this is unacceptable change the lights to green
you can add one codebreaker to a single drake doesnt cut into dps or rewardsthe lineup weve been using and has proven very effective has been 3 basilisks 7 drakes and a loki gangboosting 3 skirmish links  the shield resist link from outside the siteone drake has codebreaker two are mildly speedfit 2 bcu dcu nanofiber with tackle the rest ab fit and triple bcuas for the mining sites you can mine all the ore with an osprey you leave there once one is done and have it ready for the next ones you do
i guess you could call this a petition or a request i want it clear that im not here saying to change it or not to change it i simply want to know what the game designers and our elected representatives think because as long as i have played this game there have been discussions about this most of them less civil than others call it what you want sometimes you wont see one for a month sometimes youll see 10 of them a day the recent csm comment in the minutes afk cloaking is lame seems to have created another storm of themnobody wants to touch the issue with a 10 foot pole from what ive seen which is understandable but until someone does were going to have an endless stream of posts about it so someone step up and find out is it intended game design if so then all the people who dont want it changed will have one very simple argument to throw in all these threads ccp looked and it and said it was working as intendedis it not then why has ccp left it for so long are they simply afraid of the player base backlashit probably wont end of the posts but then at least it wouldnt be one side repeating the same argument as last week in a new thread while the other side uses the same defenses we will at last have an answer from the designers and representatives point of view thats all i want
afk cloaking is our only defence against botters are you saying you want to make it easier to botface it afk cloakers only affect botters no one else if you complain you are a bot
ive gone out of my way to state that i dont intend to express an opinion on the matter here nor do i want this to be another topic where both sides argue about the issue there are plenty of those in other parts of the forums lets keep them therethis is just a request to the csm to broach this topic with ccp whatever the outcome because its one that isnt going to go away both sides feel strongly about it and that is usually the job of elected representatives to present issues from the player base to ccp
ccp already stated afk cloaking is lame in the csm minutes but guess what theres more of a chance of afk cloaking getting changed than 00wouldnt want to make bots angry would we p
just to correct the record on ccpscsms behalf ccp didnt state anything about afk cloaking and as far as i know never has what csm said i wouldnt conclude to be a statement of their stance on the issue eithernote here that afk cloaking wasnt specifically being discussed only 00 changesupdates official heading for that section was post dominion 00 it seems like a side comment it could have been added as a general feeling amongst the csm without them necessary feeling that it was wrong or unfair it could have been a comment by one csm not representing the majority etcanyway i dont think its right for anyone to construe that as any kind of official stance on the issue for all i know they are perfectly in favor of it because of its effects on local whatever my opinions and the outcome of a discussion with the devs may be i agree that id like to see the issue officially resolved
afk cloaking is awesome cry more carebear tears mua hahaha hahaha
well thanks for responding to a genuine request like a troll i guess i know who i wont be voting for in the next csm and no it has nothing to do with your position on the matter i might agree with you i might not ive tried to do my best to refrain from expressing an opinion here as i didnt want this to become another discussion on the matter between trolling players on both sides i see the csm itself is determined to drag it to that level
hahaha aww mazz is amazing ill definitely vote for you 3
no no i meant changing the look of the neo neocom as in changing its color or the border i was not talking about changing the meat of the ui like more buttons or such sorry if that wasnt clear also i understood the idea of experimental features of eve however maybe thats the real feature that has been pulled they never deployed the experimental feature where you could turn on and off experimental features on tq if it was put on tq as an experimental feature and then removed forever for something better then that would be grand the thing some players thought the idea of experimental features on tq was a brilliant move in the right direction the features wouldnt have to stay they could even be pulled forever but even if it was just to gather feedback on a newer neocom the experimental neo neocom could of be used at great length to gather real non sisi feedback ill go back and read the minutes again just in case i misunderstood you  
the issue is that the new neocom is crap

nosferatu perhaps youve heard of it
what the hell did you even read what i said
i like the idea of rebooting an otherwise useless item with this purpose and to expand on the idea of a 100 battery penetration bonus for the curse and pilgrim maybe we should steer that towardsrole bonus5 heat damage to a targets battery if fitted per energy nuetralizer cyclethis would make it so neutingspecific ships like the curse pilgrim cruor bhaalgorn etc etc could still potentially burn out a battery fit shipaside from that i do support this idea
you didnt read the op apparently nosferatu would not be changed in this idea so you still can suck em dry you just have to be capped out as well
cap batteries are not useless specifically they are already useful on hacsliang
i would expect all tackle frigates and nano hacs to fit these it provides more benefits than an infinite range medium nos  literal immunity to neuts and practical immunity to noslianged honestly the only way id expect people to stop fitting them is if neuts became so utterly useless that suggesting fitting a neut would garner a lolfukingnoob response from any competent pilot
and thats why you cant be taken seriously sorry but you have to be reasonable in your predictions if you want people to be swayed by your arguments
great idea peoplei fit a module that eats up 30 of my cpu 20 of my powergrid takes up a mid slot is less effective than a cap recharger and is useless against neuting ships if you give them penetrations great i am totally gonna fir that instead of a cap booster
there was a time
you can fit what you want but the idea does not include any sort of penetration ability to counter the counter for already overpowered ships that was a curse pilot whinging about having to actually worry about not winning
are you guys ready for this bull
i like kittens

remove gates alreadythe only thing they have been used for this last year is as something to plant sbus at after you have cynoed in
just like what he saidsupported
another thoughtcontracts created via the api could be used to automate ship replacement programs in an alliance you could easily write a script to give out a new ship to replace one from an apiverified lossmail based on whatever criteria you choosethere really are endless uses for something like this and ccp would only have to do the backend and security side of things they wouldnt have to worry about creating any new uis it would all be done by playerdevelopers
a sound idea and one that would be extremely useful for multiple parties
having read the latest csm minutes ive got some ideas that i want to share with you and see if it could be a good change or a bad oneso firstly lets get straight on what is wanted in the game nerfing blob movement time over huge amount of territory boosting local production in 00 more small gang pvp and more ships lostkilledthe solution combination of the following steps is important not the individual steps alone1 do whatever is needed with titan bridgesjump bridgescovert jump portals to increase travel time or cost most likely by nerfing the range of the jumps but i leave that to you2 introduce industrial jump bridges with increased range that only industrialsorcasfreighters can use this jump bridge network must be separated from the current combat jb networkthe alternative to industrial jump bridges can be found in this post3 introduce personal station upgrade modules called industrial arrays which will allow individual players to have their personal manufacturing slots in player owned stations you need to pay the installationmaintenance fee to the owner have sufficient standings with the station owner and have appropriate skill to use itabout industrial arrays built from simple materials mineralspi stuff  why t2 materials are too touchy and prone to be monopolized this eliminates t2 material whines and can buff the pi market by increasing demand industrial array gets a bit of damage every time its used set it up that it would be completely useless and destroyed after some time of using it actively a week for example an array must then be replaced  why boosts the economy requires effort from users and regulates production cost each array creates 1 manufacturing slot for the owner you can have maximum 11 arrays active limited by skill to cover all manufacturing slots that a character can have different arrays for different types of manufacturing slots  much like current pos assembly arrays types of arrays that one can use are limited by the level of a new industrial arrays skill if station gets conquered by a hostile entity the new owner can destroy your arrays and you will lose materials and blueprints that were used in active manufacturing jobsreasons behind the changes stuff in empire is cheap because of two main reasons abundance of basic minerals trit pyerite mexallon and availability of almost unlimited numbers of manufacturing slots in npc stations until mining gets some kind of revolutionary fix there will always be a shortage of basic minerals in nullsec because as we all know no one moved to nullsec to mine veldspar additionally a limited amount of public manufacturing slots will become queued up if the production is forced to be done locally and even the most basic t1 stuff and ammo will be monopolized by the corporations that own the stations and have private manufacturing slots in them it will also hurt the simple member of a corporation without sufficient roles to use those private slots and will make only a few people in the corporation very rich while everyone else suffers that is not a good and healthy environment
 by introducing industrial jb network we are creating supply routes of lowend minerals that go from empire and into the 00 space at the same time by separating supply from combat routes we get another layer of pvp camping supply routes  defending
this does nothing to pop jitas rancid tit out of 00 alliances mouthremoving all forms of bridging except black ops covert jump bridge in combination with adjustments and buff to regional supplies is what needs to be done the removal of static moon goo and a nerf to recycling capital ships for the components then and only then will production in 00 will become a realitynot supported
i support this
i didnt mention anywhere that we need to totally cut the supplies from highsec in fact lowend mineral supply from highsec needs a boost plus jita is only a trade hub for those living in the north this proposal is equally beneficial for everyonei dont think youve read my entire post or even if you have you didnt quite understand it because thats pretty much what its all about we can do whatever we want with combat jump bridges as long as supply routes existmoon materials are out of the scope of this proposal and should be handled separately recycling capital ships for the components doesnt really have an impact on production of ships modules ammo or drones used in small gangs and is also out of the scope of this proposal besides you can recycle capitals in lowsec toowhen i summarize your post i dont really see the reason for not supported theres enough space to nerf combat jbs as much as you like while adjusting and buffing regional supplies in my proposal and the rest of what youve said is just out of the scope of this idea
why not boost lowend minerals in 00 if people could mine highend and lowend for same profit they wouldnt have to haul it
who mines low or midvalue minerals in null if by boost you mean increase the amount of minerals coming out of a unit of ore by tenfold people might be willing to mine low ends in null secand to the op decreasing the range of the bridges will do little if you look at the network mm and rage have some of those bridges are barely 1 ly in distance people would still put them upim still of the impression that force projection for attackers needs to be increased not a nerf to defenders aka killing the bridge networks
i see a lot of extra power for the blob with practically no sacrificeit is not a matter of adding time to projection it is the projection itself that is the problem so what if you have to do 510 more bridges the gates are still gathering dust and anyone who couldwould waylay a fleet in transit are still forced to battle not only fleet but whatever deathstar it comes out at kill off any and all military movement through bridges let that be handles by range reduced titan bridges reduce capital range in general bridges to be limited in number based on stations constellations andor systems and only able to move industrial ships miners haulers bo bridge to be range extended to give a rapid response option as well as deep strike capabilitywe need to cut the highsec umbilical cord so that only rare materials need to be imported remove supers ability to enter lowsec entirely and the onejump  titan  bridges dies out giving rise to convoys ambushes and other tasty things that go pop in the night its a decent proposal when it comes to the indy part of things ie arrays but i dont think it goes far enough the fact that people didnt move there to mine veld is irrelevant  if you make it enough of a hassle to get it by other means they will suck it up and hit the belts  increase null yield of lowends to meet the lazies halfway start the long slow slog towards supplanting moongoo with pi goods passive income of that magnitude has no place in eve and should never have been introducedpi  lots more traffic moving around  more pewpatrolling add many more and larger upgrade options to outposts in general there was talk some years ago about modular stations and poss those discussions sadly died out but are worth taking up again
yeah
supported why should there be any sound in a station anyway
i like station sounds especially amarr choir and would like to have more a toggle would be fine tho id like option to have station sounds at all times not just for one minute
a way to turn them off would be great at least for amarr stations
this does seem a bit ridiculous with all the killing and slave taking stealing drugs and prostitutes in the game the current state that some avatars seem to exist in where they have at least one layer on their top and bottom seems sufficient to melets hope this petition gets loud enough and heard by the right peopleccp is going to drive away more of the player base that is of the right age to play this game than the people that are young enough to warrant protecting with these silly and extreme messures
also i want miniskirts
chicks like me need halfshirts too so sexeh

contrary to popular belief and bad math a higher max velocity does not cause you to align more slowly the reason mwds and afterburners cause you to align more slowly is because they add mass when active it has nothing to do with the change in max velocity
do the mathwhich is easiest to kill an autopiloting freighter or a wtz freightercargo is only a factor when it comes to picking your targets and the wtz ones are very very hard to catchautopiloting ones are noobs easy prey
both are easy to kill i shoot the ones not on autopilot when i gank not to say that pilots on ap are safer they get their cargo scanned like everyone else
there is no such thing as a freighter that is hard to catch or kill
risk vs reward is a glorious thing if i bring my bpos out to 00 there is far more risk not to mention chance of getting locked out of the stations and losing access to the assets what is the reward for this risk i get to build stuff slightly faster meanwhile 00 has low volume so the time bonus is utterly uselessas a manufacturer why would i ever build outside highsecnow we cant just give a material bonus or else there will be a bad loop of reprocessing and rebuildingmy suggestion nerf lowsec slightly and highsec manufacturing a fair bit keep 00 manufacturing at no difference materialwise nerf lowsec by 510 nerf highsec by 1020 material leave pos alone highsec moons just became much more valuable and wardecs over moons in highsec will likely become extremely common which brings fun to highsec it benefits manufacturers in 00 lots manufacturers will setup shop in 00 and setup buy orders for minerals which will make mining in 00 more plausibleyaaay all around except for those in highsec manufacturing i guess
its been a while since my last proposal as well as my last perusal of this area of the forum but i have a new idea and im not sure if it has been proposed before or discussed so apologies if it hasbasically this is a very low priority proposal but i do feel it might come into play at least once in a while for many pilots and in regards to carrier pilots it would be quite a help if the opportunity to use this would arise at some point during their careerproposal after requesting to dock at a station either from a warpable distance or while on grid of the station in question before you are accepted to dock as noted above the default capacitor area allow a pilot the option to cancel the docking procedure while either in warp or approaching the station i do know that you have the ability to merely redirect your ship which will effectively cancel the docking attempt but sometimes you can get unlucky and it proceeds to dock you anywayas mentioned before it is a small issue but i think it would be used if made available especially by a carrier who has requested to dock and warped to a station while fighters are deployed once on station the fighters also warp and then the carrier docks leaving the drones out and the long annoying process of gathering them back up god help you if you dont have an indy ship helping youto a lesser extent it may be beneficial to someone who has requested to dock and finds some reason to cancel this request when landing on grid or noticing something on directional scan which causes them to change their mind i can see why people may like the fact that a careless pilot would leave a flight of drones worth 200 mil or so floating in space for an easy grab if they have the ability to do so but it seems like this scenario would happen so few times it wouldnt effect very many people just save those individuals some time but im willing to throw this idea out there to see what people think and if they like it great if not i can see whyto clarify i do not mean for this to be allowing a ship that has been accepted and which has become invulnerable to targeting to then cancel their docking procedure as that would just be pointless and wouldnt make sensetldr allow docking requests to be rescinded before the ship is accepted and invulnerable for situational purposes
straightforward
when approaching the station if you select the little stop button alternatively ctrlspace you cancel the request to dockalready in game
ok so we as an alliance have run 5 seperate incursion areas we primarily run vanguard incursion sitesnation comander outpostnation mining colonyboth vary good sitesoveride transfer arrey on the other handnot worth the time our proposed changes1 increase the sansha incursion recharge rate in highsec keep it as is for low sec reduce it for null2 make payouts for fleets more scaled eg nation command er out post pays 105mill and 1400 lp in highsec for a fleet of 510 ships make fleets in excess of this size get at best 25 a fleet with less than 5 people should get payout plus 10153 bonus payouts for fleets consisting for same corp at 25 alliance at 5 encurages people to join corpsalliances4 overide transfer arrey needs love remove the 2 bss and replace them with dps cruisers when you hack the cans the station should randomly remote rep a pod pilot we assumed this to be good because you did hack the can not destroy it5 as an alternate to point 2 assuming site is hs vanguard fleets with in excess of 10 are disqualifyed and payout is payed to next fleet with most dammage inflicted assuming the second fleet has no more than 12 members6 finalyincursion spawn mechanics they are currently realy off balancecurrent hs incursions are being d in 510hourssohisec 46 incursions at any one time pref 1 per faction spacelowsec 23 anywherenullsec 24 atleast 1 in npc spaceon a side notewe have also been discussing the possible implimentation of a point system not unlike alliance tourny in to incursion sitesa possible point listing could betable keybs battleshipbc battlecruisercc cruiserdd destroyerff frigitindi industrialmining bargelogi teck 2 logistics cruiserstighest point value pirate faction bst2 bsnavy bst2 bcbc t2 logi pirate cc t3t2 cc t2 indinavy cccc  pirate fft2 ff t2 dd navy ffff indi ddlowest point valueany thaughtssugestionschanges
aside from the massive spelling and grammatical errors i think the ideas are sound
1 eh sure2 pointless change if people want to use bloated fleets and get paid less then they can and using less is just dimwitted3 no go die in a fire people can join or not join what they please4 meh we5 see point 2 and excessively easy to exploit around6 meh we
honestly im not sure about most of the ideas herebut one things for sure incursions should be rampant in 00 and low secwhyno security why should it be more frequent in high sec should be just as rampant everywhere elseim just waiting for a const to get incursioned in the middle of a war zone in 00 with cynos being jammed
from what i have seen the commander and mining sights need to be harder every incursion is swamped with ten man fleets throwing themselves all over those sights and thats it they simply race to the next vanguard until the sansha mothership appearsall the sites should be rebalanced to be more competitive with the vanguard commander and mining sites sorry i dont like you idea if anything those two sites you love need a nerf
not necessarily the purpose of incursions seems to be to steal people my understanding is that most normal people live in empire space it sort of makes sense that the incursions would be more focused on areas where there are large population concentrationssansha also was initially driven out and defeated by the combined armies of the 4 empires so it isnt too far fetched to think he wants to give some payback so he focuses his efforts more on them that seems like a good reason to make low and high sec prime targets and helps to explain why 00 isnt overly burdened with incursions
regardless they take place in 00 either way and they should be more often if not just as often as high seclow secnpc space out there is no different than empire let alone player owned space just different forms of security
as to start your apathetic attitude towards even the good suggestions shows that either havent tried the incurison at all or dont have an opinion on the expansion in the first place so im not entirely sure why you felt the need to chime in1 this is good simply based on the roleplay reasoning that sansha hates the empires the most and because of the rate at which the different areas are being completed the ones in null are there for a whole week and then expire or are they actually being done the ones in low sec seem to slowly be accomplished at the rate they should be and the ones in high sec are finished before you can even go the 15 jumps to get to them2 i think if someone wants to use a smallerthan recommended fleet they should rewarded rather than punished its pretty much impossible to run the sites solo as is so make a mandatory minimum through the pay scale is unneccessary at this point 4 spidertanking domis with welltrained pilots can run the commanders and mining ones with some struggle but its possible and then you just warp in an alt on a separate client to get a free extra 105m anyway so why not take that 105m and spread it automatically to 25m per member of the fleet as part of the game mechanic3 he didnt say if you arent in a corp you wont get paid he said that there should be added incentive to alliance and corp groups accomplishing a task together as evident with the increase of taxes in the npc schools ccp clearly wants players to join corporations tbh of the ideas suggested i feel the least strongly about this one but it would make for a nice addition and a break from the normal neutral rr logi gangs that are making hisec wars so pointless if they logis alts dont want to be in the same corp they normally rr there should be a penalty for the increased security they get being immune from conventional war mechanics in this case less pay out from the incursion plexes4 once again your reaction says to me that you dont particularly care for this expansion in the first place so im not sure what solution youd prefer in response to the other people that say the commanders and mining ones need to be nerfed if they get more challenging then the isk and lp reward would simply drop the incursion sites isk value vs time required to accomplish them into a terribly inefficient realm i suppose this would curb the flooding into the sites that are causing the hisec zones to be over in 4 hrs time but it could also get to the point that no one will do them anymore and just run missions until they appear in motsu or dodixie then people will simply not do anything and wait until they expire as it stands they are more fun than level 4s by a massive amount and pay pretty damn good in that comparison as well so if they dont make the overrides a tad easier and instead make the mining and commanders more difficult instead of seeing a crap load of overrides in all the vanguard systems not being run youd see all 3 not being run and the negative sansha bonuses at 100 for a week
5 the hole i see in darks plan is that a fleet of 15 could come in consisting of 5 logi alts that could just bail before the site is finished and i understand and recongnize this hole the fix would be for the sites to register how many were actively participating in the fleet in one way or another and they would be counted as in that fleet as it stands groups of 15 are fleeting up from the incursion chat channel and crushing the plexes with no care as to the payout and i suppose this will die off as people come to realize the downside but those that had forethought enough to keep a fleet limited within the specified range are being penalized for it our blobs of domis do a good job especially in a group of 10 but we are no match to a fleet of 18 consisting of vindicators 4 logis etc etc sure im all for a nice bit of grief i encourage it but those idiots dont even understand how they are wasting their time and everyone elses i suppose this is just tears but its a mechanic that is at least worth looking into and as you said if people are stupid enough to blob the sites and get paid nothing for their time this wouldnt do anything to them anyway it would instead give a chance to the guys that are doing it the right way instead of starting a plex and seeing that blob fleet warp in and the only alternative being to leave before we waste any more time so give them nothing for their time as they are right now and hand the rewards to the law abiding in concords eyes dudes6 again with the lack of interest but this is probably the best idea of the whole group if this happens before the recharge rate it might make it unncessary to implement a different recharge rate altogether it would spread the players out instead of all the hisec people blobbing into one area and moving like locusts to the next after the 10 hr break where there are no hisec incursions and i get the whole move them to lowsec grief mentality i see where you are all coming from the thing is moving it to lowsec will make it so no one will do them at all outside of the very small groups that they affect negatively for that span of time or the even smaller groups that will rove around farming them if they move out of hisec theyll be the next cosmos thing where new players will ask an older one hey whats this meter on my screen that appeared when i was passing through suchandsuch lowsec and the older player will go oh its this group pve thing that came out in an expansion that no one does anymore think of them as level 5s but a bigger pain in the ass and not worth your time
welcome to the assembly hall where any idea that could lead to a nerf no matter how remote to a popular playstyle will never win any support eve is full of selfish players just like any other game
ive noticed its mostly why i dont post any of the ideas my alliance comes up with and as far as eve being full of selfish players i think its more of a people are selfish more than a this group is more selfishthe thing i dont understand is my corp mate dark here has proposed good solutions to the widespread wellknown problems in the incursion expansion and trolls just naysay it because they didnt like that incursion was launched i guess there really isnt any playstyle we are wanting to nerf aside from the pointless timewasting 1520 man fleets crushing the vanguard sites itd be one thing if they are doing it for lol that other fleet didnt get paid but they are just idiots that fleeted up and are blobbing the sites for no benefit of anyone theres no loot no pay no lp maybe some secstatus increase but why not just hit the belts instead
incurtions should be mroe frequent in highsec since that space actually has some people to abduct for sansha
tldr version  timers are causing 00 to be boring and blobby fix timers and fix 00i agree with this but ccp are too busy with incarna so you may as well spend the next year inactive then when ccp do something there will be approx 8100 more supercarriers alone in 00oh joy
1 for introducing concept of theft of nonactively defended assets moon goo should be able to steal 100 of moon goo while ship is on station thoughmoon holder easy passive income when not being raided raider income when active assets ship at r
i dont particularly care about 00 sov warfare mostly because of the mentioned reasons if the system changed to allow small gangs to harass sov holders i would at least partake in thisespecially not needing caps to accomplish crap andor a leaching ship that can steal moon goo very good idea
1 timers are setup such that you the attacker have to win 3 times straight or more while the defender can just ignore you for 3 days manage 1 small win and then youre back to stage 1 obviously this can be fixed relatively easily once past the first reinforce you can only rr to the previous reinforce and it goes back into reinforce at the same timing example shield reinforce when you had sov 5 you now have sov 4 armor reinforce and now you have sov 3 next one is dead ihub or they fight and rep it back to shield reinforce day later the attack puts it back into armor reinforce and now they have sov 2 forces them to keep defending2 lolwhat3 dreads arent used because youre better off flying a battleships because cap fights are decided by subcap fights capships now dont have the ability to kill subcap fleets this is untrue for supercap pilots as they sure as hell wont eject and get in a battleship4 youve always had to shoot stations whats the prob do you want to go back to 2006 where you could lose your station anytime5 game balance means numbers are the only factor for winning unless you live in a country which allows you to ddos your enemys comms you cant stop this6 ccp will never be able to control who is blue and such they could rip the standings system out of the game and there will be everso larger blues just to avoid conflict7 yes we need a moongoo mining capship that has to siege for like 1 hour at a moon thusly killing moongoo values
and the ability to select multiple people and remove etc ctrlclick
hi i suggest to remove the number of pos that can be anchored per system per day limitation this limitation was set in place to protect the sov system long time ago but since dominion pos are no longer used to hold sovereintythanks 
even though poses no longer have an effect over sov theyre still a part of overall sov ownership and a tactical tool in sov invasioni dont know the exact reasons why ccp left the anchoring limitations in place but i would it guess it would be to prevent pos spamming and load issues surrounding thatnot supported there doesnt seem like theres a really valid reason to remove the cap other than people wanting to anchor moar
supportedalso a suggestion seeing as the creation of boosters is illegal why dont you make the ships pirate faction versions of the mining cruisers
i find it silly that a hulk cannot mine gas faster than a battlecruisermining is mining  and a mining ship should always outperform any other ship in the game vs miningthis is not the case with gas harvesting that i beleive should be fixed before a ship is created just for gas harvesting
sweet thankslike the voice idea but wont hold my breathalso like the bit about adding in lore that was player driven such as big fightseve has so much history i could read it all day and finding these would be amazing
pink text is for pussies i vote greenalso this wont work on eveo because you can read them while not logged in then log in to post and you would only be pink texted while posting hardly an effective punishmenton an actually serious note the punishment on eveo is a bit too strict and far too easily circumvented both feed into the other as well as being enforced sparcelyi suggest a look into changing punishment as several small infringments eventually lead to being banned for 6 months at a time as this is a servise we are technically paying for i find it odd that over time there is no eventual return to a good standing with ccp if you swore on the eveo forums 4 years ago it is still counted towards your bans currentlyfree everyone
if you want to punish your guys for something you already have enough ways to do it without giving the game another gay lookwhats next pink megathrons using ice cream instead of amo they already stinck with their hybrids so pink megas louching ice cream couldnt be mutch worstno
the problem isnt that its cheap loot everyone has to start somewherethe problem is that you can sit in the last room and defeat the purpose of the key or farm the keys which also defeats the purpose

not sure if this has been brought up yeti think longitude and latitude coordinate lines should be given to planets i like the new pi system that came with the last patch but ive had to change my setups to account for hotspot decay as such im much more spread out with extractors and as a result overlap with corp members in inevitable to help prevent this numbered coordinate lines would help in communicating where i or others have extractors on a planetin addition to this coordinate lines would allow individuals with better planetology skills to help others find the best place to put extractorsany thoughts on this
or even showing extractor heads for members of the same corpalliance or high standing
since you are in init you should take a look in your neighbourhood like catch or providence plenty of smaller entities therelook i know how hard it is for a small alliance to enter nullsec without being a part of a blob in fact ive tried to do that some time ago around dominion deployment we were a new alliance on the nullsec scene with only a little help from our coalition it was called coalition of independent alliances 100 active players total in different time zones we all hoped that dominion will bring sov mechanics changes that will help us survive as a small independent entity in nullsec but it didnt happen thats why our coalition didnt last long enough to be even noted one of the main reasons why we decided to go to nullsec is because once you own a station or have access to one there is at least some form of security knowing that the majority of stuff you own is not placed in some station that can be destroyed with a little effort by some bored blob even if the station does change hands you still have a jump clone and your stuff that can be sold if you get kicked out of therewhen our little coalition fell apart some of the people i know quit playing for various reasons disappointment in sov mechanics inability to build something by yourself without belonging to a blob loss of isk they havent gone emo on the forums havent complained they just left introduce destructible outposts and youll get massive discomfort when that happens to a small alliance whose members only have isk they earned all by themselves no high profit moons isk from rent you wont see criestearswhines or any other troll meme youll just have a silent mass exodus from the game im sure ccp would love to see that happen to its customer base its one thing to get blown up because of a mistake you made and totally another thing that your entire stack of pvp ships get destroyed in a single attack in the first case you can learn something from your loss in the last one theres only one message  get inside a blob or dont even try living in nullsec
i agree waking up to find all of your assets and pod destroyed when it was all in a station is just sillyi am curious as to what the need for more than one station in a system is it so a corp has something to call their own or the need for morebetter station services i was under the impression stations could be upgraded
hey nobody would force people do build those thingsccp would only add an option for people to choose its up to them to decide whether they want to take the risk or not thered still be current invulnerable outposts but 1 per system and new vulnerable outpost many per system
my motives in all this are definitely biased but there are numerous benefitsreasons to have multiple stations within a system1 its badass to have a complete system capable of performing every function2 current station design leaves you playing rockpaperscissors for refiningmanufacturingresearch while you can upgrade stations at exponential costs none of the upgrades will let you effectively achieve anything close to the intended purpose of the stations aka you will never get a good refine at a manufacturing station or production at any other station etc3 pos related compensation for a lack of a certain class of station costs in fuel and risk pos refineries achieve 75 refine which is terrible at best and require substantial time cant even keep up with a single hulk pos construction facilities are subject to destruction and freightering ships tofrom the outpost theyre to be sold at station construction facilities give greater options personalcorp construction options and are more omniconstructable if there was a term for the ability to build anything in their slots as opposed to requiring many different pos mods for ammo drones fighters bss frigates capitals etc4 the refinerymanufacturing outpost are a pair that deserve to go together minerals are refined and then shipped to construction outpost for construction right now you have to leave system and move to another in the end its mostly about convenience and better services within a condensed area the current station blight might in part be blamed on the fact that we arent allowed to created condensed areas of functionality within nulsec
thats exactly why i vote for more than outpost per system and for sure they must be invulnerable
or you could check out this idea
it is also exactly the reason why it is never going to happen unless some massive downside is introducedforget blobs bridges and whatnot  everything is covered by services in a single system rest is for all the bots and macros to rentnull is already safer than highsec lolbridge and provides unlimited isk lolmoons in stupidly high quantities lolsanctums there has to be a limit to just how easy the pioneering life should be
considering basically 4 of the 6 next csms guaranteed to win csm have the platform of that being a very very stupid position and that increase jumpbridge use is extremely beneficial to the game i think that pretty much explains the reality of the game so getting back to the topic at hand setting stupid solopvper and highsec people who have no idea how 00 works asideephemeron you must hate warp to 0 on gates just totally kills your gameplay eh
i dunno why people tend to equate jump bridges to warp to 0i was one of the first people telling ccp to implement warp to 0 optioni am not in favor of easylazy kills i am in favor of good strategy i am against jump bridges because they undermine strategic and tactical possibilities of combat in this gamewanting to use jump bridges is the easylazy choice just like wanting 15km minimum warp is an easylazy choice
at first i thought this was a good idea then i thought about how someone could abuse itcreate starter account and go around taking everything and giving it to their main even if its junk and worthless to them there are scores of people who would do it daily just to be a 
this sort of incompetence is what ccp is known for carefully compared most ammo makes no sense on the other end of the spectrum take scorch for example provided youre not drooling and eating crayons its an extremely powerful ammo with virtually no drawbacks at all likewise conflag has minimal drawbacks and outdamagesoutranges faction multi while hail and void are still jokes with no purpose unless you need to beat on something literally right in front of you while at a standstillyou may even notice a pattern scorch 50 optimal null 25 optimal 25 falloff and barrage 50 falloff all with 25 tracking equal right no ccp failed to consider that optimal and falloff do not scale the same and failed to provide either differing drawbacks or benefits to bring anything resembling an equality in usefulness oddly enough the inequallity of optimal and falloff scaling is considered in tracking enhancers and tracking computers but completely ignored in ammothese sorts of random mathimatical blundering is pretty commonplace with ccp the common view is that poorly concieved mechanics like these make eve hardcore and is generally just glazed over with pr nonsense by ccp welcome to eve

if we were going to use maths to document this itd be as followsnormal pos shield for ease of calculations is 1000 points when it is at 1000 points it is at 100damage it to 25 hit it with 750 points of damage and it reinforcesnow in that wh system pos shield has 2000 points reinforcing it takes 1500 points of damage to take it to 500 which is 25 how its supposed to bebut after downtime pos has 10002000 hitpoints deal 500 points of damage to take it to 500 25 its actually easier to reinforce this pos in a shield bonused wormhole than it is in normal space eg only 500 instead of 750 points to reinforce it reinforcing it is 33 quicker than it should benow obviously this isnt working as intended but if ccp want to say ah well just consider that a drawback of that type of wormhole until you rep it its weaker but once you do its stronger than normal then thats something else
a lot of what has happened over the last year that was instigated by the csm has been behind the scenes at ccp the reaction to the 18 months and commit to excellence issues was such that ccp could not simply ignore them not everything the csm achieves has to have a specific in game purpose but can also affect the thinking and processes inside ccp which we may or may not seea sea change occurred at ccp in the time between june and december which was a result of interaction with the csm this may not be a tangible change in game but it signifies a change in attitude and direction more focus is being given to iteration of older features and bugfixes than before as the csm made it clear that the existing playerbase would rather have a working game than new shinies every six monthsthere is also the matter of the more frequent and indepth dev blogs that have been appearing since june with a few exceptions these have served to increase the amount of information and communication that we get from ccp and are a direct result of the csm pushing for this greater transparencyas for your comment implying that the csm is nothing but a free trip to iceland if youd actually bothered to read up on what the csm actually do and go over the minutes of not just the summits but their more regular meetings then you would realise that the csm works bloody hard on our behalf and provides us a valuable means of interaction with ccp each summit is three days packed with meetings and discussion and sometimes argument about things that the players want or dont want in eve its not a holiday by any means and implying that it is is frankly insulting to the delegates and those that voted for them i can vouch for the above through first hand experience as i have had the privilege of being able to sit in on a few meetings at the last two main summits june and december and the discussions are frank and sometimes heated i would agree that there needs to be an easily accessible list of items that have made it into the game through the csm process then maybe we can avoid posts like this in the future the changes brought in for incursion were meant to be marked up in the patch notes but they havent been so obviously ccp needs to work a bit more on their communication then again with just a little effort on your part you could go looking for that information yourself as most of it is in the evelopedia but hey efforttldr just because you cant see the progress that is being made doesnt mean its not happening
world of darkness will have treaties
i remember qhen they were announced and the hype that was sorrounding treaties i know they are generally considered an interesting feature but i fail to remember why can someone explain just to make this thread more completei mean treaties will not allow a different style of playing they will just facilitate renting thus making the control of renters easier and by consequence treaties will encourage space holding alliances to rent out more space to a certain extent increasing 00 populationthey would be a cool feature and maybe they are planned for the next release cycle but i think that we dont need more people in 00 to join the coalitions we need more independent small forces around in conquerable space even small corporations should be able to live in conquerable space without defeating a stronger group the problem why this is not possible is that there are no structures a little corporation can defend agains a larger force
i think that the last post has some really good points and although the current market may be difficult to work around planetary trade is a great way for say a new player to make isk if there was a reason to move say food and medical or construction supplys between worlds has anyone played escape velocity that ways a game i always wanted to be like eve or eve to take a page out of its book the world was cool with pirate factions and diffrent races u got missions from bars the ones you got were randome and had a story about them or u could trade on an open market finding a place where some food or luxuary item was cheep and flying it to a place where u could make a profit aswell as u could easyly oversupply on high profit items because u oversupplyed demand so that ppl who were doing this would want to stay out of eachothers trade routs so as to keep their personal profit upya escape velocity
do you work for the police cos with that idea it sure sounds like you dohow will that solve the problem traders would obviously just pack up and more on toor create another jita scale trade hub cos they would just loose way to much isk if they stayed in a 04 system here is the solution if u dont like all the ganking then dont trade there there are plenty off other trade hubs going u know

playerbuilt missions sound like a nice idea in theory in practice youll get lots of monty haul missions and one or two missions that really push the envelope of the mission creator and leave both the players and the devs begging for morethe monty hauls could be weeded out by an apple app store style vetting process  the automated tools will be able to check that the rewards match the mission level and intended security level no officer npcs in hisec level 1 missions no 5 implants hidden in level 4 mission structures no endless stream of undertanked overbountied battleships no shanty town pockets filled with hundreds of structures that have some tiny percentage chance of dropping something really nice other processes could monitor the missions once theyre available on singularity and tranquility to ensure that bounty payouts and loot drops never exceed certain valuesthe two or three really good missions will make it worth wading through all the dross while simultaneously encouraging the devs to ensure that missionhandling code is thoroughly cleaned upthere are some nice missions in the new bunch that ccp added to the game  it would be interesting to see what players could do given the same toolset im particularly amused with pick your poison since its a level 4 mission that can be completed or more to the point is best completed in a frigate similar to recon 1 of 3

agreed
no
no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no
no if ccp wants money have npcs sell stuff for isk the people that want the vanity stuff will then either earn the isk thereby sustaining the economy of eve or buy plex and sell for isk giving ccp money i imagine a npc selling some bling for 100m isk people who really want it but cant come up with the money will buy plex are plex sells down since plex prices are not up id say the demand and supply are fairly constant we probably need a new moneyisk not dollar sink to stimulate the buying and selling of plex and vanity items would do nicely high sec carebears need a money sink null sec already has one with the massive destruction of ships

needs to apply to all remote assistance eccm sebo rr tracking and energy transneeds to exclude gate jumping reason is that a jumper can be caught and molested on the other side whereas a docker cannot of the two the docker is by far the most frequently abused in highlow and i assume null as wellwere jumping to be included then legitimate roaming fleets will be pretty hard hit regardless of location essentially either making rr extinct or make it so heavy as to make any nonblob action pointless
im not sure but i think people are really starting to give up on anything being changed with hybrids nobody sane can keep trying to argue a point if the response continues to be indifference andor works as intended which basically means they accomplished their original design and if it doesnt actually work well in practice thats of no concern to them
then all is left to do is to give gallentehybrids pilots wishing to the refound of their sp so they dont have to waste more time training other races just because theirs sucks hard rather than for the fun of crosstraini can perfectly understand that someone whos playing now since stone age dont care about this issue he has the choice while newfresh players dont they just get sucked for the 6 first months of their eve experience and what a pleasent experience
pulse lasers are better in every way than blasters as far as i can tell

at the moment it seems that some select tech iii subsystemssetups shine while others seemingly prenerfed and never unnerfed are hardly used at all tech iii has not gotten much attention by ccp since it was implemented in 2009 i propose a revision of the unused subsystems bonusesslot layouts be reworked in an attempt to create more variety in tech iii setupsnote this is a general proposal the details below are my own observations and opinions on some select subsystems as well as some proposed changes these changes are not part of the general proposal and are only ment to serve as guidelines at bestgeneral subsystem issuesemergent locus analyzer currently only the amarr version provides 1 highslot for a probe launcher i see no reason why everyone but legion pilots should be forced to fit a different defensive subsys or compromise dps in order to make use of a subsystem specifically designed for scanning suggest 1 midslot be converted into 1 highslot for the nonamarr versions or 1 lo to 1 hi referring to gallentewarfare processor unlike the adaptive augmentershielding this subsystem does not yield a personal defensive bonus suggest one be added to match the adaptive augmentershielding 5 shieldarmor resistance for caldariamarr  gallente respectively minmatar perhaps a 5 reduction in sigradadaptive augmentershielding current bonuses are fine however would like to propose an additional slight range bonus approx 25  50 per level this would allow large sized rr mods to have a max range of 2030km with max skills since minmatar tend to do both armor and shield tank on different ships obviously i propose that the lokis current adaptive augmentor be changed into a rr subsystem giving it a choice between armor and shield repair cap range and price issues should ensure that tech iii does not become the new logisticssupplemental coolant injector these do not seem to be worthwhile at the moment suggest increasing the bonus from 5 to 10specific subsystem issues legionenergy parasitic complex a slight range bonus would be nice 1015 per level max range on a medium nosneut would be 1822kmcovert reconfiguration 4 turrets and only a cap use bonus whats stopping it from fitting autocannons propose an additional 5 rof or 5 medium energy turret damage per leveldrone synthesis projector suggest the current 75 to drone hitpoints per level be changed to 10 per level additional 5 to tracking disruptor effectiveness per level tengurifling launcher pattern currently the weakest ecm in game propose the 10 to ecm strenght per level be increased to 2025 per level cpu bonus increased from 33 to 66 1 highslotlauncher hardpoint be converted into 1 midslot and a 10 bonus missile velocity per level be added this would put it slightly above the kitsune but below the recons in pure jam strenght and below the scorpion in rangecovert reconfiguration suggest an additional 10 missile velocity per level making its launcher layout and bonuses similar to the suggested changes to rifling launcher pattern proteuscovert reconfiguration suggest an additional 10 to medium hybrid turret falloff per leveldrone synthesis projector currently a proteus can have a max bandwith of 100 mbitsec by fitting this subsystem plus the augmented capacitor reservoir suggest that the drone synth proj base bandwith be increased from 75 mbitsec to 100 mbitsec this combined with the aug res would allow it to potentially field 5 heavy drones dronebay remains the samehybrid propulsion armature propose a 5 to remote sensor dampener effectiveness be added 1 lowslot be converted into 1 midslot lokihardpoint efficiency configuration 75 to target painter effectiveness per level
sarcasmyou want them to do a balance pass on unpopular t3 itemshell weve been trying to get them to look into unpopular t2 items for years and unpopular t1 items since well since thats all there was and fw and cosmos and sov andthere are more important things that need to be done than balance passes really important things that will keep eve competitive with new games like pi and new avatars and walking in stationssarcasmseriously while i do agree that ccp does need to do a pass on the t3 subsystems im still waiting for the 5th modules im expecting that to land in the pile with the rest of the old features for years now ccp has shown far more interest in blazing bold trails over new ground than they have been in looking back at whats been left behindunfortunately what keeps many of us here is the blind hope that someday they will stop trying to expand eve into an omnibus game with something for everyone and get back to making it a great game for those that are not interested in games built for the lowest common denominator
hey letss not support stuff becuz other stuff needs to be looked intoon a side note supported
they should automatically flag accounts for inspection if theyre constantly online and doing activities for more than 80 of the time that the servers are up
absolutely
this document reflcts all the stuff i managed to collect on fixing gallente and put it into one piece
youd think that if the gallente were going to be fixed it would have happened by now or at least started
because you know for sure that ccp is not wroking on it under any circumstances how is that attitude helpfull anyway
i cant help but smirk at the mention of final solution for gallente
didnt ccp say that blasters and rails were working as intended things like that suggest to me they arent working on the problem or even think there is one
you mean they dontwork as intended and if they dont see the ssue thats only a cause to make more noise about it untill they notice iti really hope that you are wrong but if it continues like this the solution will be final indeed
i agree that there is a problem but i dont like the idea of having to be a squeaky wheel to get it fixed thats how devs ruin their games by listening to whoever is the loudest to shut them up
seed l5 agents in every region not just in the few they are in right nowreason is simpleyou just cant bring a small pve fleet in a enemy controlled system without getting killed within the first 15 min by pvp fitted ships while taking npc fireyou have to be in a region where your friends are to do thatthat makes it unfare to other playersif your alliance is a region where l5 agents are your lucky if there not tuff luck go and do l4see my point heregive everyone the same change of doing those missions cousse there really fun
yeah sure
well  it would be nice to have the possibility to choose how many items we can pick from the lp store  right now there is only one button accept  and it doesnt make too much sense  since when you purchase rd points it gives you the options to buy as many datacores as you want with a single click  instead of making hundreds of clicks  same with the market  you want 10000 rockets  you can buy them with a single click it does make sense  no  today i wanted to buy some bulk ammo for my corp  pressed acceptok  acceptok several times  and because of lag i received in inventory some implants  a skill book  and only 3 ammo packs  i spent 130k lp without wanting to  this could be easely avoided if you make a dialog window as the one that exist on market or on rd agents please take this proposal into consideration  best regards
it has been recently talked about a lot that the jump bridges in game need to be changed this person
seems reasonable low sec shouldnt get bridges though take them off the poss make them independent let people reinforce them these are good ideas
this would definitely help small scale pvp a lothowever the article does not address another major issue of jump bridges they make space too small they are able to cut down travel time significantly which i dont think is such a good thing i want eve galaxy to feel big and that is done by controlling number of systems people have to pass on the way from any point a to point bbig galaxy means more room for people to play war
can you give me a valid reason why a tackle frigate wouldnt fit a cap battery better cap stability than now and total neut immunity at any range is unbelievably powerful battleships  which are already pretty well useless  will have utterly no recourse against frigates none at allgreat game balance youre wanting there liang
but it is balance everything has a counter now take a look at the tackling frigatesmicro capacitor battery ii  5 mw 25 tf 53 gjmalediction  3 mids 135 tfraptor  3 mids 150 tfares  3 mids 150 tfstiletto  4 mids 150 tfnow which of these will be the overpowered fotm neutproof tackler which of these would even need a cap battery
it is not balance battleships quite literally have no counter to tackle frigates as to which tackle inty id fit it on all of them mwd cap battery disruptor fwiw a cap battery would make exceptionally sweet love on a malediction 3 3 3 3also none of them need it its just that they become literally uncounterableliang
battleships need a more proactive means to deal with smaller ships something ive suggested before
drones are i am primarily a bs pilot and i am not complaining yeah huge fitting requirements and the fact that it costs a slot
wholeheartedly supportedthat way the curse can become the new pilgrim and the joke of the piece of  that is the pilgrim can be taken out of game by ccpand next week we can quadruple the sensor strength of all ships who fit eccm so we can lol at the caldari recons and have them being rendered obsolete
as far as battleship counters to frigs go my experience is thissmall ecm drones are pretty effective at jamming frigatessmall combat drones are effective under 10km orbitsif we are considering 20 km frig orbits around a battleship with heavy neut then id argue that small cap injector would offer exactly same type of immunity as a battery because the cycle time for large neut is 24 seconds and battleships rarely carry more than 2 of thoseit is true however that battleships have great difficulty when dealing with frigates i believe that was intended by design im in favor of boosting battleships in other ways tho
val please clarify why you think cap boosters arent the effective counter to neuts your logic seems really flawedcap booster  semiinstant injection short term cap regen limited by boostersneutralizers  semiinstant cap negation short term cap null limited by rechargehigh energy usagebatteriescap recharger  cap stability more caplongterm stable capnosferatu  longterm cap succor limited by enemys cap recharge ratewhat youre purposing if im reading it right is that x amount of cap from the battery would be entirely immune to cap effects nos works based off of the cap recharge percentage rate of the targeted ship if a ship has x amount of constant unaffectable cap and a natural recharge rate to keep any modules it has activated at minimum 1 that ship could effectively permarun all modules the effective positives for the nosing ship would be negligible the nos offers only a minimal cap recharge rate and does nothing if the targeted ships capacitor recharge rate is less than that of the ship using the nosthe point of neut is to cause cap failure on the opposing ship thus turning off their modules politely for them cap boosters are the effective counter to this as they provide shortterm boosts to keep modules running long enough to do the dirty deed or at least hold the target until more tackle arrives a tackled ship with either nos or a neut with your changes has no chance to shake tackle unless they it ecm or can dps the tackle off before more tackle can arrive which would be nigh impossible in most scenarios unless the enemy tackler was pantsstupid
i can address that since i also have lots of experience in this areathe main issue is this multiple neut stacking nullifies effect of cap booster when fighting 1 on 1 or 1 on 2 a cap booster is enough but when fighting against a hostile gang with 4 mediumheavy neuts you simply wont notice any effect from your cap booster the injected cap disappears as soon as you activate it thus the cap injector is completely useless in some situations 1 curse with 4x neuts that are activated out of sync with each other will have same effect  even against heavy cap injectori would personally choose to fit cap battery when i know my opponent will be neutheavy or when i plan to engage hostiles that outnumber me more than 41for most other situations id still prefer cap injector
if cap immunity is such a big deal how about resistance instead id even dare to suggest it take a high slot because id rather active tank than run around in lame buffer fits like everyone else
as i said before ships that fit cap boosters fit cap boosters because they need them to run the ship take the abaddon for example even in brick mode the guns will cap out the ship before any serious battle is over so you fit a cap injector in fact all ships that need cap to fire their weapons have this issue ultimately ships with primarily active tanks such as the cyclone or the maelstrom also have to fit cap injectors to be able to sustain the tankhave you ever run across a drake with a cap injector probably not because they typically dont need that much cap to perform anywaythere is a major inconsistency in the way cap warfare is handled ships that need cap for weapons have no recourse but to fill already sparse mid slots with cap injectors but there is no similar danger experienced with droneboats projectile ships or missileers usually those ships also have extra utility hi slots to fit cap attack modules which even further increases the disparityimmune to energy neutralizers not nosferatunos works based off the relative health of the capacitors of the two ships involved if you fit nosferatu on a ship that caps out easily then you will almost always benefit from nossing a drake for exampledemonstrate this please even with this change most of the ships that need something like this will still ultimately cap out and those ships will have to fit a cap injector they need to fit one regardless in addition to this newly useful cap battery making their mid slots even harder to spare for tacklerecharge rate has nothing to do with it higher capacitor percentage gets nossed lower doesnt if i am nossing your drake and you have 96 of your capacitor but im flying a harbinger and only have 45 of mine my nos is fully effective nos is a great module to fit but you have to understand how it works it isnt the brainless module it used to beof course you fit a neut so you should be able to make good use of itwhat about in the context of bs vs bs pvp sofar the only argument the opposition has supplied is that frigates will be harder to kill than before which i dont necessarily agree with the exact same ships that would be overpowered with this change are just as effective now using small nosnos would not be affected at all only neuts aka effortless paralytics do i use neuts yes would this change nerf some things i do yes700 cap protected at the bs level is a big deal when being neuted but it will still require skill to manage
im not opposed to moving cap batteries to hi slot forces you to choose between damage nosneut and cap protection
this would be an enormous boost to interceptors and drams if the pilot isnt dumb and hasnt made a mistake you have to neut them to kill them if you cant completely drain their cap with a hit from neuts they can just run away
so what do you lose other than a killmail which the assembly hall has affirmed is not the reason people pvp
only battleships and amarr recons can have neuts over 20km and how often do you see battleships in pvp nowadays in fleet battles dictors do the tackleit cant be an enormous boost unless majority of pvp was done with battleships and amarr recons
right now there is a lot of csm communication that goes on behind closed doors so to speak when it happens in email exchanges and internal csm forums currently there is no mechanism to declassify any csm communications aside from meeting minutes that happen during the iceland summits onlysince the subject matter communicated between csm and ccp end up public knowledge within a few months then the private communications that happened should be declassified within a few months toothis proposal is retroactive for all past csm 5 communicationsthe csm14 internal forums have almost zero ccp input so im not going to try to debate releasing someone elses communications and the only parts of it that should be censored are materials that remain nda personal informationsuch as telephone numbers no other alterations should be allowedthe purpose for the proposal is to have more csm accountability and give the public insight into the process that happens between the csm and ccp this can help future csms be more effective in their position and also give accountability for individual csm members which is currently lacking as very few things in the minutes are attributed to individualsas for the mechanics of how it works i think the csm is going to have to work closely with someone in ccp who has the ability to edit the forums and need to get the individual devs that made the posts on the csm forums to sign off on ok this can be published otherwise the post will need to be labeled as nda
also this includes relevant email communications and whoever undertakes this huge work needs credit where credit is due
supportedif this proposal isnt accepted i expect you to be the deep throat of the csm mazz
pl needs its forum i would be a bad csm if i denied them
yes please
00 will be all mine changed to csm will be all minewell hate to say it but numbers control the voting so expect mittani aka molles  to control all of csm too sighim just glad he missed out whs for a sec there i thought his insecurities would affect whsso what other games are they to play atm or shall i just continue to concentrate on rl and return to eve in 5 years when maybe things arent so ed
just wow
csm was a bad idea from the beginning told you so
the amount of misplaced smug that always comes from him is cringeinducing just because you were able to fellate your way to metagaming godhood doesnt make you any less terrible at the actual game
sounds like youre pretty mad bro
people still use this
oh no alliances are picking their own candidates and voting as a bloc this is unprecedented in the history of the csmi demand that all csm members who achieved their office through organized alliancewide voting be immediately forced to step down sorry um nearly every person on the csm the people have spoken political parties in my eve arent cool
i thaugt the obj when you present candidates is to vote for you oponent makes sens no double
you say become like 00 isnt already populated by carebears
clearly decisions about 00 sovereignty are best left to highsec nobodies and roaming npcspace wulfpaxxers
if it does come down to this it is indeed time for csm to go
i wonder what wow is like
vovcsm hasnt represented the 00 playerbase and now were getting involved as evidenced by a recent draconian smoking ban in my current city of residence democracy doesnt always work the way you want it to
should be easy enough to require candidates to write which bloc they are inrepresent and restrict them to 1 per blocbenefit is that we get a far greater diversity on the panel null carebears have no clue as to what goes on in lowhigh and viceversa so having an actual democracy is counter productive
tfifyso counterproductive to you but youre provably a jerk so we dont really care what you think also stuff goes on in lowsec
thanks for proving our collective point
does that even count as language i swear humanity is getting dumber by the second
lol oo tears
having mittens as csm would be fantastic and hilarious
that youre all jerks youre welcome good to see we have you in the vanguard
clearly eve is all about 00 naping number warfare and rmt everything else is worthless phaving nc in control of the csm is like having ankh in control of the csm in the end nc are no different than mission running carebears
but i though dt was a major 00 sov holding alliaohwait trollalso if youre not familiar with mancur olson read the rise and decline of nations and you too shall see the light
it seems part of his ceo update was cut off did he give any other information about what game changes he would push for if he was on csm beside keeping jump bridgesor is the entire platform to be you are a null sec lemming in my alliance therefore you will vote as you are told
i believe local should be nuked utterly but failing thatinstead of a leaving the ordering alphabetical why not base it on when you entered the channelcurrent localalpha dawgbait brickbooster brocloaker altdrake pilot 001drake pilot 002drake pilot 003drake pilot 579drake pilot 580fleet commandergeorge wtf bushlogistics altnyx hotdropperminer bot 001miner bot 969obama barack lol not at the topprofitrevelation stalwartsecondary targetsurprise ihas leviathonskillbookthat guyou hatethis isnottheplayer youizscrollingfornew localjumbled blobby messbasically the natives would stand out more near the top while the traffic would only show up near the bottom to get to the top you would have to remain in local after anyone that was in it when you entered so roamers get a little buff botsstatic players get a little nerf and players whose names begin with a well they dont have to fly bait ships anymore
roamers do not need it easier with their local chat while their targets get it harder that said this would achieve exactly the opposite the great advantage of 00 wastelands is that it is easy to see if a red arrives you would almost think ccp prefers that above populated 00 anyway with this change i could when carebearing in a busy system easily keep local chat completely scrolled down so i only have to look if newly arrived is blue or red instead having to scroll through the entire list continiously
well since removing immediate mode from local causes so much carebear rage there has to be a way to change it from being so overpowered to being reasonable so how do you propose to fix local
1 make a 10 times better directional scanner one which is not a worse clickfest than pi ever was the directional scanner has to take over alot of the intel that local provided if you dont do that it will just cause exodus 30 to empire leaving you with fewer targets and the only ones profiting from that are macros i kinda like the submarine idea since we are playing subs in space anyway with active and passive mode where active gives far more intel but also gives away far more intel and should not be usuable inside pos shields also giving standard 1 minute docking timer when using it doesnt seem unreasonable to me2 all npcs  sleeper ai or similar doesnt necesarily mean they should nuke all your drones  more towards omni tank  omni dps doesnt need to be 25252525 but for example for sanshas 35351515 and then balanced such that from pve pov it does not become significantly harder why simple to make the dynamic between pveer and pvper based on more than the current situation which pretty much ends up to if tackled you die if not tackled you survive sure there are some differences especially super caps have enough time when tackled while pveing for backup to arrive or when you get lucky with ecm drones really together with warpstabs they are by far best pirate tear factories in eve but in general it is just when tackled in pve ship you diethe result with sleeper ai is that you can actually get a fight from it instead of a completely onesided gank example handfull of times i have done c3 wormholes in my brick drake with sleepers now neuting i think that is pretty much over once i saw a tengu on scan even though due to range issues i couldnt stay perma alligned i decided to continue my carebearing since at least i knew it wouldnt be that trivial for the tengu to kill me with sleepers in normal space i would either be perma alligned out or if not possible i would have warped out not a chance in hell i would stay unalligned as murphy decides the tengu arrived exactly when i wasnt alligned and i couldnt warp in time so the fight was on and since the sleepers decided a tengu was nicer km than my drake in the end the tengu had to warp off in hull one more volley and he would have been downsome time later same situation except this time i didnt even plan to run but just decided to fight the tengu when he would arrive no one with active brain cells would ever do this in normal space even though i was in a brick drake without propulsion mods about worst ship to be in if you want a fun pvp fight the fight was still quite fun to have both were permatanking each other until i hit a sleeper trigger to get more npcs on the field forced tengu to warp off in hull exactly when his buddy in a raven appeared and i considered i had enough fun for a while so warped out this is quite a wall of text i realise but the tldr is with better ai pvp ship vs pve ship becomes more than completely one sided gank which means pve ships dont need to run for safety the moment an enemy appears within 5 jumps3 now we have done this local chat can be nuked from orbitpfew i cpd copy paste not that other meaning pervert this since forums decided to eat it instead of posting it
last time i suggested improvements to things that would make removing local less painful people slammed me for putting it all together in one topicyou cant win you either post small changes that nobody will agree with due to needing other changes to make it work or post a compilation of changes designed to work together and have people slam you for not posting them separatelyso which is it do people want real solutions or not ive even had people slam an idea simply because i posted itthings like that remind me why im glad the csm has no real say in anything ccp decides to dobut i cant help it i get ideas good ones and im not selfish enough to not share themshrug
this man is talking busyness that is it
having a wall of ideas doesnt suffice you need them to be good ideaswhy not have options to sort local that would make sense and id be behind itatm there is no way to remove local and from the alternate suggestions local still looks like the best solution
that is misleading because it is patently falselocal can be nerfed next downtime but the carebears of eve usually dont understand how it also helps them to nerf local will revolt and cause a instanerf level of forum trollingis there any valid defense for keeping local no but ccp isnt stupid they know that the playerbase needs their fix and wont accept cold turkey without a major change in subscription revenue
and you wonder why you dont get any traction you post patently biased stuff that doesnt correlate to reality and merely sings to the choirno reason to keep local you will see plenty in this forum do your research
i didnt say there was no reason to keep local i said there was no valid defense of keeping locallocal is an absolute in a game that should have none
ok lets take a look at this option suppose we introduce denser versions of ore in nullsec where would it be placed put it in belts and you have massive boost to macro mining profitability  big no put it in gravimetric sites and we have two scenarios if there is enough miners in nullsec to fill in the demand of the local market gravimeric sites would be occupied right after the downtime just like signatures are now if you dont have enough miners to queue up all gravimetric sites then you dont have enough resources extracted to keep the local market healthythats exactly ive explicitly said but i leave that to you about the power projection separating industrial supply routes from combat routes opens much space for experimenting with combat power projection thats the whole point of this proposal  make changes so that localized production in nullsec can happen even if you go as far as removing combat jump bridges from the gamelike ive said this is about indy side of things and the current connection between industrial and combat routes that should be separated in order to have localized production moon goo is another problem and is out of the scope for this proposal what im suggesting is just a ground stone to a larger set of changes that can be implemented later including modifications to moon goo production processincreasing the number of slots in stations involves corporate bureaucracy that can be very complicated or not possible at all in some cases the cost of amarr advanced outpost factory is 36 bil requires a freighter hauling op and a green light from ceo or some director of the corporation that owns the station in some corporations this is simply not going to happen monopolized production dictatorship even not enough isk for an investment like that in smaller alliances i know several corporation ceos that wouldnt give a green light for something like that besides some alliances are not lucky enough to own an amarr factory outpost the only way to seed nullsec market with locally produced stuff is to give the initiative to simple members to contribute while avoiding corporate bureaucracy adding personal effort and personal investmentif we really want to go far with expanding this idea how about an ability to anchor one industrial jump bridge in lowsec that can only be connected to one in 00 space constantly camped nullsec entry points would not be a supply route firewall that can not be passed while at the same time we are spreading pvp through wider lowsec area and making lowsec a little more interesting
those industrial jb will only be used to bring in supplys from high sec not to bring in low end mineralsthe reason for this is mainly that minerals are bigger then the finished modules and that most fits in 00 are t2 fittedthe only way to increase 00 production is to cut the supply line from high sec completelya boost to low end ore in 00 might be a good idea but only in grav sitesthere are no problems with lack of roids once you have a system with an industrial upgrade as that gives you a small grav site at all timesif you clear that small site it will respawn within 5 min so there are more roids then you can dream of  btw i am an industrial player in 00atm i mainly bring in stuff from high sec mainly t2 modsand for productiona large pos can hold a lot of assembly arrays with a lot of production slotseve is an mmo so work with your corp to get a production pos up and you have all the slots you want
lowends can be gotten through reproc mining and loot you can up the frequency of the npc hauler spawns increase base yields of roids add roids to places like sanctums tweak loot tables etc plus the requirements can tweaked on bpo level and i am guessing on a production line level imagine if the null facilities had a more granular material modifier that eased the lowend requirementnot doing something out of fear of the bots is silly theyll latch onto anything with a bottomline and are currently present on the market in pi in belts in missions in sanctums in  you get the ideasooner or later ccp will come up with a plan that taps into the community and alienates the bot handlers witch hunts can be quite effective if directed but there will always be bots so we shouldnt be yielding game improvement options due to themsince we are already talking a major overhaul then why not update stations to 2010 as well the individual racial flavours would still be there on the basic level but why cant a large production annex be slapped onto a matari stationprices can also be adjusted hell you can take your array idea make is even beefier and add an external target to shoot so insurgents can shut down extra manufacturing temporarilyif you havent familiarized yourself with the dead horse yet then i can only recommend it a similar modular system would be downright awesome for outposts pos are secondary nowyou are still clinging to the unbilical time to let mother dearest have her life back as long as the majority of manufacture can be done locally you dont need highsec for anything but rarities instead of moving 100 freighters with items and lowends you move 23 jfs with bottleneck materials for t2t3 production  trick is to make null selfsufficient if they put in the effort and trade them vulnerable supply lines if they refuse to work for a living  seems a fair trade no
thats a strange line of thinking are 00 alliances more likely to use bots than to import miners from empire is warrior only kind of workforce that should be required in 00 in that case why not remove all economy except isk for npc built ships and modules or redesign mining to be more interactive and require 00 to be built on localresource selfsufficiency it only depends on what kind of game eve is supposed to bebesides with removal of jump bridges and buff of local production any profitability of bulk materials would be local sure you could mine lots of trit but you wouldnt move it you would use it locally only reason why trit is moved now is cost effectiveness its cheaper to haul it across the eve cluster than mine it locally
yestimecards aside you dont have to do anything to compensate your own botting alt
drop that you dont need to make producing in 00 even less competitive compared to empire you could even go for a reduced production time bonus insteadseparate industrial jump bridge networks is silly honestlythe proposal is well intended but i dont see it achieving the stated goals so cant support itincreasing oremineral availability is not a buff but a nerf because their value drops with increased supply not mentioning worse volumeisk ratio is bad for logistics for reference check what happened to hi ends after dominionif you want to buff 00 mining by increasing output you have to reduce the output from other sources to at least balance out the overall supply
or make jita 44 cnap an amarr station
lol problem of overpopulation in jita solved lol
the amarr stations give me flashbacks of being father omalleys altar boy not happy times its why i avoid amarr space completely please let me shut off the creepy kidtouching music
afaik currently the only things that use defenders are rats remove the almost pointless things from the game due to the processing time missiles take i would have thought we would gain something from that then grouped missiles can be treated as 1 entity rather than how many missiles you have grouped reducing further load the theory being that missiles dont need to be individual if one of them cant get hexploded by a defender smart bombs would blow the whole lot up anyway as they where all launched at the exact same moment so they should all be in smart bomb range or notalso if not already all other weapons should be treated as 1 entity further reducing the load so no real reason why this shouldnt happen but as always i am open to discussion not trolls this wont effect anyone greatly but should improve performance across the whole of eve in theory anywaywhile we are it remove all ewar except tackle from standard belt rats it serves only to annoy not deter making it pointless
making ratting easier is not the answer ewar is fineif anything it needs to be improved upon maybe just make it so rats follow the same rules as players and cant ewar from 150km like they can right now as for defender missileswho cares nobody uses them at alli seriously doubt that their existence is an issue at all grouped missiles are already treated as one entity in space you would know this if you read the dev blogs being a missile junkie myself i would like to see missile load on the server be reducedremoving defender missiles will not do that although in the years i have played i have never once fired a defender missile
ok but removing the defenders would stop the thousands of npcs from firing thousands of them and as i said npc belt rats ewar except tackle is pointless and irritating
ok the fact that alot of npcs use defenders and that mitigates missile spamming ships dps if you remove defenders from the picture then caldari missile boats will practically be the only option for any pve combat do too the fact that they have no falloff or optimal rangeturret based systems are good but missiles already outperform in many areas in pve this mainly due to the fact of the long range of missiles and that they always hit missiles do not need this buff in pve keep defenders on npcs take them out as an option for players and adapt the new ai to all pve content it will actually lengthen the time it takes to start soloing lvl 4s and encourage teamwork maybe even have the side effect of making it impossible to solo 4s in a drakeput all standard ewar webs  scrams plus the ewar type for the race on the pve ships with the new ai see how much pve content changes and then i would say feel free to remove defenderstldr buff npcs add ewar and new ai to all npc factions

first i would like to state that i dont intend this thread to argue the meritsfaults of the new ecu pi system what im hoping to get is vote support and perhaps draw some attention to ccps lack of community response to questions myself and others are having with the new pi systemquestions likeis deletion working as intendedare the ecus working as intendedare you currently looking into or troubleshooting any issues regarding this topicpersonally im not having issues with the new pi system but i have read some very detailed topics of people expressing rational concern and only wanted an answer from ccp some have submitted bug reports and support tickets without response i think the lack of response has served to escalate an issue that could have been prevented with proactive interaction from ccp with either the csm andor the community i am disappointed in the lack of response from ccpit is my hope that support of this thread will help the community get a response from ccp either by the volition or by prompting from the csm while i find this may be a long shot as most gambles like this on the forums are you miss every ball you dont swing atbaseball referencecheers
instead you should demand that ccp stop wasting your time ingame in unneeded travel times by reducing the distances between all gates by half
just tweak the warp speeds so you get at your max warp faster and decelerate from warp faster
as a truck driver is rl yes the route can get boring and repetitive at times but you still have to be at the wheel and have to pay attentionnot supported we need proposals to decrease afk players not increase
increase autopilot warpto range to 20km thatll sort the sheep from the goatsas for ganking freighters who are wtz  all freighters still take a very long time is it about 3540 seconds to align during which the wtz pilots are just as gankable as the ap zombies
ok im sure anyone here who pops into the test server feeback section of the forums will no doubt notice that 90 of the threads in that section is of course not feedback but one of either two things either ban request probably by far the most common thread name in that section to dateor cannot connect to serverinsert currant most popular connection error message here happens alot even though there are many thread duplicates of the exact same problem which are even in the thread titlesi am essentialy proposing removing the test server feedback section from the eve technology and research center and giving it its own section with 3 subsections including  feedback ban requests and test server connection issuesits a simple change which i hope could come in with the new forums we are supposed to be getting soon  hopefully with working search bar that searches the forum and not the entire internet
yes i wish we did have more forum for the test server
why the heck do we keep settling for less i had these icons and it helped me to see clearly how many people were on the overview now from the diving decision making process handled without anyones permission theyre suddenly gone and only appy to the personal contact list no doubt something team gridlock came up with to remove strain from the server we must bow to performance bow everyone bow can i please have my game back as i one played it please
rather counter intuitive id suggest you simply dont bring your bpos to null at all a more simple solution and putting such basic things as core industry into the volitile environment of giant nullsec blobs can do nothing more then hurt the market and put even more power into even bigger nullsec blobs which ccp is actually attemtping to avoidyaaay all around except for those in nullsec manufacturing i guess
this if you use the stop command at any point between dock and being accepted to dock the docking is canceled even if used while in warp
ill rephrase myself for you1 an adjustment to already existant mechanics can be tuned however ccp feels the crap like it doesnt actually change anything thus i dont particularly care either way2 if people want to do something in the stupidest way possible theyre allowed to its their problem not yours if you manage to be harmed by this its your problem not theirs and i rather think ccp made it pretty transparently obvious they wanted at least a specific amount of people to work together for incursions they even made it so theres no reason to not bring more within the allotted amount if you want to go leetpro and feel special doing an incursion site with less then the recommended which is just as bad as overkilling it with a giant blob just harder you can and get paid less3 this sounds about as intelligent as we should get increased rat bounties when fleeting with corpalliance if you want to farm incursions fine i encourage you to if you want to get paid more then others because youre farming incursions go die in a fire4 see point 15 if you cant see how this makes no difference at all is easily bypassed and in fact encourages the blobing you hate so much6 see point 1my indifference to the adjustment of details doesnt make the other bad ideas any better
no one replied in 2 weeks i guess i could elabroateany decent pilot has a skill plan and it generaly involves training skills that are affected by 2 attributes for a few months at a time so instead of leaving the other 3 implant slots empty create skill hardiwirings that will fill these first 5 slots pvp hardwirings prefferably
no
the disable engine button is more so to stop drifting sentry drone users would appreciate it this the most but not drifting in any situation would be nice
when ccp stated they may remove jump bridges from 00 to encourage pvp and activity you would expect people to be happy but you cant please everyonewith simple changes such as jump bridge removal or supercap changes high ranking dictators of a certain coalition have made it their ambition now to control all seats in the csmnow normally i would post this in caod but considering how csm elections affect everyone and the plan is to punish non sov holding alliance including lowsec pirates and empire i figured i would post it hereall this because jump bridges might get removed in this election there will be no democracy
edit ok so i see evelopedia is not up to date ignore thiswhere would one get the new csm rules or whatever they are called cant find a neat uptodate pdf anywherewhile were at it why is vuk lau on his third term right now to quote evelopedia here
jump bridges wont get removed they are population enablers flat out removing them is not good for the effective niche once ccp realises that and i am pretty sure they already have in their discussions with the csm 5 they will look at factors and variables related to what is commonly referred to as fck jumpbridges omg wtf do not touchits a topic of projection of force and that is pretty much the scope of it nothing moreas for control over the csm heh there is no social engineering ccp as long as there is transparancy at ccp and from the csm towards players when transparancy is absent you see special interestsccp does what it wants either way no matter how cool a csm member can be with them or how brosefs or awesome the only way to influence ccps decisions through providing them with well argumented metrics founded and properly communicated actions with accountability is to really treat it as a job in that way csm is no different from playing eve some would say pso yes there will be two goon candidates one or two candidates from morsus mihi there will be one or two candidates from russian backgrounds so what either way this is really a topic for jit park and not something to throw around elsewhere as it is a csm topic evelopedia is not up to date often ccp changed the term length and removed the term limit for csm 5 and onwards
perhaps only consecutive countsor he sold his char to his brother or something and it isnt the same person anymore officially 
no when people apply they have to also provide personal info such as their name im sure ccp would let their userbase know that the character running for election that had a previous post isnt the same person anymore for the sake of those that voted for the other person previously
if the csm actually mattered i might be concernedstill having said that most of the leadership of the nc are whiny selfentitled egotists and the south are no better playerowned nullsec has just turned people into elitist ers who think that their way is better than everyone elses and anyone wanting to do anything else is a pubbie or carebear or whatever derogatory term is flavour of the month nowmittens can do whatever the hell he likes kinda of the point im trying to make here tbh but if you start forcing your gameplay onto others then youre straying into the bounds of delusions of grandeur and it might be time to step back and think about what youre doing for a while
incursions nerfed jump bridgesplus most 00 alliance leaders are hated by the majority non 00 eve
ccp already know the jump bridges are bad for pvpit doesnt matter what csm think
wts my vote
players as a whole never have the welfare of the entire game in mind which is why the csm can only ever be advisory
this tbh
the issues that are brought to csm and actually supported are not lawccp will notice this and nothing dramatic would actually happen if one party controlled all of the councilthis is an egomaniacs fantasy nothing more
csm is currently only used as a thinktank to prioritise a shortlist of minor updates designed to placate angry subscribers while ccp work on other gamesit will be many years before ccp look to the csm for actual game ideas or fix any of the issues the csm has been bumping for years now
they gotta secure their rmt income somehow you know
moved from eve general discussion
hahahahaha props for beating me in making that char i am ing lazy lately
i fail to see any problem with 00 
you must be blind matealso hi marlona
some of my corpmates have been talking about pi being worse now but i disagree i tried pi before and quitthe clickfest was too much to even care about how much was being produced now though i actually have restarted my pi stuff and have expanded 1 thing to notice on the new system is links are not instant you have to upgrade links to move not just more m3 but more m3 per hour the new time interval has made me have to make adjustments in how i manage and upgrade them 2 i too have had to put less refineries on mining planets but this just makes the importance of dedicated production planets more critical people who dont specilize what colonies are doing are going to cause unavoidable bottlenecks resulting in less production 3 consider that the new limitations might be somewhat intended to get people to actually lvl5 some of their pi skills to get more advantage before the new system i wasnt planning on lvl5ing any of them but with the new system i just might i personally dont want pi to be mindless if its mindless and easy everyone is going to do it and none of the products will be of value the new system i think is a step in the right direction and i expect future updates to make pi more engaging and entertaining and profitable accomplishing that doesnt necessarily mandate more production as the most plentiful resource in eve is veldspar and mining it is probably the least fun and profitable thing you can do in eve
ive also had to rejigger my pi networks since the change and clearly some things are easier and some things are more difficult but i dont necessarily think this is a bad idea for the stuff i was doing i personally like the new pi betterpi 10 frontloaded all the thinking once you had your colony designed and set up it was all mindless clicking pi 11 moves some of the thinking into the daytoday operations and also makes colonyecu positioning more challenging because of depletion and the ability to extract more than one resource with an ecuin one of the industry threads theres a mention of the 8020 rule and pi 11 seems to be a step towards that it is obviously going to be disruptive to some established ways of doing thingsif you feel that the changes are too disruptive and need some tweaking then by all means raise a proposal in ah so it can be debated and possibly addressed by the csm a good starting point might be taking the current planetary interaction omnibus proposal and reworking it to bring it in line with pi 11
one way that this could be achieved with for example station services is giving them a very low hp amount but decent resists  somewhere along the lines of 90  95 but only 510000 or so hp this means that a very small gang can incap them but also that a single logistics pilot will be able to rep it back up in a matter of minutes this would mean that even very small gangs would have a way of disrupting the enemies home base luring them out to defend themselves and or repair the damage but bringing a much larger gang would have no real advantage other than the fact that they probably would not come out as easy it would also mean that if they do bring a large gang and kill everything they would probably get bored and leave without a response enabling even a handful of players to quickly repair the damage
to me this sounds like the same situation with fleet shield boosts after fleet jumping to a new system your max shields go up but your current stays the same its more ccp is afraid to fix this for fear of opening up an exploit due to gate jumping too lazy to fix the issue with real code so working as intended even though the mechanic is obviously broken ccp htfu and fix the issues instead of dodging the issuesdl
whoever would have thought that a panel made up largely of clueless nobodies would fail to produce anything of valuecant wait for the next csm where the wannabes get kicked out and people from 00 who know how eve works are calling the shots
you forget eve isnt about 00 only and you delude yourself in believing having csm 100 nc will change anything considering your strategy in game is to make everything safe i would say having a 100 nc panel is like having a 100 ankh panelbesides mittani rejects any opinion even elvenlords that goes against his i cant wait to hear what he wants changing in 00 already he has briefly mentioned that he wants 00 to be safer he wants jump bridges to be buffed and wants to punish non sov holding alliances careless of where or what they do

realistic police is fine if concord was realistic theyd pod suicide gankers and blockade clones in stations until they undergo trial  pay a fine for damage caused dlosing insurance for concordonken make sense it doesnt make ganking impossible it just make it more expensive
first its about time warping gets an upgrade we all spend a fair chunk of our time in warp so make it feel and look good give it a pace that is worth the many hundred times the speed of light we attain we fly stupidly fast its got to be mind blowing cool a web is meant to slow a ship down right yet some people appear concerned about loosing the ability of using them to make things go faster to me its just wat

the problem with the because of market schtick is that it can only be used if all other things are equal which they are demonstratively not  angel lp is considerably easier to get by and thus supply is not limited as much as the alternativesregardless price is not balance never will be and never should bemy initial assessment still stands reduce fittings to a point where tankdual prop becomes impossible without sever gimpage and it is balanced
what about rasing other faction frigs to the level of the dramiel instead of nerfing this one
all the others are actually pretty well balanced within the class and against destroyersif everything were brought on par with the dramiel the entire class 20 hulls would need to be looked at
if you would even consider forgoing a 20 hybrid bonus to opt for projectiles there is something majorly wrong with hybridsthe balance point should be that the weapons would be a tossup without bonuses and the bonus should make their use a nobrainerperfection might not be possible but thats a pretty broad target where improvement should be pretty easy
yeah its pretty hard to miss the target for improvement here
the proteuss wake limiter subsystem should have its bonus increased to 10 per level if not 15 as it is not really useful right nowthe gravitational capacitor wap speed bonus of the tengu and the proteus should be increased to 40 per level to make a difference in combat

i propose that with the launch of incarna ccp make use of a semiopen source format to allow players to create new clothing and station itemsthe system would work something like thisccp publishes the base design specs for clothing and station items and the acceptable format for submissionsplayers create clothing and station items and submit them in the approved format to ccpccp vets the design to insure that it is consistent with the overall aesthetic of eve this could be done through a panel of developers designers and artistsitems accepted into the program become the intellectual property of ccpthe player is provided with a blueprint of the item which could then be manufactured and sold in gameadvantages of this system1 allows for a much larger variety of ingame vanity items2 allows players to directly contribute to the atmosphere of the game in a way that does not unbalance game play3 frees up ccp staff to develop the game rather than spending time on minutiae4 designs are turn key implementation costs are near zerodisadvantages of this systemyou tell me
heh i once tried second life the amount of garbage there is simply repulsive other bad sides include not enough people in ccp to deal with all the garbage players will make imagine forum trolls with power to create in game items thatll end well  increased server load increased bandwidth requirements etc
are you talkling about in stationsbecause i could get behind that
i dont think you would get a glut of garbage ccp would provide the format not the tools the creator would still have to be fluent in 3d design and have access to some fairly expensive software this would weed out most of the crap the rest could be taken care of through a design council which would still be less labor intensive than bottom up design by ccpbandwidth wouldnt be an issue as all the items could reside clientside
1 for more cool stuff
so something like stos modifiable uniforms and ships then
second life is filled with rubish because there is no vetting this system could work
anyone play apb i know i know fail game but the characteritem creator was very impressive im all for customization of vanity items course id love custom decals for our ships too im all about figureheads

according to a recentmost recent csm meeting with ccp they openly admitted that gallante was brokenhowever its not going to be fixed because its an issue which affects no one because no one flies gallente
yeah its just a second most popular race in eve after caldary what happend to the attitudehere a couple months ago this was a serious forum where people where determined to get things straight now half the poests i se are along boobie phyzix for spacebarbies trolls are nice and fun but common
no they didnt they only returned back to csm members witch werent even agreed anyway questioning if blasters were suffering from a knockback effectwell nerfing webs is what we can call knowkback effet nerfing plates is another knockback effect speed drawbacks of armor tanking mods are another knockback effect tracking issues are another knockback effect and so onnow does the feedback sent by players after two years of different posts about blasters rails gallente ships bonus etc is realy worthy when you read that 3rd party csm textfranckly no is this gonna change after the csm changes personnel no of corse not those guys dont care about anything else than their own objectives and wishes they are not there to properly select and point what is going wrong if it doesnt servehelp their causethe absolute silence from devs team at each thread only demonstrates the point above either they dont have the feedback wich is impossible since they read forums at what they say either they dont know how to fix the problem when your read that coment knockback effect seriously all the possible solutions and ideas coming from players are already there is not our job to start writing code lines to adress the situation is it
proof reading is a wonderful skill to have when publicizing things
iwe consider the response time for handling petitions is unacceptable slowthis thread demands that a significant improvement is made in this regard specifically that ccp provide a clearly stated service level agreement which includes a pledge that a stated minimum percentage of petitions will be handled within a stated specific maximum time framethis thread suggest an initial target of at least 80 of petitions receive an initial human gm response within 24 hoursthe sla be subject to continuous improvement over time the csm vigorously pursues an improvement from ccp in this matter
supporting my own proposal
im afraid i cant support this id love to see faster petition response times as im sure we all would but theres only so many gms and only so many hours in the day what i would like to see however is a censure system for fradulentfrivolous petitions whereby those people who abuse the system either my miscategorizing to get a reply faster or by petitioning over blatently petty and stupid things are given a lower priority than the lawabiding citizens with genuine issues and enquiries
waiting days sometimes weeks for a petition response is inexcusable you cannot excuse such poor customer service ccp should hire more gms if thats what it takesmost games even ftp respond within hours
i recently saw a proposal by vaerah vahrokha on md to create a charity corp
i support the proposal on the grounds that ccp dont have to monitor the account just whenever a plexforaid chance comes up they could check on the accounts on the list of donors to make sure they are active and maybe even prod them into action  whoever runs the plexforaid thing could just make a note of the accounts involved and check them at the right time its in their interest to do this and would help mobilise this a bit more
i like the modifications caldari that would leave the oversight of graft and corruption in the hands of the players and ask ccp to handle what we cant eg hit by a bus
already suggested many times but cant hurt to support it once more
i wonder why it wasnt implemented already since it shouldnt be hard at all

so youre suggesting 50 interconnected changes to the game where the adoption of any strict subset of them will  it to hell and back awesomeliang
you really are a tooldo battleships need neuts to handle frigates no they never have and still dontdo i think battleships should be helpless against frigates not at alldo i think neuts are overpowered absolutelydo i think cap batteries are largely pointless most of the time currently you betso lets cut to the chase the sky is not going to fall the world is not going to end unless you are incapable of adapting
yay i knew you could resort to personal attacksyeah they really do drones are nom nom nom foodthen why are you suggesting frigate immunity to one of the only things that can actually stop themthen youre wrongyoure only somewhat rightits not exactly hard to adapt when the only ship skills youll ever need are racial frigate 5 and racial cruiser 5liang
the truth is what it isneuts are just one method and those only started being popular after the nos nerfim not suggesting frigate immunity to anything im suggesting a reasonable amount of cap protection for any ship that wants to fit a battery will frigates do it probably not since the smart ones cant be neuted anyway how do you kill those incidently or do you just log off when that happensnope i leave that to youthus the most word it is very useful for not conveying an absolute condition but average people mostly never get that so i dont blame youdemonstrate this show us the overpowered neut proof ship and setup with this idea that actually does the job it needs to do and isnt just handicapped in some other way
you are under the mistaken illusion that i have to prove you wrong however seeing as how this has rightly has a 0 chance of ever making it into the game i dont have to all i am going to say on the matter is that one of the very few counters to nano ships is a curse or heavy neut ships with so few counters will make the sacrifice to fit a cap batteryyou say that neuts werent ever used until nos was nerfed but this is false cap warfare was always usedyou say a lot of things that are either outright untrue or skirt the edges of the truthand none of it matters because this has no chance of making it into the game enjoy your last free bump shrugliang
thats where you lost any credibility you still had alright op lets stop feeding the trolls
as a matter of fact the one suggestinglobbying for a change should have to prove hisher point not someone claiming the current state is fine otherwise we could just resort to l2p  no you  your mumstyle of argumentation especially when the line of argumentation is as hmm shady as here but yeah whatever not gonna happen most likely anyway
wrong the person making the point has to prove their own point liang has no point if he isnt willing to back it up
ill reemphasize that battleship vs frigate relationship is not significantly influenced by the proposed battery changewhybecause frigate can equip small cap injector which will work nicely against 24 second heavy neut cycles the only point where small cap injector will start failing on a frigate is when theres more than 2 neuts on the frigateit is also worth noting that we rarely see any frigates equipped with small cap injectors in fact i havent seen any such setups in pvp that suggests frigates are not willing to sacrifice mid slot of antineut protectioni believe the most concern with this battery change is the effect on cruisers and larger ships talking about frigates with regard to these changes is just stupid they are the least effected
what do you lose other than a killmail i think some people play to win pvp fights if you cant then that is rather dumb and beyond that you can easily lose your ship as ceptors would suddenly be invincible to larger ships drams are already fairly overpowered if no one could neut them they would simply become even more powerfulive mentioned this before ill mention it again neuts should be more chance based just like everything else with an optimalfalloff gunsewar they shouldnt do a uniform damage to cap if that change occurred the defenses against neuts already in the game would be more than acceptablea lot and not true ive been in quite a few bs v bc fights recently i remember several ceptors pinning people down in these fights as well im not sure if the mods will allow this to stay linked but here is a battle from two weeks ago i vividly remember those dramsdaredevil causing all sorts of trouble partially because they were instrumental in killing off the dictors thus becoming the primary tacklerswe havent yet mostly because it does very little for them if this change went live they would become more important than a dcu ever has been
which will make them easier to kill by more mundane means most nano ships are going to have to give up substantial shield tank if they want to fit a cap battery which may or may not be useful to them some people will go for it others wont and gameplay becomes more varied than i haz neut and you dont i win
nano ship countersccp destroyed all nano ships the current nano ships are nothing compared to the old days nano tactics were completely destroyedand even before they were destroyed by ccp there were more counters than a curse they died by the 100s every day just finelet us reverse the nano nerf then ill completely support neuts and nos without any counters like this battery idea
newsflash the other guy running away means you won the fightwhat dram pilot is going to fit a battery and what are they going to not fit in its placehow do you even make this happen without totally changing what a neut does the main premise to this thread is not to nerf neuts it is to buff cap batterieswait so you think every frigate will be fitting not only a cap battery but a cap booster too i think reality has left you
not only have i been neuted ive been ecmed by a falcon webbed by a rapier and tackled by an arazunerf neuts scrams webs and ecm nerf everything that i cant use and buff the things that i can
oh look a straw manecm has a counter webbing somewhat has a counter tbh i kind of think overdrives should provide a little web resistance and warp disruption also has a counter
cool idea br0supported
not supportedwhy1 i dont care about internal conversations between csm members and csm  ccp as long as stuff gets done2 only a handful of people would read that anyway its basically a transcript that you can only read and not join the discussion only beneficial to eve addicts that doesnt have a life out of the game3 for any conversation purposes information about candidates and active csm members theres already a pretty good place where you can actually have direct conversation with your csm member of choice or discuss topics that happen between csm members and between csm and ccp
crowd control has been tackled by ccp already by sending people farther away for missionsi would say ccp should turn this a bit smarter the actual system population will still contribute on how far you will be send away but in addition the amount of missions in a system on a day will be taken into considerationlike a overworked trafficer at the airport the quality of the agents should lower themselvs when they got too much to do and the quality should raise when they havent got any missioners who take their missions onon how many missions a day are given out by a mission hub agent i dont know but for the easy example take 200 with 200 missions a day a agent would have only a quality of q20 with max 10 missions a day his quality would raise to q20 the social skills like labour connections could contribute more activly to negate a bit the quality loss tell me what you think its only a first thought but i think this could spread people a bit one advantage could be the boosting of low sec a bit the agents there wont be giving away many missions a day in addition low sec agents quality should be able to raise to 25 or 30 according to their status
i think that you should pay more attention on how you play your game instead of looking how other people play theirs i also think that you are not in this game long enough or not informed enough to know that the quality of missions decrease already if you use one agent too much
i wonder why in this forum there are so many who start with insults instead of contributing in a normal wayi am in the game for about 25 years now that the quality of missions decrease i didnt know of except that you still get another faction mission even if you just delined oneoh and i was talking about the quality level of the agent not the missions meaning you get less lps
the more people run for a certain agent reduces the amount of lp isk and standing given as a reward for a mission already
i really never heard this do have the wiki entry or the dev blog for me i couldnt find it in here
nah i didnt mean to insult you the first sentence is meant to give you a general advice about posting any suggestion anywhere including eve online suggestions that will benefit the majority of players affected by the change are generally accepted while most of the suggestions that are targeted to nerf a specific group without any benefit for the affected players is either heavily biased troll or not formed well enough replies to such suggestions will be formed around assumption that the original poster belongs in one of those three groups ive picked 1 biased randomlythe second sentence is just an assumption based on what youve requested in your original post since quality of missions already decrease if you use the same agent too much to the point that after some time that agent becomes practically useless to you adding a modifier that would have an even bigger impact would be just too muchim sorry if you felt that i insulted you but im still not supporting this proposal
oh allright then well i am heavily on your side not to nerf missions as they got nerfed quite much already still i must admit my idea was it to make the milk sour so you wont stay forever in one system also based on the probability that no system would ever stay alone long enough to get q20 id say that there could be a small nerf to missioners in high sec but as there are already no non faction mission agents in high sec that gives you higher then q18 one could say that there will be several q1617 or 18 then which could be a buff for missioning compared to the situation nowwould you have and supportive suggestions on how to make my basic idea to spread people to meet your views also what do you say to a positive influence on low sec when there would be base on the system suddenly 25er agents or even 30er this could be long awaited boost on low sec without nerfing high sec keyword risk vs reward
more epic mission arcs the players must want to spread not be forced to do sothe amount of lp and isk you get already depends on a security status of a system the agent is in for example the lvl4 q18 agent in 03 system will give more lp and more isk per mission than the agent with same properties in 08 system faction warfare missions give even more rewards and items that are unique to fw loyalty points stores lowsec is rewarding enough but most players are just not willing to take the risk
what with the epic mission arcs would bring a solid lvl 4 missioneer to start running around the universe standings will hardly be the reason as they have usually good standingsabout the sec status and the reward i did know of that is why some systems are overrun with missioneers imaginge you dont have to be in 05 to get most lpsif lowsec is rewarding enough i cant say personally i havent done them yet but i think when you consider standard market rules of supply and demand one could argue that the rewards arent as tempting that they meet the demand
rewards and refreshing new gameplay and content the story actual fiction in mission descriptions in epic arcs that are already implemented is pretty good too its a shame hardly anyone reads ityou already dont have to be there there are some pretty profitable agents in highsec that are almost forgotten just because people rush to the agent with the best attributes for example there are level 4 thukker tribe agents in altrinur and their lp store offers nomad set of implants pretty cool for highsecforgot to mention cosmos agents and missions spread through a whole constellation in each racei havent done any regular missions in lowsec either was too busy hunting pirates i did run fw missions for a couple of months when they first appeared and i must admit that i liked the rewards but then i moved to nullsec and stayed there ever since for the pvp content in 00 not the pve
i believe in jumpbridges they are real
i am readyfree the little defencless nc
my cat ran for csm once
please visit your user settings to reenable images
i hope next csm will bring up more issues with lo sec and non oo alliance pvp whatever its not like mining etc couldnt use improvement either like making it more exciting whatevercouldnt really care less about fleet lag

i suggested it because of roleplaying what will all those rightclickfreed slaves dothey need counseling and a slow reintegration into society they need to learn a trade so they can support themselves and become fully appreciated among their tribesmeni dont intend to just hand them a datacore certificate of freedom and send em on their wayso long now get lost thats not me i feel responsible for the slaves i keep in my hangar waiting for the bureaucracy to settle on how to handle themi believe we have a nice opportunity to free the slaves and to add a mechanic to cycle through different personages via pi or whatever convert slaves to citizens  janitors etc fueled by various now useless trade goods as seen hereand i dont want to deny the amarrplayers the chance to redeem themselves by freeing their slaves but they should have a choice thats what makes eve great choice its not like wow where id be sol as an orc if i see the error in my waysthe beauty of such a system is that evil guys start at a base free folks and invest tons of training to convert them to slaves whereas the good guys start at a base enslaved folks
freeing slaves should be an option but i think a little thoughtdiscussion needs to go into the mechanicsit used to be possible through important missions i think this is the best route it would be necessary to include similar enslavement missions for for amarr characters for captured tourists refugees etc1 any standing gain should be minuscule allowing the side stepping the existing standing mechanics should not be the primary objectiveit should be a logarithmic return so that at low levels of standing it requires few slaves but once a character has achieved higher standing freeing many more slaves is necessarystanding  10  single digit numbers make a difference10  standing  20  tens20  standing  30  hundreds30  standing  40  thousandsetcstanding gain should be countered by corresponding loss with amarrbalance suggests that the same mechanic should exist for gallente and caldari but how

bump this to he dude above jsut noticed your post my question is what change will that make i want to be able to wap ammo to that appropriate for the range i am engaging at with ease thats a small buff and gerarding your other points speed penalty will make webs obsolete they should still have a purpose if it is per hit then i fit hyperion with 8 electron blasters that fire every second and i get a mega webber when firing them seperately you make a huge number of assumption in your post first of all why did you decide that roftracking should be the advantage of hybrids is that your personal opinion where did that come from lastly if this pos is about looking at guns it is unreasonable to criticize me for not looking at ships that simply is not withing the scope of this post no there is not because there is no reason amarr ships should be able to run missions for hours on small cap boosters but gallente should be bale to run long on active tanks in pvpv because thats their racial feature
it isnt point blank this doesnt change the actual issues your proposal is a tweek not a solution for the issues actuallyif you had read enough about gallente issues in all dedicated threads if you had already contacted gms about this if you had already read the answer from them about the fact that hybrids advantage is the trackingrof then you shouldnt even ask that question whats your point yes it is once again read the forums and the threads all of them and all posts  and you will mabe understand that gallente ships since you compare them with amarr ones have lesser cappower than amarr ones you see where the problem is again not the cargo space but the ships cpupgcap base vs amarr counterparts in the same tier same fittingedit before you compare with minies  they dont have that problem neither because of their capless weapon system as you can see the problem is not the cargo space but energy
1 ammo size i think this one isnt really needed i agree that sizes make no sense currently from a rp perspective but quite honestly i dont think all hybrid boats need smaller ammo only the ones designed to actively tank might need the cargo space to bring enough booster charges so easy fix there might be to just increase their cargo space is anyone using those at all2 reload time this is very much needed as long as hybrid guns  well mostly blasters  have to switch ammo in order to do anything useful the current 10 seconds a huge timesink that is totally unfair the problem here is that you have two cases either you roam around with am loaded and thus cannot apply any damage at all during the first few seconds of a fight or youre roaming around with null loaded and have to accept a big decrease in dps because of nulls tracking malus or the 10 seconds to reload whichever you opt to do3 increased tracking for blasters this one depends actually the tracking would be perfectly fine if the blasterboats could dictate range once they got ahold of their victim following djegos input of giving blasterboats the old 90 web there would be no need to tweak blaster tracking then the blaster user would have to make sure to use them at the correct range  ie not going to point blank completely but keeping them at optimal what people try to claim sometimes as could be seen in the argument between djego and the other guy who hides behind an alt is that ultra high tracking or 90 web mean certain death especially to anything without substantial hp buffer that gets in range imho thats not a problem if people drive their frigs into this position its their own fault dont go rubbing hulls with a blasterboat if you cant take a beating4 bigger range for null i strongly disagree on this one blasterboats should not be allround gank platforms giving null more range is not needed it wouldnt help the blaster frigs it would be like a better version of barrack especially in cruiser size and it might unbalance the caldari boats with range bonuses5 rating didnt follow the link i suppose it is some stats comparison what are you suggesting here6 more tracking  damage for rails i dont think we need a tracking bonus on rails what are long range guns used for essentially their purpose is to hit at ranges now artillery has alpha beam lasers have damage so the only niche left would be range which would be ok for rails rails dont have to be equal to the other longrange guns so why not give rails the ability to easily outrange other guns without having to use tracking enhancerscomputers or range rigs i know i know nobody is fighting at extreme ranges as they used to there was a time when fleets engaged at 180km those times are over but think of it more like a way to make it easier to fit a railboat or more precisely make rail fittings be more flexible as they would not need the range mods does that make any sense hmanyways supporting your suggestion as a great way to get those freaking hybrids fixed already thumbs up
large railguns can easily have over 150km of range with t2 ammo this means enemies can just warp to on grid rails range advantage is useless for battleship sized guns and for eaglewhats wrong with rof increase and a clip size reduction
ive always though that adding signal to noise is a far better solutionhave people appearing in local who are not there and their ghost ships showing up on scan but not showing in your overview because they werent really thereyoud get the cried wolf mentality but even better it would give advanatages to those who knew about each others corps read other players bios and made a gut call whether the ship was a fake or not there might need to be some fake covert cynos appear whenever a ghost ship spawned but didnt jump from gate to gatethis keeps all the great multi player sustained universe sense that local helps along by giving us more ways to see each other whether we want to or not while still greatly reducing the free inteligence aspect  and allowing characters to run at any sign of danger because there would far more frequesntly be a sign of dangeri think with constant tweaking it could give a great way to make botting far harder to pull off too while player intelligence might be given more tipoffsand real players could imitate the ghost ship behavior to trip the bots into believeing they were ghost ships
we own the space we build the stations and pay for the sov why the heck cant people who own space have a sense of securityremoving local from nullsec that is a really terrible ideaall these gentlemen who have chosen to live in highsec who primarily gank morons on the jita undock are suddenly these great armchair generals on how to improve where we live in this game they are the same gentlemen who cry about the death of honorable 1v1s and solo pvping meanwhile they have no risk where they live no chance that all of their assets could get trapped in stations an endless supply of lvl 4 missions and were supposed to somehow feel bad that they cant gank our logistics ratters and other peopleseriously how the heck does always feeling not safe improve nullsec at all the investments for living out here are enormous the risks for having a lot of assets out here pretty high and so why should we be suddenly punished by living in a wasteland
1 if you scroll down local it stay scrolled down so you would see immediately when someone enter a busy system if he is placed at the bottom of local it will be a roamer nerf 2 if i want to locate someone in chat having a alphabetic horder is way better than searchig himher in a random position
failed utterly to read the threadnot if it adds the newcomers below the viewable part of the list moving the scroll up as people leave etcthat is rather the point it should not be so easy to use local as an intel tool but eve is 95 carebears these days and nobody wants excitement or a thrill of danger anymore
you know what the consequence of removing local in nullsec would be cloaked gatecamps in every pipe that is regularly used it would last for a few days and then nullsec population would go down faster than a 5 dollar hooker what would be the point of that better come up with a feasible solution instead of some rubbish like thatalso your suggestion in the op is counterproductive for your intentions too as has been pointed out already not supported
the point of 00 isnt that its supposed to be unsafe the point is that the only safety should be that created by the players themselves not by npc space police shooting the bad guys for you or arbitrary wizard hat restrictions against certain types of combat or behaviours a 00 with no local where you could be tackled and blown up without warning at any moment is a 00 that will be totally deserted except for moon mining alts afkorbiting the pos at 500m and the occasional stealth bomberrecon gang stumbling around blindly searching for ratters to gank because the ratters will all be back in highsec running l4s like a sensible person or more likely unsubscribed and playing a better game dominion may have been a hilarious failure in many ways but one of its specific aims was to increase the amount of people living in 00 vs those in empire and just because it didnt succeed particularly well is no reason to believe that ccp are going to suddenly decide the heck with this nullsec bull everybody go to motsu and turn 00 into an unlivable hellhole
heh dont fall on trolls m8anyway 1
well i dont want to nerf the forums so i probably shouldnt support the thread i dont want to see forum threads snuffed just because theyre redundant well they should try to take a slightly different tact buti feel strongly that seeing players names in local adds so much to the sense of a multiplayer environment that eliminating it would be devasting for my sense of place 10 second delaysadding some fals information in addition to the real information hey those could be ok  just let me see the people who are inhabiting a system so i can take the time when i have a chance to click on their names  see corp discriptions bios etc
and the players created local which allows them to ratmine in perfect safety amirite no then maybe they should have to create their own safety like you said without the use of local310 for the doom and gloom though especially when theres wspace to prove you wrong
i cant wait till ccp finally nerfs localthe big alliance people have grown too fat and lazy and in need of serious purging back to empirethe nolocal would come with scanner improvements if overview can show scanner results people will have 15 au warning radius thats at least 10 seconds for fast enemy frigs  enough for carebear battleship to warp off about 1520 seconds for most other hostiles in cases where people jump in and the carebear is less 1 au away the carebear still have time to warp off his battleship before people scan it down with directional scanner initiate warp exit warp finish lock activate mods so if thats enough 15 au scanner radius is also enough
the only people that are afraid of local being nerfed are also the people that should have stayed in high sec
hello there i work have a family and play eve so when i log in eve i dont have much time on my hands of course but why is it so hard to make isk unless you spend hours at itsurely ccp can make it easier for new and older pilots to make isk faster for example put bountys on rats to 5 mill or 10 mill im getting bored of spending a few hours in missions plex whto just get enough to buy a battlecruiser only to lose it in 30 seconds to a gate camp surley if players could get more isk in less time it will make eve a better fun enviroment as everyone likes to be rich and there will be more pvp and less running away ps if i was unemployed yes eve is great i can spend all days in it lolbut for the rest of us 1 or 2 hours is all we can spare so i think my idea a simple raise on bountys will help corps  tax help retain new players as a lot just throw in the towell the first few weeks as they cant buy anything and get bored and help with the fun part as people will be out pvping againg instead of spending days making isk lets pull eve back into fun and less hum drum

theres a lot good in the op an the abovei really like the idea of jump briges because they give players a way of shaping space and a sense of improving their little nation the way romans built their aqueducts etc and something valuable to take away from someone too  no fun if you cant hurt someone and valuable bridges are somthing you can destroybut making them for only industrial ships and maybe a smattering of others if they gimp themselves with special hard to fit moduless keeps the neat part of improving space while vastly nerfing the short response miltiary valueone issue with a move to black ops is that they really take somoene with clost to 30 million sp to operateyou could have specialty alts of course but that stll hits the same problem groups of people whore canny gamers and have played for 6 months to a year should being able to gang effectively without needing a big buddy  they could go along in sbs fine with lower sp but they need a friend with bs v jump cal iv with prereq jump v  cnyno v thats like 3 months of specialized training above and beyond any general competence people need to get first maybe its no different than it is now its not like a bunch of people a year into the game are builiding themselves jump bridge networksbut they can make pledges and alliances and get access to other  longer time players resources in returneven though they cant do it on their own now without renting or doing a bit realpolitickissing but they can get started that way
it shouldnt be dropped for the sake of pi market it also adds effort from the players required and regulates cost for example if i remember correctly the minimum cost per hour in an npc station for a single manufacturing slot is 333 isk on a monthly level thats roughly 240000 isk  job installation cost of 1000 isk per job in jita for example this is 807 isk per hour or roughly 581k isk industrial arrays that last for a month could have a price tag between 250 and 600k isk  enough space to make a difference between different types of arrays without adding up to the cost of the final product no not alliances individuals are more likely to use bots for their own profit if its profitable enough
the problem with localised mining and increasing profitabilityyield of low end ore in nullsec is capitalsupercapital production spam that could get even worse than it is now why industrial jump bridges because they can maintain the supply for subcapital production but would require almost impossible amount of effort for transporting enough materials to add to capital production spam taking out freighters from industrial jbs would make that happen the biggest ship that could pass is an orca  just enough cargo to keep your personal manufacturing business running and not enough to spam supercap production but then again theres always a possibility to haul modules like bartos102 said and avoid production completelyhowever hirana yoshida pointed out one very interesting alternative  modifiers to production requirements of lowend minerals in nullsec factories if the modifiers are blueprint specific or applied to the sub capital personal industrial arrays only that would eliminate the possibility of capital production spam and solve the low end material requirements problem in nullsec for everything sub capital these modifiers if tweaked properly make even the whole idea of industrial jbs obsolete this could be implemented in pair with logistical modifications that should make exporting modulesships from nullsec to empire not possible not easy or not profitableconcerning industrial arrays poses and station upgrades one thing needs to be pointed out there should be enough manufacturing slots for everyone without role requirements for market to be even remotely competitive to highsec one relatively cheap stuff is essential for more pvp lets take a quick look on options in two different situations big corporation and a small one poses  big corp security issues you cant just give roles to everyone especially if you have supercapital production line every big corporation have spies and thieves so making stuff in a public corporate pos is not going to happen private production poses cant be owned by everyone in a big corporation because of two possible things  monopoly and security issues with privately owned poses a great amount of trust must be on both sides player and the corporation to make private poses possible in a big corporation which is very rare in eve and again makes only the handful rich while the others cant use the resources and doesnt produce enough stuff to keep the market healthy privately owned poses also add fuel costs that must be calculated in the price of a final product which makes the stuff not competitive to the imported one poses  small corp again we have security issues and metagaming problems thieves spies but to smaller extent theres also the fuel cost problem a big one station upgrades  big corp great solutions for huge entities that own whole regions of space and multiple stations it would make people create more or even bigger coalitions in order to be competitive i dont really think thats a good idea  station upgrades  small corp well what good is of station upgrades if you dont have at least a couple of stations it will again make blobbing and coalitions favourable which is not really going to help gang pvp instead of fleet one if we boost manufacturing slot numbers just a little smaller corps cant be competitive because they dont have enough slots if we boost it a lot again small corps cant be competitive because a big corp will have even moreone way to solve all presented problems security issues player  corporation not favouring creation of coalitions even more balanced production cost elimination of monopoly and competitive smaller entities is by adding personal industrial arrays in stations that way all entities are given an equal chance as far as they have skilled and capable individuals that can contribute

this should have been posted in feautures and ideas its not near a proposal i thought i was in the other forumive enjoyed both the griefer and blob kills well enoughhave dozens and hundreds but comeon i dont see those type of kills being the paragon of pvp that need to be found more frequentlyand good part of the antil local and anti jump bridge sentiment just wants hopes to at least make more of those types of petty killsheres an idea to stimulate more feisty struggles fairly spontaneous and random  creating incentives for people to put themselves in harms way and maybe take a few more chances against the oddshave a pve activity trigger the opportunity for pvpers to make some isk but give the pver a short window to reship and rally a pitchfork gang to fight for his lootso lets say when you get a faction spawn in a belt or anomaliesif a faction ship gets popped the event opportunity is triggeredthe faction ships have some special piece of equipment that creates a little forcefield of untargetablity around the wreck for 15 minutes and have that field appear in the overview like a cyno field would wreck should have a huge number of hp to prevent the if i cant have it you cant either avoidance strategy so the guy pops the faction guys and hed got to make a choice whether hes going to reship and rally friends to support a possible fight for it or risk that some roving gang will come through before the timer is up and steal his pricey loot there is some juicy opportunity for incorp tension of traitors in your own corp trying to bogart your loot a chance to reveal people for who they really aresure care bears will qq about the risk to their very best part of incomeyet theyll have a true chance to fight for it it will also give another source of income to those people preferring to pvp and taking the risk of roaming hostile systemssome pve groups might pitchfork well others might not and given the fairly short time frame but high reward youd have guys go wtf and fight for the wreck with even odds rather than waiting for a sure win id make the wrecks unpoppable to prevent the if i cant have it neither can you scenario and have them spawn a large warp disruption bubble around the field too to prevent an easy quick loot and warp off situation
i have a better idea why dont ccp just give you free carebear kmsnot supported
i vote for term limits and ccp can either back someone it likes and agrees with or immediately disqualify themthis is ccps game they do and have done a damn good job at what they do term limits though allow the game to grow and continue to engage new players no one wants the same old chronies calling the shots i thought that was the point of electing csms
sovereignty needs a complete overhaul an overhaul that includes changes to pos outposts system upgrades and finally sovereignty itself otherwise itll always be about massing 1 overpowered ship typei dont see ccp doing any real work towards 00 so well end up with more and more scapitals even if they nerf it as the time goes by capital numbers will only increaseeven if you secure all the seats it wont ever matter because both ccp and csm wont have the balls to fix that is beyond broken the jacket were wearing is a jacket no more its a carnival of patches made to patch the patchesbe happy if they nerf sc within 2 years
disallow all people mentioned in those communications for planning to rig the election however inconsequential it may be and by coercion no lesshuh are incursions everywhere now does an incursion prevent a bypass from from being thrown up temporarilyyou can be fairly sure that most 00 people hate the leaders too but they suck it up and muddle along like with real world politicians
wth you must be new to this gameand what makes you think the majority of olderveteran players cares a whit about csm you are being soooo wrong m8 we love our highmighty leader in so many ways that romeojuliet looks like a cheap bmovie in comparison
this is quite possibly the worst post i have read today congratulations sir
is it i see people giving up crying on forums about things that aint get fixed anyway this here
csm are pets of sov null alliances thank god theyre ineffective otherwise all of us who are not sanctum chaining moogoo sucking kb humping blobers will be in big trouble
yep pretty muchtheyre not representatives they are lobbyists
lol in general
allowing the csm much more influence could allow those who can con their way on the csm too much personal influence if not alreadyprobably not good for most of us
its called prioritization or making the best use of your time and resources it means things get fixed and new things get added all the time but in all likelyhood your pet peeve isnt going to be among the things that get fixed and your brilliant idea isnt going to get implemented its one of those necessities of real life so get used to itthe value of the csm is filtering helping with that priorization and help negotiate acceptable solutions to issues while they do represent the people who voted for them and i have been pleased with the representatives i voted they naturally use the opportunity to get their pet peeves fixed too

as the csm applications are about to begin i thought it would only be logical to start my campaign for csm we all know that eve has its problems in fact the only people who say that there are no problems in eve benefit from these problems themselves im talking about broken market mechanics marcos ganking abuse of wardec mechanics etc in fact every day i see posts based on these ideas which ofcourse only seem to attract the trolls adding such enlightening comments aslol carebearmmmm cry some moretears fuel my shipand so onas csm i would work towards a future where players opinions matter and allowing us to mold the game around the communitya wise man once said  a reasonable man will change to suit his surroundings an unreasonable man will change his surroundings to suit himself i believe in this idea but i obviously dont mean for my own personal gain i am talking about the gamer community as a whole its time that we took control of our game its time me made the choicesso vote for me and be unreasonable an outline of my referendumintroduction of mechanics that will destroy the macro armies and restore stability to the marketreplace the mechanics of ganking in order to stabilize trade and make the game more entertaining for criminalsmodifications to the wardec system to prevent unwanted griefingincreased system defense mechanics that will allow smaller alliances to secure spacei am of course willing to answer all questions you may havethanks you for readingps i know a load of you want me to do my avatar i just havent got it right yet
me sighs
not until you have a face at least
whats your opinion on bloodline change for freeiskplex
griefing is unwanted
well i certainly dont feel using rl money is right our characters belong to us and we should be able to decide what they are like i would say that something like a bloodline or ancestry should be able to be manipulated at will maybe for an ingame isk pay out on a side note our avatars should also be changeable at will in game maybe we could even start buying bling for our characters
may want to rethink your choice of quotation hereunless you mean to say you are unreasonableoh wait
their is a reason why they call it griefing
seconding thisbullet meet foot
thats exactly what i meanthink about it do you want a perfectly acceptable and agreeable csm who isnt going to get anything done and be a complete waste of space or do you want to make your vote mean something by voting for someone who will fight your corner
not if you were the only candidate and voting was mandatory
wasnt there like a special forum or something where junk like this can be dumped
i found your problem
two worst ideas ive come across in a long timeyou cannot replace the mechanics of anything it would amount to replacing combat mechanics read soe nge starwars galaxies and that is bad at its corealso attempting to goes against eves entire core of being cold and harsh
id actually prefer a nice plant for my corner to help the feng shuimaybe you can fight the snowdrifts outside instead
i think there might be people who want itgriefing and being griefed loosing and winning  people sometimes call it playing a game
you must hang out with some very weird people
i am sure mr zedrik cayne will have something to say about thisalso get out
its never griefing anyway
ha i am sure he will write an essay as soon as he can
i play eve after all
sad thing is most mongs will probably vote for it rememeber that clueless dutch woman whose manifesto basically amounted to lets destroy eve if she got voted in
nobody is talking about destroying eve calm down
and then that morally superior player got booted because of an nda breach yeah carebears are better humans eh
really depends on your definition of pvp i will respect a pirate over a scammer any day
clever diplomatic hint unreasonable people get ignored this is especially true with the csm which continues to exist only because ccp wills it  they are under no obligation to reveal anything or discuss anything with you raging at them will only hamper the ability of the csm and ccp to actually get anything donebasically i wont vote for you and no one should vote for you good day sir
moved from general discussion
well you have basically just said csms are useless and hense nobody should waste their time voting ccp wants to improve their game it makes business sense
no i just said that your particular extreme position is useless there are moderate positions between being an spineless ccp fanboy and being a disagreeable douchebag
well obviously im not going to be a disagreeable douchebag because that would just waste everyones time
your logic  so much fail
how so from what i can see i didnt even use any reasoning and as such logic wouldnt even apply to it one is a statement of fact and the other is merely poking some fun at ank and her holier than you attitude but never stop posting its hilarious
who the hell is ank
i dont understand the point of csm at all who really listens to them at ccp or cares what they say
somebody who didnt get tired explaining to everyone how much better than everyone else she was that got her voted into the csm at least i dunno three times in a row she wanted to remove scamming suicide ganking wardecs etc from the game and insisted that pvpers are psychopaths then as if to prove how good she is she broke a real life nondisclosure agreement with ccp and subsequently got booted from the csm  never to be seen again in eve her platform site still exist google for take care  maybe it contains some useful information for your own political adventuresif you meant to ask why were discussing another person in your platform thread somebody likened her programme to yours and sorry for the derail but i cant let some tool question my forum elogic i will try to meditate and just let it go no promises though edit ok breasts were also a big factor in getting her into the csm  i dont want to keep important facts to me
maybe that just shows how lots of people dont like the physcos in the game either that or it was all down to the 
how dare you attempt to invalidate the generalization i ascribe myself to your logic must be fail or its entirely possible that being good or bad is an individual choice which will cause me to actually have to do good thingsid rather just enjoy the fruits of my generalization pls
uhm you said that you were going to be unreasonable in dealing with ccp thats a pretty big warning sign towards being a disagreeable douchebag right there honestly you cant even represent your own opinions faithfully how can anyone expect you to represent them
it would appear that cp are by nature very unreasonable hence it should be a wonderful relationship
how much isk do you pay for 1 vote
anyone gonna vote for me hehe
no thanks
depends are you running as a republican or a democrat
whats your platform
how much isk are you paying for a vote
none someones bet me i cant get above 3 votes so i guess id spread the isk from the bet evenly if i do wincampaign message atheistoffail stands for the sandbox ninja salvaging afk cloaking hulkaggedon and many other shows of the freedom of the sandbox must be protected we will fight for your right to blow stuff up and play however you wish within the eula in this sandboxcopied right for my app some people might like what im running forps only made thread since it asked for a website i figure people can critize me here as easily for running

when software is designed there are a series of steps taken even before a line of code is written one of these is the creation of the specifications that the software will follow in this case ccp created a spec for wormholes and control towershaving worked for a major software company sometimes bugs are discovered that are debated questions such as whether the alleged defect breaks a part of the specification are raised often heated debates break out in many cases bugs are stomped but some are found not to be bugs at all they are a part of the design specificationthese are therefore said to be working by designwhat youve discovered is something that you think might be a bug but is according to ccp by design thus you are correct to bring the issue up here but not for the reasons that you think if you think that this is a game breaker bring it up as such its not a bug however  its working within the games target specifications if you find that its a potential balance issue you can bring it up as such cheerio

what microtransaction drahma
man its like you dont even know how hard youre getting trolled
yes it is deal with it
yes yes yes trolling etcsomeone says something gets called out and suddenly people say troll to defend him  her its been happening in goons for years nowthe funny thing is when a person mentions someone is getting trolled it always means that they werent trolling in the first place and they are so threatened by what bull they came out with their only defence is to mark it as humourgoons may as well just criticise people who died in rl again then after getting flamed at go im trolling  worst damage control ever
im finding myself in the uncomfortable position of agreeing with mng
although the thin clients allow devs to play the sansha and kick our asses that way instead of infiltrate our players corporations i have been told that it was boring for them as most players cant ever even deal with the sleeper ai let alone what 1 dev controlling a fleet of sansha could do
worth supporting over and over and over  again
yes yes yes
these threads are always funny the big bad boys go ohso high and mighty on you when it comes to choices in eve having consequences and such except of course when theyre ganking folks then the insurance company needs to pick up the check for their misdeeds along with if you please virtually no security standing loss at allsoooo supported 1
not that i necessarily disagree with removing insurance but i am confused by the original post can someone explain the evidently important distinction between an itty 5 pilot with 5bil in his hold and a shiny mission boat pilot with 5bil in fittings i am sure there is a great deal of difference otherwise the poster would not have problems with the missionrunner getting blown up but i cant figure out exactly what that difference is please help
no real insurance company would insure ships in eve
a web reduces a ships maximum velocity but not its acceleration when a freighter is webbed this allows it to enter warp sooner as it reaches 75 speed faster and is able to align faster due to being at a slower speed
your original post on changes to scs is reasonable and well thought out ill tentatively support it but i really prefer the following two counter suggestions as i think they accomplish the same goal of making supers more susceptible to subcaps 1 make ffbs more vulnerable to bs weapons so they can be declawed although a pos mod for drone storage would probably be needed for refilling drones 2 a cruiser antisuper citadel bomber ships to provide a subcapital counter to supercapitals

bump for great justice
definitely need doing
it is only fair that all t2 ships should get 7 bonuses like bombersinterceptors need 2 more bonuses they only have 5 recons need 1 more they get 6 already hacs  hics  bos should get 3 more they only have 4 and mauraders should get 1 more they have 6 right now then all t2 ships would be treated fairly and get the same number of bonusesif you want to nitpik and claim that unlisted bonuses to resists that are over t1 resists for that race then the number of additional bonuses will be reduced by 1 for those ships with built in higher resists doing this is stoopid though because they are not really bonuses but merely different ship attributestotally support giving all t2 ships 7 bonuses to make things fair
you have my full support
bump i am just going to quit eve until they fix those kthxbye
support

this is the best way forward as far as i can see it wont harm actual human players fill the screen with popups or create piles of neverending work for devsthe first step isnt to scan accounts or client memory its to remove all asteroid belts ice fields and respawning rats stay with me for a second next make asteroid sites scannable via probes and have rats guarding them with a small number of roids at each site 30 hulk minutes worththink mission duration and a few rats to shoot adjust the spawn rate and quality of both to diminish as the frequency of harvesting increases this encourages people to spread out and cripples macros  macro like behaviorwith no ice fields belts or systems with 7 belts to chain spawns macros as we know them today will die yes macros will adapt but the boring tasks are improved 1 players the macro income has been greatly reduced 1 players and the never ending supply of isk liquid or mineral has diminishing returns 1 players beating market bots is much much easier all market bots rely on an infinite number of market updates per day the solutioneither put a limit on the total number of times a player can update orders per day or greatly increase the cooldown timer of making updates the former would hurt actual traders much lessnote there are so many antibot this and that in the assembly hall that i accidentally quoted and posted this in the wrong thread when relogging double post not intentional
when i first started playing eve many years ago 00 was a scary place it was far from the safety of empire where one could go many jumps without seeing another soul or another player made object this was how 00 was meant to be high rewards for high risks unfortunately today the opposite is true there are no risks if youre paying attention and you can live just about anywhere without any hassle due to the station proliferation that has overcome eve in recent timespersonally i think building stations is great its quite like building your own alliance supercap its something everyone can work towards however unlike everything else you build in eve its indestructable you can ping pong it around between alliances remove clones and corp hangars but apart from that nothing the station will remain there forever so what happens when your space is invadedover the last few years a trend has been emerging one alliance loses its space waits a few months then retakes it with all its assets intact ready to be reused again sitting in a station see for example mc vs nc goons vs bob and it theres no real problem with losing all your sov if your patient and your alliance isnt some paper tiger the chances are you will retake your station some day then build more stationsi know it has been discussed before and deemed impossible but it needs to change this should be a major priority for ccp and if its required code should be rewritten stations need to be destructable im not gonna go over how i think they should be made destructable as thats another days discussion currently there are at least 10 regions with more than 25 station coverage in space this frankly is ridiculoussome datain order of station coverage providence52 stations84 systems61 station coveragedeklein28 stations68 systems41 station coveragedelve not including blood raiders npc space 34 stations85 systems40 station coveragetribute 21 stations54 systems39 station coverageperiod basis 13 stations40 systems33 station coveragetotal stations in these regions 148average station coverage 425these are just 5 regions admittedly ones that looked most station crowded on map in all of 00 not only do stations provide sanctuary for pilots and assets but they also provide huge defensive advantage as you have to reinforce each one three 3 times which the defender gets to set timers forfinally this would allow alliances to go on a scorched earth campaign and actually inflict some damage on hostile infrastructure
supported burn them all
most definately supporting this its not something that will be easy to implement and if it is it shouldnt be a trivial act to destroy a station requiring a good time and manpower investment to get the job done
i support the general idea of destroying stationshowever i dont like the way strategic fleet battles are done in eve it wouldnt be fair to allow stations be destroyed under current sov mechanicsmaybe something like this the current owner of the outpost can self destruct the outpost after 30 days of ownership self destruct timer 24 hoursthat gives people enough time to try reclaim it
big support something like this needs to happen if 00 is every going to break away from the go ahead and knock it down well just rebuild it later and lose nothing mentality it has right nowid even go so far as to say if stations were destructable ccp should allow multiple player stations in systems the biggest problem i see with this is the person who unsubbed 2 years ago and has all their stuff sitting in a station in delve will not be amused if he resubs now to find it has all been welped destroy stations sure but some form of asset preservation or even compemsation needs to be in place this is one of those things that eve desperately needs but it needs to work the first time and it needs to be implemented in fullnot like the halfassed and still broken lolsov changes
i just want the bisons roam free ing farmers and railroads
i agree with this i like that 00 is hard to live in it should not be made to easy the challenge is half the fun
just curious if there is nobody around to make the sexee time on you how risky can it really be seems to me that you have it backwards m8
while i agree that stations should be made destructable you argument carries no weight does not propose a solution and highlight something that isnt even an issue i have no problem wiht null having 200 station coverage its not like those stations just spontaneously appeared there people worked their butts off for them you know
i think youre missing the point where evil griefers are hopefully supposed to be able to robdestroy player made structures like in said dark world tm quote from some random ccp interview i cannot recall now they wouldcurrently stations cannot be destroyed or even looted even poss are pretty difficult to loot since well ppl can just warp out their stuff even if someone has time to waste to shoot pos two times currently practical way to rob people is just join corp and get a passwordhangar access
while im not entirely convinced by your argument about proliferation i certainly do agree that nonnpc 00 stations should be vulnerable to destruction just like everything else there
only if npc 00 and lowsec stations can be destroyed too
this thread isnt the propose a solution on how to design the mechanics of how you destroy stations ccp have stated it is impossible with current coding so this thread is to highlight that that needs to be changed soonpeople work their butts off for titans too but theyre destructable stations go against the grain in eve
id like to comment that i also think 00 should have delayed local like wormhole space an entirely different gate mechanic and be twice as large
kill them with fire
dont count the votes of folks whos alliance didnt build any stations while they were in it
some things will be more or less popular than other things thats the way of the universe never ending balancing to try to change that can not workas a counter proposal have different subsystems have different balance of material costs so the less popular subsystems and their materials can drop in price to match their lack of popularity allowing less popular subsystems to cost less may increase their popularity a rise in popularity would also allow the bpcs to be somewhat useful instead of being trashable garbagethere is one reason i can think of to balance the ships themselves when t3 was first announced it was observed that there would be thousands of possible variations with some of those ships there are only 1 or 2 actual viable loadouts
i support making t3 ships more versatile and better than t2 for pvp purposes i like the idea of people losing more expensive ships in pvp and suffering some skillpoint lossi wouldnt mind if t3 replaced t2 completely and only reason to use t2 would be to save on coston other hand i dont like when cheap ships are made more powerful like battlecruisers either raise the price or nerf them
thing thing with making some of these subsystems more powerful is that they will leave some t2 ships as serving no purposei agree with coolant injector really needs a buff your idea is cool but still not enough to pique my interest in it as a viable choiceadaptive augmentershielding  this idea is cool but there was also the original plan of having 5 different subsystems for each slot and one designed specifically for rr could move that amount bonus over in tandem with range and replace the secondary bonus on the adaptives to more resistanceproteus  covert yes on falloffi disagree withwarfare processor as it stands they give an awesome bonus and making them have an additional tank bonus would make command ships role pointlesstengu  rifling giving it too much jam power eliminates role of falconsrooksproteus  drone synth makes ishtar pointless if you give a proteus 125mbitsproteus  hybrid prop used with the scram range electronics subsystem the damps eliminate the arazus rolelegion  parasitic rules out use of curseas far as the rest i havent looked into the matters enough to have a strong opinion one way or the other but ccp has stated specifically in the past that they wont give the proteus the 125 bandwith since it would make there no point for ishtars anymore and buffing any of the other subsystems too much would make a lot of the recons or command ships or even hacs useless its why they wont introduce an interdiction bubble subsystemi do think they should consider a propulsion subsystem that allows jumpdrive capability without it being on a ship with the covertops subsystems however
thats exactly why i want it tho because if people use t3 instead of t2 they lose much more when they die i want people to put more on the line when they pvp losses should hurt
haha i get the motivation but there are already too many useless ships in the game id like to see a day where everything has its nice little rolein the case of t3 they have the massive advantage simply by being modular with each subsystem using its own skill set to modify bonuses i dont want to see any ship be cast to the wayside while t3s become massively op t3s versitility is their strength and a massively plated proteus with the scram range a mwd and a full rack of neutrons s face as is and pretty much make a deimos look like a really useless item as is more than it currently isthe last thing we need to have happen is all recons and command ships to get put in the same heap with destroyers
yeah the tendency to forge ahead and leave the old features behind not a good thing while i can appreciate that there are more important issues around than this one a balance pass on tech iii seems like a relatively small fix to me anyway im not a techprogrammer kinda guy
 burseg sardaukaryup i agree would not want to phase out tech ii and this is part of the reason why i stated the examples were only guidelines and in no way absolute truth nor part of the actual proposal which was simply to divert some attenti
t1 t2 t3  theres a bunch of different unpopular things that need to be reviewed and fixed these seem like appropriate fixes to me
versatility is all great and good just so long as you dont end up with thousands of mediocre variations to choose from and t3 is very close to exactly thatt3 absolutely should put t2 to shame it should be a much more effective and flexible option but one that comes at great costthe way things should bet1 reasonable effectiveness little flexibility low cost always availablet2 good effectiveness decent flexibility mediumhigh cost mostly availablet3 excellent effectiveness excellent flexibility very high cost may not always be availableobviously this is not the way it is now the vast majority of t3 fits are less effective than their t2 counterparts and come at far greater cost there are really only a couple of effective t3 fits which is exactly why you dont see masses of t3 ships and the one you do see are almost always fitted in entirely predictable and common configurations kinda defeats the entire purpose of what t3 was supposed to be all about
oh hell yes now that would be a good use for that subsystem
i have spent some time evaluating the benefit of using that subsystem and its indeed useless  compared to other choicesbeing able to overload things 50 more effectively would make it desirable so 20 overheat bonus on hardener becomes 30  thats actually a very neat given the time limited nature of overheating it wouldnt cause serious imbalance issues
sounds like a good idea anyone know what design software ccp uses
i want to see an armani store in jita supported
id love a chance to make my own designs of outfits id probably give up flying around in my spaceship and open a boutique in jita edit forgot to click support
or perhaps a player elected capsuleers council to address issues like this player advertising affairs and itd be regional eg amarr council for amarr style clothing etcthat would free up ccp staff to develop moar and filter less and it would immerses players a lot more imosupport
while this has been suggested before the need for more isk sinks in the game is becoming more and more apparent and i believe playercontrolled advertising on the billboards would be an excellent idea to do sobasically players should be able to place ads in either either system constellation or regionalwide ad campaigns the costs should be paid in isk and be low enough to encourage widespread yet large enough to have an impact
yeah i think this would be nice particularly for someone selling services prerigged ships etc
90 of the ads would contain scams business as usual literally well at least they would have to pay for itregards lax
since this would complement my idea about open source vanity items i support it fully
this idea been proposed since eve was released 5 years for sureccp just dont care or they are paranoid they dont want goons showing dirty pictures and nasty messages to timid empire carebears
now that team bff has some free time how about another look at this feature
yes please
this is the best way forward as far as i can see it wont harm actual human players fill the screen with popups or create piles of neverending work for devsthe first step isnt to scan accounts or client memory its to remove all asteroid belts ice fields and respawning rats stay with me for a second next make asteroid sites scannable via probes and have rats guarding them with a small number of roids at each site 30 hulk minutes worththink mission duration and a few rats to shoot adjust the spawn rate and quality of both to diminish as the frequency of harvesting increases this encourages people to spread out and cripples macros  macro like behaviorwith no ice fields belts or systems with 7 belts to chain spawns macros as we know them today will die yes macros will adapt but the boring tasks are improved 1 players the macro income has been greatly reduced 1 players and the never ending supply of isk liquid or mineral has diminishing returns 1 players beating market bots is much much easier all market bots rely on an infinite number of market updates per day the solutioneither put a limit on the total number of times a player can update orders per day or greatly increase the cooldown timer of making updates the former would hurt actual traders much less
the eve client could be configured to exam other exe files running and interacting with the client much like poker software or other anti cheat software id also like the names of banned players to be published along with the corp so that they can be named and shamed

gallente need love
its not just the ships and guns guysits our high sec and our factional warfare as wellplaying gallente is like playing dante must die in devil may cry 3
i support fixes to hybrids but what needs fixing about the ishtar
erm read the document if you want to find out
my bad thought that was part of your sig reading nowedit having just read that i would say that the ishtar doesnt need more cpu i mean i wont say no to more but its not a drastic needon the other changes i think the numbers you propose needs to be tweaked as some would be a massive overboost the brutix bonus you propose wouldnt fix the ship as ewar has never been the brutixes major weakness i would prefer repper bonuses being changed to hp bonuses as it would lower the reliance of blaster boats on trimarks for tank however having said all that i would support a damage and tracking increase to the point where its dangerous for ships of similar size to be in scram range of a blaster boati will also support a lowering of the fitting requirements for blasters in general as i think this would go a long way to improving blaster pvprails i would prefer to be the middle ground between artilleryhigh alpha and lasershigh dps not like they have at the moment with crappy damage tracking and dps
ok here are my thoughs i agree that ishtar is not horribly wrong its one of the few gallente ships that actally works i am not asking for a massive boost but give it just enough to fit adrone upgrade or two bring it in like wiht another gallente hac numbers i proposed are examples only i leave it up to ccp to decide exact values yup some might be an overboost indeed with the ecm resistance i was trying to get an original ship where no equivalent exists in game yet my fear is that a straight hp boost will just give people more incentive to buffer tank it and trimark it so they can get a brick or a bait if we give it a ecm resistance boost it becomes an ewar ship killer iprefer this due to followingecm ships usually have virtually no tankbritux has a massive damage output this would mean that it can kill off large part of your fleets ecm force quickly and means that ecm ships must be guarded and introduces one more counter  this makes sence from rp perspective for gallente to develop a ship that is speshialised at taking out caldarys ewar support  weakens position of a falcon as the ultimate reckon ship adds something interesting and unique to the gamein the document i propose increasing powergrid of most gallente ships but reducing fitting requirements of blaster would achieve the same goal i have no preference in this regard so it can be done either way
did you forget to mention that scorch gets no falloff bonus or that barrage gets no optimal bonus its is well balanced hybrids gets both optimal and falloff in half the amounts of the other 2i dont follow you here because autocannons get longer falloff blasters need tracking if you are complaining about your lack of an engagement range then say so and ask for more falloffand the fact that minmatar ships have smaller cargoholds than any of their gallente counter parts does not come into play maybe they should boost minmatar hold size and ammo size so they can more effectively fit capboosterswait so all other faction cruisers dont have to downgrade their guns to the mid sized ones to fit so it can be the fastest cruiser in game beating even the vaga and cynabal no thanks while were at it lets put a dd on it give it 50 million ehp and make it have to cyno or do we have ship like thatactually not half bad changed but the cargo holdweb range is a minmatar bouns gtfo with that ideaactually not half bad changed but the cargo holdfirst off its spelled deimos secondly speed bonus is too op as stated above for thorax web bonus i could agree with though and the vigilant and kronos get themyou want more shield tanked ishtars in gameall good but ewar bonuswhile that would be a nice bonus i cant behind it cause youre practiclly giving the gallente 2 feild command ships it needs to have its links fixed and survivability in fleets reworkedyou trolling me on the kronos bro it is competive with the others its just the golem that needs a nerf to bring it in line
the reason i suggest lowering the overall powergrid for hybrids rather than increasing gallente grid is so that it boosts the caldari hybrid boats as well as the gallente ones
ok i agree with that will adjust paper tomorrow no it is not you are criticizing me without any basic as you did not even bother to do the maths 25  25 does not add up to 50 bonus in this case since for lasers faloff represents a tiny percentage of their effective range they dont care that faloff was not boosted same is true for artillery so i will spell it out for youweapon optimal falloff effective rangeneutron blaster canon 72 km 10 km 172 kmmega pulse laser 24 km 8 km 36 km800mm repeating art 48 km 192 km 24 kmwith appropriate longrange ammo fitted weapon optimal falloff effective rangeneutron blaster canon 9 km 125 km 215 kmmega pulse laser 36 km 8 km 42 km800mm repeating art 48 km 288 km 336 kmso effective range was increased bybarrage 33624 km  40 bonus to effective rangescorch 4236 km 375 effective range bonusnull 215172 km 25 range bonusas a gallente pilot i demand racial equality and demand that null should be as good as any other longrange ammunition and its bonus should be swapped to 37 at least no we dont need longer falloff because short blaster range is what makes gallente blaster unique not that i would mind getting op autocanons but i am trying to be fair here tracking required is proportional to the rnage a target is at so if you whant to track the same object at twice shorter range you need twice the tracking autocanons have shoter range than lasers but they need to track smae targets thats why they have almost three times  higher tracking speed the same should apply for blasters i dont know why it does not at the moment i did not check cargohold of every single minmatar ship and i dont know whether this is an issue for them it is irrelevant to this thread anyway it is beyond my capabilities to check every single ship in game thats something ccp is payed for if you whant to make a suggestion go ahead but the simple fact is that gallente where designed as an active tanking race to active tank you need cap the only feasible way to get cap in pvp is cap boosters cap boosters take a lot of space so logically if you want gallente to work give them more space not rocket science you are complaining that thorax gets to be the fastest cruiser in the game it does not really it only gets the speed bonus while overloading the mwd so that speed bonus only works for 30 seconds or so after that you burn your mwd and you have a cruiser without propulsionit has one chance to catch a cynabal but aif the cynabal pilot outmaneuvers the thorax the mwd burns and the thorax is stuck there i am not sure if i made it clear enough
please explain me what eggzactly is the problem with the ewar resistance its made of paper and is the worst bc in game except for maybe ferox it will still be weak you just cant jamm it so you have to shoot it not really a big deal considering it cant fit a tank i personally like armor ones for pvp but what exactly is a problem with shieldtanked ishtars i dont see why it should not be a valid tactics besides web them and battleships can hit it for full damage because of bloated signature radius well yes but there is a difference between being a field command ship and being a useless ship and yes link must me fixed indeed i agree maximum tank on a kronos cap stable 1080maximum tank on a vargur cap stable 1450yeah kronos is alright  
so i noticed that the sign up for candidates for the next csm election is startingbut the csm has always suffered from one chief sin lack of legitimacy csms have been elected in the past by as little as 7 turnout and the best weve ever managed is 12that promotes the image of csm as a joke or pr stunt where the interests of voting blocks dominate right or wrong nowhere except in eve would an election with 7 turnout be considered validmy proposal is this you have made a working ingame browser now right  so when the election starts make it so that the first time you dock or login in a station during the election period on an account the voting page is opened in the ingame browser for that account ofcourse the voting page would also be revamped to look prettier and give a better overview of what the csm is and of each candidate the player can close it and never be bothered by it again until the next electionthere you go trivial to implement minimal hassle for the player no more newbies missing the election because they didnt click on the tiny link on the login screen and dont know why the csm might be important to themi belive with such small changes we might even double the number of voters ofcourse some groups would rather we didnt but its in the interest of eve as a whole
i support this as it would create more awareness for the election showing the voting page when logging into the game while in a station would be preferable for me so that it does not cause lag when i am docking while in a hurrywhat i would suggest as an extension of this suggestion randomize the sequence of candidates each time this page is shown so that no candidate gets all the votes from those players who do not care and choose the candidate at the top give the player a show this again option to be reminded later this would help players who while being interested in the csm per se do not pay much attention to the voting period
would be pretty awesome of they used the api ident system of the igb to facilitate voting would go even further though and spam popups like they did with the avatar creator got to keep in mind that not all people ever open the igb instead using external applicationsthe whole voluntary democracy is a stupid notion as people are too damn lazy for their own good proven by previous elections both in eve and real world should be mandatory or at least encouraged
thanks for the supporti tried to keep my ideea as simple as possible so it can be quickly implemented rather than delayed forever and so theres little reason to object also supporting my own proposal ofcourse
lets not have people who neither know nor care much about the game deciding who should influence its development
im on for this
i agree 100 this should be implemented with the current election give each candidate a few sentences to describe their positions
i agreeccp should also establish some rudimentary policy outlining quorum for elections as well there should be some established minimum of electorate turn out before results can be considered official
please fix any exploits or problems and get this in a future release soonUFFFD
atm game allows players to jump supercapscaps to cynofield at onlining pos what happens is when pos 10sec from been online you can jump any cap sized ship 100 safetly you 0o dont get it how exactlylittle example lets say i want to go from x point to y in order to do it i need jump low sec system full pirates and hotdropers so all i need to do is grab pos anchor and then online it when theres 10 sec left on timer i cyno up jump my jf uber fleet and after few seconds pos goes online and noone can hit me since im inside shieldstherefore disable cynofield function at least 40km from onlining poses just dont say on grid because that would not be good for hotdropersrablys
or make them bump when pos onlines supported
afk nuisancing fitting a cloaked ship with a covert cyno to negate cyno jammed systems and being logged in 237 in the same system with little to no activitythe problemthis has become an absurdly obnoxious way to completely shutdown almost all industrial activity in a 00 system it is virtually 0 risk and is done afk with great rewards which is the opposite of what ccp claim to want for the game on the occasion that the person is actually at the keyboard they can quickly scan the system to see if there is anything for them to hot drop and after 1 hot drop almost all activity will have to be stopped in the system because you can never tell when the person is actually there or not there is no way to attack decloak scan down or in any way counter this except when the cyno is lit this means you would have to scan down the cyno form a fleet and hope that the fleet could get to and pop the cyno ship before it could cloak back up which you would have to do under fire even if you did manage to pop it it would take almost no time for the pilot to refit another claoky with a covert cyno and get right back theresolutionim sure there are a lot of players who have thought of ways to remedy this the most compelling i have heard so far is simply making the cloaking devise shut off every so often perhaps giving it a very long cycle time but requiring it to be reactivated another idea might be might be using a pos mod to decloak all the ships in system allowing an afker to be scanned down but an active player to cloak back up before they can be located or bring back the system scanning pos mod and allowing it to scan down cloaked shipsim sure there are many other solutions and i dont know which one should be used but i do know that this is not something that should be allowed to continue it is completely impossible to defend against requires little skill is no risk to the person doing it and offers massive rewards by either giving easy kills or shutting down a system that would otherwise be producing isk or bothim not saying you shouldnt be able to sit in a system all day long cloaked up if you want im saying you should have to actually sit there not log on once a day then go about your business in rl or on another character
the main problem here is the hot drop mechanics not afk cloakingcurrent cyno hot drops are completely overpowered  they are instantenous and unscoutable there needs to be some delay between cyno activation and ships appearing there needs to be some way to know whats coming  at least as soon as cyno activates and there should be options for mobile cyno jammers that can block even cov ops cynosthis isnt about cloaking at all
whats cloaked cant hurt youuse this as an opportunity to protect your industrial assets while they are at risk in space
 ephemeron this thread is about the inability to decloak or scan down a cloaked ship that has no one behind the wheel if you feel cynos are over powered feel free to make your own thread explaining why kryhane what if your asking what being cloaked
i agreeits complete crap that someone can just sit in a system cloaked all day every day and never actually be there
nerfing scouts isnt particularly fair but i feel ships fit with cloaks noncovert ops should possibly require some type of fuel or be able to be scanned after sitting still for too long this allows covert ops ships to do their jobs while ratting drake bots cant warp to a planet and permacloak on every person entering a systemi think a better solution to the heightened alert would truly be a spinup cycle needed for cynos or even a cyno mass limit i understand that in the roleplay sense a cyno is a beacon that the drives of the ships lock onto but i feel that as a ship jumps to the becon its mass should start to be reduced this would make cynos deployment and jumping more tactical and less everything i have is coming through at you in 1 secondon top of that supercaps should require a special cyno to bring them to the scene like a 1 minute spinup on a module that must be fit to a carrier  least
i agree that cloaking scouts should not be affected at all or at least very little by whatever mechanic is implemented the decloaking pos mod would absolutely be able to be used for decloaking scouts so perhaps it could have a long cool down timer maybe 6 hours this would limit its ability to disrupt scouts pretty considerablythe issue isnt with cloaking drake botters another subject all together its with covert ops ships fitted with covert ops cloaking devices and either a cyno or a covert cyno they are impossible to counter and cause huge problems for the people they are harassing without having to even be there while they do so much less having to put anything on the line is a great tactic to employ but i feel that you should at least have to be paying a little attention to the client while you do so not out shopping for groceriesagain not talking about cyno mechanics talking about the ability of a player to log on cloak and walk away disrupting the ability of other players to play without having to actually be playing himself cyno mechanics is an interesting subject but not of this thread this thread is for ideas about countering afk cloaking and supportcriticism of those ideas
ashofski how about this then if you gain the ability to scan down and decloak people in deep 00i should gain the ability to eject carebears out of stations and pos shields especially when they are afkfair deal
pooped on because scouts have already gotten the shaft enough from ccp
maybe removing all mention of cyno lighting and being hotdropped from your post would be a better way to articulate your problem having a nuetral in sys wreaks havoc on a botting operation this should be done away with just out of curiosity do you regularly have to scan down the cynolighter whilst being hot dropped i would think that if your being hot dropped the cyno ship would be there on grid with you
so someone docked in a station or clearly visible inside of a pos is somehow causing you your corp or your alliance damage how in the mean time you have a mechanic for killing people as a single bomber or by cynoing in friendlies at any time of your choosing with little to no warning depending upon the location of the people in system since you rarely have to use probes to find someone and even then if you bookmark the plexs hidden belts and exploration sites after downtime you still get free easy kills with no warningcloaker griefing is the biggest carebear profession in eve hell its riskier to undock from jita in a hauler thats empty
no
no fueled cloaksno cycle timeccp thinks afk nuisancing is working as intended and for once i totally believe them  this thread proves it
i am all for a player flying his ship into a system that has people in it to disrupt what ever it is they are doing be it botting or running anoms or mining or whatever else the issue is that currently once you have moved your ship to that system you can simply cloak and walk out of the room logging back in and cloaking after down time effectively costing other players hundreds of millions of isk with absolutely no risk or even interaction on your part if you want to sit in a system and disrupt what other players are doing i think you should at least have to be at the computer reactivating your cloaking device or something it isnt right that people can just walk away from the computer with no fear of dieing in 00as far as scanning a fleet would not be able to warp to a covert cyno and would likely not be put together fast enough to warp to the pilot that was being hot dropped1 im not the one to be bargaining with since im just pointing out what i think is an issue with the game not the one who would be fixing it2 you are again bring up a subject that has absolutely nothing to do with the subject of this thread start a thread regarding your ideas and i will comment on them there3 feel free to continue to bump this thread to the top while making yourself look stupid
like in a stationoh you dont protect your corp m8s by having combat capable ships on grid nice corp the commraderie sp is heartwarming
not possible for a neut to dock in a player station and even if they were you would know where they were and when they were actively trying to kill you as apposed to afkno i dont routinely assemble fleets large enough to take on a 15 man fleet and stage them on grid with me just for the purpose of running a few sanctums but that has nothing to do with the point of the thread if you have an actual point to make in regards to your opinion of the subject of the thread ie i think afk cloaking should continue to be aloud because please make it your assumptions of how my corp operates and your comparison of cloaking and docking are completely irrelevant
the proposed changes are straight up bad if taken on their own they would not do anything to fix the issues with force projection and would in fact exacerbate the problems removing them altogether is better than the proposal however a few modifications might make that proposal workableid say go with these changes except make jump bridges extremely easy to reinforceshutdown by small gangs but require dreads to kill make it so jump bridges have a 1 week cooldown timer before they can change destinations that would give small gangs a target make supply lines disruptable moderate force projection but still allow some logisticsmake lowsec smuggler bridges usable by anyone but give anyone who uses them a gcc smuggler bridges should show up with the onboard scanner but maybe not the overviewreduce the range of all jump bridges to be short enough to not cover interregion travel this along with rebalancing super carriers should limit force projection while still making logistics possible but not invulnerable
force projection is hard to control if you decrease the range of jumps bridges the simple answer is put more in eve is to easy for the blob to win or have the advantage
what if some wh mechanics were added maybe a jump bridge is a semistable wormhole that will collapse for 24 hours if a certain mass goes through limit jump bridges 1 per system make jump bridges show their destination system on the overview like regular stargates it should be easy to scout out someones jump bridge network and easy to disrupt it
i feel like alone it would work however the gcc for lowsec idea and the whlike idea above i love
why is it that you are fighting for the personal teleportation grid aka bridges so furiously linked solution does nothing better lowsec bridge hahaha force projection albeit slightly more vulnerable and no downsideseven if they can be reinforced by a single frigate it will be as todays jammers with a million of them anchored ready to online when needed adds nothing but aggravation to tenders with little to no impact on the issue of projectionhow about bridges available anywhere you want anchored away from deathstars and usable by anyoneyou get all the benefits but also get the shaft in times of war if you forget to dismantle the grid or guard the stations terrorists of today happily use local infrastructure and logistic hubs trainsplanes mostly are often a priority target for capture when armies invadeps lowsec smuggler gates have been brought up previously and have nothing to do with bridges they were mentioned as a way to complete the lowsec circuit
they should only be anchorable at planets and only those of a certain fairly rare type such as plasma one bridge per planetthis way most systems cant get more than 1 bridge in them and a conventional jump will also be neeeded a few rare systems however might be able to fit more than twodust mercs will be able to mess with jb operation in some way as a highish level objective perhaps greatly increasing fuel use of size of fuel bay a cooldown on jumps or something along those lines  completely disabling would be too much though
the problem jump clone timers are indiscriminately 24 hours regardless on how far they have jumped you most players jump in and out of implanted sets more than for distance leaving them with 24 hours where they will have a strong desire not to enter nullsec or for some not to even engage in pvp medical clones are expensive when you start accumulating sp there is no direct correlation between personal wealth and skill point total there are rich new players and poor old players at some point it becomes foolish for high sp characters to use ships that are prone to dying  destroyers in comedy gangs tackling frigates interdictors and heavy interdictors the solutions base jump clone timer on ly distance from origin and destination 2 hours every ly minimum timer being 2 hours maximum being the current 24 hour this allows for people to swap in and out of highly implanted sets into empty or cheaply implanted easily that are in the same station remove medical clone cost and the need to upgrade them the possibility to kill someones skillpoints is funny but seldom happens in reality its just an extra cost that discourages high sp players from using riskier ships or situations implants are the discouragement for podding as implants can run 100mil for a normal set to billions for pirate sets
medical clones are a good isk sink they should stay
jump clones are not meant for risk aversion they are fine as they are
i stongly agree with the op the entire idea of 24 hours time is to stop people jumping around the univerce where one would have jumplones all over the place and would simply jump into one closes to where he wants to go there 24 hour times is reasonable however if one switches a close on the same station just to go to pvp there is no reason to penalize them with a 24 hour timer i agree wiht the second point even more i have a number of mates for whom costs of the close exceed 20 million which is higher then the price of most t2 frigates this makes flying this ship silly for them in my opinion age of a character should not be forcing a centrain placetyle and you dont die nearly enough to make this a viable isk sink in entire lifetime of this character i have spent more on ship repairs then on clone replacements and a few hundred time more isk where spent in lp store on implants fullest support
sounds ok and if not make the jc timer 23 hours not 24
supporting my own proposal
arbitrary jump clone timers are a relic
good ideas
this is awesome just yesterday i couldnt fly my slicer bc i had jumped into a different clone set wo cpu implants frig combat in t1 frigs is kinda silly since my pod implantless is often more then the fit on the ship
supporting this
awesome idea
people would be even less inclined to pvp without medical clonesso no z
hes not saying no med clones hes saying no increase in cost for higher sp med clones there would be one medical clone if you have it you dont lose sp on death if you dont have a medclone you do
no the need to do this gives stations with cloning a strategic advantage basing out of a station with it means you can jump straight into a new ship and go rejoin the fight while if you dont bubbling up your hostiles main cloning stationthe route from it to their staging can help prevent them from bringing new reinforcementsi dont really care about the cost but the need to update them should stay
true they were meant to be used for moving long distances in reality people use them for specific implant sets i have a slave nomad jackal and 3 normal set i swap between them for different ships and situations if i am in a nomad or slave set i do not enter nullsecyou will wake up in a station same as normal no sp loss no cost to get another clone basically that free 800k sp clone will now hold 800 million spno implants  no reason to avoid being podded unless you care dearly for killboard statsmaybe killed the medical bay should make people wake up in another station one that has an active medical bay rather than having a fleet of people wake up in a station where they can choose to lose sp or lose a systemanyway arent you arguing that you want less fights and less resistance as long as they have assets to dedicate to the battle surely they should be allowed to fight if they want

jumpclones good idea 100 support make it 3 hours  ly evenmedclones no its a good thing podding hurts high sp characters more regardless of implants
just curious why is it a good thing that high sp characters should have higher costs
it would make a lot people mad and ruin a lot of setups but i feel like the game would be more fun it would nerf the overpowered ships to a normal level and the rest of the ships would fit in place naturally the only ships i think any of us are bothered by are only strong because of module stacking certain unnamed ships have a nerf coming anyways even if it hasnt been mentioned we all know iti think it would add more variation and fun in ship setups as well
i think the current system of diminishing returns works just fine
while were at it lets make it so resistance mods can get you to 100 resistance across the boardnot supported
it just doesnt work when there are bonuses which give percentage bonuses such bonuses grow insanely huge very quickly and become gamebreaking ive seen many games start without a stacking penalty system eve included and without fail a short time later they all either have a stacking penalty or a hard limit on how many similar affects a person can havenot supported
i too think that 4000 dps abaddons are a good ideano wait mind you this could make dreadnaughts relevent again
i dont like it its too shiny for a deep cold and dark eve universehows that for an argument its as good as yours  you like it i dont
everything that makes eve look prettier and more realistic has my blessing heartedly supported 1
actually that view looks pretty bad and i would prefer the current stations many of them have planets already in the background anyway and look better than in your picsi also dont see why a station cant just hang out in space its not like space travel is hard for us in eve so we dont have any reason to build stations so close to the planets that you need orbital corrections to prevent it from crashing down on the planet might even be dangerous since such a huge block of metal isnt exactly going to crash gracefully if something were to go wrongdo not want
this looks immensely cool
not sure i want this on the one hand they look cool but on the other hand half the time when youd warp tofrom a station youd go straight through the nearby planet and i hate when that happens
thats the stupidest argument ive ever seen why dont downgrade the graphic and screw up the sound of the game a little aswell so you know to make the game less shiny and more dark and cold supported
i disagree here liang the battleships would still have a counter here in this case they could fit a mwd and try to burn to gate or through pos shields disruptor wouldnt help here and youd have to choose between a scrambler and a web in case of the 4th medslot which only a few interceptors are blessed with the point is i only really see the cap battery viable on 1 or 2 hacs ishtar and zealot and the active tanking t3s and viable and useful on no frigates battleships or any other class they need a boost as to whether capdrain immunity is one of them i dont know but your example here was a bit daft tbh
with absolute neut immunity range becomes a nonissue so fitting a disruptor rather than a scram becomes the exception outside of fleet bashesproperly flown frigates and some cruisers could care less about websdrones on ships larger than themselves and only fear neuts  remove that an small  big more than it is currently that is keep in mind that a battery would not only give the immunity but a bigger pool and the associated regen that is right up there with what a damage control offers  instant mandatory moduleeven if you removed the capacitor part of the equation and only kept neut immunity it would be borderline criminal but heaps more reasonable than what is proposed
two things if you want cap batteries boosted consider modifying their fittings to be more friendly or increasing the amount of cap neut immunity would prove to be an extraordinarily overpowered mechanic your own example leaving battleships with only having the option to disengage and run away when faced with a frigate has no semblance to balance i am confused that youd seriously put it forwardliang
you have not proven that this mechanic is overpowered in fact you where proven wrongthat renders the second point you are trying to make invalid and your post irrelevant to the topic thank you
can you please point to the post where i was proven wrong i must have totally missed something other than an incorrect conjecture that neuts were overpoweredhere are the arguments that ive seen to cite that a cap immune cap batter is somehow magically ok it costs a slot and fittings yes but meaningless everything costs a slot including nos however nos doesnt provide you with absolute neut immunity and is furthermore constrained by range drones still counter frigs not really true  many frigs will destroy a full set of drones before being meaningfully inconvenienced hell even a kitsune can kill a full flight of warriors before being taken down webs still counter frigs somewhat true  close range frig setups are more than capable of living inside web range even today neuts are overpowered this is not true at all first of all no other ewar has a fit me and be 100 immune module second neuts take time to be effective unless youre being hit by neuts much larger than you are third i would argue that cap boosters are a more proper counter to neuts because they are a limited counter in a similar way as all the other ewar counters fourth not all ewars even have counters  and that is ok cap batteries are underpowerd ok fine feel free to boost them by reducing fittings andor increasing cap amountultimately a lot of it comes down to beliefs but what isnt up for debate is that adding a mechanic that even has the potential of ing the game up in a big way is ed beyond comprehension this is why he has the burden of proof and i do notliang
less fitting requirements is a nice idea and might be enough of a boost to make them somewhat useful for battleship defence well most tackle on battleship happens in scramble range otherwise the battleship will just run back to gate or turtle through pos shields and there you could fit a nos to power your scrambler having cap immune frigates would only help in the situation where you have more than 1 source neuting you and when using long range disruptors at which point the battleship could run away rendering your point mootits kobayashi maru all over again why should we omit a no win situation
even with the battery most frigs would still cap out against a neuting ship if they dont fit a nos if they fit a nos they are essentially cap immune alreadyso they could care less and no properly flown frigate actually fears a larger ship not specifically suited to killing them nonethe bigger pool only matters when not being neuted and the mildly improved regen is negligiblei disagreeno it wouldnt it would greatly increase the viability of the vast majority of cap dependent shipshow do abaddons apocs rokhs maelstroms and hyperions kill frigates without nuetsnobody has stated that neuts are overpowered but that they have no actual countersignificant fittings especially on those small ships you claim and have not backed up that claim will be impossible to killnos is also far easier to fit and on the vast majority of frigs does not do anything to gimp the fitcarry spares or manage your drones betterwhich is also neut range incidentlynobody has claimed it isthis change doesnt make anyone 100 immune to neuts neuts are also not ewaryou made the claim that this will lead to the era of the unkillable frigate i and others have called you on it because it is patently false the burden of the defense of your claim is on you
how tackle is hardly going to draw more than regen and even lasers on offrace ships will not draw enough offrace because amarr guns ships dont have the mids to spare are you basing the proposal on all ships fitting dualrep tanks when using the battery or something silly like thathave you even tried looking at the numbers involved cruisers fitting a large peroxide get up to a whopping 50 regen and frigates get around 30 with a small negligible is not the first word that comes to mind  and that is on top of roughly equal percentages added to pool
lets try it on sisi at leasti predict the real impact on general pvp will be smallwe can try small gang fights with generic and neut heavy setups and also see if using battery equipped ships puts people at disadvantage against gangs that dont depend on neuts
no i want them deadi fly a dram if this goes through i will ditch almost any module so i cant get neuted dont get me wrong i enjoy running into enemy space and ganking ratters and haulers with a dramdaredevil fleet i dont want every single roam to be composed of dramsdaredevils though as they are currently there are risks to flying them such as people fitting neuts making them a straight out i win button is dumbby providing something that makes ships unable to be fully drained of cap you have nerfed neuts pretty heavilywho fits a cap booster on a frigate i didnt mention such a thing all you need is to not be zeroed out of cap so your recharge rate isnt completely shot and youll be fine
sisi doesnt exactly have a good history of being indicative of finding broken mechanics i predict that the change cant be meaningfully tested on sisi as long as it is the subject of testingliang
if you fit a micro cap battery your regen wont go up much at all and a small cap battery pretty much makes the frigate completely unable to fit anything it actually needs to perform such as tackle 50 cpu is not a small thingall that regen and they can barely fit what they need to fight large batteries on cruisers is called lolfitting then kill himwhat does this alleged dram fit look likea module to counter another module eve is built around this conceptonce you get neuted down to the immunity that is the new total size of your capacitor it doesnt take long to drain that down with just your own moduleswhy not it shouldnt be hard for you to come up with a fit that proves your point oh nvm
oh hold on let me fit the guns that can track a dram oh wait those dont exist ive tried many times let me fit the web that will allow me to get into range and stay in range oh wait thatd be a daredevil and the dram scrams them back and abs away drams die because they make mistakes or get neuted currently i would love to kill them more but if you kill my curse it is going to be a lot more difficult4 mid slots 1 mwd 1 ab 1 scram you guessthere is no other place where there is a perfect counter eccm doesnt stop ecm from being effective tank modules dont stop guns from killing you there are plenty of modules which mitigate neuts like eccm mitigates ecm and tanks mitigate the damage from weaponsgoing back to the dram a counter to the dram has 1 chance to neut them if they want to kill them and the cycle time on a heavy neut is pretty long giving them plenty of time to stabilize againjust as you argued that liang should prove a point on sisi the burden of proof lies with you you are asking for a change you have to prove it wont unbalance the game
lol what you seem to be missing is that many frigs will not be able to be neuted below peak capacitor recharge rate while that provides less cap than a cap booster and i do have a cap booster on a couple of my frig fits it also provides fully neut immune capnot very well most of the time see comments 34 and 51 for people directly saying that neuts are overpoweredi said it would tip the balance of power even more away from bigger ships towards smaller ships its very possible to kill even an overpowered ship but it may be a lot more hassle than it should befitting a nos takes a high slot thats a pretty damn big sacrificeim not going to go line for line but basically you asserting things yes it does make them immune to neuts and yes neuts are ewarthree things the burden of proof is on you because you are the one suggesting a change to the game you have yet to address any of my counter points in a realistic and credible manner where the facts dont suit you you either misrepresent them or outright lieliangi actually do have a fit that proves my point i have refrained from posting it but it absolutely exists theres a reason i keep pointing at tackle inties dramiels and such
i just wanted to point out that all other ewar has counters which either work against all incoming ewar ecm or has stacking penalties which prevent too much ewar being stacked on one target why should neuts be different
comments neuts are not guaranteed to immediately work in the same way other ewar does if youre neuting a similarly sized target for example you may not see any effect before the fight is reasonably expected to be over painters scrams and neuts do not have counters in the sense that you refer to them tds and rsds can still be quite effective  bringing the engagement range of even close range battleships below where they can be effectively used im not sure a 2km optimal geddon is terribly useful ecm is special because its chance based this means that bringing additional ewar to the fight doesnt have quite the same implications as other ewars this is why so many people complain about ecm dronesbut ultimately i want to repeat your question to you  should you actually support this why should neuts be different why should they be the only ewar that you are quite literally immune to the ewar no matter how much of it they bring why should it change from the way it is nowliang
i dont think itll be very interesting because1 the juicy stuff ccps failures and sensitive internals would never be declassified2 the stuff that gets declassified would be the stuff players already know about through csm minutes blogs dev blogs and actual game changeshowever as a transparency mechanism i approve of this
supporting an obviously good ideatransparency is good let the voters see what their representatives have been doing for them
aye
i agree currently we get far too little information to really differentiate candidates the minutes are pretty much worthless for this and raw logs of the votes rarely contain any decent information it would be great if csm internal forums could be always viewable by the public but only csm and ccp can post on them sort of like senate debates are public so that voters can be informed but i suppose that is impossible due to the nda we need to have more information to properly differentiate what candidates views are on issues relevant to what we do in the meantime csm elections will have more to do with deciding who is a bigger celebrity than setting forth any sort of mandate as to what players think will actually make eve better
real time communication is not feasible the actual communications are going to have to be delayed by a few months at most but i dont think that there have been any communications that should never come outall for nda reasons of course

cant find the exact quote from devblog but it was implemented somewhere around apocryphayeah but they even made it easier for mission runners  t3 ships were added that can be fitted to be immune to probing as long as you dont use drones
not everyone can fly or afford t3 unprobable fit greatly gimps gank and tank to the point where it cant tank some of the harder missions rat tps will make unprobable fits probable lowsec camps are not reliant on bubbles unlike covopsb t3 is sluggish enough that a fast scout can burn to location of last contact during gap in cloak and decloak it before it warps off if its such a convenient solution lowsec wouldnt be as empty as it is nowconverting all lowsec missions to fw style missions would help not to mention high lp and no bounty is good for the economy
its not my intention to nerf highsec missioning i am with you that highsec has seen one to many nerfes in the last two years i am open to changes that make it only necessary to spread but not loose income its only the spreading which i think could be goodand i dont know where you have looked but i know 05 border systems that are still populated by 100130 people mainly missioneers
i too would be very interested in seeing something to this effect in patchnotesdevblogs
qft otherwise it rotates in some direction faster then othersthe lines of action of major thrusters also must pass through center of mass or it cannot accelerate without rotatingbut arguing physics in a game where ship bounce off each other harmlessly kind of defeats the point p

pandemic raaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaggggggggggggggggggggeeeeeeeee
i like the idea in principle but have a couple of differences id like to seeway back when ccp implemented the new lp system doing that got rid of the only way to free slaves there were rewards that would allow you to trade in x amount of slaves and get militants science grads and other human based trade goods when they did this there was talk of there being a new pos mod that would allow us to change slaves into freed slaves militants and whatnotthis is what i personally would like to see a rehabilitation module and its opposite an enslavement module
as a long term minmatar loyalist ex minmatar militia member and gallente by origin i must support this
10
once again supported
supported as long as enslave is added for other types of people
this would help add some personality to a very bland marketplace within eve it doesnt replace any current aspects of the game either merely provides an optional enhancement
serviceoriented corporations who are in any way using contracts would benefit from this  and their customers would as well
it would be more useful if you bumped it here or asked csm directly what is happening with this idea i can see csm already voted for it that means that the suggestion is already presented to ccp
oh hi vuk surprised to see you on here how you doing still playing once every two weeks i see  you gotta tell me how your coalition is still alive when major players like you and fred0 are inactivewhats your secret
actually your awful post is the worst one in the thread thus far you denigrate without identifying the aspects with which you take issue so good job failposting about failposts next time consider pointing at yourself because your exhibited ability to both reason and communicate is an arrogant embarrassment though prototypically you dont seem to realize itthat being said removing jumpbridges seems like an overreaction and a bad idea because doing so removes a facet of the game with the capacity to be used in a variety of interesting strategic ways if there is a nerf solution to more variety in pvp entirely removing jumpbridges may be said to go too fargoons and nullsec dwellers with a similar csm agenda represent not only a substantial part of the player base but a portion of the player base that may be said to be very actively engaged in the full measure of the game they have every right and reason to take as much of the csm as they can and they will represent a large body of reasonably likeminded constituents beyond their own membership if they do theres nothing sinister about it if you fail to persuade enough votes against them a reasonable majority will have spoken
no were not check how many people are in 00 alliances also check the latest minutes of the csmccp meeting in iceland to get a big awakeningas far as how effective we are it depends on what if one expects the csm to dictate what ccp does not very if one expects the csm to provide meaningful feedback on suggested changes and helping ccp determine where the priorities of the current playerbase as a whole stands then were very effectivethe fact is that developers spend less time playing the game than we do as a whole and not to the extent were playing it as such our input is very valuableas far as that linked thread is concerned its always a question of priorities theres a finite amount of developer resources ccp has its own plans wishes and vision we have ours sometimes they coincide sometimes not so we have to find compromises and make the best use of the resources available black ops have been put on the table ccp has heard it now you have to give them time to take all weve said into account and decide what to do theres so many things that need improvingfixingrebalancingthat doesnt mean steps cannot be taken into improving things one step at a time resource allocation is not necessarily easy thats what were most helpful with and feedback
csm is good for fun posts in buysell always get the i have 5 votes for sale threadsalso good for a sideline i have though about but never carried through others can run it since sharing this idea hard enough to play of late let alone run a poollottery setup lol my idea an isk betting pool for the electionshow many reps from blob alliances do we get some chance in this pool last csm varied from prior runs and not all 00 alliance members iirc after the election though the real fun pool beginspool to see which csm member gets kicked out and banned for eula violations this has been batting about 100 so far make an pool bet option for no kicks at higher odds for good money in the off chance the next csm doesnt get one idiot who speculates in the billions on the market after thier trip to iceland lol
csm is a joke if ccp really wanted to hear what their playerbase think about this and that they would have serverwide pollsquestionnaires built in the client performed on regular basesbut one thing is certain csm looks cool in ccps portfolio
 which is why most nullsec alliances are seriously ed at the csm proposals for a nullsec revamp
what do you think when elected representatives of a whiny fickle and never sastified player base flies out and talks to the developerscsm do wantccp u cant haz
actually the current csm seem to have been doing a really good job now lets make sure to keep mittanis puppets out of there this time so that we can finally get that jump bridge nerf
i think if the csm built a working spaceship out of duct tape and old kitchen utensils half the eveo fora would still declare that they hadnt achieved anything
maybe they did
csm is just for show no really influence on ccp actionsfor how long csm asking to rebalance hybrid weapons year two and after all ccp just says well yeah maybe when we will add fancy laces into incarna and if there will be nothing to do else than we will think about thinking about doing hybrid rebalance in 18 months
i remember when the csm argued with ccp for hours over microtransactionsit was something like csm no you dontccp yes we arecsm you better notccp we going tocsm nuh uhccp ya huhso yea csm are there to give solid customer feedback but that doesnt mean the customer is always rightactually from a retail standpoint the customer is almost always wrongits just about making them think they are right
while technical support is all about them realising theyre wrong
and in the end ccp thought it over and adjusted their microtransaction policy no one says that the csm is always uselessand regarding the pet stuff well it only means that the majority of the voters care about certain things more than about others if you dont like it then start a campaign to convince voters to vote for someone else
im sorry our logs show nothing
at best you could say the csm efforts merely delayed microtransactions just wait until if incarna rolls around
you mad bromad you dont have sanctums to chainmad you dont have moon goo to suckmad your kb sucks arse
the power of the csm is limited to providing face to face feedback to ccp on issues that the vocal elements of the player base bring up and providing some focus group feedback on any nda items that ccp chooses to bring to their attention thats really all they are empowered to do they cant force ccp to respond to that feedback or force ccp to make any changes to eve or the direction they plan to take it ingiven what they are empowered to do i think this has been the most effective csm yetuntil a game company is founded on the business model of the player base as an invested stakeholder and owner of the product or company rather than a customer or a marketing target i dont expect that itll get much better than this
yeah i lost all confidence in the csm process when ccp failed to deal with certain individual joke csm members who were doing nothing but clowning aroundas far as im concerned the whole csm process is just as broken and useless as faction warfare
this thread is now about finding an amusing bacronym for csm
moved to jpsc from eve general
not all csms are in 00sec alliances nor the candidatesvote for one of these candidates and get some support from your corps and friends to help get them a spotgoodlucksip
if i get it it will be an honest victory i will not buy my way in sorry
i already made a deal with general windybutthe is our chosen one
goodluck and makesure you include your goals in your campaign application using the editing supplied aboveyoursserious
no
my question is simplewhy are a bunch of selfish arragont 00 pets representing the eve population influencing empire activitieswhy is there not a way where players can handle a way i dont know a way where real suggestions for the empire side of the game be handled properly and not dismissed by 00 playersi know this is abit weird im just curious
the people in the csm are in the csm because they were voted into the csm
if youre curious you should probably read the csm minutes theyll answer your questions quite nicely
why are people in the csm chosen only between a portion of the players demographics and not all of themyes i have paraphrased the op to make it reasonable and not a troll postit is relatively simple those demographics have high visibility figures while there arent equivalent figures in most of the other demographics there arent lists of famous mission runners or miners while between 00 alliances there are widely known figures the same between pirates and so on so most segment of the high sec population havent a figure that will rally enough voters to get a seat even if the high sec players are a majority of the eve active accounts some market forum guru has been elected in the past as they are the people with the highest visibility between those interested in high sec but they represent only a section of the high sec interests the best option for high sec voters is to read carefully the candidates agenda and try to vote the people with the more balanced agenda hoping to get a seat to one or two of them
because the empire players voted for an obviously unstable proven liar who was also a selfobsessed egomaniac who was thoroughly ignorant of the game to represent them when she extended her talents to breaking the nda she was kicked from the csm which was probably the single best thing she ever did for eve
could you maybe provide some evidence of this so far this is not my impression id be happy to answer your question when your facts is backed up by some hard evidence no youre not you just feel like ranting
its because so few vote in the csm election biggest turnout was 12 lowest as little as 7 that any large alliance can mobilise voters and guarantee a spotwhy not have a private seat at the ccp table to promote your interests and maybe just maybe get your hands on some juicy nda protected information ahead of everyone else ive written a proposal on the issue as well
because 90 of players are casuals who dont bother with reading walls of text csm candidates are putting on web or dont even know about csm while 00 population although being comparably small is naturally dedicatedhardcore and therefore very interested to vote and push their guys to the topironically ccps income is also coming mostly from those casual players but so far ccp didnt show much interest to hear their opinion about the game they are playing ad paying for
fyp
qft empire carebear i may be most of the time but i did a happy dance when she got kicked her ideas would have killed eve as we know it
no you have to ask players to give each one of them chance to state their opinion  directly thats of course if you really care about it
this people can  all they want about how the few hardcore can dictate how the game is developed but those few are the people who really care what happens to the game and are willing to put effort into achieving their goals the majority are simply here to play a game and either dont care or cant be bothered with politics if you think you can represent them apply for the csm and get them to support you and your ideas
sure they cannot dictate anything you are missing my point
no you dont nobody comes to my house to collect my vote irl  if i cant be bothered to find out whats what and then turn at the polling station thats my problem the same holds true for evethe fact that so few bother to vote simply tells us something we already knew  most people dont care that much about a game
00 powerbloc csm  keep jumpbridges or well quitccp  f you all incarna will pump us full of money to last until we have the twilight mmo released
fixedyoud suppose that if the csm is just a bunch of selfserving 00 reps they wouldnt be the ones who said jump bridges could go diaf
i was more refering to this upcoming csm which the tinfoil hatters seem to think would 00 powerbloc controlledthe only thing of note the current csm did was ok microtransactions for the game while they did shoot down remaps for plex they certainly allowed cash for vanity item bull so all the features that should have in the character creator will now cost rl moneybless them

mazz make sure to do that by the deadline a wiki page is part of the requirement to raise an issue just copy and paste an existing proposal that was already raised and change the details
escalate it to a senior gm and its not an exploit its a bug so bug report it actually taking advantage of it is an exploitif that doesnt get it fixed escalate it againit seems blatantly obvious to most sane people that this isnt working as intended the pos shields before and after dt should be the same
clear case of unintended consequenses of wh effects that have broken a previous existing system this isnt the first case when these wh effects have broken the game the effects themselves are great but ccp didnt bother to put safeguards in the system to prevent exploits and the breaking of existing systems just keep pestering them about it and continue to post bug reports dont accept their canned answers and keep explaining your points clearly and calmly all these issues the wh effects keep causing need to be fixed instead of being ignored but as usual ccp needs to have their snout firmly shoved in their own crap before they will admit there might be a problem
sorry i ran out of characters in the subject line i shall do the last letter hereuand thats appropriate really because u are the most important thing in this thread well i am actually but u are important too here this graphic shows how important u are to melinkageplease visit your user settings to reenable imagesi have 5 core policies so far but ccp locked the thread which kind of sapped my energy for the whole thingbasically i will be your voice on the csm no  not your actual voice my own voice is deep rich welleducated and booming i dont think that applies to many of you you squeaky voiced little adolescents but i will be your voice in as much as i have absolutely no policies at all yet and when elected i will campaign on the basis of whatever 5 policies are you the plebs tell me to campaign foradditionally i will campaign for1 introduction of a sobriety test  when logging on after a certain time in the evening you are forced to complete a complex series of keystrokes before youre allowed access to the market open a private convo or hit the undock button posting on caod is compulsory before youre able to spin your ship2 ummmm3 implementation of a killboard system for forum warfare4 compulsory poasts by dastommy one a day5 i can only think of 4 things so far6 introduction of a guest voiceover where every week a lucky player gets to rerecord the warp drive active thingy in whatever style they choose and every played has to endure it for a weekso anyway its over to you stick your half arsed campaign policies below and at some point ill put them on one of those social media websites on the information superhighway that allow the common man to upvote and downvote policies right im done now i really cant be arsed with all this

i like the idea of an update to the way going to warp appears i like the idea of there being some sort of visual indication that a ship is about to go to warp change in thruster colour robotic hampsters being deployed to start pushing whateverbut no change to the actual mechanics ie changes to the amount of time to warp etcdidnt ccp recently hire an effects artist perhaps this should be on their priority listso changes to graphics  supportedchanges to machanics  not supported
to further expand on thiscurrently ship warp speed doesnt count for toffee unless your making loooooong 30au warps how about your ship near instantly accelerates to top speed instead of the 10 seconds of acceleration and decceleration at either end of the journey

i also tried to get my alt fatter i was aiming for paunchy male drill sergeant and did get the face right but i couldnt get his beer belly right i mean really he spends all day in a badger he should be paunchy i also had trouble in getting my female alts nose bigger yes i know fine facial features what people want but honestly i was using my beautiful wife as a model and she does have an above average nose size for a femaletldr can we get fatter figures i guess it is too much to be able to actually model within normal limits of humans
what about man boobs for the larger capsuleermoobs ftw
oh and please ccp do not implement bouncie boobiesi dont want to go into a station and be greated by hundreds of women characters jumping up and down so that their 16 year old players can watch and touch themself
it has already been stated that no jumping and running will be available for characters in stations so jumping just to make boobs bounce is not a concern
this thread was posted a year ago oh god im screwedwish i hadnt put 7m sp in railsthey dont even look or sound as cool as the other guns cmon ccp do something
yeah thats a list of botters yes its that easy to point them out edit thats about 50 billion isk per day 15 trillion isk per month not counting any drops these are the bots that players with limited resources could find out i suspect trillions more are made by bots every month whether for the rmt or personal use the list contains only a fraction of null space theres tons of other null sec regions not to mention high sec with limited resources we have no idea how many more there isedit 2 link
this is one of the aspects addressed by my giant sovereignty reform proposal basically stations would be rolled into colonies in planetsmoonsbelts which would be built by alliances at great expense in time and effort more so than outposts these colonies would be the battle sites of sovereignty and would be fully destructible but not by dpstheoretically based on the system ive set up you would see a lot of infrastructure build up in the cores of larger alliances during peace time and a lot of destruction between alliances during war
i see what you did there1 anything to see cva whining more about how the sov system is imbalanced against their former holdings
hell noplayers didnt left to nullsec to risk everything they own even when they are not logged in
in that case supported
a similar proposal made by my humble self has already been passed by the csm
for anything player created there should be a way for other players to destroy it thats the reset button on a sandbox gameoutpost proliferation was a point of concern shortly after they were 1st introduced at the time ccp did acknowledge the potential for an issue and said they were not opposed to making them destroyable if it did become an issuei wont say that its a problem yet but i think were close enough that its time to start talking seriously about it if absolutely nothing else rebuilding after a scorched earth campaign would certainly revitalize the economy
qftthe rifling launcher pattern is probably the weakest ingame and the capacitor regeneration matrix actually gives more pg than the power core multiplier  go figure  allinall im happy with my tengu the way it is
have you compared prices recently this is like complaining that navy raven makes normal raven obsoleteand no fixing the proteus drone bandwidth would not make the ishtar obsolete because the ishtar would still have a bigger drone baysupported make proteus and legion relevant
you guys have no fuel catelyst lol you know as caldari im supposed to hate gallente scm but seriously i feel you deserve one nonetheless speed tanking is a big thing on a t3
i support this 
for sure theres a need to review some subswhat seems the more obvious for me is the proteus drone setup not even able to fit 5 heavy drones seems ridiculousa range bonus on all rr subs would be heaven also
when you board a ship from a pos you should start out at full shields as if you just unlocked from a station currently when you board a ship at a pos you will start with around 3050 shields when i board my onyx i start at 21 shields because of this pvp combat based out of a pos currently gives armor tanked ships an unbalanced advantage take a real life example that happens to me on a regular basis you are scanning in your wh when you see someone pop up on your dscan and they start clearing sleepers you are currently cloaked and they have no idea you are there you run to your pos and grab your pvp ship whatever it may be now you run into a problem you are a shield tanker and your shields are currently around 40 you have two choices wait for your shields to recharge and as pvp shield tanked ships generally rely on hpbuffers and not recharge rates this can take a very long time or go attack the intruder immediately with your severely crippled shields the first option of waiting will likely result in the intruder seeing you and fleeing almost every time resulting in you never getting a kill the second option of attacking immediately will have a very high probability of you dying quite oftencurrently armor tanked ships have a greatly unbalanced advantage over shield tanked ships in pvp combat based out of a pos when you get a chance to kill someone you generally need to act immediately this means running back to your pos grabbing your pvp ship and running right back into action not grabbing your pvp ship and then sitting in your pos for 5 minutes waiting on your shields to recharge this is a problem that really needs to be fixed
i propose a second filterfirst player approval via the forum a posted screen shot of the proposed vanity itemsecond ccp council could be elected players approval via a submission after player approval in the forumthe ops idea does make an interesting new profession oh you are wearing last seasons atreides shoes fluh
if it can be done im all for it
this would take the dull out of manufacturing
as ive said before id love the idea of putting up advertising messages on billboardsmaybe also put more billboards and bigger ones around too like say at station undock so people cant go around and drop a truckload of secure cans anchored some distance away from a station just to advertise themselvesmight have to put in some quality control for the adds themselves but otherwise ccp go for itill easily pay 1020m a week for having my face plastered on a billboard telling you to buy my stuff ofcourse the price of billboards would depend on the system ofc just like station office prices a billboard at jita 44 is prime realestate so should be comparatively expensive
itd be fun
this is one area where microtransactions are both harmless and can be applied in a really useful mannersupported 1nb i wonder how long it will take ccp to figure out that they can have actual reallife companies do ingame ads
like
cleverthis allows blasters to fill their intended role as a unique weapon1
i think the idea is perfect
btw if ccp implement this a new turret effect would be nice bonus
please give the miners a nice optical effect the amarr have her colored lasers why not the minersi think my idea is low complexity to implement thiscolored rays of strip miners for the different types of mining crystals a nice amplification for the atmospherean example for the different types of mining crystalsplease visit your user settings to reenable imagesand here an example for a situation in a high sec belt with veldspar mexallon scordite and pyroxeresplease visit your user settings to reenable imagesi hope you like my idea i speak for many miners
awesome
we are only asking them to so something and untill now we only see ignore mode activatedthere are many solutions on this forum and ccp can look at them and decide what is the best thing to do or they have something betteris it bot recognizing software in client is it changes in game mechanics is it something else or combination of all its up to themjust please do something
unconditionally support
great attitude then why are you here
imolocal fine as ismap fine as isdscan fine as iskillmails fine as iscloaking fine as isnot knowing what is waiting at the undock fine as isnot having deathstars at gates fine as isprobing mechanics not entirely fine but needs a nerf not a buff willing to keep as ishaving whine threads about too much intel totally fine as is
supportop has stated why these things are not fine if you think they are fine its best to explain why they are
actually he has only stated that they are not fine but he has not give any reasoned justification for the claim this holds true for both the individual proposals and the overall passive intell is badmmmkay context in which he has made the post
ERROR
you understand if weve got scripted magstabs inevitably wed have to have scripted heat sinks scripted gyrostabs and scripted bcus as well right im not neccessarily objecting to that by the way i just want to make sure you see this
yes that possibility exists in this context i am considering it as a unique functionality of hybrids and their weapon upgrades
comments suggestions
seem to be a good idea dit gives more ways to fit a ship and thus more options to do stuff
hello csmthis is the first tyme ive tryed to contact you so im sorry if iv got this wrongi am asking for any information to that thing that is passed around tyme and tyme again and seems to have become something of a joke to most players the hybrid weapon systems and in particular blastersdont hurt methere are posts with sujestions on how to fix them whats wrong with them ways of getting around them everything except and i appologise if iv missed it anything with any hard facts i read in the reports of when you went to iceland that you talked about them but due to restrictions you couldnt say more now i understand that fully but as a topic that hasnt changed in many years and with has had no more said about it than its under discusion i am asking for any information you can tell usif you cant for any reason could you say what that reason isany reply to this will be welcome and i hope i didnt go on too long i dont even use blasters yours votingchrome
there are comparison between various ships fitted for same role in hybrid threads these are as hard as facts will get csm and ccp has not enacted any change on ccp or sisi they probably have some kind of internal balance mechanism but thats just my guess
ccp was aware of projectiles for a good 2 years before coming out with a quite lovely fix ccp has been aware of hybrids for over a year now the fact that csm is gagged on saying anything about their discussions is probably a good sign that a change is coming fairly soon
sounds like a very clever use of mechanics one that even takes a modicum of planning preparation and iskisnt that the kind of gameplay we want in evewhat you should ask for is for an offline tower to have poor ehp so it can be dropped relatively easy bonus for helping to get rid of offline spires hogging moons all over the cluster
it is clever but its also incredibly carebearish its hard to believe cap ship owner in 00 can be that much of a pussythis definitely deserves a change 00 travel should not be 100 safe even for supercapsi also agree that offlined pos should have poor ehp so even 1 battleship can kill it in half hour
exploit yeah clever yeah practical no just jump to the damn station its 100 safe as you cant be targeted for 30s after jumping if you dont activate any modsnavigate and virtually all stations have huge dock ranges these days if people want to expose their poss to attack needlessly like this im inclined to let them admittedly super caps cant dock but there are easier ways to get them namely killing them in battle
thats not my point imagine i have 6 pos low sec that let me go from north to south i just need to move my alt to tower offline it and online it again in last 10 seg i jump my 9000 titans knowing i cant be killedprobably alot people dont know this but it kinda sucks if everyone starts doing this nobody will be able to kill any supercap lowsec00 that jumps to cynofield
its not exploit cyno is open before tower goes onlineand its 100 practical if u do it corp level
yeah noone does it
a pos requires 30 minutes to anchor and 30 minutes to online during which time the pos is completely vulnerable to attack just kill the pos
i am fully capable of seeing what it is you are talking about but your solution is inelegant to say the leastreduce offline ehp and you can knock out any of the towers thus stranding any ships in transithell even making all ships except the active pos manager bounce on bubbleup is more elegant than a base no cyno for you
tell me non mercenary corpallaince that cares about random pos if u destroy it they will just put another one up if u put poses all over moons they will just pop one of them if you really want system full of your poses they will just use another low sec systemthere isnt way to counter it
reduce offline ehp poses are online they only offline it for just 1 hour to jump their expensive stuffif you got issue about offline tower ehp just create new topic with valid arguments
his solution of reducing the offline ehp was pretty good something that would allow a smallish group of bss to kill it within 1530 minutes would be awesome if someone wants to take an hour per cyno risk an undefended 50300m in assets just to move something safely then let them i dont see anything overpowered or broken with their actions please explain how it is adversely affecting the game
if people want to move something cheap and insignificant by spending 50 mil in assets then i have no problembut when people can move something very important and expensive in 100 safety then theres a big problembig isk  big risk
last update ccp changed current cyno distant from poses to 15km that means when you jump to pos you will always appear 15km from shieldswhat im starting see more is people using this method i mentioned at begining post theres big risk when you jump to pos in low sec because at 15km from sheilds youre vunerable to hotdrops
hotdrop their tower and blow it up while you might not get the satisfaction of a 4b isk jf killmail if you kill two or three of their towers theyll reconsider using this method their still risking something moderate valuable for the safety of something extremely valuable hence i dont really see the big deal
i will expand on my previous point given the penchant for people running industrial or ratting ops in 00 to hide behind cyno jammers and jb networks at the end of a single pipe dogleg with 30 bubbles on the in gate there is literally no other way to have an affect on day to day alliance operations or get the chance of a killblack ops dont have a long range good intel channels and regular patrols will warn of threats as they emerge not when they drop on you add enemy black ops pilots to your address books find out where they live have an afk cloaker watching them so you know if theyre forming up to come and get youhere i made you a handy flow chart of actions and options to take in the event of an afk cloaker entering local
cant wait till local is finally nerfedthese 00 carebears need to be purged back to high sec just reading these whines makes me want to strangle them with my bare hands
you do realize that a cloak change will not solve the problem of afk camping a system people can also camp it with an unprobeable cyno ship thats why many of the best solutions to these attacks revolve more on the cyno mechanic rather than cloaking for every cloaky ratter camper there are 3 mostly afk cloaky intel eyes which your going to mess with additionally given the potential awards from living in null sec there aught to be plenty of risks try to find a solutions that provides a middle ground between the hunter and the hunted
i agree that cloaking up in a system is a very good way to disrupt industrial operation i believe this is the 3rd time that i have said that i think its a perfectly legitimate tactic the use of black ops and covert cynos has been a great addition to the game imo but being able to walk away from your computer knowing that you are in no danger of losing your ship while it floats out in 00 space is garbage if you are logged on to eve and your ship isnt in a station you should be in danger of losing it the players running anoms mining doing patrols sitting in fleets gate camping pos bashing and doing whatever else are at the computer while doing it why dont you have to be and its doesnt matter if there are 1000 bubbles on a gate that wouldnt add any more danger to a cloaky ship getting into the system than 1havent run into an issue with unprobeable ships before but a very good point that i hadnt thought about before thank youand the reason i started this thread was to not only bring attention to the issue but to allow a forum for discussion of what the fairest way would be to deal with the problem i feel that forcing the cloaker to have to press f1 to reactivate his cloak occasionally shouldnt disrupt anyone from using a cloaking ship unless they are doing so without actually being at the keyboardmaybe you should spend less time trolling the forums and afking waiting for someone to give you an easy kill of a pve ship and more time actually fighting pvpers it would make you seem much less lame both on the forums and the killboards its pretty entertaining to see how the people doing most of the pointless complaining are the ones saying those with pointed issues are whiners
because they cant kill people that see them log on there is no warning however that they sat down at their computer and god forbid they fight within the same confines everyone else does
not supported cloaking is fine afking is fine local and cynos are overpowered
is it me or does this thread appear every other week with the same exact numbers of responses heavily favoring not changing the mechanic
the funny thing is that if you were some how able to force those players you dont like ie the carebears back in to high sec youd then be whining to ccp to force them back to you so you could viagraup your killboardyour idiotic inference that docked afk players are some how causing a combat threat on a system shows that eithera you dont understand the problem orb you do and are pusrposely redherring the issuemy bet is on b but meh you never can really tell on these forumson a different note maybe if ccp were to remove local and make it so that predator has the overwhelming avantage over prey then predators can sooner rather than later overhunt lonull sec space leaving them bored out of their minds and with nothing else to pump up their epeens eventually driving them out of the gameeither way carebears win 
matrixskye mk2 personally i dont care much for killboardthe main point i was making is that staying afk cloaked in space is exactly same thing as staying afk docked or afk at posin all cases you appear in local chat channel but you are 100 safe and dont need to be at the keyboardthe root of the issue here is the face in local thats what it all boils down to no face in local  no afk cloaker problemand as i also said if you are willing to give tools to kill afk cloakers in space then it would make sense to also provide tools to kill afk docked people and afk posed up people as long as they are afk it should be possible to kill them righton other hand if you dont think thats right if you dont think that afk docked people should be forced out of their stations and die then you have no right to demand the same thing to be done to afk cloakers
i think a rather eloquent solution would be to have a spool up timer for regular cynos once a ship decloaksthe argument has been made that while a cloaker is afk in a system he cant hurt you this is a valid point but the fact remains that you can never tell when a cloaker is simply scouting or preparing to hotdrop you the cloak mechanic seems fine the way that it is and griefing is working as intended but it seems rather silly that someone can go into enemy territory cloak up and then drop a cyno almost immediately upon decloaking this gives the defender no real opportunity to counter a hot dropi say change the cyno mechanic in relation to cloaking not cloaking itselfps i feel that covert cynos should be able to be lit immediately upon decloaking
delayed from entering local for 60 seconds after entering a system characters in cloaked ships no longer show up in localno need to worry about afk cloakers bro
afk in station is definitely not the same thing as a person in station poses no threat and is only applicable to a relatively small number of npc systems a person afk in a pos leaves a potential avenue for recourse kill the pos there is no avenue for recourse from an afk cloaker and they do represents a legitimate threat to carebear as soon as they return to the keyboard while your vulgar solution would solve the problem it is not the root of the issue the root of the issue is the balance between risk and reward anyone that has carebeared in nullsec knows that it provides the easiest venue for isk generation to balance it it is supposed to be fairly dangerous with a significant amount of risk since it is hard to both carebear and pewpew at the same time the carebears want an avenue of recourse against all forms of risk a good solution needs to be a middle ground where the cattle with horns can fend off a wolf local is the largest intel tool in the game which provides benefits far beyond protecting nullsec carebears before you remove it wed need a much better alternative to intel gather beyond the onboard scanner i very much support a 1020s delay between entering local and appearing in local but not the removal of local covert ops stealth bombers recons and covert t3s are not extremely powerful ships two ratting bss can make short work of any one of these ship types this is why a spool up timer on a cyno is a huge boon to the defenders if you cant kill an immobile cyno target in 3045s then you deserve to die you dont have complete safety and you shouldnt given null sec rewards but you can have a reasonable recourse to a hotdrop especially when you carebear in groupsanother reasonable solution i can think of that doesnt involve nerfing cloaks is to increase the intel from local create an inactive icon that appears on all inactive members in system it would appear on anyone docked in a station and anyone that doesnt interact with their ui for 10 minutes it would disappear whenever someone undocks or whenever someone interacts with their ui ie warps scans changes course etc i think either of these solutions are better than forcing a covert ship to be at the keyboard and alert most of the time they are online
i havent been involved in faction warfare at all but i really like the idea of it ive heard that it needs some work though and i have had a few thoughts on what i would like to see it become my idea would require a whole revamp on what faction warfare is what i think could be a fun idea is to create a new type of space 11 or faction space war space fact space whatever we want to call it it would comprise of 20 border zone systems 10 between amarr and minmatar and 10 between caldari and gallente faction warfare would only take place in these 20 systems if you sign up to participate you are still allowed access through all empire regions just the opposing side npcs will shoot you on sight in these new 11 systems your free to shoot other players that also participate only in 11 systems and you dont need to be in a special corp anyone can sign up regardless of the corp you are currently in think of it as a tag that you enable this way you can do your normal thing with your friends and not be excluded allowing for more participationthese systems would be objective based similar to the new sansha incursion sites a new fleet format would be introduced each system acquires its own automatic fleet formation if you are on a faction side and you enter a 11 system you are asked in a pop up window if you want to join the battle selecting yes leaves any current fleet your in and places you in an npc fleet with an npc as the fleet boss free move would be on and no leadership skills take effect in order to prevent exploiting from the other team in case they filled up a side with alts in leadership roleseach system will have areas warpable on the overview and can vary in objectives one idea would be to have two weapon manufacturing outposts you would warp to your own faction outpost bringing you to an acceleration gate which places you 75k from the outpost and loot a bomb item from it a new bomb item would not spawn until the first one has been destroyed you can jettison the bomb but if not picked up in 30 seconds the can will despawn if an enemy picks up your bomb it will blow up their ship the objective is to destroy the enemy outpost by looting it and placing a bomb which will drop the outposts health by 10 so you need 10 bombs to win one catch is that surrounding the weapons outpost is a new stasis webifyer bubble that only affects the opposing team it would be 10  75k in radius allowing for more tactics once one side wins the outposts are immune for 12 hours and no bombs are spawned giving that side temporary control over the system bonus lp is awarded for the victors the map will reflect who has control holding 75 of the systems will grant you a bonus to lp gain holding 100 of the systems will give you an even higher bonus destroying the opposing faction player ships will grant lp and isk by size of ship small med largeanother scenario would apply to only 2 systems with each side having 5 initial areas across the bordered systems on one end of the line is each teams main staging system you would have to control all 4 of the middle systems for a dreadnaught to spawn in the final system only when defeated will you gain control of the last area which then after 23 hours your dreadnaught will spawn this allows the other side to attack it to press on the attackers will also get additional npc battleships as reinforcement to encourage constant flipping of control the bonuses are meant to just be temporary rewards for players who were recently active this idea is more for casual players where systems are constantly being flipped and short term bonuses apply allowing for casual pvp with minimal organization you should be able to log in if you only have a short time for 30 mins to 2 hours and get right in on the actionim sure it would need a lot of tweaking but thats the general outline of the idea
so you know nothing about fw but are suggesting improvements to it i suggest trying fw first then coming up with ideasas for the ideas themselves i think theyre terrible not supported
im just throwing ideas out there to gauge an opinion as to the ideas themselves i know its very different from what it is now i wasnt talking about a simple fix or tweak but a complete change to what faction warfare is if its as terrible as people say isnt that what needs to happen what about these ideas do you think are terrible and why would they not work

jesus ing christ noone of the main reasons removing jump bridges completely is to cut back on power projection even if they were moved to a planet and made public it still would not cut back on a blob from zipping across the galaxy in a via a couple jump bridges to crush a seven man roaming gang and be back for teaby removing jump bridges completely you dramatically reduce the amount of players who are willing to want to travel a ton of jumps just for a couple guys roaming three regions away because it is not worth the effortyou are also wanting to increase its hit points which means if someone wanted to offlinereinforce it before be blobed to hell and back you need your own blob to do it quickly
jump bridges make 00 a lot more accessible as well i think if you take them out many people will simply leave making for less pew pew
sure it will very few systems would be able to have 2 jump bridges youd need additional conventional gate jumps and the jb network can be more easily interdicted by ones opponents
there is the solution maybe add the ability for hostile forces to knock them offline and bobs your uncle or aunt who knows these days
more options as far as ships go higher efficiency with ships and weapons bigger price to pay if you die its reasonable the way it is
support for jump clone change although i would prefer local switching to have a much shorter timer something where i can log on switch to a combat clone go look for a fight and get killed and then return to my initial clone the shorter the local switch cooldown is the betteri could live with your medical clone change and i can see why to do it but im not really for it no one really loses sp so the only real consequense is the cost my only problem with the current system is how it scales my income earning has been pretty stable after the first year but my clone costs keep scaling indefinitely this is bs and i would be happy if it stopped after a certain point and if that point would keep flying in cheap frigate or lol gangs feasibleeither way even the unaltered proposal in the op is preferable to the current situation
i think the poor old people are the exception and not the rule so wouldnt use that as an argument isk and assets accumulate over time especially assetsjumpclone sounds good with one addition a maximum of two jumps within a 24hr period pew and still have time to jump to ratting clone and back to pew as nauseum null would be the ultimate carebear land is bad now but always room for improvement medicals it is annoying to have to pay for a fitted bc if i lose a frigate but since most people jump out of implant clones when going for pew the cost of implants cannot be used as argumentkeep costs a little lower than they are refundrebate cost if lost clone had implants ten slots so a nice even 10 per slot  means you have to stock up on 1s for the suicide trips to get a 50 to clone upgrade with reduced base cost it should be manageable even for the old paupers
agreed with cooldown reduction dont care about clone cost
its not reasonable the way it is how does making pvp more expencive add t variety what why
what about no module stacking at allthat means no stacking multiple modules of the same type instead of diminishing returns it is module doesnt stack with with the same effect he didnt say what about no module stacking penaltywould this include having multiple armorshield repair modules what about capacitor modules i know that when i do pve you have to be cap stable while having an armor rep running they would have to increase overall cap recharge and shield recharge or totally revamp pve im in favor of having more tools to use instead of having all mid slots cap recharger iis but im wary of this proposal to overhaul the entire fitting system i think it would make the game much easier to balance from a ccp perspective but would require a complete rebalance of the entire system
what is the goal of your nerf exactly only 1 hp boosting module of each kind 1 shield extender 1 armor plate ecc only 1 module affecting the same stat of the ship cap recharger hardener tracking computer ecc or whatand what will happen when 1 get to use only 1 tracking computer but my enemy bear 2 or 3 tracking disruptors against my ships or ecm or td eccwhat will happen when more than one of my friends is rring meonly the strongest module will work 1 from each ship every module coming from other ships will be affecting me but only one of mine would affect megive a reply to all the above and we will see if your idea has some merit
i just mean modulesi can fit one dcu should be one hardener of each type one kenetic one em etc one invul field one extender basically just the stat boosting modules if you think about it very few ship configurations would actually change and those very few are considered overpowered and are going to get nerfed in the future anywaysi just think hardeners and extendersplates are too powerful ccp has been fighting these modules since the game came into being id say just kill shield extenders but i think a lot of the damage mods screw up mechanics a bit too muchobviously not all modules ecm ships with multiple ecms webs etc anything offensive doesnt really count as theyre more lke midmounted weaponsand a lot of you think you wouldnt be able to adapt id like to know some ships that would be totally ruined by this change name 3 ships that will become useless in level 4 missions that arent battlecruisers who really shouldnt be solo in level4 missions and ill agree that this change would be stupid or pvp ships that will become completely useless because of this changeon your pointand what will happen when 1 get to use only 1 tracking computer but my enemy bear 2 or 3 tracking disruptors against my ships or ecm or td eccits just a good point i cant really think of a counter there would obviously have to be rebalance for situations like this or simply we could just live with it and figure out better ways to counter it like uh training more drone skills for those who can fit more launchers i can get webbed and warp disrupted by multiple people and defending against those causes me to suffer harsh stat penalties if i can defend against it at all
my abaddon requires 2 hardeners of each type to do hard level 4s even sansha ones require 3 total hardeners so that means dual repping and no high capacitor lasers id be back to dual heavy pulse lasers and angels dont take enough damage from those type without 3 heat sinks for me to complete the missions in a reasonable amount of time however if they were to implement this they could scale back npc resistences and damage a bit to make them doable shamless propeither that or they could remove the team killing aspect of fleeting making level 4s take more than one personshameless prop
what is funny about this entire thread is that everybody has completely misunderstood the op he is not saying to remove stacking penalty of modules but to remove module stacking entirely meaning you can only have one bcu on your drakeperiod no need for a stacking penalty because you cant stack modules at allpersonally i will not support this because it will then reduce the diversity of fits that we have right now and change the mechanics just a bit too much for my liking
what is funny is the lack of people reading the thread the two people above the ops last post knew it was no stacking
i should mention that this was intended as a partial fixproblem lots of people talking about rebalancing capital ship warfaregoal to reinforce combined arms fleets and to get more dreadnoughts and carriers into the mix while further refining the role of the super carrieri agree with some of the things said in an earlier thread concerning reducing the amount of regular drones that super carriers can carry to make them more dependent on other ships but i would like to give something back to super carriers to make it cool to fly them all the numbers are for discussion only i pulled them out of my arse for discussion it would be necessary to allow dreadnoughts to receive some repair from carriers when in siege mode in order to balance out the carriers and super carriers fleet against the carriers and dreadnoughts fleet the repair amount could be balanced by reducing the effectiveness of carrier rr on dreads in siege mode through some sort of diminishing returns or requiring carriers to be in triage modeall super carriers99 reduction in cpu need for warfare link modules can fit projected electronic counter measures can deploy 3 additional fighters fighter bombers or drones per level can fit 1 additional warfare link module per level 200 bonus to fighter or fighter bomber control range immune to all forms of electronic warfareaeon5 bonus to all armor resistances per level 5 bonus to capital energy and armor transfer range per level to all carriers in the scs unit2 increase in dreadnought weapon tracking with an equivalent increase in dreadnought missile explosion velocity per level to all dreadnoughts in the scs unitwyvern5 bonus to all shield resistances per level5 bonus to capital energy and shield transfer range per level to all carriers in the scs unit2 bonus to dreadnought weapon rate of fire per level to all dreadnoughts in the scs unitnyx5 bonus to deployed fighters or fighter bomber damage per level5 bonus to capital energy and armor transfer range per level to all carriers in the scs unit2 bonus to deployed fighter damage to all carriers in the scs unithel5 bonus to shield and armor transfer amount per level to all carriers in the scs unit5 bonus to capital shield and armor transfer range per level to all carriers in the scs unit2 bonus to dreadnought weapon damage per level to all dreadnoughts in the scs unit

ive seen some rather complex ideas with regard to jump clones of late however ive always been a proponent of a much simpler idea allow 2x clone jumps per day instead of just 1x but have the second jump cost you 25 of the price of your current medical clone that way ppl can go pvp in a cheap implant clone and then go back to their all 5 clonerationale older characters can afford to lose a bit of training time they can fly pretty much all they want and time is simply pressing less on them younger players however are still frantically trying to get to where they want to be fast and are thus less motivated to lose an entire day of fullspeed training for each pvp opthe second jump should cost you a bit but not insanely so more like if youre really that ocd about not losing training time fork over that 5 mil then if you really want it
the problem with this is that while simple it is also much worse than the more complex ideas this retains the ability to teleport across the galaxy multiple times a day which is something i dont really want to see and you are mixing medical clones with jump clones something you might want to keep clearly separate since new players seem to mix them up at times even now i also dont see what is on principle wrong with allowing people to switch jump clones locally without limits so why penalize people at all for doing it it encourages more varied implant use and implant use in general since you can easily switch between clones designed for different activities it would also encourage more people to participate in pvp without affecting the existing risk vs reward equation yes it wont turn a carebear into a lion or even be enough for everyone but it removes one unnecessary obstacle from that paththe point is you cant get advantages from implants not in your current jump clone and people are unlikely to risk heavily implanted clones in combat this especially if the implants arent even combat related so it goes from simple risk aversion to just not being grossly stupid yes some people will risk it but most people wont and there isnt a reason to retain this barrier id like to see that block of casualrisk averse people or people whose main activity isnt combat and who are therefore usually implanted for noncombat activities doing more occasional pvpwhat is the harm in that since implants dont show on killmails even killmail s can only benefit from this change the only possible consequenses are seein more targets to shoot at and people retiring from combat to a carebearingtraining clone for the night so the only negative is people being able to retire to a bettermore fitting clone after a pvp incursion and not be forced to stay in a crappy clone until the 24 cooldown is overare people really so bitter that they want to keep crappy old mechanics because they cant stand the idea of people being able to get the best of both casual pvp and high grade implant use even when it wont change the game for the worse you dont need to answer that i took part in the remove learning skill discussions for years i know exactly how they are
good idea however they would need to cost something significan as isk is no problem for big powerblocs wanting to defend multiple systems in different parts of the universeeg make the extra jump cost a weeks worth of skillpoints
i like many others think low sec isnt broken so much that its a perception issue preventing it from being populated a thought i had on this would be to increase the travel through it by making it less risky if the gate gun damage was increased by a large amount eliminating small gate camps it would take many more ships to have a successful gate camp a gate camp in low sec would be very rare but not impossible if you werent told dont even go to low sec its camped instead hearing you can go there but just be careful when you do stuff people would travel through it with no fear find a system with no one there and begin pi mining or rating as they please so it brings people there with little risk to travel from gate to gate but still a large risk to mission or mine bringing the fights to take place in those areas it encourages people to play smart and pay attention a place you cant afk like high sec but can still have fun in for a slightly greater rewardi think once people are in low sec systems and see how they can access it easier they will be tempted and get bolder being active in the space and bringing a small group seems a lot easier without the worry of gate campsanother change i think should help encourage more low sec activity would be to remove security loss for destroying someones ship but increase the sec loss for podding someone i know for many people the reduction of security status is a strong deterrent especially if you are not making an income through ratting or missioning this makes people primarily want to pvp in wormholes and 00
changing the sentry damage wont do what you hope m8 sorrry to say camp compositionsize will change to compensate for the new mechanicsthe sec hit thing is not really that big of an issue for people who go looking for fights solosmall gang the key there being looking for fights pop haulers all day and it drops faster the hits are really more a problem for people in gangs andor are too lazy like i was to shoot a few rats when things were quiet i would be cool with lessening the hit but that is merely preference and not something that i think is necessaryyou are correct imo that perception is a large part of the issue but this starts at the no0b corp level and good luck trying to speak rationallyrealistically there you will be shouted down by those who think they know stuff quickly
protip those camps youre so afraid of outside of a very small number of systems they dont exist
the factual accuracy of your statement means very little to players who are terrified of lowsec and losing ships
enough of the obvious low sec entrance points are very often camped if rookie jumps in and first thing he sees from low sec is also the last thing it will be very long before he goes there again and yeah i live in low sec myself usuallyupping gategun damage is best way to get low sec populated and more targets for the pirates since contrary to what many pirates seem to think making it easier to get killed in low sec does not actually give them more kills in the long run but tbh it will never happen
low sec travel is 99 safe if you have mwdcloak fittedreally the travel part isnt a problem its the lack of rewards high sec level 4s can give 70 mil an hour why bother low secand 00 has more rewards yet can be much safer than low sec if you join a big power blockso if you want very low risk  good rewards you stay in high secif you want some risk  great rewards you join 00 power block
id rather remove the aggression sec status penalty that way you still lose sec for ganking haulers and stuff but you dont lose anything by shooting first against someone that will fight back another change i would like is to make anyone with 00 sec status to be a free target in lowsec so you dont go gcc shooting them i would personally love for anyone in lowsec to be able to shoot me without penalty without having to go 5 and be barred from flying in highsec
that was my main point i would hope it would change the larger the fleet the more rarer they would be for example what if you made the gate gun damage so high that in order to have a successful gate camp you would need a carrier or dreadnaught maybe two even
id love to see this implemented there is quite a big eve blog community out there and being able to use openid linked back to evegate would be awesome
one reason to play a mmorpg is to play with other people then you get to know them and become friends and stay with the game because your friends play it however in eve this can be harder because you should not fleet with people you dont trust how can i trust someone if i dont do anything with them suppose im suppose to find friendsfleet members in my own corp what about small corps are we going to continue to make starting a new corp hard because we have to trust corp members there is also a reality check here in real life at least in the usa if i join up with someone they dont automatically get rights to bash my face in unless they want a conflict and say wanna take this outside and then i agree i propose a change to fleet rules lets have an option to disable team attacking or enable it as is i dont fleet with people to do missions and this means less friends in game and less attachment to the game i do like doing missions with people but i usually dont because i dont want to lose my ship to someone who wants a abaddon kill mail
errrr last time i checked it was not possible to attack a fleetmember who was not in ones corp without incurring the wrath of concord in highsec at least
they should add more outfits the ones they have are lame im a bussiness man and all there is for me is some stupid looking gayshaman outfit i want a pant suit set in multiple colors added in with the ability to customize a handchef thats folder in the breast pocket of my sportjacket also a choice of pins to pin to my suit and a tasteful selection of ties and maybe some albino aligator dress shoes you have one week
ahemps  not to be a fashionista but are you posting from 1978
what smaller alliances
the fact that some existing features serve to screw over smaller alliances does not mean youre free to ignore the danger of further screwing them over when introducing new featuresgranting an outpost wrecker which megacoalitions can churn out in large numbers and hold over the heads of smaller groups to keep them on their knees is a powerful tool for maintaining the status quo pretty much everyone seems in principle to be in favour of ccp reworking 00 to somehow incentivise smaller spaceholding alliances but granting another tool which will more likely be used against them than by them clearly risks working against that aimand of course to ensure a level playing field its only fair that such a weapon should also be deployable against npc stations in lowsec and npc 00 perhaps introduced as part of an expanded and revamped factional warfare review
1 there arent any small alliances independantly holding space in sov 00 nor are there ever likely to be on anything except a very temporary basis2 even if there were how could it worse for them to be kicked out of their space and the outpost to be wrecked  which allows them at least a chance to retrieve assets  than it is for them to simply be kicked and to be locked out of the outpost3 outpost wrecking is actually more dangerous for large alliances since as i said on page 1 they actually have to defend their peripheral outposts rather than complacently assuming that they can let 1 or 2 fall to an insurgency only to gain them back later
supported
this would be nice but the actual icons need to be slimlined becuase the red blue thing could be confused with standing to a new playeralso make it so that when you rr you dont get the red flashy scquare but instead a blue square highlighting none threatening behaviour
i like the idea supported if you have to add manually the tags you keep the confusion in large battles while it will reduce the chance of stupid mishap that can be generated by lag when operating in small groups
epic idea
as you all know the bounty hunting system is not used as intended i have seen many ideas on how to fix this im not quite sure how effective they would be but after thinking on it for a while i came up with this ideafirst off lets take a look on why the system fails its purpose if someone were to place a bounty on my head well thats just great let me find a friend to kill me and we can split the payout that is the root of the problem the one with the bounty wants to be killedhere is my solution to that problem we have to make it so that you do not want to be killed when you have a bounty on your head this can be achieved through penalties upon your corpse being turned in a couple thoughts ive had would be to have concord disable your implants preventing them from functioning for 30 or 60 days or reduce your attributes by one or two points across the board temporally for 60 days maybe even just limit it to one implant slot for 30 days per each corpse turn in to prevent to much griefing you can refine it in many ways but i think this is a step in the right directionthis way you make it annoying to the point where i dont want to pod myself for any amount of money without really making any game breaking changes you wont get alliances placing bounties on every enemy alliance member in order to compete it goes along with tech 3 penalties i know when im about to lose a tech 3 ship as long as i eject i can breathe a sigh of relief isk comes and goes but whats really valuable to players are skills forgetting to update a clone is devestating but losing a pile of isk happens to us allone other deterrent for alliances to go at it with the bounty system would be to introduce a couple of skills with the primary attribute being charisma of course you could have the first tier of skill provide a 1 bonus to the payout per level 5 not a huge isk faucet and the second tier skill actually allow bounty collections each level providing 1 extra turn in per month and unlimited at level 5 anyone without the collection or liscense skill couldnt turn a corpse into the bounty office
but they do work immediately on smaller targets it was one of your primary reasons for shooting down the proposal in the first place quote better cap stability than now and total neut immunity at any range is unbelievably powerful battleships  which are already pretty well useless  will have utterly no recourse against frigates none at allpainters are stacking penalized and require med slots which is an important distinction scrams youre right but that only shuts off one capusing module rather than all of themonly on a specialized ship with specialized skills using med slots with heavy stacking penalty good luck talking people into giving up a med slot for mediocre ewar 4 damps on nonbonused hulls against a geddon in a gang with no sensor boosters still bring it to 216km if all 4 damps have the specialization skill at v you make this assumption based solely on a frigate which id argue is already quite neutimmune thanks to small cap boosters and small nos lets see you make a neutimmune activetanked blasterthron or really a neutimmune activetanked anything
micros are supposed to be phased out if i recall the bpos were replaced with smalls some time agomalediction3x rocks a whopping 1mwdii small peroxide disruptiidcuii 2xspeedneut immune tackler with more than enough firepower to clear drones hardly unable to performsame picture for pretty much all other ships you can even make a mwd neut immune rifter that can itself neut for ten full minutestoday yes with your suggested changehalffull tank 800rt rupture with lperoxidehow about a neut immune kiting omennomen or perhaps a thoraxwhat of the logistics we have eccm implants now so reducing the number of counters to ecm only and then mitigating thatpeople are already more than happy to use fitting mods even with very low slot counts available if it will give them an edgeneuts are insanely powerful if you can afford the cap giving not only immunity but more cap to use neuts yourself can only result in the batteries becoming as standard as the neuts themselvesthink about it run the numbers we did with the ab af suggestion from ccp and shot it down even before sisi results started trickling in  the analytical mind can be a powerful tool
two things it helps to finish reading the point i already addressed your concern that quote doesnt do anything to invalidate or change what i saidscrams dont just shut off one cap using module they immediately and totally kill the mobility of any ship affected the mobility is the important part furthermore painters still dont have a counter and in many ways high slots are more important than mid slots tracking disruptors are actually quite common on unbonused ships furthermore im not sure why youre focusing on unbonused ships given that the change in question is specifically aimed at bonused ships see the comments i pointed out earlier in the threadno i make the assumption based on having flown kitingnano ships before neuts are very nearly your only fear furthermore the malediction sacrilege and stabber fleet issue were all capable of having pretty reasonable active tanks under an infinite amount of neuts from bonused ships i stopped trying after the first three ships worked outliang
if youre not going to see any effect before the fight is over then why do nano ships fear neuts whens the last time you tried to fly a ship with guns that take cap and fit to active tank unless they have an afterburner in which case it does nothing a warp disruptor wouldnt do better hey a tactical choice where having a scram isnt automatically the best ideai havent been affected by a tracking disruptor in 8 months second neuts are common on anything with spare utility highs third you brought up the point and i quote tds and rsds can still be quite effective  bringing the engagement range of even close range battleships below where they can be effectively used which is not actually true unless youre using bonused rsds and multiples at that at least 3 for every enemy target tds i honestly cant answer to as again i havent been affected by 1 let alone 3 in quite some timefourth im more concerned about nonbonused ships and neut resistance rather than outright immunity if batteries granted cap that couldnt be neuted i wouldnt be opposed to a balance pass on neut ships to see if something gets broken i just want there to be some reason for people to consider something other than stuffing neuts into every spare high slot and flying around in passive buffer tanks because anything else will get neuted to death it gets tiring when every fight consists of mostly drakes and broadswords ive even seen some buffer fit ravenspost those fits for me so we can put them to test if you please if they work under infinite neuts ill stop arguing the point since i would agree that a change which allowed that would be excessive
supportedi am especially interested in the csm mails where vuk goes completely mental when the other csms and ccp takes about nerfingremoving jump bridges should make for a very interesting drama bomb
i am declaring my candidacy for csm in 2011 under the campaign messagethere have been too many content expansions it is time ccp spend the time to tweak the current mechanics to balance the game and fix antiquated concepts while the new content expansions are always fun and exciting when they are released there are more important things that need to be done it is time to fix the mechanics that ruin the reputation of eve we need to stand to insure the current systems in eve get fixed and there repair is a priority i will be the player that makes eve strongercurrently my biggest concerns are to neutral remote reps bounty hunting and corp taxesi will be available for conversation on my ideas as often as possible i plan to make sure my ideas are completely developed and approved by my supporters in order to make sure that eve becomes a better more functional gamefinally even if i am an alternate i will not resign for any reason especially to make a pointi plan on spending time on this forum but most of my content will be viewable with commentary on my campaign blog dycoevecommanalapan daily lottoin hopes of encouraging my supporters to let me know of their support and get feedback on my ideas players that announce their support or provide constructive thoughts and feedback on my ideas in this thread or on my blog will be placed into a pool every day there will be a drawing and the winner will receive a random prize these prizes will be worth a minimum of 50m iskfirst drawing will be at 3511 0200 eve time this will go on until the announcement of the csm winnersfor a list of those in the drawing and the list of winners go to the eve post or my campaign blog
would you not consider resigning if you could use it as a medium that could ultimately benefit the community or the game if there was someone qualified to take your seat or alternate position even if you had to give up your free trips to icelandgoodluck and great choice of design for your website it looks greatyoursserious
i am not denying that resigning could be used as a medium to benefit the community my thoughts on that action is that i would be ultimately disappointing the community by surrendering my position to someone they felt was less qualified less votes my goal is represent the community interest and i feel that could always be best achieved by maintaining any position within csm even alternates
what is this no mention of your previous scamming why the heck would anyone vote for someone who was quite proud of their ability to scam people out of iskgranted you did not force anyone to deposit isk with eve bank but come onyou think we would not rememberhmm
nope i take no attempt to hide my scam i was very adamant in this on my campaign last year scamming is integral part of eve that is one of the major elements that separates it from other mmos my history in this aspect means i understand that realm of the player base and know what parts of it need to be fixed for the benefit of scammers and nonscammer alike
well said then  good luck
you do understand the difference between lobbying for votes and rigging an election right no ones attempting to tamper with the actual voting process here
lol everyone knows csm is just for show
from ccps standpoint the csm primarily exists to manage player expectations when ccp does something that is not well received by the players like failing to fix something thats been broken for a long time ccp leans on the csm to explain it to the players since the explanations come from player elected people they are more palatable to the players than something handed down from ccp directlyfrom the csms perspective the csm exists to advocate for player interests some of this has been for special interests in eve and some has been for the benefit of the game in general the recent history of the csmccp relationship suggests that some of the discussions have been heated csm advocates changes the players want andor the special interest of the csm want ccp advocates changes they want the csm to forward to the players in a favorable lightccp also resists doing anything that will not in their view provide a good return on investment of their resources this last is why things remain broken ccp believes that new content brings them more money faster than fixing the old things that are broken thats why those things remain broken the csm can and evidence suggests that they do yell about this all they want and ccp wont budge relying upon phrases like the data doesnt support your conclusionsbeing a member of the csm involves a lot of work work that is frustrating and has no return other than a trip to iceland big yip 15 minutes of fame and every once in a rare while making a positive change or prevention of a negative change to the game i really dont know why they would want the job but theyre welcome to it and im glad for whatever positive change they make or negative change they assist in preventing an example of this is the csms adamant opposition to micro transactions of the type ccp wanted to put in they apparently were able to give ccp the necessary feedback to prevent it thus they helped the players and also helped ccp by preventing them from making a mistake which would have cost them moneyi disagree with the csm at times such is the way of politics but im happier having them there than i would be without them they do function not fixing broken content should be laid at the feet of ccp not the csmbest regardswindjammer

while i still think that eve currently lacks the tools for enabling a really meaningful small gang warfare i think that lowering a lot the ehps of station services would be a good start but highening the resistances while keeping the ehps constant could discourage combat the defender would pay less from not interveningi mean this must be balanced but i like itmoreover we could be able to fire on ihub upgrades and disable them and it should not be possible to place jbs and cyno beacons near poses at least not deathstarsbut the core of the problem is anotherin my opinion meaningful small gang warfare can only be done by small independent political entities the good reason for setting up a small gang is to have fun but if you have a real objective youd better set up a proper fleetblob the only situation where you dont make a blob is where you cant because your side has just too few pilotsthese measures would make possible for small gangs to create some damage but small entities would lack the tools to survive anyway and surviving does not mean winning over bigger forces if ccp creates a logisticalproduction tool that allows small entities to survive in 00 they would encourage small gang warfare in 2 ways1 first of all populating 00 with small entities that actually live on small scale stuff and small scale pvp2 those logisticalproduction tools would be the natural targets for small gangsthe point of my thread is that such tools cannot be designed like poses or outposts just changing the numbers we need something radically different in how safety is achieved
pulsar system with a pulsating shield bonuses even if it was not intended this is awesome d
completely agree with op1
bump
increasing falloff of hybrids and reducing damage especially on blasters will bring them back into the game peeps still use blasters though zyes i support a change for reasonable balance
hehe lets compare railguns and missilesi have 28 million in gunnery i still can barely make my medium guns hit a cruiser they cant hit a frigate or break the tank of a battleship i have 500k in missiles and i can hit everything from drones to battleships and take them out with medium guns fix rails i love flying my eagle  but now i bought a cerebus because of the railgun fail
so you are asking for more dps but a dps increase is not a good solution the analysis has been done you add nothing to the discussion but only whine about blobs the fact that 50 of the characters in the game cant properly use one of the dedicated weapon systems for their race doesnt help create 11 fights if blasters and railguns arent fixed why should people use them and the ships that they are fitted on their only option left for them is to fight in blobs if i wanted to fit autocannons id fly minmatar if you dont like gallente or caldari biomass your char and start again as minmatar you seem to think they fit your playstyle
ok then then there should be a way to destroy everything a highsec player owns in a station you declare war on npc corporation and siege it the station doesnt get completely destroyed since its not player built but everything player owned in it gets blown up including pods clones etcsince its a sandbox theres no reason why only players in nullsec should play in quicksand
you can destroy assets in high sec  when player moves them in a haulerfreighter you can destroy player clones  every time you pod people their clone is gonebut can you name 1 scenario in which it would be possible to destroy a station there is none and there should be
hmmm this could be the fix to the isk flow problem ccp feels there is right now add an isk sink like and burn them all to the groundi like it
admittedly ones that looked most station crowded on map  do the others as well it is still a barren wasteland for the most partstations are dumped into regions prior to or immediately following an invasion to provide security exception being providence which was developed for developments sake by cva  friendsif ships have nanobots all over to facilitate repairs one can only imagine that stations have even more extensive systems for the same purposechange the station mechanics in regards to whats allowed and how the capture mechanics function to introduce vulnerabilities rather than the uninspired shoot until wreck remove ability to use rr within docking range solves undock carriers and highsec lameness in one swoop remove ability to anchor anything within docking range want to bubble use a bloody ship disable services while system is contested ie ihub reinforced
isk sink bwahahahahahahayou have absolutely no clue what you are talking about
there will be one more station in 00 very soon
t3 definitely needs to be expanded andor balanced out i recently posted a thought on how it might be done over in fibasically a let the market handle it approach to new ship designs
its interesting to note that in my 00 roaming i almost never see proteus or legion i see a lot of tengus and some lokishowever in high sec empire i do see quite a few legions and proteus and its not just the noobs that fly them anyway t3 setups are very predictable anyone with some experience knows that all that hype ccp built up about t3 being super versatile and unpredictable is false
woof woof  good
i dont care much for pringles but this idea is a good one
legionafterburner bonus is somewhat useless when you are heavily armor tanking speed penalty from plates somewhat nullify the afterburner bonus so speed bonus is pretty much  0 its useful for missioning but everything else meh this is probably same for proteus its probably intended but well blehcloaking subsystem for legion is very weak it is offensive subsystem so if you dont get any kind of damage bonus for anything youre better off flying anathema damage output from cloak legion is ridiculous especially when you cant kill even tackling npc elite frigatesewar subsystem for legion is nice but unlike similar setups with proteus or loki it has no range at all and neutnos takes hi slots so your damage output is pretty much doomed unlike in ewar proteus for example which can still have full offensive capabilities meh
bump 1 also get t3 frigs bcs and bss in i want to play with my scifi lego

very yes
im sure this has been proposed at a previous time  very rarely does a truly original idea germinate  but i would love to see an option to show only those people in a system in local chat with a particular standing towards you your corp or your alliance after applying the filter only those people would be visible in the local list though of course the messages of others would continue to be broadcastwhat a happy place new eden could then become
yes i agree you do realize however that this thread is bound to devolve into a remove local because piracy isnt easy enough thread right
but of course i dont really want it to though
that is an excellent idea whod want to buy advertising space in derelik anyway
this will need a lot of tweaking but its an excellent idea thumb applied
like it
sure why not  
it would be wonderful
this has been brought up before and in the thousand paper cut thread i like it though

nonot exactlylol nonopemostlystation games rocknot with the other changesso it doesnt need a nerf or a buffintelligence is traditionally the most difficult part of strategy for a reason
exactlyalthough you messed up the last one and tried to place a reason instead of mere opinion
i have found myself being stuck on the courier business when ever i want to haul some cargo from a to b there are alot of contracts for courier that pay sometimes only a mere 1000 isk but with a collateral of 16 billion isnt there a rule or a possibility to make it a rule that the payment should be about 10 of the collateral  sometimes it exceeds over 160 and taken that its not just 8 jumps away its more often not worth itcan this be changed rhapsodaeps as a fairly new player any feedback for discussion is welcome
gizznitt malikite theres a reason low sec is littered with offlined towers it is simply not costeffective to kill themthe cost of a tower is much less than the opportunity cost for 10 cap pilots organizing and bashing posesif it was possible for a single battleship to kill offlined pos within 2030 minutes then youd see much cleaned up space then people would actually hunt down all offlined poses as it is now just not worth it
clearly one of those ed game mechanics we have out there
which speaks for reducing offline ehp as a way to prevent this kind of escapism for the risk averseany behavioural scientist or mother will tell you that prohibition is probably the worst method if you want to effect a change in behaviourusing obstacles or carrots are not only more reliable but give a lot more control over the direction of the changereduce offline ehpsubtract capacitor  the closer you land to structurecyno delayjump spoolup on lowsec jumpsetcthere are loads of ways to make the offlineonline trick described unattractive and nonviable without making the players feel like they just got fisted by god
if you think it needs change thumbs up
whether something is common or rare should not matter as we are comparing effectivenesswhat if every 00 system had npc station where hostile could stay afk docked would that stop all carebear operationsyou may argue that a docked person would not be the same threat cause youll have buddies docked and keeping an eye on him alerting you when he undocks if thats the case the same buddies could be sitting next to you in space in ecm or sensor damp ships protecting you when afk cloaker suddenly decloaks same thingthere is recourse  the afk cloaker has to enter the system using stargates and probably more than 1 stargate so you can kill him before he gets to his destination that is much easier than actually killing a pos especially when major power blocks are involvedanyway i have faith that in the end ccp will come around and nerf local i believe that is much more likely to happen in next 2 years than any cloak changes ccp will do it if they want to keep the game fresh and hardcore theyll do it if they know whats good for them
returning to the keyboard is insufficient to be considered a threat unless they changed things and you can scrampewpewcyno whilst cloaked now once they uncloak they do represent a legitimate threat and you do have an avenue for recoursecloaks are aok from my perspective
remove local so you can whine and cry at empty space since you cant actually tell if theres someone afk out there or notepic flow chart you win the internet
nerf blackopsbest suggestion evermg
it seems appropriate
first
as it stands this tab gives very little information in fact all it gives is the number of installations present im proposing that each planet listed have a dropdown box that gives useful information without having to view the planet in planet modefor example it would be nice if i didnt have to switch to planetary view to see how much of the launcher cargo space is used and by what silos too i guess but who uses them  see the program time remaining for the extractorsi would also like to see how much customs space is used

theres definetly enough bridging in low sec already even titan bridges are too much srsi think divorcing jump bridges totally from poss is cool idea though ive been talking about similar kind of ideas for some time now like jump bridge and cyno beacon would take so much cpugrid from pos that you could only have only few guns there at best no warp scramblerneutwebother ewar battery which are major reason why people cannot raid jump bridges and are using super capitals instead
you can have one races subcaps completely maxed out and your clone is still cheaper than a fully fit frigatealso what stops you from skilling up multiple characters on the same account for different races instead of crosstraining everything on one characteryou know for the sake of variety it also saves you money on clones seriously make clone contracts like insurance contracts have them expire after 6 weeks
i would not like to be inconvenienced in this way and no my clone already costs 2 mil that more than a frigatesi am not crosstrained and i cant even fly half gallente t2 ships theirfore your point is invalid
how about 2 jumps every 48 hours itd let you hop into and out of a clone briefly but youd still be stuck with one24 hours ammortized
after fittings im sure your frigates cost more than 2mill unless they are all t1 fit a highend t1 frigate can easily run you like 78mill fully fit let alone a t2 frigateand how often do you lose clones anyways in highsec or lowsec thats maybe once a year at most even my cheap nullsec clones have a couple of hardwirings that are about 40mill in totalin the end it is just that you want a character with good skills then the clone costs more just the same as if you want the 5 hardwirings instead of the 3 ones
if your want your clone not to cost to much  stop training
make a proposal and ill support it 
i agree with either reducing medical cost or removing medical clone upgrade totally it just takes out fun in game if you lose tens of millions medical cost not counting implants here gents just because you wanted to fly a 1 million isk rifter for a change i think there is enough cost if you lose implants in case you used something which gives you real advantage like pirate implantsjump clones i cannot agree magical moving around is too easy if we need something its ability to change implant set on clone srs
the invul wont stack with the hardener that way though
so essentially for the sake of nerfing the drake you want to kill buffer tanks no stacking of armour platesshield exenders kill resist set ups no stacking of hardeners  kill gank set up no stacking of damage and tracking buffing modules kill sniper set up no stacking of range and sensor enhancing modules  kill speed set up no stacking of speedagility modsat the same time you want to allow staking of of webs warp disruptors ecm target dampers tracking disruptors ecc from the same ship because anything offensive doesnt really count as theyre more like midmounted weapons suggest to use drones as a counter whait my omidirectional tracking links and c will stack they are like midmounted weapons too fit more launchers as there was plenty of people undrgunning theyr ships  suggest to adapt after nerfing the tools to adaptyour hate for drakes is very strong if it cloud your judgement so much
op needs to show us where the drake of supercarrier touched himjust for fun i took a battlecruiser in eft and tried following the ops rules its next to impossible to fit one how i want it it resembles a noob fit tbh
so just stat effecting modules like every module in the game other than weapons and reppers so for industrials we could only fit 1 cargo expanderthis is a bad and not so thought out idea also it would make killing sansha incursions take more than the beneficial fleet size therefor removing the point of doing the incursion
i think stacking is a good thing allowing for more diverse setups and choicedo you put on a different mod or take a stacking penalty to gain more of the same bonus you already have
i like this idea but the bonuses should be changed a little and applied as gang link bonuses so you can only get 3 scs providing these bonuses per fleetalso wyvern and aeon should give shield with capacitor or armor with capacitor and the nyx and hel should give bonuses that would fit their race
this does nothing to fix the real problem with scs witch is that they can 10k dps wile mobile this allows a handful of people to tear apart pos defenses in less then 5 mins and destroy blockade units in less then 60 secs theyve gone from useless to wtfpwnmobiles
there is nothing wrong super carriers they do what they were meant to do which is to be superior fire support dreads are simply cheaper and weaker alternatives for those who dont have the isk or the power to use em nerfing super carriers will destroy what made them super in the first placethe game needs more dps and less tank the only thing i would support is if the hp of all ships would reduced by 25 and dps output increased by 25 making killing easier and surviving harder will be a more hardcore element of the game
supper carrier at least you didnt call them soup carriers where is the combined arms part of the solution all i see is capitals capitals and more capitals no inherent vulnerabilities and scs becoming even better and more spamable than todayyou need to make them weak against not only dreadnaughts but to subcapitals do that and you force them to lug around support fleets ie combined armsnot supported scs do not need even more power and reason to exist
lol supper carriers thought those were waiters and waitresses damn you spell checkeryeah the bonuses listed are for discussion only i actually copied them from the super carriers old secondary bonuses this is why they may not have the bonuses that you mentioned and they are intended to transfer their bonuses like command ships i may have been unclear about that col callahan and hirana yoshida this was only intended to be a partial fix i do not want super carriers to be nerfed back to pos ornaments i want people to want to field them in fleets as well as solo removing all of their remote repair and energy transfer bonuses and turning them into fleet bonuses passed to capital ships below them was intended to make them dependent on other capital shipsthey now have a significantly weakened ability to form remote repair gangs with other super carriers they also give significant buffs to carriers and dreadnoughts below them which should make people want to field them with these ships i should have been more clear in my opening statement but i was concerned only with the combined arms aspects of capital and super capital ships i was not attempting to bring subcapital ships up with these changes others have discussed this already i referred to some of these proposals in the beginning some of them include reducing super carrier ehp reducing super carriers ability to carry wave after wave of small drones reducing super carrier fighterfighter bomber bay size to force them to carry enough of them to fulfill a single role ie anticapital or anti subcap adding some sort of timer to super carriers when switching from fighter types fighters and fighter bombers making them more vulnerable to ecmi do not necessarily support all of these if changes are to come i think it would be better to see a refining of the super carrier role and a drawing together of the other capitals rather than brute force hacking at ehp and damage thanks for the replies
i support it only under the condition that some of the stations that are currently close to the lava planets are actually getting moved further away from themsome of the stations are so close to lava planets that i doubt anyone would want to live near a glowing hot and heat radiating ball of molten rock
switching jumpclones locally in system and without limits sounds fine to me it would after a fashion accomplish the same i want to be able to pvp every once in a while and go back to my regular training afterwards only difference being that in your idea id have to first fly to my pvp destination but i dont see that as prohibitive per semy point precisely  people especially the newer ones are not going to pvp in a very expensive impant set no matter how hard ccp tries to force pvp on them i feel in this regard really something has to give as in ccp laxing up a bit on jumping your clones if someone were to have an actual poll as to why people wont pvp i bet youd be surprised how many folks consider their implants the nr 1 inhibiting factor i certainly do losing a few reasonably fitted ships is something i can afford losing 1bil in implants to boot per incident is something few new follks can really keep up for longand like you said alllowing multiple jumps a day locally would boost the implant mechanics of the game you can go mine in your miner clone go rat in your ratting clone etcpersonally i dont really mind people jumping across the galaxy multiple times a day when the amount is strictly limited to once forth  once back a day as per my proposal linking the cost it to the medical clone is handy as it were because its isk value is directly proportional to ones skillpointsyet perhaps it is really best if someone were to make a simple nonconvoluted proposal which just states that jumping clones locally is to be allowed an unlimited amount of times per day because frankly i cant for the life of me imagine what horrible gamebreaking consequences that might bring
what we need is less magical clone jumping around implants are totally another story
id say the two are kinda related 
problem is not gate camps theres very little to camp at first place pi is pretty much riskless pi products are generally not that expensive that it makes any sense to try ganking a pi hauler and even if they were its pretty difficult to predict when someones gonna pick up their  missions can be done in unprobeable ships and even if you didnt have one you can just keep watching out for probes and align or just join some naptrain corpit is just that with same effort its easier to join 00 naptrains and make many times more moneyimho they key here is that low sec is not treated as unique sandbox like it should low sec is where you go when you dont give a crap about 00 fleet fights and stuff and just want to do your own stuff in small groups or solo were it piracy mining or industry this is counting out fw whoring
give it a unique identity or dont bother more of the same makes for  poor gameplay and is the root cause for lowsec being as lifeless as it is

greetings everyone it has come to my attention and many others that faction control towers no longer seem to be dropping as loot in the game and as a result the prices for these towers has skyrocketed i am hoping that the current csm or soon to be csm can look into this and ask ccp what happened and if this is intended as far as anyone can tell there is no note in the patch saying their supposed to be dissapearing and as such many of us are hoping this is a bug
i agree some information regarding what has happened to the drop rate would be nice if csm or ccp can give us some information regarding what happened it would be greatly appreciated

this is a player initiative in a venue favored by the players who set it up it has absolutely zero to do with ccp they are not involved in the csm6 facebook page whatsoever nor is there the intention of trying to force anyone there who does not care for the venue if you dont like what is offered as a result of volunteer initiative then take your own initiative to go make a csm6 site page or whatever in a venue that suits you when youre done come back here to tell people about it

my proposal is to be able to put for a claim for salvage to concord against a pos that has been achored in space and left for a length of time off line my proposal for this is simplesalvage rights disputed assets must have beenin its place unpoweredmust wait for 30 days before concord declares it as yoursafter it is declared yours to have one of the following to occura concord gives a temporary increase to standing to put the tower online and to unachor the pos structures only b civilian data core with temporary permissions to put it online to unanchor only c the entire pos is contracted to you in space by concord when you accept the contract concord then unanchors the entire pos for you to scoop up in a hauler disclaimer when you put the salvage claim in you have to wait 30 days before you find out if your claim went through during that time a notification is sent to the corp about the salvage claim the corp can then put the pos online or to take it down to nullify the claim if and when the salvage claim goes through you have 5 days to get the disputed assets removed from space during that time the owner can still put the disputed assets back online provided that heshe is the first one there
on the plus side this would remove the millions of old poses that are no longer in use as many corps have vanished or ceased to care about an old posill leave it to someone else to come up with a negative or two support reserved until then
sound like a good idea
very good idea it will help newere corps with growing and expanding and as mention recycle the old poses that isnt in use anymore
ill support anything that makes mining less boringalso rorq bonuses the tractor bonus fex is useless 999 of the time because they are never in a belt
well sure do it but i cant see how a scrambling frigate will be a problem a retiever with a bunch of hobgoblins can kill it get scrabling crusiersbattlecruisers then thats gonnabe interesting
the  of shield depend on your modules and skills when you board a ship from a pos the shield value is what you would have without modules and skills
way around this use the fitting tool of the pos to deactivate and reactivate all the shield buffersfull shields or close too it there will still be the gap of your skill level which will still exist when you undock from a station or get a boost from a fleet member who just warped into the system
i know this but it doesnt change the fact that it is not balanced
ummm deactivating and then reactivating your shield buffers will not change anything your shields will just jump up to full with them off then jump back to almost empty when you bring them back onlinethe bottom line is i undock from a npc station my shields are at full i undock from a player owned station and my shields are almost empty or another example my friend jumps into his phobos and his tank is at 100 i jump into my onyx and my tank is at 21 yet if we were to do this at a station both out tanks would be at 100the easiest fix would be for a ship that goes into a hangar at 60 shields it comes out at 60 shields if it goes in at 100 it comes out at 100 ccp needs to either fix this problem or be consistent and make all ships that undock from everything start off with no tank that will probably get some attention
next time im at my pos ill test this adding extenders to see the effects you might be right in which case ill support the issue
id like to see something done about this i like the solution as mentioned of having shields come out at whatever  they went in at even though it supports all those dirty shield tankers
ok i tested this and you are indeed correct so i fully support this

as long as it is hisec only that would be an ideaif its lowsec and nullsec as well youd need to put those local channels in delayed mode or you make it too easy to spot hostiles as if it isnt trivial already
yes globallyand even in wh space
the point is though it would have the greatest effect in high sec space and be of very limited use elsewhere  though of course i would support its introduction across all of new eden as population densities in high are generally far higher than low or null spotting wts can be a right pain in the bumble if youre in a particularly busy hub tried looking for a target in jita when there are 1800 people in system not fun lol

cloaking  scanning is broken to four turret slots each gun does 36 dps without dmg mods and with close ranged ammo what the  is this thing designed to kill immobile capsules if i want the damage to go up i have to sacrifice 15th of my tank with every heat sink cause it has like no low slots ffs what the hell were you thinking
even after two heat sinks and all level 5 skills 213 dps wow thats respectable i mean it totally makes up for having no drone bay and a 546 layout
the problem is the covert suball the other t3 get some sort of dps bonus whether its straight damage or rof legion gets a cap usage bonus and thats iti completely agree it needs something more
plus its a great way to boost mining without increasing yield
damni like this great proposition
dont suspend or ban bot accoounts delete them then ban by ip address
look man the problem is pretty simple and you all are pretty dumb if you agree with the first post 90 of the people in this channel are too stupid to use botting so they  that they have to make money the old fashioned way ccp allows bots and as such you should learn to move with the times
supported going further it should really be a nobrainer for ccp to introduce an automatic report botter petition much the same way they introduced a report isk spammer petition that is accessible from the rightclick menu anyone reported as a botter enough times should automatically be flagged for review by ccp staff and perchance added to a public list of suspected botters

we all hate big alliances with the exception of the drones in the big alliances and want to see some more spontaneous small combat in 00 my proposal is to change the aspects of moonmining the reason for this is that most big alliances use the numbers to take high value moons away from much smaller alliances my proposal is simple make moon miners either be outside of the pos or be independent of a pos altogether in the latter case they would be solo anchored objects with an ehp buff as well as storage for a week or two in a way to make this more fair for the moon miner would be to allow one moon miner to harvest all objects on the moon instead of just onethe reason for this would be to provide a target for small alliances to harass the larger alliances guerilla warfare must be implemented i dont care how much of a bother it is to the small alliance i feel that an insurgency must be a viable game mechanic against the large alliance stars
i support lower ehp1 bs in 2030 min sounds good
this cloaking is finewhat you can do how fast you can do it and how effective it is when you decloak is the issue
sorry but i disagree with thisif youre in a system with low enough security status to be in danger its up to you to protect yourself from that danger low sec and in particular 00 is supposed to be a dangerous place not a industrial haven 00 in my eyes should always be rewarding but extremely dangerous empire should be safe but less rewarding unpredictability of hotdrops make the game more interesting and also give some small advantage to the smaller alliances or corporations hit and run tactics which are dwindling with every patch released
cloaking is fine i frankly do not understand how a single cloaker active or not can cause this kind of havoc we have cloakers in our ratting systems nonstop that does not stop us from ratting no disrespect meant but if you cannot learn to cope with such a simple threat then perhaps you are not ready for nullsec lifesomething that does need an overlook however are hotdrop mechanics

why not
yes
i support this it is simple and useful addition to the ui i will be confirming my support for this on my campaign blog
yea  pretty weird
the whole lp store interface gotta be reworked completely
so i was thinking it would be sweet if for every kill that you were a part of in a specific ship you would receive a hash mark on the side of the ship hash marks would stick with the specific ship to show how long that ship has survived in pvp battles obviously they go away when the ship is destroyed or if the ship changes hands maybe it would be cool if for every hash mark the value of your ship goes up similar to a bounty say 100k for each hash mark and if you had 10 total the person who killed you gets a million isk anywayrough idea but it sounds really cool to me discuss
so i could kill 100 newb ships on an alt and then let the alt kill my ship for a net gain of 10 million isk sweet deal totally support
ok so maybe that part wasnt a good ideaits the hash mark idea that is important here
if you think waiting for the docking manager to let you undockexploderedockchangeship 2 minutes at least is worth 100k then you need to find a better source of income
this actually is a cool ideai just dont see how other people could see such hash marks given eve graphics setup all the ships are rendered small and even if you set look at itd still be too small to see hash marks most ship textures dont have room for such markings eitherit would have to be some kind of show info thing
your proposal is to move fw to special high sec systems and restrict it to only those systems that itself flies in the face of the spirit of fw the problems with fw currently are bugs in the standing system and a poorly implemented missionplexing systemfirst of all the standings bugs currently if you remote rep a war target shooting your fleet you dont get a standing penalty but if you remote rep an outlaw member of your own militia aside from getting gcc you also take a standing hit with your faction its a known bug and if you petition it youll get the standing loss back but its silly having to do this every weekend for all logisticsrr bscarrier pilots im sure the gms dont appreciate it either poor gm libra luna he needs a vacation from me alone thanks to those petitionsthe plexing system is flawed because you get absolutely nothing for doing them there is no incentive to run them beyond looking for a fight and plex fights are getting increasingly rare instead all the rewards for fw are piled into special lvl4 missions and as with any mission the best way to approach it is to evade pvp if at all possible and so the missioners do thus fw zones are filled with soloduo stealth bombers sniping their mission objectives from 100km away and bailing if a wt even enters system never mind actually attacking themone solution to the plexmission problem is to remove the missions entirely and instead put the fw lp into the plexs the plexs themselves need to be altered currently all you have to do is sit on a button and wait out the timer its basically capture the flag thats fine of course but the npcs are pretty stupid so they need to add the requirement of killing all npcs present instead of just running down the timer i would place a reward on the sites that is awarded to the most significant gang this is an idea from incursions however the optimal gang size should be set between 1 and 10 depending on the site none of the sites should be set largerflipping systems also needs to do something other than changing the name of who has occupancy maybe free repairs in friendly controlled systems finally the npcs in the plexs need to be balanced out minmatar npcs tp frigates to the size of bss and pummel them with 120km ranged torpedos amarr npcs cant hit a stationary carrier from 5km away but they will td the hell out of it gallente are just as bad as amarr and caldari i honestly dont know aboutin any case i stand by my previous point of learn the current mechanics before proposing new ones your proposal would likely remove 99 of current active militia pilots from the militia
fw isnt terrible lacking it might be especially when it comes to the whole plexing system as rothgar explained but certainly not terrible some of us like fw simply because its a massive unrestricted war dec with little structure andor organization we dont care to win we just want to kill things
that is all ive readnot supported
first off op has no idea what he is talking aboutas king said the main to problems w fw is the lack of motivation for conquering systems due to the crappy mechanics involved ie dumb npcs and no rewards and fw missions are equally as badking you should flesh out some of your points in a new proposal maybe if we beat the fw dead horse a bit more ccp could give us some love i mean it wouldnt take but 1 dev a week or so to implement changes that would make fw low sec too much better

hi i didnt see a thread about this but i think its a problemi dont think im the only person with this problem but every time i log into a station or load grid after jumping into a system i get lag because of all the character portraits that are now forceloaded this causes people to constantly disconnect in market hubs because of the sheer number of portraits that need to unnecessary load nowand on top of that lag problem a lot of people even in hisec use it to see who is a new person in local so having all the portraits loaded already means that you cant tell who is newplease revert character portrait loading back to notforced or provide that option because all it does is cause lag and makes local watching a pain not strictly for nullsecthanks
cross poasting my thoughts on bridges from shcjust poasting to voice my support in nerfing jump bridges in the ass main reason beingthey have taken the depth out of 00 instead of nullsec being the dangerous and logistically challenging far reaches of space its a goldmine for sov holders and death trap for any visitors bridges are rather absurd when you can hop into ec in pure blind and travel to branch or tenal with maybe 34 conventional jumps something that otherwise would be a dangerous 3040 jump trektakes the challenge out defending space on a day to day basis if anyones familiar with the nc jump bridge map it is an utter cluster every third system seems to have a jump bridge it means you can have an entire constellation of people descending on your position to blob you out in a minute or two null sec is meant to be dangerous instead its now get sov  entirely safe unless you get full scale invaded there has to be an effort in upkeep to match the huge wealth and benefits of holding the space currently the upkeep is largely in isktime etc pilots should be required to fight to use their space to its fullest as it stands the vast majority of any alliance membership can essentially opt out of pvp while a tiny part of their number can bridge across multiple regions in whatever ships are needed to destroy any threatright now sov holders can sit in bubbled dead ends bearing at 50100mil isk an hr and at the site of a roaming gang reship to 50 drakes and bridge ahead of the bad guys to killforce them out things are way too heavily weighted in favour of the defenders ill cite deklein in particular as an example in deklein core there is a jump bridge at every major chokepoint and all one corp does sup jsr1 is follow intel and bridge around to chokepoints with an instalock gang of 510 with bubblesashimmulach etc and instakill any soloer or small gang for the attacker there is a huge risk to being out and roaming but for the defender they can move around huge distances in total safety and press f1  recieve killmail stay safewhat id like to see reduce bridges to 1 per constellation maximum make bridges alliance use onlychanges such as these would but the effort back into everday space holding people would have to be prepared to fight to enjoy the benefits of sov space its ing nullsec thats how it should be and large scale logistics would require a coordinated effort from a fleet having read the above suggestions divorcing them from poss could be very cool as well it only makes sense that there be some risk associated with the speed and range of movement that bridges provide
this is a good summary of the types of ideas im trying to get passed
my avast shows an issue with that web address false positive
jump clone timer  should be based on distance or empire vs nullsec ive had multiple times where ive wanted to hop up to empiredown to nullsec base to grab skillbooks and the like and had to wait a whole day to move again its a day of my time wasted because im in the wrong place to do what i want to domed clone cost  still needs to have some cost but paying over 1m each time you get podded is dumb a lot of older players arent poor but when you come back from an unsub after giving stuff away including your isk getting a new clone can be a major problem
trolling comment removed
actually the hic is very useful in empire space hi and low in some cases it is too usefulfor starters with damps the way they are you are completely destroying the raison detre for training gallente recons outside of a few circumstances where having a cov ops cloak on them is goodsecondly you are adding functionality to a whole class of ship that is essentially the sole preserve of one race and improving upon it so unless the other chap wants to shell out on a faction scram and a gang booster hes going to be outclassednow long range scrams on gallente ewar ships are pretty powerful tools they are mitigated by the fact that these vessels are relatively weak in terms of ehp and deeps and have terrible cap and fitting hics tank like a brute and can still be capable of putting out deeps equivilant to or in some cases greater than a gallente recon and yes they should probably be looked at at some point in time sooner rather than later i hope
oh man that collection of people totally want to get elected so they can advocate policies they favorhow nefarious
ill make an inquiry about this
you spend a lot of time talking about balancing and improving plexing but the underlying fact is that plexing doesnt matter in my experience most players dont do it at all and why should they unless plexing means something its not worth either doing or fixing
well i dont know any other game mechanic that makes t1 friggsdessys and t1 cruiser usefullnow days not many ppl plex becuse its a broken game mechanicglitches flipping a system can be retaken inn less than a day it have no real rewardsbut in my experiance before gliches and bugs where known and ppl thought ccp would give rewardas they did talk about at the timelots of ppl plexed there where bunker fights also u got very good fights in plexesi belive if it where looked on and fixes reward given etcit would grow again
hey evocationzxanthia sarn i bet with your charm and genteel ways you could get a lot of votes and represent high sec carebears quite nicely you certainly seem to be pro at this game lets face it no one gets voted in because of their experience of the game and anyone living in 00 couldnt possibly know anything about high sec right
i think you might have the cause and effect mixed upthe people who play in 00 are more metagame oriented and understand that the game extends beyond the boundaries of the screen and keyboard the are politically driven with power blocs organizations and yes the occasional epic failures in 00 reputations and names become important in hisec    not so much oh there are a few known folks but heroes villains hisec inhabitants keep more to themselves mining or missioning in small groups as a result there probably is a lot more of the vote sourced from null than high and that results in them electing the people they knowthat is the why of it it would be lovely if the hisec players actually read campaign platforms and voted but i would be very willing to be that not many of them even come to the forums this right here is meta game and in the same basket as the election itself if the only people who care enough to read listen or vote are the politically active 00 folk then that is how it isyeah i am runningyeah i would love more hisec players to get involved might even send some votes my wayno i am not whining or complaining just answering your questionm
ok i know ccp upgraded their node for jita so that the old pilot cap of 700ish would be a lot more enjoyable 1 to you ccpbut then you make the player cap 1600 with the new upgrades and it lags pretty much just as bad as before why not make the pilot cap 1200 for jitaif i missed something about this please let me knowflame on
why not give out 1 weeks bans on scammersthat would clear up jita pretty fast and no need for a upgradein real life if u scam someone you will be penalisedwhy not eve
because scammers are not breaking any rules
well eve rules no but in most other sosiaties selling a objekt under a better or something is ageins the lawbut if they changed that in eve  jita lag solved and real traders would could actually link their goodsno point now in jita local cuz most ppl ignore it
following suite with your example of real world and eve in the real world those who cannot put together sentence in an orderly fashion where through grammar or correct spelling is not seen as someone to take seriouslyso ccp i give you this test jita with a 1000 or 1200 pilot cap for a couple days see how it goes just a thought
this bump is much like my other bump its not the same bump but it is still my own
no x7 accounts
a very huge no
nevereverytime someone clicks that support button a kitten dies
no
no  or in the worst case  cosmetic only  though that would be a really good isk sink  and there is no need for us to pay for clothes with real money  when for the ships we pay with isk 
i am against microtransactions my primary thought of this is how it has effectively destroyed other games i used to play team fortress 2 comes to mind now things i would like to see along this note though would be changing the transfer character change character portrait and other elements that already exist for purchase to be able to spend plex to get it the process done in addition to the current straight payment
yesh
morning bump
bigger is better 
the  we stay in is even deeper new bot revelationsit seems all these assembly hall threads dont get any recognition from ccp
ok so now i got you reading the topic i am a char of over 70mil sp i really have no need for newbie ships apart from events but each time i pod around which sometimes you do i get a free one in each station i dock ati have a lot of newbie ships i need need so i just trash them all surely all this trashing of newbie ships is a big waste of database keys for each object so what i propose is quite simple in the menu for there to be a buttontick boxoption to allow a player the choice of wether they want a newbie ship or not when they dock when it is unticked player gets none ever ofc the box will be ticked automaticly from any new client intall or player but as time wares on ooo god wasted 4 years of my life players will find out be told about this option and untick it and if you need a noob ship just tick it again and redockso is it just me that gets annoyed with about 10 stations on my assets windown with just noob ships or do more people agree with me zamahave a free shipnew idea layad out by othersits been noted meny times just to ass a button to the station menu or another menu that lets you request a new ship which gives you a noob ship ofc to stop people then spaming loads of noob ships would need to make it so thay dont get one if thye already have a shipi like the idea more so than my own loland to stop people from keep on recomending it i add it to my proposal so you will stop posting about it lol 
you usually never need one for just traveling it warps with 3 aus just like your pod but takes time to align and has a larger sig also is monitored by faction police etc there are more maneuverable and faster things to move in for transporting small but valuable items bet even the newbies have something properly fit to use so yeah its not like we need them every time we dock in a pod
i support this ideathe only issue with it though is the current process where if you get podded you appear in your clone station and say it has no ships you are currently unable to undock and need that rookie ship or some ships available for purchase in station this is the only currently existing mechanic that creates a problemi support this completely and will be adding it to my campaign
seems that to succeed in eve you have to cheat thats not what i had in mind when i subscribed to the game
make it possible to use nanite paste to repair drones and you can avoid all the added work of making new stuffbenefits all drone carriers and balances itself by making drones unavailable for launch while being treated
i would say just add it this way utilize nanite paste and make it not unique to motherships and carriers but obviously have timer specifics benefited in the direction of motherships based on drone bay size so it takes much longer relatively to repair a 50 damaged warrior in an imicus as compared with a dominix and and even more so compared with a mothershipthe important part on this idea though is how the numbers work out so as not to overly buff drone based ships make it take a while but be viable i will be formulating some numbers and posting them on my campaign blog later
yeah i would like this
drone based ships incl carrier classes should if anything have a faster repair rate than all others their primary damage is drone based and as long as you make the drones unavailable for the duration it is hardly a buff  gunmissile ships have been able to repair heat damage since it was introduced after all combined with the ideas to balance carrier classes to reduce regular drone count it would merely serve to bring drone users up to par with the direct damage crowd
sounds logical
alright i do think that cynos need a change here are my thoughts on the issue they are similar to the op with a few additions1 there needs to be several sized cynos 3 at leaststarting with the most exclusive the covert ops cyno would only allow the jumping of black ops ships and their covert jump portalnext is the general cyno we are all familiar with it can be fit to any ship and will allow black ops carriers dreads rorquals and jump freighters to jump to itlastly there is the supercapital cyno this must be fit to a carrier sized craft or bigger this is only what titans and motherships can jump to but any other ship down the line can jump to them as well 2 mass limits on cyno fieldseach ship starting with the black ops fleets will consume so much percentage of a certain field the black ops will have the smallest mass and it scales up to the supercapital cyno which will have the most mass every time a ship jumps through the field diminishes similar to the function of wormholes3 spoolup time on jumpdrivesthis will make the deploying of a cyno for hotdropping a more strategic job the distance from the capital ship the target field will factor into the equation as well as the class of ship the farther away the longer the spool time the bigger the ship the longer the spool time this can be capped at a certain interval possibly for a titan at max distance with no skills could take up to 3 minutes

hey csmi am sitting at a train right now and checking my email at my mobile phone and it got me thinking what about an evegate smartphone appam i the only one who feels an urge to an app like this ofc if this sounds redicilus then tell me best regards sing jai
im for this ive got a droid x and for whatever reason when i try to log into evegate via the browser it never lets me get past the enter a character on this account security screen
yes for making it compatible with mobile browsers which should be no problem if they just follow standardsno for making an app to effectively view a website which is what a browser is already for for wm60 wm70 android iphone symbian etc
agree with furb killerneed an app that will be formatted for the phone not a browsers i would like to see it but im not going to hold my breath go figure
are you using a custom rom the site loads just fine on my galaxy s using both the default browser and dolphinhdback on topic not supported with the amount of people now days using smart phones with builtin browsers that can handle rendering regular webpages very well it seems like a real waste of dev time to make a special mevegate
nope but i did see that they changed it to where the name checker is cap sensitive so that might be why looks like around the time i was trying to get inupdatejust checked it and it works fine on the native browser
same here and btw  in c6 pulsar you usually logs inget ship from sma at less than 10 shiled way to go for caldari ships when you are in a harry for a pvp
supported
i support more filters generally i think is a good simple addition that i will be adding to my csm campaign
great thanks can i also have my dbank money back lol
supported
true maybe only some stations would allow free form and have some sort of warning
it would be nice but i cant support this for two reasons1 lageveryone being able to create stuff would really increase the database dramatically and slow down emulation before it even gets started2 this is not secondlifethis does not really make sense with the world of eve and does not support the desired play styles
suggestion to make planetary interaction with a corporation access option so that corporations could allow or have access to players planetary interactions to maintain and transpose as needed with player approval ie check a box and while your away your corp mates can look after things for you
ill give my 1 for thisi havnt read the entire topic maybe i will later but if it hasnt already been brought upthis shotgun idea is cool infact i love it but id like to have it coupled with a very very slow refire rate like 610 seconds think about how players would have to utilize timing and judgment to get their max dps maybe not even having it on auto fire so do you wana fire now for 2540 damage or wait a few seconds to close in and wreck them for a full blast fire now while you have the shot or watch your enemy drift away againi think they as a shotgun type weapon should have no minimum distance to shoot from farther distance would only mean a better time tracking up to where the blast radius starts becoming greater then the sig radius of the ships i like this for a few reasonsa since the shotguns would always do some  of damage until they just cant track are at a certain blastsig ratio they could always atleast put alittle hurt down on frigates even battleships meaning that a hyperion would act as an oversized destroyer protecting the fleet from ships that would otherwise be too difficult to track like a close orbiting frigate while still being useful against larger ships at greater ranges even if the damage isnt a ton it would be enough to get the frig to back offb when the ship engaged a ship of the appropriate size such as meds to a cruiser larges to a battleship they could effectively hit them at feasible pvp ranges of course as they start trying to fight smaller ships theyd have to close the gap to be effective frigates for a large gun should have to basically be point blank to receive full damage and of course at which point theyd suffer tracking issues honestly if a bs caught a frigate at point blank that wasnt moving lets be honest they fail and deserve to get vaporizedc would require the player to think about positioning and timing would they wana shoot now or wait to do more damage the closer they got the better theyd hit and the cycle time would be enough to justify getting closer before you took a shotd could introduce a new blaster weapon mod a blaster choke basically the equivalent of a tracking computers range buff for blasters as the tracking computer range buff wouldnt make sense how is aiming better gana help you hit farther if your ammo is the limiting factor im sorry if yoru shot is 100 dissipated at a certain range being a better aim isnt gana change thati hope ccp takes this idea and seriously considers it its a unique idea that would give that little sparkle back to gallente weapon systemsa problem i see in this however is that alot of hulls just do not support this kind of action deimos could perhaps pull it off thorax most frigates vexor ehh brutix myrm too clunky and bss compound on that issue thats kinda how it is now which is another topic to discuss though ive got some ideas
i thought i read ccp does not consider the under usage of a moduleor by assumption sun system as a sign of a borken item from the csm minutessure ccp is well aware of the relative usage of t3 ships and mudules and how everyone use the tengue and at a distant second the lokisure they also have stats on what modules are usedtrouble is convincing them that it matters
i like itthat would be nice
no reason to keep mining any less exciting than it already is bring on the colours
this would make it look even better when killing a barge
its a double rainbow
supported and the csm being upstanding members of the community often affiliated with major alliances and aware of much that happens in eve should publicly state their opposition to pilots corps and alliances that benefit from bots
ill tell you one thing ccp can dohand out meaningful banscaught once with a bot  one month bantwice  6 month banthird time  permanent ban on all accounts the player holdsthe bans they hand out to botters now are a joke and show ccp is not serious in any way about dealing with botting
put hands on work now
this has to be one of the top two threats to long term player disaffection along with lag  we have a war on lag and we now need a war on botsi for one will be voting for csm candidates who take this issue seriouslyif ccp are not taking this point seriously enough then we have to shout louder
the best idea is certainly to remove local bots wouldnt be able to operate as easily and 00 pvp would also be improved

the words final solution were not intended to invoke images of the holocaust but were in reference to a solution to the various problems with the gallente dont hijack this thread just to show your knowledge of history
history is something scientific wed better use term modern mythology
anyway as far as ontopic discussion goes the ops proposed too much to be discussed seriouslythat kind of laundry list of game change requests can never workthe last time that was done was the great nano nerf and it was a disaster
thats like me saying that your posts is too for meto take your opinion seriously if you want to argue give me solid feedbackth wall of text is too long does not cut it
it doesnt beat probing
of course it doesnt beat probing you cant warp to 0km with it but in many ways it has benefits probing dont have or require effort to accomplishits instantits directionalit says ship type and ship name from the beginningit doesnt require any skills trainedit shows probes of your enemies so you know when someone is probing youit allows you to say what forces are there without warning enemy with your probesit allows you to probe faster by judging distance and direction of enemy shipit allows to fast finding of poses exact moon location even if there are dozens of moons on one planetyou dont need to uncloak to use dscan less chance for enemy to spot youin wspace its as important as local is in 00and many many moreso all things together you cant warp to 0km with dscan but other than that its great intel tool dont tweak with it
yes they should openly show which alliances and corps to provide shelter or actively support botsthe corps and alliances should know the ebst themselves who are bots and who notwith this we could have much more pressure onto all corps and alliances to actively go against bots they destroy their own game kill the bots 
really upset after
this would be a good and easy function to start the war against botsi mean if somebody is reported by 10 different people and clearly acts like a bot  it is a bot
i think we do need to take steps but am fair certain when i have my alt army mining it looks pretty bot like my concern is mostly abuse and at the end of the day this would just result in more stuff for the gms to work through slowing down the current petition process which would be worse than the bot issue currently
sounds like something that could be highly abused ive been called a botter by some noob that thought it was cool to bump me like a  until i came back and melted his retriever last i checked bots wernt that cool but at the same time this brings up a point that people have a very low recognition differential for detecting bots vs people who just afk mine like meim also sure the report spammer function is worthless never seen it usable but report botter would get spammed every 5 minutes by some peopleawe man look its our rival corp stealin our omber report dat  and suddenly the gms have like 30 reports on the same guys despite if theyre legit or not then there would be people who just reported every one who mined for more then half an hour in the same spot because that never happens specially not on ice belts or similarnot a bad suggestion but given our broken ass player base it wouldnt work
they need to automate the function that means the more a bot is reported the higher the character goes on the list the gms have to check i guess this is what they already do with the report isk spammer button
long ago ccp made the faction implants crystal halo etc be 3 to attributes because at the time that was what there was then we got 4s and 5s i am suggesting that both lowgrade and highgrade faction implants are a bit outdated and should be like thishigh grade implants should give 5 to attributes with all other effects staying the same low grade implants should give 3 to attributes with all other effects staying the same
supporting my own evil
when a bot is discovered concord should fine the bot pilots corp 5 of the total funds in its walletswhycorps currently benefit from bots through taxescorps can police their members and kick out those using bots  they currently have to look out for spies and scammers as it iswould concentrate bots in npc corps where they might be easier to managewould prevent bots from benefiting major alliances and therefore impacting on everyone elsebut that isnt fair my corp cant control whether a pilot uses a botcorps currently benefit from bots so it is reasonable that corps be punished for harbouring themcorps are at risk from member pilot activities currently anyways corp thefts scams and spies  i would like to see use of bots also presenting a threat to corps
oh heck yes and their names displayed for all to see
so why isnt happening anything when they have several people working on this why are whole regions full of bots why do bots that i report come back after one day ban botswhy can you read in eve bot forumsfirst page google that ccp does nothing against botsi heard nc is supporting bots to like all other alliances i dont think its only the bad russiansi guess you 00 alliances feel mighty with your big fleets financed by botsyeah and i better post with my new alt cause otherwise i will end up wardecd by 10 merc corps financed from 1 hour of botting
if this and other forums become nothing but ban bots and ban the accounts benifiting from botsthen good
if you think about it market bots cause an unnecessary load strain on the server with all their query activity
lol yeah csm better listen or he might do absolutely nothing in retaliationsorry that made me laugh as for the topici dont think bots are an impending threat of any form they function rather well in a may as well macro game like eve they sell cheap ore because they can and make everything more affordable as a consequence on noe its not like they cripple the market either mining is probably the single safest easiest profession in eve and should pay out as such however i do think that mining in lowsec poses very little reward for the risk but whatever not the topicthe only issues i have are people who do rmt which is entirely unworth it thanks to eves well i cant decide if its a good or bad thing but their decision to sell plexs for cash which return about the same isk as most rmt trades i personally enjoy padding my wallet with plex i sell i have over 2 billion isk and i didnt earn a damn penny and honnestly ive enjoyed eve alot more as a consequence since making isk is like watching paint dry very excitingon the flip side you get alot of idiots with too much isk on their hands that blow up more ships hey guess what more economy because more ships are being circulated sorry you industrial guys we know you enjoyed selling about half the ships you do nowthis could be fixed with something as simple as giving the eve regional markets their own light weight server to query off of thats if they dont already its not like they dont have the money to expand their servers
recurring themes can also be an indicator of people having nothing better to do with their timethere is a thread over in general discussion talking about who the botters actually are rather than have ccp out their own intelligence you could participate in the lynch mob 
support the idea of little guy vs the big guybut with hot drops they can and will hot drop anythingeven had a stealth bomber gang hot droped ondid they really do thatwow yup
so either it is trivial to reinforce the moon mining arrays or it takes quite some time and you added yet another structure grind that is just a poorly disguised supercap boost
part of the issue is that both sovereignty and disruption of infrastructure basically come down to dps contests which small alliances will basically lose by definition i made a pitch awhile ago on how to delink sovereignty from dps contests and infrastructure from pos barebones summary herewould that be along the lines of what you were thinking matchete
you do realize there are mechanics  methods already in game that will allow a small corp to all but cripple an alliance using gorilla warfare tacticsright
the problem with a change like that is that it doesnt discriminate between blob and nonblob there would be nothing preventing griefhotdrops on big and small alike or even roaming gangs knocking out every array in a regionyou need to add something that the blob can do that is outside the reach of the small entitygangthey could kill the pos but why bother if you just whack the mining gear
i like the idea of using scripts to make the hybrids more versatile but i have to admit that the thought of taking a 25 hit to the capacitor for each mag stab that is fitted with the script is more than a little daunting perhaps just more cap usage instead maybe around 75 to make it still useful but with a sufficient handicapi have to note however that this proposal breaks the whole idea behind scripts because it adds an attribute to a module that it never had prior to the script all other scripts merely redistribute the percentages that are applied to the bonuses they give therefore i unfortunately cannot support the topic directlyhowever since the purpose of the proposal is to give hybrids something unique why not just have the scripts go directly onto the guns themselves that would absolutely give hybrids something unique and very useful and it wouldnt be game breaking since the scripts will merely redistribute the stats of the guns for whatever purpose they need at the time
the idea is interesting but it needs to be complete as in have some basic numbers for heat sinks ballistic controls and gyros it is an unfair advantage to hybrids to have them uniquely with scripted damage buffersalso your numbers are too high that much damage bonus is a lot also increased optimal range is a job for tracking enhancers and computers not the damage boost modules i would say script to damage or rof but not both at the same time
post here if u would love the idea of jump cloning possible every 12 hours feel free to discuss about the subject
hmm well im disapointed i was hopeing for at least a no now go away
i do see that as a really small exploit so i do support this but might just have when the shield comes up to disable the cyno but keep the immobile duration i think that is a better solution than preventing it from a certain distance to the pos during this process
be prepaired for a non fail cloaker to arrive soon
my view is this the worst a single cloaker can do is be a bomber and  my ratting bs or hulk the only reason it is a threat is because of the hot dropping mechanics the cloaker himself is not much of a threat
can you send some my way as wellill be in delve system pdeu3 the more the merrier
yes that would be nice to have make it easier on some of us
signed
1  decent and balanced platform well structured presentationthe whole campaign should be highlighted on a separate page or something or at least with sticky forum topicsgood luck
how is your view on macros and bots
it would make hics hugely overpowered
will you support this tread
thank you larkonisi didnt even think about how that would antiquate the use of the gallente recons odd because my main ship is a lachesis based on that i think i will be removing it from my campaignwinternight i too have nostalgia for many of the old textures and definitely do support that
select plexsanshactrlcselect plexfwctrlvinclude the whole lp mechanics but now they dont go for concord lp shop but for racial fw lp shop and you can exchange it for a certain rate for lp from corporations belonging to that faction and ai now you can be happy oh and make it so that the amount of npcs and side they are on depends on uncloaked people in the plex in other words when gallente are fighting caldari npcs and the caldari fw comes in gallente reinforcements will come in
dont agree with some of the other points you have listed but yes occupancy needs attentionthe whole plexing thing was designed to encourage fights  which it can and does still do but sadly as you state the boost to pirate frigates has had a detrimental affect on plexing it would be better if the pie frigs were restricted from the smaller plexesalso would like to see occupancy actually mean something there have been many suggestions previously on what this could be such as giving system wide buffs to the sov holders or restricting station services from those not holding sovsadly this is post no 8723262 on please ccp fix my fw and as yet were nowhere near the top of the todo list
i definitely support this i miss a lot of the old textures and would enjoy a way to acquire them as collections and this is a nice simple way of doing that
if you look at the issues raised by csm 5 you will see that a substantial majority of them are things that are either global in nature or are aimed at improving empire and lowsecthe csm delegates who were active campaigners in the last election because they were not depending on alliance blocvotes to get in tended to be very responsive to the concerns of non00 players because they got a substantial portion of their votes from hisec in my case while i got some votes from my alliance it was the hisec vote that got me on the csmheck right now im gathering ideas for a proposal about missionrunning tweaksthe bottom line is if you have a concern you want raised you should contact some of the csms and ask for their help getting a proposal properly raised the squeaky pod gets the lube so to speak
yes
the most recent attempt by ccp to fix insurance payouts by reducing them clearly did not solve the problem return t1 insurance payouts to their predominion levels leave t2 insurance payouts as ishi sec ganking is a huge problem in game taking away insurance for concord destoryed ships is the largest incentive you can give in game to stop this practice fully supported
removing insurance will have no effect on organised gankers
no but at least their profit will be reduced current logic of insurance is weird i insure my new car in case of fire i set my car on fire in front of insurance company guy heeey bravooo here is your insurance money
considering their profit is never guaranteed due to the loot drop system you would be surprised how little insurance would affect them they would just get a little selective or gank more freighters instead of t1 haulersthe real life insurance argument doesnt really hold in this case either as no real life insurance company would insure a mission ship or mining vesseloutside 0910 sec systems either as you are willingly flying them in situations where they could get blown up it only works when considering the complete removal of insurancethe only true way to stop suicide gankers is for the guys getting ganked to stop leaving themselves so open to it the amount of times i have seen people lose billions because they decided it would be a good idea to fly it around in an untanked t1 hauler would make your mind boggle
funny how whiny pirates who hide behind their mining alts for iskfarming always use the term something that can fit a gun not pvp fitted apparently for some stupid reason they think that farming rattingmissioning ships is any better and that only they should have safety and still be able to grief
i cant believe this hasnt died yetanyway noinsurance in eve isnt really insurance its basically percentage scrap rights concord gets the rights to 60 of the mineral scrap value of a wreck and the owner gets 40 you pay a slight amount more to get more of the scrap valuethat is why it is payed out to everyone
absolutely supported 110 only a pirate would not like this idea it makes sense too criminals who have their vehicle shot up by the police dont get covered by an insurance company for the damages you dont get insured for setting your car on fire eitherpirates just want their jobs to be as easy as possible when in fact it should be one of the most difficult things to do in the game
supportedyou can argue about what is better or worse about eve now compared to years ago until the end of time but people are in absolute total agreement that this was a stupid stupid move and the old effects cynos jump drives jump portals and engine trails need to return
supported ccp bring back the old cyno jump effect was for noobs so much awesomness to see their first cyno jump now its just pants
id love to see a better balance of ranges the damages work out pretty well right now as is fully supported
morning bump wink
while this practically turns the game into a turn based cluster it is still better than the soulcrashing cluster we havethis thread just got approved by captain jt kirk
yes
sounds good
supportedbut just one thought there should be a limit on the time dilation if the server ever gets to the point where its running at 20 or 30 sec gametime versus realtime then ccp should just let the modulelagserver crash happenoverall its a brilliant idea
gallente ships need a serious boost fully supported
1 to this and it wouldnt be to much to ask for if gallente boats could run 1 extra dronei mean with all races being able to use drones and gallente is the drone race its strange that they dont get any special with their drones
what like drone bonuses or the ability to field a larger variety than equivalent ships no that certainly isnt a current gallente traiton a side note reducing the fitting of hybrids and making them insta reloading would improve both gallente and caldari hybrid boats which seem to get forgotten in these discussions
caldari boats look like they get forgotten because the hybrid issue is far more acute for gallente vessels even though improving both blasters and railguns would benefit both races ships caldari ships also have the use of missiles which are arguably a better weapons system than drones
i would say the caldari hybrid boats have more of a problem applying damage than gallente ones due to a lack of midslots being slow and having no damage bonusthe whole caldari have missile boats doesnt really wash minus the drake tengu hookbill most are crap or average at best the nighthawk is good but not that much of an improvement over the drake whereas the gallente drone boats are largely good the ishkur ishtar vexor navy vexor and domi are all good ships and the myrm is largely underrated this is why it would be better to fix hybrids first as it helps benefit more crap ships than just a gallente ship fix
actually gallente ships are designed by person who thinks that hybrids are powerfulif hybrids were powerful then it would be fair that ship carrying them are slow have horrible cpupg weird and useless bonuses and so on this is how balance works in eveunfortunately hybrids are not powerful they are badly underpowerd compared to other weapon systemsminmatar ships on the other hand are created keeping in mind that projectiles are bad maybe they were bad before not sure so their ships are versatile fast and just good so change the whole concept about hybrids being good they are pretty much niche weapons and ship that carry them should be designet acordingly
this is ccp were talking about if you were around when nozh really ed up the ms design youd know how badly i want to go to iceland and burn their offices down for not caring about hybridsthe one problem with hybrids is their lack of range boost their range and you immediately boost their usabilityi have seen many posts defending the lack of range of hybrids but none have explained why amarr can hit up to 50km whilst having the highest tracking minmatar can hit almost as far as amarr and caldari being able to hit up to 30km with torps torp ravens are so rare theyre rarer than platinum an abaddon can match the dps of a mega whilst outclassing it in every scenario and lets not even talk about autocannonsthe imbalance is ridiculous and infuriating because ccp have been notified of this many a timei will vote for anyone who rebalances guns and adds more range to hybrids adding extra damage will not do as its pointless you can have a ship with a trillion dps but the moment youre webbed or your mwd gets shut off all your dps is useless and all you can do is wait to flee in your pod because youre never going to reach your target anyway the one thing that will help is somehow making them faster but as i dont see it happening i want to see hubrids being able to hit at up to 40km
thats a stupid fix making hybrids hit out to 40km replaces projectiles and means we end up with another essentially obsoleted weapon type
whats more stupid than unused guns with no niche go ahead ask for total anihilation of gallente racespace since you are there the only people sugestig things to make those weapons be usefull for a whole race are called stupids emoragers and so on its pathetici can also say that i wouldnt like any other weaponship to become another i win button like my minie stuff but that would be too much honest wich is not on the gameplayers lineso what is your sugestion and please give some numbers realted to other weapon systems so we can see how you have found the best option and the way so that even newbbies stop using autocanonsartillery in theyr ships
im sorry there have been plenty of decent suggestions to fixing hybrids lowering fitting requirements increasing damage and tracking instant reloads however increasing hybrid range to that of projectiles and lasers only makes all the guns similar with hybridsblasters outdamaging both lasers and projectiles across the boardthis all being whilst it would now have the best tracking anyway due to the improved hit chance from the now increased rangeit is a stupid idea to make all the guns similar hence why i said making blasters have 40km range is a stupid fixedit i personally support a damage and tracking increase whilst lowering the fitting requirements this would help both gallente and caldari hybrids and mean that you would still have to work to get people but the damage is now enough to make up from the tank you lost getting them in range
ccp lots of your time and our money has been and are continually waisted in combat of bottingthere are a sh load of posts in the forums where players are demanding an end to bottingits like combatting software  movie piracy  its just not possibleyou can copyprotect all you want  it will be hacked  thats a fact and we all know know itwe are fighting a lost causeif you cant beat them join themwe need a new approach to the problemlets even the ods outi suggest making ingame botting possible and legala fully flexed macro language with all commands nessssarycommands like these undock warpto nameofdestenation activategate dock stationname invitetofleet charname activateslot slotname ejectcargobaywhenfull activatemodule deactivatemodule locktarget unlocktarget and so forthif its available to everyone ingame there is no need to buy isk via rmt and no need to buy external botting softwareif its available to everyone ingame it can be controlled and optimized by ccp so as not to put exessive load on serversim thinking in line of scripts you can manufacturescript command sc  manufacturering  ship command script scseach sc has to be added to the same scs one line at a time by the help of manufacturering in order to create a fully working scsif not manufactured in correct order scs will not work correctly  isk waisted like invention  try againone thing is important ingame botting must not be limited in any way or people start using external botting againplenty of options to make this another industry in eveonlineship command script can only be insertedremoved in station pos or ship maintenance bays like any other modulescs is not destroyed when removedone property of the sc could be manufacture time and the more scs put on a scs the longer it takes to manufacturenew skills are neededa scs cannot be copieda scs gets worn down by usage and must be repaired otherwize it will end up being destroyed  think of it as an old fashion punch card you put into ships auto pilotthere is a chance npc ewar will disrupt ships computer halting a running scsim not saying this is the final answer to botting and its connection with rmt but with ingame legal botting there is no need to buy at rmtim not promoting afk play but some things in eve are outright borringand im all for keeping iskies in the gameall mmogs are having the same problem with rmt and are fighting the same lost causeeve online is different in having a csm why not try this radical new approachccp dr eyjog wants more isk sinks  here is oneccp and csm this is ment as a serious suggestion please treat it as sofly safe out there
hell no theres a reason why games fight against botting because allowing it unchecked vaporizes economies rmt wont be stopped if anything legalizing bots makes it easier for them to produce lowering their prices per isk amount even more while making a sanctioned way for them to be unkillable like in 00 with ratterswhat people need to do is stop cheating in games everyone blames ccp about bots but we need to start blaming players more legalizing botting would do nothing except kill the economic side of the game and make it dull to play

i live in 00 atm and i like the idea of destructible stationsbut as stated earlier you can not just destroy everything in the station mainly because of inactive playersand nobody wants to run the risk of losing the 5 fitted carriers he has in a station
the return of risk for the reward
supported and predicting epic lulz when a high level spydirector selfdestructs a station
i would rather have more solar systems than less stations
i def support this it does feel like there are some gaps and room for improvement with several t3 subsystems all of which seem to have been addressed here well thought out and seems like it would be a welcome improvement sadly i do believe this would drive the market prices of t3 ships back up to what they were right around the time we first saw them introduced there is no such thing as a free lunch i would be happy to pay the inflated price for a more versatile and useful t3 shipthumbs up
i dont particularly agree with the changes in the op but i can support some love to t3 it seems tme you are paying 5 times as much for a ship equal to or lower in capabilities to the t2
i support this however to the people up above who claim otherwise the legion most definatly needs the fuel catalyst subsystem 100mn afterburner ftw
forgot to officially support
thanks for all the support guys i for one will happily skip into jita and stay there forever when the ability to filter out all of those thousands of people in favour of those two wts is deployed
local needs to be nerfed not buffed
its hardly a massive buff but please do explain why you said what you said its more of an adjustment in something that should have been present at the start but wasnt  filters in any sense are good and the game would be better with more
i disagree the items could be clientside updated with each patch which would not slow modern machines at all if you did notice a speed hit it would only be in station and would not effect game play remember also that not everybody would be able to create stuff it would take a real life skill set and have to pass a vetting process before becoming part of the game basically farming out the labor intensive graphics design process to the members of the player base that have those skillsalso though this isnt second life the ambulation feature is going to attract a lot of people into the game and this would enhance their play experience im not quite sure how you define the desired play styles desired by who
a massive massive burden on ccp staff as they have to trawl through 5 gazzillion crap and  or offensive clothing designs from wannabesunaceptable levels of censorshipclothing  spaceshipsthe concept of having a look n feel for clothing is completelly irrelevantlook and feel and trends and styles develop because of what people like to wearthere would need to be massive choice for clothing to become realistic as there is in the world todaya better system would be to have the cloths designer ingamehave a system which makes sure nipples remain covered etcand have it cost a crap load of isk to prototype clothing designspolytextiles  prototype clothing bp  cloths which can then be soldallow survival of the fittest to take care of all the crap stuff  noone wants
helloi want to present idea to add percentage tax to any order change in the market the same way it is present in the contracts for example you sell x for 100000 isk you pay 1 than if you want to set price 999999 you should pay another 1 from the whole price this tax can be affected by skills but cannot be remove completely why is it necessaryall we know that normal buysell operations now are totally screwed by market bots and nolife players which are going 001 isk game leaving no space for casual tradersit is good idea to have them think about their prices not only mechanical outbid until they reach the bottom this idea is widely supported in russian community and i think it is the technique which can greatly helps to improve this part of the game and moreover is a very simple in realization the original russian topic
market bots are a problem indeed this idea probably may become a little step on the big job of cleansing bots from eve at least for market bots  to reduce a number of 001 isk order changings if each change will be fined by a tax it would be a bit easier to trade for non botting people
this topic should be moved to assembly hall for the idea itself  i support it
moved to the assembly hall on the request of the op
unsupportedits perfect how as is now pretty same as real stock exchange marketlie its at least 5050
we are not buying stock selling merchandise in real life has real cost overhead and in this game the overhead is so small its irrelevant hence the 01 isk game as it is now the person with ocd and no life winsunless a bot is in playhonestly they should be taxing highsec transaction a hell of a lot more than they do both for the isk sink and to drive trade towards null allowing those willing to move the goods and take the risk to profit more than those that sit in the safety of high sec gaming a system that would never exist in real life
supported it would kill alot of the 01 games by driving their margins to 0 for each change they make
im so sick of petitioning bots in high sec plexes like angel creomining im so sick ccp  hear me
i know you asked for constructive criticism but as i was reading through the pdf i realized that literally every clause had some sort of silly demand like doubling something or decreasing something by 50 or similar nonsense and just ended being thankful ccp dont listen to every random proposal they see
thanks for stealing all our ideas and putting your name only on the document
yes you are right however i read most of the ideas i borrowed on this and other forums months ago and even if i remember where i read it this might not be the original authorthat being said if anyone shows up and says this is mythis dudes idea i will add the name happily there is no reason i should take credit for what i dont deserve
sorry but i love lengthy posts i recently posted a thread entitled dear hulkageddoners which you can probably find in the events  gatherings forum here is the link
partly a good idea though not original or uniqueyoure proposing 2 different ideas so i cant support the threadyou sound like youre doing a stealth whine in the form of a suggestionflaws with the idea of making killrights sellable is that nobodys going to buy them 1 killrights do not apply to the pod which is whats needed to collect the bounty 2 the killrights would be made worthless if the suicide character is a throwaway toon 3the nonthrowaway toons would have their sec status dropped fast enough that they probably spend most of their time in lowsec anywayive made a proposal in the past on how to fix the entire bounty system with a few simple changes but i dont think enough people are interested besides ccps too busy for probably at least another year or two before they can even begin working on anything like this its been broken for 7 years now its not something anyone expects to be fixed any time soon including ccp
1 let the market decide the value of a killright2 there is no bounty involved so there is no need to kill the pod i am not proposing a new bounty system3 isnt ccp supposed to be cracking down on the use of throwaway toons 4 the whole purpose of making killrights tradeable is make the enviornment uniform so that even if a toon does hide in lowsec or nullsec someone there will be able to buy the killrights so it wont matter where they hide edit and the mere fact that someone can hide from a killright only proves once more that the system as it stands coddles the gankers
simply making killrights tradable will not make them useful1 market decides the value of a killright but if the game mechanics give them no benefit to use they have no value2 bounty would be the only reasonable way to make killrights valuable by neglecting bounties they are still just as worthless as they are now3 i havent heard of anyone getting banned for using throwaway toons have you4 in 00 killrights mean absolutely nothing they have absolutely zero value there in lowsec killrights would mean you could have more legal aggression and small ship combat on gates but you dont really need them killrights would have the most value in highsec but since you have no way of knowing for sure if anyone much less someone specific has killrights on you allowing them to be tradable would discourage people from occasional lowsec pvpso your idea needs work for it to actually be good if you want to whine and cry like the tone of your posts have so far you wont be getting much support here
i like hulkageddon but i also like the principle of this idea however as mkmin pointed out some other game mechanics changes would be necessary and the implementation is very messy but contrary to his point of view i possess a different concern while the average killright would hardly be worth much as he pointed out there are always extremes in every systemone of my biggest worries would be the scenarios in which ganking becomes counterproductive if you gank someone in highsec you give them a license to kill which is worth money on the market at some point that license to kill can become worth more than the gank and in essence by ganking people you could actually be giving them free isk insteadoverall i have to say no

not using plex so far but like with cell phones you should be able to see any time how much time you got left
as of now theres no point what so ever to this tab change it to something useful
changing what a module does onthefly is a very fun aspect of eve online even when youre doing something as simple as changing a tracking computer to tracking speed instead of optimal when an enemy comes into default optimal range it gives you something to do instead of just praying that your guns hit in the situations where you really cant do anything elsemore modules should have script functions these come to mind right awayarmor repairers shield boosters damage mods damage controls cap boosters long ranged variant gunsmissiles afterburnersmwd siegetriage etcof course every script would have a downside equal to the upside making them balanced just like tracking scriptsdiscussion on script functionsfeel free to add your own module type
i like the general idea of scripts but i was absolutely horrified when i saw the way ccp did itit was a huge nerf to all scripted modules 50 nerf if adding scripts to these other modules will also result in 50 nerfs then forget about it
the modules that have scripts are modules that affect 2 different things the stuff you list only do 1 thing guns are scriptable with the kind of ammo you pick if you could figure out something that would be better scripted than what you have listed then yeah id supportconsider current scriptsewar are range effectiveness or half and halfhic bubble is either bubble or infinipointidea doesnt seem very well thought out as to what youd like to script what effect it would have and why it wouldnt unbalance the game
in game so not much time to type buti was thinking scenario based scripts like for example an armor repair system would have a script that doubles duration but also doubles the amount repaired and visa versa if you know you wont have cap for very long use the double repaired etc
yes
ive just recently gotten into heavy trading and hauling ive worked up my own very elaborate market quickbar folders to simplify this however searching my existing buy orders and sell orders is much more tedious as there is no way to organise the items and they have limited sorting optionsi would like to propose adding a folder system to the market orders window for simplicity i would suggest making it identical to the mechanics in the market quickbar window that way there would be a minimal learning curve and ccp could possibly just port over the code im not a programmer but i think this would just be a cosmetic clientside modification so it wouldnt add any extra load to the serversthis feature would be of greatest benefit to traders who have many many orders open simultaneously rather than settling for the default alphabetical sorting it would allow us to sort orders in a way that mirrors the market browsing tab or our market quickbar or it could be used to mirror the sorting of items in the hangari did a search for similar suggestions in the assembly hall but i couldnt find any however i did find many people asking for the quickbar folder feature several years ago before i started playing obviously many people found that useful and it got implemented im hoping people will also support market order folderschris
nope there is no official rule but usually you hear about 1 of the value to be transported high sec transports are mostly capped in the payment you wont find many transports go over 5 misk payment the collateral should be usually around 110 of the value to make it not worth stealing the cargo t2 production can be higher as for t2 you calculate with higher margins then 10 the collateral shouldnt be higher then 1 billion isk as well cause then the break even for ganking is reached so 16 billion on a transport with a freighter is like a cross hair on your back you shouldnt accept those anyway i hope you dont accept those 1000 isk courier contracts cause then you are responsible yourself for such kind of contracts as long they get fulfilled they will be set up like this
of course they dont get fulfilled and of course theyre still set up like this its same as all other scam contracts you set up idle contract slots on all your toons since the slots are wasted anyway if you dont use them eventually some scrub bites
id like to see some action on this too
yes absolutely
problem currently and against what some might feel is common sense a corp member requires the role contract manager in order to accept contracts for their corporation however they require no roles whatsoever to steal a contract that has been assigned to their corporation into their own possessionthis means that it is impossible to securely send items or a courier job to a corporation such that one of several trusted people could accept it as they are available unless you are able to 100 trust every single member of your corp even a 3 day old on probation with zero rolesproposed solutionadd an option when contracting to a corporation that restricts the acceptance of that contract to for corp without allowing members to accept it individuallyalternative 1 even more usefuladd an option that restricts acceptance of a contract made to a corporation to those with contract manager roles for both accepting for corp and for individual acceptance secure contract optionalternative 2 perhaps more intuitive and safermake the default that contracts to a corportation can only be accepted by contract managers but add an option which opens the contract out to all corp members open contract option  eg for sales of fitted ships at corporation prices to members etc
just a bumphope to see it as a fix during one of the small patches
like the idea do something about the bots already i know this is one of a thousand topics on bots but let me put it this way this issue has not been touched by ccp during any other csm it has been a known problem for years after years of inaction you bet youll hear alot of uproar about it fix it and fix it correctly supported
well one should think there are so many threads cause people dont see much progressbut it is true that showing the name of the bots would support the botdevs to fine tune the code therefore i would support the topic but more generalized the max info ccp could release is how many bots in which region where banned but this is imo not of use to any player so one could leave it completea monthly update on how many bots in total how many in high low or true sec a dev blog on the bot bannings would be interesting but contra productive to ccps work on the work against bots police doenst tell you how far they are catching the criminal as well maybe some extra words in the eve quarter report
i hope this is the right place to post this sort of thing i have a couple of suggestions that will definitely help trading and the market if you feel like moving this post to a better more proper place on the forums please do so 1 searchs done on the market should have sort by power requirements and also by size filters to make it easier to fit out ships2 when viewing the market your orders should show up in red or some other color than the current market colors to make your orders distinct from othersi believe that both of these suggestions would greatly improve the efficiency of the marketplace and help people from getting more headaches thank you for your time hope this finds the right people soon have care fly safe 
hi there suggestions are right here but i think there will be little hope for yours both issues are already solved with external programs about 1  have you tried the eft eve fitting tool yet its great for fitting tests i think there is hardly anyone who makes a ship and is not trying the fitting first on that toolabout 2 it is solved by tools like evemeep your orders will be listed and highlighted in such tools seeing your orders in a different highlighted color could help but i doubt ccp will give it high priority as there are so many things they currently work on maybe the announced change in more little updates will bring some quick fixes like yours
1 i dont think thats really necessary  when youre looking though the market for a ship you generally have some idea of the kind of ship youre looking for2 this would be a good idea
read this
most people who are at a level where they needbenefit from using these implants dont need the extra skill training speed and it would simply raise the cost of these modules way above their current value for people that pvp in themyou can also jump out of them during combat downtimes and the only real benefit would be to carebears who will only ever use them in a risk free environment and definitely push the price up to stupid levels through increased demandno

i think that the current game system has some really strong limitationsif you want to keep sovereignty 1system based and the size of powerblocs does not change the current situation is the best that can happen in my opinion two things must change1 it does not make any sense that you can invade just a single system at a time when a two entities fight their goal is to control at least a constellation usually a region sometimes even multiple regions i am completely confident that if sov warfare not soevereignty itself becomes constellation based with constellation wide reinforcement timers and some measures aimed to eencourage simultaneous fights on different solarsystems splitting the load of the global fight onto different nodes it will become far more enjoyable less lag and deep2 people should stop thinking that small independent entities should be able to hold sov against stronger opponents this is never going to happen without senseless game breaking changesinstead small entities must be given the possibilities to live and do farming logistics industry ecc in hostile territory thus supporting a guerrilla style pvp not at all an i win button tools for small entities to survive to avoid direct confrontation only to an extent with a stronger opponent tools to hide up to a certain extent without being a threat to poses outpost and sovereignty people must understand that sovereignty outposts poses are only for powerblocs and not for the weaks but the weaks deserve some way to survive in conquerable space
kruger i agree with everything you say except the above so i am 90 on board with you but this part i really think is a bad ideayou want fw occupancy to be more about pve i want the opposite i want the npcs removed and the actual players to be notified and fight for the plexes as long as plexing is mainly a pve activity it will never get any respect in the game it must be pvp if it is to be worth doing for anything other than iskas for giving isk for plexing i agree there should be some reward but i dont want plexxing to just be a new way to carebear occupancy wars should motivate people because it is a challenging game consider player sov systems and all the wars fought for that do alliances take over space to make more isk or do they make more isk to take over space why do they fight for sov so much you see the motivation to take over space is because that is how you succeed at a rewardingchallenging game if the game is not rewarding or challenging it will not be respected as long as fw is a fight against npcs it will not be a rewarding or a challenging game it will only be worthy of luls from the eve community perhaps you can clear out sansha or sleepers better than anyone in eve who really cares are we going to have an alliance tournament to see who can kill sleepers the fastest would anyone watch pvp is the thing that is most challenging and interesting in eve but you are right about everything else fw could truly be great do the things you say and let the militias know exactly where plexes are entered by whom and ship types so they can go fight it out fw will indeed be the best pvp in eve and gaining occupancy will be challenging and worthwhile
on fw i would suggest some simple to impliment but effective ways to buff the game split by category and ease to implimenton plexseasy improved ai implimented big lp reward for plexes faction ships to be counted as tech 2 solves them all in one fell swoopmedium all sides get various ewarefare generic plex rat introduced if needs be so never again complaints about bias in sideshard offensive plexs 70 defensive faction spawn 30 offensive faction spawn i want to be in a war zone so lets see the navies fighting when you enter it also immediately makes plexs more of a viable zone as both sides will be under fire when fighting in themon missionseasy if big loyalty point reward for plex mission lp reward toned downmedium missions to count towards sov just like plexeshard new ai introduced all mission would need redoingon fw in generalall hard i fear for development consequences caldari conquered all of low sec they got a badge eve is meant to be about consequences so let see either a bonus to caldari space or a penalty to gallente in such circumstance annoucements in militia chat every five minutes when a bunker is vulnerable would lead to everyone charging the system just to find fights which is good for everyone war dec mechanics against militia to be revisited either treat as alliance or allow alliances no ccp half arsed nature about this reward for rank at the moment ironically you actually provide a reward to the opposition for your rank you are worth more lp simply apply a similar multiplier for rank so if you are rank1 shooting a rank 10 general is worth 10 lp but if you are a rank 10 general then its worth 100 lp to shoot rank 10s and 10 lp to shoot rank 1s
this comes up allot but the same objection often comes up if you give some bonuses to the side that is winning and penalize the losing side why would anyone join the losing side wars will quickly become lopsided wont they
ive kept thinking about this since fw was introduced its needed to make people realise that there is a war going on does it have to be something that ruins balance though im not so sure you could make it so that those losing get a buff to the offensive and defensive plexes whilst penalizing their missions and rewarding their opponents the question is making sure both happen and that if one is being penalised on the rewards then they get help with the combat a similar idea is taxes rise on the defensive team then they had better get more fw npc ships out there to reflect the extra spending neither of these ideas really solves the problem but it makes it less static and more dynamic though lets be honest this is just dreaming id give anything just to see ccp actually remember factional warfare
manai see what you are saying there are ways to make the game more dynamic without leading to a completely lopsided war one thing that i have considered often is this lets say caldari have taken over 70 of what was originally the gallente space at that point the actual people on planets of these contested systems should be pretty solid gallente race maybe they could have spies behind the scene npc spies make it so that at that point gallente could bring cruisers into the a minor and bcs into medium plexes etc caldari would still have the original restrictionsif it gets to be the point that the gallente are down to their last few systems then all the plexes there allow bses for gallente the idea is the gates would be bugged by the citizens who live in the last hold out systems for the race and it would make for some pretty interesting game play not only would have blobs of frigates trying to take down battleships but perhaps races would try to take systems further from their base so that to capture the last holdout systems they could be close to their basebut again as long as fw occupancy is pve it will be lulworthy and not worth doing
i am admittedly a nonplexer ie i am in fw for the pvp and think plexing is utterly mindnumbingly boring not to mention completely irrelevant to my game though ill do it on occasion if there is no pvp at hand or if friendlies who do take plexing more seriously than i need assistancehowever having said that i agree with the above suggestions with one addition fix it so that the alternate enemy faction also takes npc aggro when plexing  ie amarr in a gallente plex
lovin the ganker tears supported
anyone on board with this proposition has no idea of balance if there was no risk to lazy feckless people in empire then more people would be boring carebears and there would be less demand for building gank shipsthe only scenario i would agree with no insurance paying out is if concord was tuned down to the point where it was possible for a group to beat them since concord means pwn then insurance has to be validyou may as well make it a criminal offence to mount a pvp fit to a ship in empirehulkageddon is coming up happy hunting and yarrr
i agree with you here if insurance is removed for concord related losses due to realism of insurance i say the police should be more realistic to maintain balance
same numbers caused projectiles being foty i vote no for more ignorant changes as such
perfect lets all train minmatar or amarr and let gallentecaldari for noobs and fresheasy killmailsworks fine like this atm wy change it

supported as a temp fix to the problem
1 of course only ccp can know for sure if it makes sense to go down this route but hey brilliant idea
just weird enough to work
would be real nice to hear from ccp if this is feasable and what they think of itclever idea

lowering fitting requirements will do what how will that solve the imbalancehow will increased tracking fix the problem other than everyone fitting rails great blaster fix fit railswhile fitting requirement would help somewhat it wont solve any real problemwhat you miss is that every race can match gallente for dps whilst having more range you are proposing to increase tracking to hit what a webbed ship if your blasters are unable to hit a webbed ship you are either shooting the wrong target too small or you need to level your skills morei have 10m in hybrids alone and i havent flown a blaster ship in years whats the point in having these guns when everyone uses rails there was a time when blasters meant something and a blaster boat instilled fear now a blaster boat causes laughter look at that fool flying a ship with 04 fittingsthe last two options are ccp refund all the sp weve put in hybrids so we can put them in more useful guns like lasers and lasers and lasers acs if you want to fly machs but otherwise lasers or they add mid slots to gallente ships allowing us to fit several tracking computers
the main issue imo is ccp nozh or whoever is responsible for balancing changes this personpeople simply do not posses enough knowledge rational thinking and understanding of the game mechanics to make such changesuntil there is some radical change in the balancing procedure or people in charge i do not believe there will be any positive move in terms of game balancesmall example of t1 cruiser comparisonmaller 5x hpl 855 pg and 21875 cpu leftthorax 5x hnb 71 pg and 24375 cpu leftrupture 4x 425mm  2x ham 2938 pg 25625 cpuleftweapons make fitting difference for the most part as remaining modules are about the same on all three ships question is what do you want to fit on your thorax with 71 pg left balancing fitting requirements is essential part of blaster issue as the problem is mostly the ships and less the weapons
you may have 10m in hybrid sp but evidently you have 0 skill in reading as i actually proposed a damage and tracking buff for hybrids range is the one thing that definitely shouldnt changeedit also as the above poster pointed out the ability to actually fit a full rack of medium guns an mwd and a 1600mm plate on a thorax without an acr would go a long way to helping rebalance the guns
it would be nice to fly my own races ships with hybrids and an armor tank and not have to worry about being constantly out gunnedwhat he said 1
sounds good although the being unable to undock thing could be circumvented via the ability to purchase a noob ship for naf all
makes sense to me
same here but you see how ccp is listening to the community

nowt will be done but hell ccp have got to realise that gallente are just fricken screwed royally mind you i think that ccp just love the squidheadshint ccp fixing this helps squidies too you know
naga i agree completely with your sentiment as long as a popular mmo has atleast 2 players youll always find one player wanting to get ahead which naturally leads to cheating fighting against it only leads to restrictions and concessions that damage the end user more than anything and by proxy the host company as wellwhen we look at a similar situation square enixs final fantasy xi who i believe have had a couple of conferences with ccp discussing rmt se took an incredibly agressive position against rmt setting up an entire branch of employees dedicated to nothing but seeking out characters with large amounts of ingame currency and tracing its flow looking for rmt traders and holders and using programs that automatically and permanently banned accounts on a no appeal basis tracked down the methods used by rmt to accumilate their wealth generally legitimate strategies that normal players employed too and annihilated them eg gardening a mechanic designed around passive incomes used by normal players who also wrongly got caught up in mass bannings bugard skins mistletoe ect by the end of 2009 they had managed to alienate their already dwindling playerbase completely through heavy handed and almost ridiculous treatment of the situation and only recently has the game had a renaissance due a completely new development team and the massive flop of their most recent mmo final fantasy xiv which almost all of the complaints can be drawn from their ridiculous anti rmt policies eg horribly lagged serverbased uifor antibotting designed for controllers only a system of character growth that lowers your exp gains as you clock more hours to stop powerlevelers no centralised trading resource to stop rmt gaining an early foothold on the money side of things ffxiv has slowly been regaining in popularity but the damage has already been donenow this is just an example of one company but one thats very well known and respected company that managed to almost destroy themselves by tackling a problem in a very wrong way i understand why you might want to legitimise botting as it would effectively level the playing field completely but what it also does apart from devalue isk massively is marginalise the actual reason why youre supposed to be playing the game and thats to actually play itone of the biggest problems i see with botting in eve online is that its so easy to do and theres very little reason not to the biggest botted industry is without a doubt mining and although its alot less prevelant than it used to be it still exists and it exists because 1 its so easy to bot 2 its not fun 3 its slow and tedious and lastly 4 because the time to isk ratio is rather low the second most botted industry is belt ratting in nullsec which to my knowledge requires relatively hightech programs to manage compared to macromining atleast the reason this industry is botted is because 1 its astronomically profitable 2 its not fun 3 its slow and tediousyou said it yourself though things simply arent fun they way things are and it certainly doesnt help ccps case thinking about how much work would be involved though balancing and reforming the games economy completely all official macros would do is take us a step to the side because even though were not really working for our meals now they still taste like  we really need to look at making the things being botted worthwhile to actually do in person first and until then i think ccps reactionary damage control is the best were going to get for nowps sorry for the difficult to read wall of text
janaren thats full of crap i played ffxi and their antibotting stance so helped the game it wasnt funny when bots and exploits were rampant things like scorpion harnesses cost 10 times what they did after and rmt consistently botted and locked up virtually any notorious monster spawn they did not alienate large parts of the playerbase but managed to actually make the game less of a grind and fixed a lot of the issuesa lot of the mistakes were often because players imitated rmt style by using massive numbers or alts to try to gain passive income as someone who actually farmed bugard skins before rmt did i can tell you virtually no one else legitimately did because it was only profitable in large amounts through rmt a lot of the ways legit players made money had zero to do with rmt at all selling drops from enm and othersif you played ffxi and think it was better before they cracked down no offense but you never played during cop you never saw the armies of fishing bots as well as the rmt monopolizing and hacking ulli or serket youll need to pick a better example because ses antirmt saved the game
yeah a lot
we already have that its called pi
here is a better idea hell no why should we make isk easier to make for the guys who will carry on botting external to this mechanism anyway unholy rage worked well hoefully th next hulkageddon will work well to kill some bots and as i am also an industrialist iut hurts me somewhat but happy for it to go ahead reduced supply industrial stockpile  profitrmt is the ban of a game liuke eve and your proposal does not solve it it just makes alliances which already have a lot of money able to fuel themselves a lot easier your suggestion is entilerly about afk play and multiboxing i like to know that the guys i am competing with are working hard for thier money and more work needs to be done wrt unholy rage and rmt not supported
centri i never said ffxi was better before they got off their arses how did you come to that assumptionstopping fishing botting was neccesaryswitching rareex drops on nms was neccesarybanning of kings and sky rmt was neccesarythese things were all literally required in order to make the game playable in leui of the expansion of rmt and im not arguing about those additions to the game if you look at what my points were i was arguing that the modification of sell prices to practically destroy any focused gil production in the game also destroyed any semblance of the economy you say that the legit players made their money by selling drops from enm but where did the money that they got for their haguns ect come from enmsbcnms became profitable precisely because of the inflation rmt caused when the majority of the gil being introduced onto the market is by rmt there something is considerably wrong with your game and this is where they killed the economy through massive reductions of the amount of gil in circulation they effectively placed their servers into a permanent recession where there was no way to build it back upif se had thought about ways of balancing their actions to give legitimate players their own way of supporting the economy without being underpinned through rmt then im sure all their attacks on skins mistletoe gardening and such would have been finedid this stop rmt no they just developed more insideous strategies to get the money through hacking and slashing ingame scamming and trading accounts they managed to alienate their customers through horrific customer services who regularly dismissed any allegations of incompetence when they accidentally rolled back a character 5 years or when they would outright refuse to discuss erroneous bannings their gms and bizarro tos policies that could theoretically ban you for healing a player who wanted to bloodport or was chainpulling and dying they could claim you were trying to harrasssteal their mobs respectively or give more rights to scammers than to victims did not help them at alland my points about ffxiv still hold strong everything they did to try to make the game rmt proof also made it fun proof and se is still attempting to recover from the loss of stock value that happened after its release there is literally no way to curb the rmt activity of a popular game and to think so is beyond naive i actually agreed with your post but i guess you didnt notice that because you were too busy misconstruing the point i was attempting to make at face value to boot
whilst i have some sympathy for the spirit in which the op makes his modest proposal the solution to the problem remains what it has always been lets try this one more time to see if it will stickwhen pve ie making isk is challenging unpredictable and needs some actual intelligence then well see a big falloff in botting and not beforeeg rats that have faintly realistic fits and behave with a modicum of intelligence sleeper ai is a big step forward here including trying to escape when theyre threatenedeg rats that do not behave in very slow completely predictable ways and sometimes appear in unexpectedly large numbers and pull stunts like try and decoy the ratter to one side of a site so that hauler spawns or faction spawns can try and escape from another parteg belt and anomaly spawns that routinely escalate where one has to solve a puzzle to work out where the escalation site is the escalation sites have the real valueeg asteroid belts where the miner has to use some skill and intelligence to find the orebearing rockseg asteroids with unevenly distributed veins and concentrations of ore so the miner has to skillfully aim his mining beams through a 3dimensional volume to get the optimum efficiency out of themchanges like the above would make eves pve much more engaging and fun whilst making life very difficult indeed for the bots doublewin
 no
what annoys is that botting can be done with equipment which is either low cost haulersinsured ratting ship or difficult to get to kill hi sec activityi am pretty sure if hauling missions would need tech 2 fitted hauler preferrably transport we would see much more people after them and much less botters similar thing with ratting at least if would annoy much less if youd get some kind of reward for blowing them up instead of 10k isk worth t1 loot and sec hit in case it happened in low secmining again is just repeat you can blow up couple hulks but only one gaining anything is the guy selling suicide ships and hulks if you mine 25milh or more with hulk i doubt it hurts much to lose one per year or somethingi think this suggestion is horrible though d

while i am all for going after market bots i dont agree with the opundermining the 001 game has only one result  broken pricesits already happening to often that some fool reduces his price by insane 500000 isk cutting the margin by 23 the next one follows and soon we have prices which are under 105 of the material value and no longer worth sellingdoing the 001 helps keeping the prices stable over a long period and hence keeping up the earnings of all traders who do this they have to update their prices more often but thats the price to earn more iskas a casual trader you should probably think of changing the product you want to sell if it has a 001 change about 50 times an evening one requirement to work with this product is obviously not to do it casually

i bet that 90 of market load is created by 01 erswith only about 10 of load being created by new ordershaving the ability to freely reduce prices by 01 leads to a very static market where it takes forever for products to reach there equilibrium valuethe markets are for everyone not just traders cough botsa proper solution would be to allow players to place managed orderswe pay a broker fee but the broker does nothingi should be able to tell my brokersell this much stuffsell it in this amount of timesell it for as much as possible but for not less than xxxthe broker should then manage the sell price until all the stuff is gonethis solution would make market bots irrelevanthaving said that the above solution would require a server in the tranquility cluster to process the orders on a periodic basisbetter this than the current situation of load inducing bots which are1 against the eula2 cause strain on all parts of tranq including proxiessol nodesand the dbthe tax solution is not perfect but would be easier to implementso this gets my support although i prefer to see a fuller solution brokers that work for there fees 
the idea is good the frequent change of market orders should be followed with taxes
this really isnt necessary there is plenty of profit in the market for the casual trader and there is nothing wrong with active market players having advantages if you feel botting is a big problem than think of ways to fight the bots and not fudge up the normal market gameplay in the process not suported
there are four problems here people expect passive trading to be equally lucrative with active trading this is stupid people believe it is the same person 001 isking them in jita when in reality there are thousands of other real players involved in that market people believe that nobody sits there and monitors their buysell orders except bots and themselves of course  people believe that market bots are taking over yet i personally dont believe this to be true market bots are pretty easy to discover identify and then manipulate for amazing amounts of profit but for the sake of argument im going to give you a quick tutorial in passive trading that makes sense and isk this is how i make billions on the marketfirst you have to remember that the market has a natural fluctuation it goes up and it goes down and because it goes up and down we know that static orders between the end points will get filled the trick then is to find the upper and lower bounds and exploit them with afk buysell orderswhen doing this you have to remember that the majority of your isk is made from your buy orders  so margin trading and tycoon are really important to get a good wide spread on your buy orders with a reasonable number of buy orders youll see some market action on most daysyou can immediately relist the stuff as lowest sell for usually 1020 profit but i tend to relist at the higher end of the curve for closer to 50100 profit it can take a week or more for the market to cycle back up that high but you were wanting an afk passive income rightliang

hell no find other ways to kill bots
we are not buying stock selling merchandise in real life has real cost overhead and in this game the overhead is so small its irrelevant hence the 01 isk game as it is now the person with ocd and no life winsunless a bot is in playhonestly they should be taxing highsec transaction a hell of a lot more than they do both for the isk sink and to drive trade towards null allowing those willing to move the goods and take the risk to profit more than those that sit in the safety of high sec gaming a system that would never exist in real lifei agree with your second point here but the first one is incorrect as while yes selling merchandise has overhead changing the price of merchandise has absolutely no overhead also if you want to reflect this on real life taxes are not collected on anything until the transaction takes place and then the buyer pays for it like the current system the current brokers fee of 100isk provides an already decent isk sink for every change in a market order if you feel we need more isk sinks increase that number to 1000isk but a  fee on placing and changing a market order is wrong and will inevitably lead to huge inflation prices will rise
if i choose to list my goods at a price that gives incentive for them to sell quickly then i am taking a profit loss for a quicker return i dont give a damn about your margin its pvp get used to it if bots didnt mindlessly 01 isk then my stock would sell out at the price of my choosing and you could continue to get your inflated long term margins
if bots didnt mindlessly 001 isk you someone else would place another sell order 500k below yours and another below theirs and another below theirs lianged the problem here is that two people like you are fully capable of crashing a market  and both of you are going to come to the forums ing about bots while a bot wasnt involved at all and no i dont care if you crash markets just means that i can pick up the pieces on the cheap
that would be a healthier market more responsive to market equilibrium you cant crash a sellers market below highest buy order price 001 isk war results in wide gaps between buy and sell orders and lower overall volume of actual trades
no that would not be a healthier market and no they do not result in wide gaps between buy and sell orders if anything the suggested change would increase that gap as playing the market becomes more expensiveand make no mistake that would be the only change youd still get under cut but now you wouldnt be able to do anything about itliang

youre yanking my chain right either that or you need to take a refresher speed reading classin the midst of hulkageddon youre going to say that no one would want to kill another ship unless there was a bounty or profit in it for themwheres the profit in outfitting a battlecruiser with smartbombs and heading into an icefield full of mackinawshow about canflipping wheres the profit there can flipping is done all the timethe idea that players must be motivated by a shiney reward transforms the sandbox into the themeparkthe idea that players are only motivated by shiney rewards is contrary to the evidence provided by daily life in eve online
dont want to read your post too closely but you just said that ganking is productive and the system proposed by me would make it unproductiveganking is productive because the gankers are coddled by ccp and you must have missed the point of my post what i wanted to do was make the ganking unproductive by exposing the gankers to the same risks that they expose everyone else to as you point out the current system protects and coddles the gankers and makes ganking a riskfree activity
this would not work cos evil griefers would just bait you to get kill rights with alts u know
lengthy post but not much of content or thought in theretradeable kill rights arent new idea although i always liked it but it will never work imoproblem is the bounty price if it is too high it will be exploited if it is too low it will be meaninglessany idea how to fix iteditpossible fixmake the kill right price fixed based on hull destroyed a kill right payout will be subtracted for insurance pay outb selling your own kill rights wont be profitableany other possible way to exploit it would it be still interesting enough
sure it doesit isnt in spirit of bounty hunting it is definitely a reasonable alternativehaving kill rights tradeable cause a few thingsa if pirate wants to exploit the system by buying his own kill rights he will have to pay to the victim sweet isnt itb it will actually increase the risk for the pirate as he can be attacked anywhere anytime and more kill rights further increase the risk as there will be more huntersc allow criminal hunters to avoid their own security hitsthe systemeven current one needs more improvements like being able to expand the kill right on your corp but the problem is as i pointed out the kill rights trading itself
actually smartbombing an ice belt can be very profitable if you have an alt in a salvage ship near bykillrights shouldnt be permanenthaving said that i support a decent change to the bounty system that makes antipiracy and bounty hunting decent professions however this isnt it also for the brief period i did can flip i managed to make quite a bit of isk in ransoms and can flipping isnt ganking and gives no kill rights as the person has to agro the flipper before they can do anything anyway
not really sure i understand the objection here or if there is any real objection at allyour point is that someone would use an alt bait you into killing him then sell the killrights to his main and descend on you with his main in a pvp tenguhow is that an objection to the proposed system because there was intent on the part of the player with the pvp tengulets say i create a mining alt hes out in his retriever minding his own business mining some veldspar along comes a hulkageddoner pops the alt in the retriever then takes off with my mining alt i sell the killrights to my main get into my pvp tengu and descend upon the hulkageddonerwheres the problemif you are out there engaged in any activity that results in killrights those killrights would be tradeable whether you were baited goaded or they flashed their  at you doesnt matterif your post contains any objection at all it is that the proposed system would lead to gankers getting ganked someone would be able to gank the gankerthe current system coddles the gankers the current system makes ganking a riskfree activity its one of the tencommandments of eve do unto others then warp and thus escape any and all conseqencesoh yeah and let me not forget to point out with canflipping one player baits another player into doing something that would give them the right to attack theres no objection in your objectionseems negativity is its own reward
yet another post stuck on the concepts of bounty and insurancei did not propose a bounty system or a fix to the insurance systemmake killrights tradeablethats it you sell the killrights theres no bounty no reward no waiting to see if the person got killed or not let the market determine the value of a killrightwhy would you try to fix the price of the killright obviously so that ganking the gankers wont become too profitablealso please explain to me how one player could get killrights on himself the only way i can think of isa if pirate wants to exploit the system by buying his own kill rights he will have to pay to the victim sweet isnt itseems negativity is its own reward
sorry for bad wording it isnt bounty in a matter of fact but very similar in mechanics just it is not the victim placing it but market due tradeable kill rightthe weakness i see is that pirate can generate his own kill rights by killing alts and selling acquired kill rights on the marketthis mechanics will ruin the idea of killrights market imoif the price is too low pirate can purchase the kill right himselfif the price is too high pirate starts selling selfgenerated kill rightsfixing the price of the kill right of the destroyed hull removes any possible exploitation whether such fix is needed or market will be able to handle the price at the right spot is a question i pesonally do not think so
killrights kr as commoditieschanges remove bounties entirely make kr contractable commodities new contract type include isk value of loss as part of kr multiply market value with a multiple of metalevel for faction stuff perhapsbounty office to be modelled like the militia offices and function as a separate contract interface has list of most notorious criminals ie active contract values has list of most efficient hunters ie earned contract valueskr contract seller can set price as normal and escrows sum to be paid on completion think current courier contracts escrowed amount appears on targets sheet as bounty seller can stipulate minimum isk damage do be done to target for fulfilment of contract until met the kr remains active and escrow unpaid isk damage value should have 23x original loss as maximum escrow and damage requirement must not deviate more than x to minimize possible abusesand presto limited ability to abuse it with alts to score cheap isk creation of a bounty hunting profession potential severe backlash for suicide gankingps for very large losses perhaps the ability to split kr so that one can sell multiple rights within reason on single targets to really make them hunted prey
i see lots of scammingthink current courier contracts
killrights should indeed be tradeable but what we need is a whole reworked bounty mechanism to go with it in fact as long as were wishing for things were not going to get the whole crime in hisec system needs a rework why do i get concorded for aggroing an ephemeral empty jetcan can but i can steal the whole contents of that can with near impunity  to name but one particularly egregious examplein before torfi explaining why it would be a waste of resources to fix the bounty system because noone uses it
how if you use the actual loss behind a kr as basis for what is possible to set as bounty the ludicrousness of courier contracts will never happenthere is nothing to gain at all by setting up fake contracts except if you set the price insanely high and log the target out of game or go hide in null for three months which is kr duration i think  assuming someone is willing to pay the initial contract at allalt a kills alt b alt b pays to put contract on alt aalt a either gets dead gets some pew or gets most money backwhere is the scam there is no collateral system to abuse as there is with couriers
presentation could do with some work and this has been suggested before its on the csms proposal pageit is however still a really good ideai would vote to skip any bounty office and simply have it as a contract tradeable item make it like bookmarks except without the copy abilityplayer can sell kr and attach a price to it it would need to be searchable so you can find that guy you dont likeanother suggestion  kr should expire dont remove that limitation  just make it something you can check before buyingalso  your complaints about sisi are stupid please stick to one topic per thread so we can praise you for putting forward repeating a good idea in one thread and trash you for failing to comprehend in another
bounty hunting as such wont work ever due exploitation imo but here is a proposal i made as alternative
i thought the bold part represent flat fee you have to payreceive when accepting the contract what the normal and escarow price is supposed to be thenif the contract has no collateral what stops pirate from picking up the contract and let it expiredormant1 the reward cannot exceed the loss of the target2 when you make the pay out depending on isk loss you need to subtract the insurance then you are left with value of fitted modules and some extra for higher tier hull3 because of 23 the rewards will need to be very low4 having isk loss limit to fill your contract is making it very tediousthose are main points i can think of top of my head
the escrow would be similar in function to current bounties but with a hard limit based on actual lossthe normal price is mostly to avoid a pirate buying rights on himself and letting it expire as that money is lost to him and in victims walletone could have low normal and max escrow but the trick would be to find a balance between the urge to get some money and getting paybackthe whole thing revolves around the meek buying help from the strong to get back at whomever wronged them13 loss would be comprised of the whole package three armour rigs for instance easily cost more than an uninsured hull and modules often 23rds of uninsured hull  so there is plenty of room for reward through the escrow4 alternative is to make a partial payout on first kill and return remainder with modern piratessuiciders being as cowardly as they are chances are you get a sacrificial frig and thus lose money if they get wind of you hunting themcould be done i think by seller setting a minimum shiptype to be killed frigcruiserbcbs and letting the normal price be set based on that
who is paying the normal price contractor or purchaserthe normal price is indeed a collateral then
contractor attaches the normal price fee at time of posting it represents the actual purchase of the kr and is the only part of it that allows the victim to recoup some of his loss you kill me  i sell rights on you for cost based on what i lost or lower insurance wise i submit escrow to be paid when conditions are met could be insurance or loss based as long as the benefit of you redeeming with an alt is minimala freighter being ganked for instance would leave a huge margin for the fee but if set to high it will never move so one has to consider just how much one wants the person dead  isk is lost either way just as it is with the current useless systemtricky part is obviously the escrowbounty part it needs to be profitable enough for a 3rd party to want to buy in yet still leave as little as possible for a pirate buying his own rights could be done by simply not allowing escrow to exceed fee but that leaves only lootepeen for the 3rd party as payment which could actually be enough in most cases ref 1020 fee of modern day bounty huntersconcord might even want to sweeten the deal for the eager beavers by adding 1 per 2550 completed contracts up to a max of 10 grinding pirates for isk 
being an eve fanatic and enjoying tabletop games id love a cross over evetabletopmuch like warhammer 40k and other strategy role play games eve as a tabletop would be great for the nights when i feel the strain on my eyesalso an additional thing the delivery charges from the evestore i have bought some stuff but i find it a bit painful throwing so much more money on delivery opening a distribution office in the uk would be awesome and id spend a lot more money in there

assuming you are looking in the right directionthus the namethe type could be important the name rarely is unless the pilot is an idiot that doesnt change the default nameit requires the skills that dont require spuntil you meet a good proberjust add falcondistance not as much as directionplenty of other ways to do that but that is usefuli do it with gate cloak tooalthough it doesnt save you from fast warping shipsexcept that it gets buffed in the op cry moar
noreducing information on kill mails solves nothingremoving kill mails removes bragging only not actual blobbing and hotdrops nono for reasons you posted yourself  you do not have any reasonable solution nomap information like any public intel tool swings both ways if i can get accurate information where enemy is enemy can get accurate info about my position as well better map information provides better awareness about gate camps thus promotes active playi call for more options on map such as multiply filters nobounding scan range to sensor strength is just horrible ideaespecially coupled with your next proposal for probing changes noprobing needs rather nerfchange than boost i disagree with the idea but it gave me a new oneno local for ships with cloaking device  being affected by some structure or changed to device effect itself that would actually require active intel gathering
pretty much a no to all of theseprobing needs to be nerfed not buffed its already too easy to probe someone down the directional scanners is fine as it is as is cloakingi can support removing local or changing it a littlekillmails dont encourage blobbing only bragging blobbing is caused by people not willing to risk there isk flying ships solo and by people wanting to make sure they win
thanks if you have any questions for me throw them out therethanks mynxee your support and endorsement mean the world to metldr version bots are a cancer on eve and need to be wiped outlonger version campaign promises aside i dont believe that the csm can actually do anything about bots and botting the current csm has been presented with ccps botfighting strategies and those discussions are under nda but if im selected for csm6 and i hear those strategies i will listen to them with an ear toward both killing bots and protecting actual players a lot of botfighting strategies hurt honest players just trying to make iskan idea that occured to me that id love to get feedback on though the really scary player pirates dont hunt in lonely 00 systems in the middle of nowhere they hunt in systems with a lot of traffic in them so rather than have officer spawns appear according to sec status i think itd be interesting to have them appear in crowded 00 systems instead base it on the number of people that pass through that system during the previous 48 hours thatd make it a lot more likely that officers would appear in pf346 sec status 035 than they would in pxfrf sec status 10with no officers in those deep uninhabited systems the reason for some of the botting there would go away what do you think
i think you have no idea how ludacrisly profitable botting is if there arent any officers they will do normal battleships if there arent any normal battleships they will do battlecruisers if there arent any rats at all they will run mining bots if there arent any roids they will use market botsthe point is there is so little effort in botting since it is almost a completely automated thing that they will be used even if you slash the income of botter to 10 of what it is now in some way even at 10 your one bot most pro botters run multiple though i reckon i know i would if i was one will most likely earn way more than a really active player and even if it was only half the income of an active player they would still run the bots cuz the effortreward ratio would still be insanely goodyou are not going to get rid of botters by trying to take away the incentive as long as botting will just net you a t1 cruiser a week botting will be donenofi but your view on bots seems to be nothing more than i already stated in this thread earlier it does not really go beyond bots are bad mkay bots need to be dealt with in two ways1 agressivly hunt them down ccp has the monitoring capabillities to do so or the resources to make those2 through their own software it should be less bot friendly many other games have antibottingcheating software that is highly effective
ripard you seem to be a decent chap with a lot of drive vision and knowledge of the game but youre pretty clueless about the botthe csm cant do much about the bot in much the same way that it cant do much about anything it can apply pressure and raise an all mighty storm if need be on any subject if ccp refuse to budge but i digressofficers appearing in more crowded systems may well see a fairer share of real people getting to enjoy those phat loots given the as yet undocumented improvements to officers it could be that these almighty pirate lords become something of an npc anti bot device although no doubt the software will evolve to the point where they are avoided a conservative estimate would put botted income at around 30 mil per hour just for normal rats and not including loot or salvage 12 hours a day and you have enough for a plex anything over and above that is pure profit even if you can lower this amount as long as the bot can provide a reasonable return given the investment it will still functiontheres also the issue of the drone regions by all accounts one of the most heavily botted areas of the game where there are no officers and commander spawns are hardly worth the extra ammunition investment in terms of looti agree with the chap above me if ccp have the means to detect the bot then they should be pressured into employing them more rather than just targeting obvious rmters although day by day the rmt trade is becoming smarter and i fear staying one step ahead of the gms the rmt trade has been running micro transactions long before ccp even considered them given the lack of updates i can only assume that the steam has run out of the unholy rage initiative if they dont have the means then they should be pressured into investing some time and money into creating themthe bot is not just limited to the depths of 00 it infests all facets of eve right to the heart of the jita market it hurts all of us from the industrialist to the pvper rooting it out in a controlled manner which doesnt damage the economy will be no easy task but it is one that i hope you will take up if youre electedid also like to know which anti bot strategies you think have been seriously suggested and considered which hurt normal playersapologies for length
i have no doubt that your amazing contributions to the eve community and your experience in working with ccp as one of capsuleers developers will enable you to do a fine job of representing the community and being a productive member of csm6 so best wishes for success in your campaignand dont say i didnt warn ya
thanks babe and youve given me sufficient and multiple warnings dont worry ill be bugging ya all year long
roc the vote
roc the vote
lol your sense of humor is excellent as always korvin
lol
i am hoping i can get some feedback on my ideas campaign site your opinion matters to me and i want to make sure you agree with my ideas i have also posted one of my ideas on the eve forumsbounty hunting fix
i think you misunderstood me as i didnt want occupacy to bo more pve there should be a bonus reward for killing other militia inside plexesalso an idea for missions is that u could choose to do a pvp mission like a lobby go there and fight 2x gall t1 friggsdessys etc and have a site with acceleration gate that only allows the players who have agreed on mission on both sideslike given a acceleration gate key to the missionit might be hard not to have it exploited such with deadspace fits etc
then do away with npcs altogether just let the players know in a seperate intel channel exactly where plexes have been entered and let them go fight for them  if they choose if players dont want to leave the large fleets to fight for the plexes then they will lose occupancy to an opponent that spreads out and does several plexes at once its really a pretty simple fix
fw forgotten but not gone
reading the csm minutes for june 10ccp stated that fw is not a priority and no fwrelated changes will be considered until after incarna and dustccp responded that lack of focus was not due to lack of enthusiasm but more to availability and prioritization of resourcesso more hurry up and wait
how that should really readfw was released half completed and has been left gathering dust since aside from the pve missionsive dabbled a bit in fw it stinks no benefit for being on the winning side or possessing systems monetary or otherwise its just fighting for the sake of fighting while that may suit a lot of people to a t it doesnt really grip me though im not much of an rper i was under the impression that eve was a game where the players drove the story fw would have been a perfect opportunity if implemented and run properly to have allowed players to shape new eden outside of nullsec its definitely something worth raising
ok i have some concerns that consequences will lead to the fight becoming completely lopsided who would want to join the losing side with all the disadvantages but i suppose there could be some consequences that only indirectly effect playconsider thislets say amarr gain occupancy of the system evati right now there are a few minmatar npc stations there well lets say that when amarr take over there is a certain percentage chance that those stations become amarr npc stations so a boundless creation might become a carthum conglomerate the chance of this happening may depend on how long occupancy is held say every 6 months you roll the dice on any enemy faction corps leaving there may also be a chance smaller chance that a corp from the sister faction would move in  so perhaps lai dai caldari would move in there would be new agents that go in to that etc the rp story would be boundless decides to close down facilities in evati due to a sudden increase in taxes and sells station to carthumlai dai or some suchnow it would be an indirect benefit because you usually have high standings with the faction you fight for so you would gain new agents and resources for those in your faction but then again if one side loses many agents the value of that lp should see a slight rise because the goods are more scarce so it would be a decent storyline consequence that wouldnt likely lead to a lopsided war would this work for actual militia stations that might be going too far  and lead to a lopsided war but if they added some decent faction specific items to the fw lp store there would be a natural balance those lp would be worth more i certainly think many amarr mission runners would fight to keep huola but right now the only after lunch in london plexing mechanics are so bad that i am hesitant to put much weight on it just an idea maybe its bad
discuss i dont want some lunatic stalking me just because i run well that and all the evil things i did to them in game
oh yeah and me for csm
can you cite examples of this happening
it caused me a bit of trouble its quite amazing how upset some people can get over in game conflicts this was all prior to larkonisgate though never had any dramas during and since despite all the space rage it generated  the op you shouldnt have much to worry about unless you have a particularly distinctive name and youve managed to upset a 40 year old manchild with a loose grip on reality
i agree here danger makes eve work but it is ridiculous they pay insurance on crimes
noim against the principal of this even for cosmetic goodsthe only way i could be persuaded is to offer a 2 tier subscription method1 lower price  micros  cosmetics from micros1 standard price with no micros  free cosmetics
nomts are a rl money sink no sensible person needs isk mts are the closest thing that should even be considered in a space game we really dont need cosmetic stuff unless its painting our ships which isnt a good idea when you think about lagits sad tamber resigned and left the game but i can understand that people love the game but tamber clearly loved the game enough that he decided to protest their proposed mts i hope ccp realizes thats why he quit because he needed to make them see that mts are not the way to go
yes i am tired of not being able to tell the difference between chars as im sure more than 80 of us arei1 o0 5s 6g 8b as said and sometimes 89 are hard to tell aparti cant imagine anyone saying that its fine i dont see the problem in giving he font openly to people so they can try and make new fonts and submit for improvement ideas 
i agree
its morning again id swear its been only few minutes since i fell asleepanyway bump
i have been saying something like this should happen for quite a while now so supported perhaps if they dropped the little improvements for a while and got this done things could get more interesting in eve with this war would become less about how many resources you have and more about efficiently using those resources strategically now people will be able to have absolutely massive fights where they will be using up their resources as fast as they can to destroy the other side this would come as a pretty big boost to the economy especially if they come up with an automated system for detecting bots with this change the little people could matter a lot more then they do now edit forgot to check support
yes please
i hardly ever fit neutrons too much pg and cap drain fittings are only part of the problem but one that does need solving but hey we didnt want to fit those guns ccp introduced because were only being trolled anywayccp have no clue as to how to play the game nozh is simply put an idiot seleene worked hard on the mssc rebalancing and in come the clueless and sweep away the designs seen by the players as great and introduce hisherittheir own stupid ideas that do nothing to stop the proliferation of msscrelying on ccp to grasp the fundamental problems of the game is like expecting an alcoholic to decide that theres a problem with that kind of lifestylemedium guns  rails with improved tracking you wont need to webthus we have solved the blaster problem fit rails how about no when i say blasters i mean blasters not rails with a 1600mm plate a thorax may be faster than a bs but its still too slow to web anything before its either pounded to a wreck or the targets got awaywell done youve just solved the rail tracking problemi have raised this problem at every csm election and i will only vote for the person who champions this otherwise i dont see a point in even considering voting for people whose only goal is to advance their own selfish ideas
medium guns means just that medium guns at the moment you cant fit a rack of electron blasters to a thorax with a 1600mm without a fitting mod of some kindi think i will have to go through my idea step by step for you as you seem quite happy not reading the short versionsfirstly the problems that gallente blaster boats face is hybrids are no longer the face melters of old and do not have the dps to make up for there lack of range anymore the old example of a geddon vs mega damage wise comes to mind the other problem is that due to slow ships and short range by the time the gallente blaster boat has tackled its opponent and can start laying in the hurt its lost too much of its buffer alreadythere is a third problem in that even if hybrids were fixed alot of blaster boats cannot fit a tank equivalent to ships of the same tier rupture vs thorax and have medium guns thorax needs an acr to fit electrons 1600mm plate and mwda fitting buff for blasters and rails would help both gallente blaster boats and caldari hybrid boats i personally reckon an increase to the point where the standard armor thorax fit becomesthorax new setup 11600mm reinforced rolled tungsten plates ienergized adaptive nano membrane iidamage control iimagnetic field stabilizer iimagnetic field stabilizer iiyt8 overcharged hydrocarbon i microwarpdrivefaint epsilon warp scrambler ifleeting propulsion inhibitor iheavy ion blaster ii caldari navy antimatter charge mheavy ion blaster ii caldari navy antimatter charge mheavy ion blaster ii caldari navy antimatter charge mheavy ion blaster ii caldari navy antimatter charge mheavy ion blaster ii caldari navy antimatter charge mmedium trimark armor pump imedium trimark armor pump imedium trimark armor pump ivespa ec600 x5this would increase the tank dps and range of the current electron fit and put it closer to the level of the standard armor rupture fit this would require a decrease in both the powergrid and cpu of hybrid guns mainly powergrid thoughthe speed issue is a little more difficult to solve a straight speed buff starts to obsolete minmatar kiting ships as most minmatar kiting ships have low ehp and rely on speed to survive i personally believe it should be a challenge to land that scram on people in a blaster boat but once you have your opponent scrammed it should be difficult to leavethis could be solved by making a gallente ship the fastest inside scram range so that its actually dangerous to get into scram range of a blaster boat and you cant just try a duke it out with them as you can nowgeddon vs mega example againfor the damage and tracking increases an increase equivalent to one free mag stab would be good this would mean that blasters have a clear advantage in the dps stakes im not too sure what would be best as an actual number increase for the tracking as i have to admit am not to sure of the tracking formulaedit tried to edit out any spelling errors
i agree with you that minmatar are highly overpowered in this regard but the other issue is the problem of having your mwd shut down once that happens youre also dead as youve either got to fit an ab slow or slowly make it back to the gate death prior to the mwd mechanics change id have agreed with you but blaster ships are slow and catching your prey is hard when everyone else is fasteri am strictly talking solo pvp a while ago i was flying around and got caught by a gang consisting of a vaga two inties a dictor and another ship or two i cant remember the vaga flew off in hull i waited for my timer and jumped through the gate id come i held my cloak and waited for my shields to recharge a little and mwd back to the gate the inties pointed me and i slowly made my way back to the gate all the while being shot at then i jumped through again had i been in anything but a drake id have been dead long before id made it to the gate the first timeits impossible to try this with any other ship let alone a gallente one caldari may do little dps but their ridiculous tank and their ability to fly at full speed is simply incrediblefor solo pvp i would either fly a drake incredible tank or a zealot range and dps why shouldnt i be able to fly a diemost i want to have the ability to fly a deimos without it being a diemost this is why i want to see ranges increase or something else done that will allow me to hit a target from range without worrying that i will be in pod by the time a single shots hit the hostile maybe its not so much the guns that need be changed but the ammo i dont know but when a zealot can hit at 30 and a cerb can hit at 90 lolmissiles you have a problem do i even need to mention minmatar even at the height of the nanogotry era not many flew gallente they were useless even then deimos or nano zealot hard choice therei was just thinking increasing gun range wouldnt hurt or make arties or acs obsolete simply due to the fact that they can swap ammo
increasing gun range to that of lasers and projectiles would obsolete projectiles whether they can select damage type or not as you would have more dps and better tracking as hybrids have a large optimal the only reason it wouldnt obsolete lasers is because they have scorch and scorch is awesomethe ability to switch damage type whilst a handy things prior to fights if you dont have the right damage type in then you have to live with it as swapping during fights is rarely worth itedit no where in my post did i mention minmatar being overpowerededit 2 increasing the range of blasters to that of lasers or projectiles only serves to make this game more uniform and removes the traits that make the guns unique from each otheralso lasers are better at range than projectiles
increasing gun range will never obsolete other close weapons systems but will make gallente pilots use their racial gunsthis will only make megas fit blasters to fight instead of autocanons whenever the pilot has understood that autos in a mega is pwnmobile like while with blasters hes easykillmailmobiletry it youll get addict fast and even more with shield buffer wich well agree its the true nature of gallente race use autocanons and shield tank or not
please yesespecially when all you can do is trash the thing anyway
oh god yes please also turn the notification mails off when docking in a pod
what a great idea please implement this ccp and save us all from the endless n00b ships
in a day and age of interstellar ships the ability to not share data between them especially at close range seems rather silly the whole process of having to copy bookmarks to cans in space for your corpalliance mates to be able to get them is convoluted laggy opening a can full or bms takes anything from 30 to 60 seconds and not really up to scratch for wspace usersmy suggestion is the implementation of a central repository read new screen with lots of nice buttons and lists one for corp and one for alliance that members with scanningscouting role new role to be implemented can add and remove bookmarks to this can be accessed from any station or pos perhaps a new module for the pos that needs anchoring and onlining and members can then click update bookmarks or something similar instantly all their bookmarks are updated to the latest instead of having to take them from a can then copy them back for the next personpeople with the correct roles can remove old bookmarks and add new ones to the repository the repository could know when they were last updated and when the player last updated and a notification could appear when the repository is opened letting the player know new bookmarks are availablein addition ships can trade bookmarks with each other or simply select several bookmarks and then send to ships within certain range 50km perhaps those ships then get a popup saying someone is sending them bookmarks do they want to accept if so the new bookmarks appearthe current method is either poorly coded or is responsible for a disproportionate amount of load on the servers for the cans to take so long to open not only would this make things easier for people it will save server power
even if you can see any negitive things to say about it please show your support for it  tyvm
in the case of pos anchored simply to tie up a moon for future use or the lolz you idea does nothingget notification  toggle online  23 more months of blissmakes sense for legitimately abandoned pos but in that case a month is too short i have had real life commitments and dubious internet availability that lasted significantly longerreduce ehp of offline poss to a level where a couple of bs can drop it in 4560 minutes declare war on owner he is not around anyway   remove tower  salvage modules  put up your ownsolves your problem as well as countless other issues related to offline poss
the point of this is to not just take the modules but to take the factionnormal tower as well and as for having to just have it online if you take it thats were the other options come in since all you can do to it is empty it and unanchor it it also forces the owner to either take it down or keep it fueled i just dont want an expensive kill mail and not get the tower thats all
really this is not needed the existing site works well in a modern mobile browser i wish the android market was not stuffed with so many of these redundant 1 website in an app apps
an app is not necessarily needed i think but eve gate and the forums could be programmed in a way so they can adapt to mobile phones browsers
like other have said a compatible browser could be sufficientbut having an app dedicated to eve gate like facebook app on smartphones could be also interesting1
after writing a post about a possible implementation of strategic frigate iv got a lot of support wich lead me to take my idea a step further and propose it to the csmoriginal threadthe idea is simplecreate t3 frigate that can be customized the way of a t3 cruiser can bewe know that t3 cruiser can tank and dps like a bs or near to then t3 frigs could tank and dps like a normal cruiser they would not be overpowered cause they still have a limitation in pg and cpu wich remind that a frig has limitationto see such idea implemented we would need to see new skills to be added as wellin the original thread i were thinking about small subsystem skill a counterpart of standard one but wich have the same requirements the difference is that the small skills is cheaper of course and lead to the understanding of subsytems used in strategic frigate constructionfrigate lvl 5 would be also a requirementan other idea to make strategic frigate more skill intensive would be to make assault ship covert op interceptor and electronic attack ship trained to at least lvl 1skills related to production would need to be added as well there could be skills related to small t3 subsystems construction hull construction but also invention and reverse engineering why make new skill for these this is surely not an obligation as i think strategic frigate should be implemented whatever the skills needed for their production but if we add specific skill for their production we could make them easier to train than t3 cruiser so if a t3 frigate would still be difficult to produce at least it would be easier than a t3 cruiser this would lead to consequence like new producers who will be interrested in t3 manufacturing once they will have started in t3 frig they will surely want to continue with t3 cruiser this will make t3 frigates less expensive than t3 cruiserwhat is also important to think is the hypothetical i know material requirement needed in t3 frigates construction we must make sure that t3 frigate price would be proportional to t3 cruiser price t3 frigates should be an investment not something we buy every day i imagine that t3 frigate should be the most expensive frigate more than pirate faction and maybe more than tier 3 battleship but price are determined by the market who may change instantly so for that reasons we must look into the material req more carefullyis there any advantage to this give new player a midterm goal to achieve give them a reason to continue playing t3 frigates have the new player in their aim t3 frigate would be less skills intensive than t3 cruiser but offer the same degree of customization only at a smaller scale the scale of a frigate even older player like to hangs around in frigate so it would be the perfect toy to add in the game reward player who invest in frigate skillinga lot of player skill t2 frigates cause they are a req for t2 cruiser implementing a t3 frigate would lead these player who maybe doesnt have the isk to have a t3 cruiser to invest in t3 frigates also it would gives player who prefer frigates in combat a more usefull role in fleet fight as well in small gang warfare sandbox for t3 cruisert3 cruiser are a major investment in a pods pilot life t3 frigates would permit carefull player to see what subsystems works well with their style of play let industrial a chance to start in t3 productionwith a easier to make t3 end product industrials will maybe think it could be a good idea to start t3 production i think about small corporation or small alliance that maybe doesnt have the means to make t3 cruiser better gaming experiencet3 frigate would be the little brother of t3 cruiser it would add a lot of surprise in any fight as 2 t3 frigates can be fitted in a myriad of different ways
sorry for the long postso is there any disadvantageyes of course but none that cant be take care oft1 frigate fight vs t3 frigate unbalancedt3 frigates would tank and dps like cruisers so obviously it would be difficult for a t1 frig to win a fight vs a t3 frigits not a major issue when we know that t2 frigate and cruiser are also overpowered compared to their t1 counterpart its also normal that a ship that require a lot of investment in term of skilling and isk gets the better hand in case of an engagement and teamwork is the key of success like t3 cruiser are destroyed every day at gate camp or trap or fleet fight t3 frigates would be much more vulnerable to these tacticst3 frigates price expected to be higheven if we plan to give a midterm goal to new player price of these new ships would require a lot of farming missioning or whatever you do to have isk the good point in it is that we will see this ship in specific rUFFFDle only like pve pvp as tackler dps or bait and not in overall useso if a player decide to do piracy with his t3 frigate he can but he will not find very funny to be tackled by a inty and destroyed by an ast3 frigates vs faction cruiser espescially pirate facim not talking about an eventual fight but about the market what will happen to faction cruiser price does player will overlook them in favor of t3 frigatesome of them surely but flying a frig is different than a cruiser most player who prefer cruisers will stick to faction cruiser also faction cruiser are a way less skills intensive that t3 frigates would beso my post come to an end as i think i give many reason to why we should implement t3 frigatecustomization is what really matter in eve fitting subs etcif you want to debate the subject fell free to go in the original thread linked in the first post if you have already make up your mind post it here and feel free to add to this or explain why its not a good idea
theres really not much use for a t3 frigatewhat is the point of flying around a t3 frigateits a nice ideaand as a pilot of smallsized ships i dont mind the idea but i really dont see a point or any motivation for ccp to make a t3 frigatewhywell we have assault ships we have interceptors etcthey are all already focused on specific roles its great to have a customizable frigate to do certain jobs just like a t3 however you have to realize if that frigate gets hitits instant pop keyword on ifthen it wouldnt be so newb friendly anymore asfirst of all afs run at around 1015m and faction frigs 20msoa t3 frig wud have to be priced around 3050mat that price the battlecruiser would be a way better option and way more usefulkeep in mind that many t3s are used for ratting and jewingtheyre not used as often in fleet battles etcwith a t3 frig you cant rat in thatand most likely you wouldnt want to take it out on a fleet battleroam considering the fact that others who use regular t2 frigs arent missing out too much on the bonusesits a great idea and your argument about helping out newbs is enticingi just dont feel a need
i do feel a need from interdiction nullifier alone that plus frig size and lower cost is just perfect those residing deep within the blue ass of alliances need to be less comfortable
the frigate range is already completely saturated theres over 60 different frigate class ships in game and only maybe a third of them are actually useful introducing a further range of t3s into this would only make the problem worse
there is indeed a lot of frigatei dont know if only the third are usefull but i know that a t3 would surely beplease clarify how a t3 frig would make the problem worse what problem and how worse
good
i dont think there would be gazillions crap designs since the creation of the item would require a knowlege of the software and could be pre vetted as suggested above by csm or a player elected board it is rather more likely that noone would take the time or effort to design anything at all
i vote yes and demand my own sex toy shop in incarna
make another incursion spawn the moment an old one ends instead of after an odd number of hours since they spawn at odd hours instead of downtime anyway there shouldnt be any technical limitations preventing this
my alt will be less visually boring
yeah sure but its a bit hard to find enough distinctive hues for each roid type
this has been suggested before put to the csm passed and i believe presented to ccp who i think really liked the ideahowever ccp havent implemented it yet i dont know why as i cant see why it would take much to do probably an hour of work at the mostbut supported to get it pushed through sooner
at the moment when you go to specific constellations in 00 dont know if there are any in lowhigh sec you get a pop up about gas cloudsthere is no way to turn these pop ups offif you leave in a region with them you will get those pop ups every time you go through the constellation yes after 1 time we know it is thereif you dont know about it you can get caught with your pants down on gates because of the pop up message yes we killed people because they warped to the close planet then to the gate landing before they can even click ok on the message no chance for themtldrgive us an option to turn these gas cloud messages off

tell me more about these extremely valuable gas clouds
extremely valuable gas clouds have been discovered in the nether regions of various peopless pants while the serpentis corporation has quickly moved to take advantage of these clouds ore has already claimed them as part of its territory hurf blurf durf extremely valuable gas clouds
extremely valuable gas clouds have been discovered in the pegasus constellation which have created a gold rush it was quick to claim ownership as the constellation borders its sovereign space but the goons and test as well as multiple entrepeneurs from the cluster coalition have all claimed their own piece of the pie inevitably collisions have occurred and the constellation has become a sort of warzone between various groups of greedy claimants

if ccp accept just part of this ideas it will be great to be gallente again
you need to have l5 agents in low sec thats part of the riskreward theory the game works onif you expanded the number of regions that had l5 agents in them all you would be doing is making even more areas populated by gank fleets
it was a mistake to add them take them off
why was it a mistake
i have a better idea why dont ccp just give you free kms
never mind the all seeing eye that is local to start for one it takes actual effort to scan someone down that is good unfortunately it takes zero effort to find out if someone is scanning for youyou simply hit the scan button and you instantly know if they are or not at least before you had to scroll through a list of everything to search for the probesnow it is simply too easy to avoid being probed downand no this is not some whine that i want kills to line up for me that argument is simply edremove the ability to add scan probes to the overview and make the prey at least put forth some ing effort to know if they are being probed
or you can put forth some effort to get kms instead of whining about not being spoonfed
probing people down is stupidly easybasically you want to return us to the days of having no filter on the overview this is stupidly frustrating and just bad game designif you are clever like a good hunter should be you can still catch people pretty easily with probes
whaaai am a pirate whaaapirating is too hard whaaatake away local so i am invincible whaaapeople can tell when i am scanning them whaaawhy cant i instapop people without them ever knowing i was coming whaaai thik i have made my point
you do realize that probes could be added to the overview manually before in fact any item in space can be added to the overview if you know the item code
youre never going to satisfy everyone with changes made to the game but marconus i think youre in the minority i for one approve of being able to select probes in the filter list
in my opinion it is truly horrible that you cannot determine what standings another corp or alliance has toward youi was asked by another alliance to set them blue in exchange for blue with ours i complied but i have no way of verifiying if theyve done it or not i cant tell if someone has set us red eitherim aware that eve is built on player interactions and that they deliberately make parts of the game require trust but in my opinion this is ridiculous
create your alliancecant see any reason to blue some corp just like that trust is like respect you must deserve it and not be given without reasonwhats the next step ask you access to your assets

im in awe by the eloquent and professional presentation of your proposal you werent satisfyed with just writing a few lines of barely coherent ramblings like some lesser plebeian oh no you went the extra mile and worked out all the fine details of your proposal in advance so your idea would have no chance to be ignored or ridiculed in any way your masterful analysis of all the prons and cons of this idea is so extensive and thorough that it has left us with nothing to talk about i truly wept tears of joy after witnessing such an exquisite display of the prowess of the human intellect your proposal is perfectly balanced and has no possible negative affects on current gameplay you sir are an intellectual giant that makes the rest of us unworthy to even lick your boots im left speechless and can only humbly bow before a culmination of human excellence such as youyour fan 4ever dsq
oki dont know who else has seen thisi just want to bring it upcause its been ing me offive been seeing this game all over the place advertisedand i looked at it
wrong forumdont careeve is still 1
this on all three counts
any other space based game is clearly a copycat because space sim starts and ends with eve

what is this i dont even

so until this point you basically do the same as in my own proposal you count the kill right price from insuranceif escrow price is calculated from hull insurance will cover the loss and escrow price will be exploitedif escrow price is calculated from item loss pirate will get the loss of the items covered by escrow price
hirana yoshida and kepakh are obviously having a filibusterfor those of you eve kiddies that dont know what a filibuster is its when a legislator talks a bill to death by consuming all the debate time with absolute gibberishi cant even make out what theyre saying and im following the thread closelyas far as i can tell they are trying to fix an absolute price for killrights whyheres another scenario to consideri create a new character im totally bored and im just roaming around the eve universe looking for anything i havent seen before in some system i come across a pilot named chribba fascinated i begin to orbit him at 1000m after a few minutes of this he becomes frustrated and sets off a smartbomb my velator is destroyed instantedim supposed to sell the killrights for chribba for the price of a velator hull plus insurancewhat formula could you ever possibly come up with that could calculate the value of killrights on chribba if chribbas corpse is worth millions that im sure killrights on him are worth twice that muchand im sure there are quite a few people in the game whose killrights would also sell for a hefty amount if a ganker kills someone then rushes to the killright market to buy up any killrights on him that would mean that the system has value which would drive up the prices for killrights it would be something for the person selling the killright to take into consideration unlike the current system where putting a bounty on someone is the same as giving that person money selling a killright doesnt put money into the gankers pocket gankers buying their own killrights before anyone else can is not a problem
is reading too hard for you
sometimes reading is hard for example heres what you say the weakness i see is that pirate can generate his own kill rights by killing alts and selling acquired kill rights on the market this idea causes you to put forward the idea that the only way to prevent this abuse is to have the price of a killright determined by the hull of the destroyed ship is that correct have i understood you thus farlets take an infamous literal look at what you just said the weakness i see is that pirate can generate his own kill rights by killing alts and selling acquired kill rights on the market you said that a pirate some underhanded eve player would kill alts and generate his own killrights that is killrights on himself over and over and over again and sell them on the marketok maybe what you meant to say was that a pirate some underhanded eve player would create an alt and let that alt kill him over and over and over again and then sell the killrights on that alt i dont think this would be a problem either though supposedly there were people who would scam the old insurance system by blowing themselves up over and over again however the insurance system was dumb dumb in the sense that it didnt think if someone came into the insurance office with a destroyed battleship claim the insurance officer didnt say things like hey werent you just in hereusing an alt to kill you and then selling those killrights on the market wouldnt be such a big problem that youd do something moronic like fix the price of a killright to the hull of the ship destroyed because there would be people humanbeings thinking feeling humanbeings watching and using this systemif the market had killrights available for a player named test dummy and that player was less than a day old or had a full page of killrights on him who would buy those kill rightsmaybe some other mechanic could be used for example this forum alt of mine has no sp because hes an alt on my main account perhaps ccp could include a mechanic that prevents killrights of toons with less than a certain amount of sp from being sold on the market similar to what other games do to keep goldspammers out of general chat impose a level requirementperhaps another mechanic could be used for example a graph or chart of that kept track of the number of times a killright had been sold on a character like test dummy and the number of times those killrights had actually been satisfiedor other similar information could be used to help an experienced player make a wise choicelet the market determine the value of a killright and dont tell me i have to sell killrights on chribba for the price of a velator hull plus insurance
why would anyone care if people sold killrights on themselves i dont see why that would be a problem unless theyre also going to pay significant sums as bounty then the only people who will be interested in buying those killrights would be people who have some other motivation to kill the selleri dont see why this would be a problem for anyone
unfortunately youve mixed two related ideas and one completely unrelated idea into the one topictest server  everyone must face and share the same risks i can log on to the test server you can log on to the test server everyone can log on to the test server how is this situation not the same for everyone the test server is required to get a better idea of how well patches will perform on tranquility and investigate issues with the current code so it is absolutely required rather than scrapping the test server ccp need to make it easier to get on to it as a result of this i will not be supporting your topicpermanent kill rights  sounds like a reasonable idea but tbh people will just end up with a huge list of kill rights that they never look at plus what if the target has turned over a new leaf reformed their behaviour and become a saint since the kill rights were awarded i cant support this ideacontractable kill rights  this is a good idea especially as an auction but it would allow exploitation in the same way the current bounty system does if you sell kill rights on me whats to stop me using an alt to collect the reward and without a reward whats the pointproperly thought through contractable kill rights could work but i cant support this thread
it wouldnt be a problem if somebody would pay me to get rights to kill me i would be glad to sell those
make kill rights disappear when they are used you get killed or when you buy them back you pay money to the victim
yes i bet obviously i asked too much from youthreadimo the bounty system as such will never work but if you find some reasonable and nonexploitableaka pirates cannot profit from it it will be fun for both sides  hunters and hunted
gw is focusing on their 3 core games right now and even lord of the rings is in something of a lull at the moment while they wait for the hobbit theyre not even offering any real support for their 2ndline games like epicarmageddon battlefleet gothic and mordheim lord of the rings is the only time that the modern incarnation of gw has taken on someone elses ip and i doubt theyd spring for a setting with a much smaller popular appeal like eve has especially as gws current business strategy seems to be to spread their own ip to other markets see the ultramarines movie and warhammer onlinedark millenium online a smaller tabletop gaming company might go for it thoughi will say that its a shame the battleship models available in the evestore are so out of scale with the battlefleet gothic models
i think there is an easy way to make eve bigger and to break up the power blocs make session timers 5 minutes instead of 30 seconds make capital drives and jump portal generators spool up to something like 30 minutes before jumping with the increase in travel time there wont be 30 minute responses half way across the galaxy anymore
you must be plain stupid how about more solar systems
eve already has far too much waiting around for things to happen adding a vastly increased delay to every stargate and jump drive activation is crazymay as well have named the thread make eve boringer
wanting to break up powerblocks i understand but this is not the waynot supporting thisgo find some of the better ideas like making standings cost isk to alliances and corps 1st one 1 mil 2nd 10 3rd 100 etc etc that was the geral idea for both positive and negative
that is also plain stupid tbh
well increasing session timers will change a few things it means that when someone jumps into you they can no longer burn back to the gate when going through systems you have to wait 5 minutes before you change systems so when you go into a system youll have to warp to a safe and keep warping around or youll get scanned down and killed depending on the ship of course no more undocking and redocking without consequence im not saying your ship should be invulnerable for 5 minutes keep that at 30 seconds im saying by increasing regular travel time you make travel more meaningful the increase or spool up time for capitals is just a way to make sure people dont circumvent the increase in travel time by just taking titan bridgesi was just thinking by taking an action and having to commit to it without the safety net of burning back to the gate or redocking or having the ability to jump from one part of the galaxy to another in such short periods of time would really make the projection of power a lot more meaningful
no that is not plain stupid what is stupid is adding even more delays to a game that is already slow and unresponsive
well yes that is stupid but adding more solar systems is also stupid just gives the large powerblocks more space to install pets and macros
thats just stuuuupiiiiiiiiiidwhat about traders and logisticsit would take them hours to move stuffit would make not lucrative enough to move stuff around so only one manufacturing and trading hub per region maybe nothing in ls and nulls or horrible price increase since it would be even more dangerous to go there it would mean no more smallsize pvp fleet too no more roaming etc
good idea
change it so it doesnt look like a more moneys for cpp plox page
having flown with him in the past i believe that he has the charisma and education to make a difference on the csmin regards to the bots currently plaguing eve i believe that in order to combat the sickness effectively you must alter the dynamics of how a bots successfully function such as changing the static nature of asteroid belts to be more akin to gravimetric sites or adding a heat element which turns the mining lasers off at random intervals things that would add degrees of variability whilst not causing much more inconvenience to the active player while these are not the complete answers paving the way for much needed discussions and not trolling on the topic of bot prevention will help lead to an answer in the future my contemplations aside vote ripard teg for csm6
other than the people who run them who isnt jk seriously if the bot problem were easy it would have been solved long agoi agree with you and id love to hear suggestions on both how to deal with bots or how the csm could bring additional pressure on ccp on this issue im glad to hear you think the one suggestion i have in this area has some merit thats one way i think bots can be combated by addressing the motivation i know that chaining bots are one of the most popular types i agree with both you and dirk that it doesnt address basic ratting bots or mining bots or any other type of bot but you have to start somewhere one of your own suggestions was to evolve the pve content to make it harder to automate and i think thats also a good idea though a lot more complicated from a dev standpointim not sure i believe that ccp has a magic wand that would eliminate bots that they can use but they just choose not to id want to see some evidence of that but try me im willing to be convincedid love to hear player suggestions on how to address it i think thats the key role the csm can play on this one is collecting player ideas and putting them before ccpthanks redempt ltns your support means a lot to me
you dont solve the bot problem by just starting somewhere they will just move away to another part of the game if you can crack mining bots they will move to ratting or market bots or invent some other way to make money with bots you need to crack down hard on all forms of botting and cheating a full blown assault nothing else is going to dimminish the bot problem ccp banning ppl for 23 hours for instance is not a full blown assault ive been researching the bot issue a bit lately and it seems that that is your basic punishment for running a bot if you get punished in the first place yup thats really gonna stop the major 00 alliances and rmtraders running their bots
ho and ripard i just want to say im not here to pick on you specifically or something im just an average joe who is miffed about all the botting while im trying to play the game fairly its just that the average csmmembercandidate is either clueless about botting doesnt care or is completely fine with it of course nobody will admit to that last part but tons of ppl are fine with it cuz they do it themselves or profit from them indirectly cuz it funds their alliances for instance alliances dont even have to run them themselves renting out space to botters and turning a blind eye i had no idea honestly is also profiting from them
just so you know this issue is not being ignored by the csm or ccp at this moment there is ongoing discussion in the internal csm forums about the problem of botting as always we are encouraging ccp to communicate with the community on the matter it is clear they plan to do so while it may be comforting for some to see weve got it covered messages in dev blogs ccp clearly wants to provide more meaningful information than that to reassure the community about actions it is taking messages of that type require a certain amount of progress on various fronts to happen first sojust know the issue of botting is not being ignored and csm6 will hopefully be able to continue the discussions productively
well i still want to know the vision of csm members on how to combat botting and how much of an effort they want ccp to make there is a big difference between a gm sometimes banning bots for 1 day when they get petioned by players and ccp actively hunting them down and making software changes on a regular basis to twart bottingwhen i hear alliance members admitting they use bots and shrug off petitions cuz you only get a 24 hour ban at worse anyway and they wont touch your other accounts that sure as hell does not sound like ccp has things covered theyve got  covered and to the general public it even looks like they more or less condone botting hell id be surprised if not at least some ccpemployees are turning a blind eye on purpose andor are linked to bottingrmt themselves they are only human and emotions like greed and envy live in all of us and the lack of communication on the issue is disturbing too i imagine if ccp released numbers on the impact bots are having on the economy public outcry would be tremendous still we deserve to know stuff like that
truth 4 csmcampaign website  wwwtruth4csmwordpresscoma little about mei am a 26yr old married with one child living in the lake district in the uki have been playing eve for nearly 7 years now and have experienced pretty much every aspect of the game from 00 alliance warfare and politics to wormhole exploration and market tradingi came across eve after i stopped playing another well know internet spaceship game freelancer and although i have taken the odd break from eve over the last 7 years eve has defiantly always been at the center of my desktop and will continue to do so for as many years as long as they keep the servers up or till they blow upwhy i love eveonlinemost of my family and freinds those who dont play eve have said to me many many times over the years are you still playing that game havent you completed it yet once i have got my head out if my hands i try and explain why i love eve so muchthe fact that their is no end game some say it is being in a top pvp corp in the largest alliance in game some say it is having massive wealth but simply their isnt one i have missioned mined pvped etc and still i go back to those things from time to time to do them as a kind of break from what ever my main focus in on at the time the fact that eve is a massive place where even tho everything is pretty much the same through out each system the community make is so vastly different and you never quite know what will happen when you jump the next gate or undock from a stationthis will be the first time i run for csm so i am a bit apprehensive about the response i will get from the public but i feel that i can give something back to the community after playing for so long so have a look at my website for more information on what i will be doing as csmthank you for taking the time to view this post and my websiteeve truth
the csm has repeatedly asked ccp to iterate on it we discussed in june the many problems fw faces sov gainloss is meaningless contesting sov is boring and opaque fw pvp activity has no effect on sov fw missions have no effect on sov and moreoverall ive always had the impression that to make fw ccp rolled a katamari damaci ball through the game design department and just implemented whatever stuck to it theres no synergy between the various fw gameplay elements no overall purpose to fw and a lot of gameplay that is needlessly boring capture timers etcunfortunately fw does not seem to have a very high priority while dust and incarna are being rolled out i did get the sense that there is real willingness to iterate on fw but only after theyve finished rolling out dust and incarna and  as oveur said  go back over the older gameplay systems and iterate where needed so fw iteration may happen but not any time soonif you feel ccp should put more effort on it sooner vote for a csm candidate who you think will best bring that message to ccp
fw was actually one of the best things ccp has ever done it is the only thing they ever did to actually promote small gang pvp through the plexing systemthe idea was players would pvp in plexes and lose ships how would they get isk to replace them they could no longer do afk missions in high sec because of the war dec so they developed fw missions fw missions need to be balanced between the faction no doubt caldari can apparently solo in sb and that is too easy for amarr you need 2 ships or at least a bc to run level 4s but other than tweaking that ccp successfully made a whole new type of low sec mission system  successfullythe only thing that is really broken are the occupancy plexing mechanics yes that is a big one i agree why no action well first of all players disagree about allot of things some players want fw to put even more emphasis on shooting red crosses others want fw to be more about pvp some players want there to big consequences to occupancy others tend to see that will just lead to everyone joining the winning team yes we all agree that if the post downtime spawn mechanic is bad this needs to be fixed and i think this has has been passed by csm but the mechanics of how you most efficiently do plexes will remain the same the rats will still be a huge disincentive to pvp for the vast majority of pvpers in eve the other militia still wont know where you are plexing some people dont mind taking rat damage while they pvp and they do get good fights in plexes but most people think pvp while tanking rats sucks in sum even if ccp implemented everything the csm proposed people still wouldnt plex it would still be a mainly pve activity players simply have not gotten on board as to what they would like to see that would really benefit plexxing
they have we have there was a furor of discussion in the first year of fw where all the rp pvp and plexing parties participated  eventually it just dawned on us that the small bugfixes is all we are going to get for a long time and people stopped caringgoes back to the new  more customers vs better  happier customers ccp has started leaning heavily in favour of the almighty dollar so improvements on existing gameplay is forever stuck on the soon list
it is not a problem and of all the csm candidates i should be the most worried i am too pretty also due to the importance of csm removing the anonymousness from it is critical to its success i do not approve
i feel that all csm runners should have to post a picture attached to their name as well to prevent fat ugly chicks from winning just because they are femalelol
this man has vision
my questions are simple how do you vote for csm candidates i have seen some of the candidates posts but very few the process seems like random luck if you happen to find information about candidates since its mixed in with everything else just as importantly how do you vote does it get its own thread is it off on a third party site when can you vote
voting isnt open yetccp will announce the final list of candidates and a week later open up voting via the website
voting will take place in the csm section of the main navigation bar on the left under csmcandidates normally people dont start campaigning heavily until after everyones been annoucedyou will get a list in random order of the people you can vote for once theyve shortened the list of illegal candidates youll see their name with their character portrait and a short campaign message  their url and once the voting opens youll be able to click to vote for them straight from that same page although it usually takes you to a are you sure pagethe following not safe for work image will help with the datesyoursserious
being involved in a current hisec war in which our aggressor corporation is using neutral reppers as part of there strategy i can attest that the neutral reppers do not become red to us and have petitioned ccp about this fact that we have no recourse in this matterhere is a quote which i cannot give the author or who the author may or may not work for or when it was written by rules of this forumi am afraid that this is currently working as intended when a neutral aids your wt you will become flagged to him but he will not become flagged to you until he fires on youi have to say this is very disturbing on many levels1 why on earth would i the non aggressor become flagged to the neutral repper and not the other way around it is their choice to enter the war as such there should be a consequence for their choice of action2 i do not know any logistics pilot that has mounted a weapon or even carries combat drones thus they will never fire upon anyone3 if ccp is considering warships fit with remote reppers then this to should be considered as an act of war by the pilot beginning to repair one side or the other they should get the same concord alert as any other non sanctioned act of aggressionare you sure you want to commit this act it they select yes then they should be held accountable just like any other act either by concord as normal or becoming red flashy to the other side of war not being repped this can last for the normal aggression timer of 1215 minutes or for say 24 hours or the equivilant of kill rights for example 4ccp cant possibly continue to say it is to hard to fix this issuethey can add new really cool content which proves their true capabilitiesand we the players must join together with one voice and say fix these old annoying issues first pleasesome of you may comment i am just another ceo who is whinning about an unfair game mechanics i tell you i am voicing a truth in that this mechanics does not fit in any part of eve online conceptpiracytheftcorporate espionage etc all have a posibility of recourse from the players who was the target of the offense in this case the neutral reppers are in essence just like all the other games invulnerability cheat codes which to a true gamer is weak at best to use and frowned upon
highsec fifteen minutes do you really think you are going to get more pvp out of thatnumber of actual engagements will drop like a stone and be replaced with insane amounts of logonbait ganks  that is not pvpneutral rrat least it would mean they disappear completely but is that how an openended game is supposed to be draconianequate remote assistance with everything else done remotely like shootingjammingetc solves pretty much all issues regarding neutral rr if they are used in highsec concord removes them for you no charge docking range would be much better if ranges were normalised even if it means losing the few kickout stations that exist  most stations should be borderline kickout with just enough buffer to account for loadlagties in with the highsec entry in that reducing the docking range makes a successful bump exceedingly easy making changes to docking timers irrelevantwraith remove the gm blurp it is against the posting rules
oh that looks better than the new versioncan i have one 
i approve
not as ridiculous as asteroids that are mined to nothing yesterday reappearing tomorrow thats unarguably totally unrealistic so we had better ask ccp to stop that as well heck we could even put it in the same proposal who wants to write this one up

i agree the current font sizes in eve are not sufficient they are to smalli would very much agree that they need to be of a font size that will be easyier for the ganers to read i also have reading difficulties even with the largest font size currently avaiable in evethank you
i dont even need a whole new font just fix those letters that you cant tell apart just put a slash through the zero and im happy

at a minimum blasters need a tracking boost there is not a single situation in which a mega outdamages a tempest or geddon beyond 12km yet there are plenty where those same ships out damage it under 12kmi can accept super limited range if that limitation comes with an advantage in applied dps at that range pretty much all a laser or projectile boat needs to do to minimize your dps advantage is stop moving then your massive dps advantage comes down to about 50dpsas far as im concerned blasters should have sufficient tracking to hit a similar sized target from 0optimal perfectly at realistic traversal and it should definitley always hit better than acs or pulses at those rangesyeah i get it nightmarex a really good pilot can make blasters work against a crappy pilot a really good pilot can make industrial work in combat against a crappy dramiel that doesnt make an industrial a combat ship blasters make a hell of a lot of sacrifices cap usage ammo consumption reload timelimited damage type range for little or no advantages and thats just broken
whenever you can see the return of ccps about this matter well yes getting tired of mass useless devs blogshas sisi deleted im ok to be there if i win something usefull in tq like blastershybridsgallente ships fix some sp or just possibility of reallocation of some sp but since feedback is useless better spend 15min playing any freee fps than spend time on that useless server for useless feeedback resulting in useless decisions that will need patches a few days latter and keep issues like those mentioned in thisother related threads unsolved

gallente supposed to be the advanced drone using race give damage upgrade modulesrigs for normal drones too not for just sentries
this and increased pg across the board for gallente
this sounds perspective either way most gallente subcapital boats are in deep ass in nowdays big fleet combat opses gallente have perfect capitals their small ships are good as well but middle classes and bss need some boost be it a speed boost or pg boost  doesnt matter in general i support this idea
lower mass does not help much blaster boats being kitied within scram rangethat is a reasoning behind base speed buff as it would help blasters the most to fight within their weapon range
increasing range would be a bad idea better to rebalance ammo a bit and reduce reload time so you can switch from am to something that can actually hit something more than a stones throw away in fact my proposal to to fix blasters would be increase tracking alot so you can actually hit a same sized hull for full damage out to optimal you already have a stupidly short range to work with why reduce it even further by cutting out the fist 20 of it next adjust the fitting requirements on hybrids they just take too much to fit a decent set of guns fit electrons and you lose the bulk of that great dps advantage you are supposed to get and you get even more pathetic range ideally a ship should be able to fit a full rack of 1st tier guns with a reasonable tank with low skill a rack of mid tier with a reasonable tank at high skill and a full rack of top tier guns with a good tank with perfect skills and max 1 fitting mod as noted before rebalance ammo and make it instant or really fast ammo change they are hybrid after all they already get disadvantages from their base systems capammo use as well as limited damage selection why not give them a single advantage from one quick ammo changereduce ammo size why does a 425mm round that requires no propellant take more room to store than 1400mm round that does lower cap use or at least lower cap penalties on ammo its a hybrid system not a pure energy system it should use significantly less cap than a laser system particularly since its meant to go with active tankschange the penalty on active tanking rigs nanopumps nonobot accelerators to something other than reduction in speed lower fitting requirements on active tanking mods particularly large armor reppers omg 2300pg for a lar2 thats just stupid particularly since you have fit 23 of the damned things to put out enough rep to be useful cut it in friggin half or boost the  out of the pg on gal bs hulls you can fit 3 1600mm plates and have room for a meta 4 heavy cap booster with the grid savings alone compared to a single lar2 hell do that alone and you might get away with leaving large hybrids alonerails hell i dont even know where to start there just doesnt seem to be a place for them in long range combat beams get the best dps while arties get the alpha they get slightly better optimal but by the time that starts to become an issue youre moving into warpable range really aside from alpha strike any range beyond 150km is useless
yeah i find this more annoying than the noobship itselfits always funny to see on next login youre flying a caldari station xxill say a pretty simple solution would be to be able to get a free noobship by hitting the help button  on the petition and co ui you add a line with ask for a noobshipwith a timer  number limit to avoid abuse
totally agree at least give us an option to turn them off
the only thing this solution will result in is the continued abuse of resource balances in favor of 00 space by the same tired group of good ol boys that have controlled it since day one a multibillion isk income with absolutely no effort breaks the system and you know it this in no way levels the playing field it just makes it easier for pilots in 00 to break the game even further not supported
i wanted to type something smart as an answer to the op but saw that it could all be said with two wordsnot supported
as far as 00 stations are concerned yes they should be destructible though for the exact same reasons why you cant use bubbles or doomsday in empire space this should be limited to 00 stations only supported
i support thisplayer structure should be destructibleand destructible station are an isk sink too couldnt hurt
the only problem are assets of inactive players who left expensive ships docked and quited eve for a few months they return and see that their 100500 fractionfitted tengus were destroyed with a station  what will they do quit eve most likely if ccp will somehow resolve this issue im sure there will not be any other reasons of not doing this change destructible outposts
this is going to be the biggest sticking point in the debate its less about the stations than it is about the stuff in the station theres no good rp reason for anything in a destroyed station to survive but there is good value in terms of player satisfaction and retention somove all player owned contents of the destroyed station to the players hanger area at the nearest 00 npc station active players inactive players current residents and residents in exile all corp assets are delivered as a single corporate delivery to the same station receivable per corp settingsresearch  manufacturing jobs are canceled and materials are lost bps from these jobs are delivered as part of the corporate delivery or to the players hanger as appropriateas posted earlier all those items can be destroyed by other means only the outposts are forever
forget destroying the stations let people loot the station after they take it over flipped the station all your base are belong to us all the ships fittings random junk are now lootable that is the way it should be if someone loses a station make it hurt
that also makes perfect sense within the scope of hardcore game ideals tho perhaps not 100 of the items should be found theres still the possibility of things being hidden or smuggled out so there should be some random chance of 75 lootingbut of course its too late to ask for such things now the ccp people who made this game are not the same people who manage it now the hardcore spirit is long gone and the carebears who are in charge would never accept such ideas
im not that sure this is the best way to improve the sharing of bookmarks but it definitely needs to be improved i do like the idea of corporation bookmarks that would be available to everyone in your corp to use and copy from but only people with a specific role can add edit and removeid like to include some easier way to trasnmit bookmarks to a neutral party too selling bookmarks or doing exploration for someone is unnecessarily painful because of how limited the bookmark transfer system is i dont mind it being limited to prevent mass bookmark copying but a limited number of bookmarks should be easily transferrable in a way that doesnt require both people to be online at the same time or visit a specific place

long story short we need thissupported

not sure if this is the best way to go about it but there def should be a faster way of removing ghost pos than assaulting them with a fleet its sort of absurd that there would still be fullyactive local defenses running on a structure thats been derelict for monthspersonally id love to see a mechanic where you can send marines to board the pos and get the salvage  and then play as the marines to fight whatever automated defenses remain its be a great use for incarna 
honestly in high sec the charters should continuously be consumed regardless of whether it is online or offline and once they are all gone the faction should come blow the tower up or the faction militia should be allowed to pop it
well for starters id hear way more whine about unprobeable shipsbut look at it this wayt3 cruisers take the advantages of a cruiser and give it the dps of a bs and highersoooo the question is do you really want a ship with all the advantages of a frig doing bc type damage t3 frig would need to be prenerfed in so many ways im not sure the end result would be recognizable as a frig would have to deal with its speed and sig at the very leaston the other hand a ship with a sig of 40 that goes 1kmsec with just an ab and does 500 dpsi do kind of want but how do you make it suck enough to not make every other ship in the game obsolete
i will not support this since it is inevitable that t3 frigates will be introduced to the game just as it is inevitable that t3 battlecruisers and battleships will be
priceiv heard many rumors but its difficult to say whats true and whats not i think that ccp must know if we want to see them
there have been 49 cruiser hulls in game not counting various rarities that arent available in mass quantities before they introduced 4 new t3 cruisersand unlike with the cruiser class there are quite a few roles that arent filled yet for example no logistic frigates no cloaky ewar frigates no gang booster frigates just to name a few so there are a few things that t3 frigates could do without stepping on the turf of existing ships like the t3 cruisers mainly did
10
t3 frigates ive been waiting for for a long long time ever since the introduction of strategic cruisers t3 gets used all the time for support roles i know that t3s are used as antifrigate platforms and commandships in black ops gangs the ability to put a cloakyinty through a bops bridge with out it being a bomber is a strategic advantage that i would gladly pay 50 mil for it might even make black ops more useful on there current platform as you wouldnt have to send a cruiser to do a frigates job1 and thanks for all the fishas a side note my personal belief is that ccp wont do a thing in the t3 field until someone cracks the secret of the sleepers see you in whiskeyspace
because the inevitable consequence of squeezing more frigate hulls into the range is that even more frigates will become outclassed were already seeing frigatelevel pvp boiling down to dramiels bombers interceptors and the occasional rifter or minmatar assault frigate with everything else left to spin in the station or used on gimmick ops to create amusing lossmailswhat the frigate class needs is a major reworking so that more of the existing hulls are worth bothering with so that assault frigates and electronic frigates are viable choices so that dramiels are nerfed down to a level where other faction frigates can get a look in and so that the t1 range is more closely balanced and newbies can be given advice other than crosstrain to minmatar fly a rifteruntil that issue is dealt with adding t3 to the mix and introducing a new range of superfrigs with the ability to outperform some of the already small number of viable pvp frigates and with the amount of customisation available some available combinations inevitably would do only deepens the existing divide
if anything t3 frigates should be strategic ideedcyno jammerability to scan ships while cloakedmany more things like thatetc
if the aim is to make a customizable frigate that is jack of all trades master of none do frigate types truly have enough roles among them that such a ship would be usefulif the aim is to make an expensive UFFFDberfrigate that beats everything else in its class no wayi could get behind more customization in fitting ships but not power creep for the sake of itself

not suporting this is in theory random right now and it should be sometimes is mornin sometimes its middle of the nightthats the gooooood thing
this idea is about introducing some new ships have the same role with the current shipsi got this idea on last time ccp changed the model of scorpion many people may feel better with the current one but i have some people prefer the former why cant we have bothrename the old scorpion with another bug slightly change the attributes andor bonus personally i dont have a favor on the old scorpion this is just an expample my suggestion is having some very popular ships to get an alternative each like raven drake dominix hurricane abadon maelstrom tempest megathron scorpion harbinger and so oni dont mean to add only t1 ships but have changes on the t2 system may need to have more considerationthe short of this idea would beexpanding the client and more calculating in the servercost in designthe advantages arethe starship contest could be a resource for the new modlesthe player designers would have more chance to have their design be in the game making the game more famousmore ships in the same race the same role will reduce the competition in the market therefore reduce the frequency people modify their ordersthe direct and obvious advantage people will have more choice to fly and and will get bored with a role slower makes the game more attractive
im a bit iffy about this especially since you referenced the recent contests as a positive example and most of them looked nothing like eve ships and certainly not like the current designs many eve ships are already iconic and i want strict limits on what kind of alternative designs would be available if this goes through i want the vexor to look like a vexor in all variations and not to have any other ship design use any vexor designs variations of the same ship are ofcourse excluded from this limitation but a totally different looking ship should not be able to use its name or attributesi dont want the appearance of a ship to be totally separated from its attributes and treated like a piece of cloth that you can change to something totally different than the original design it isnt realistic and cheapens the game and the ships these are industrially produced ships and so similar ships should have very similar hulls this is why i would prefer infinately more to have options to paint the ship with alternative color schemes it would bring a lot of variation to the existing ships without taking a huge crap on the current ship designs and game immersioni think ccp should be careful when thinking about catering to their customers whims in this manner some limited variation would be nice but if you make ship appearance freely changeable it cheapens eve and makes it feel like the universe is there just to cater to our every silly little whim instead of being a living breathing world where we are the ones who have to adjust to it and its rules not supported in any form unless the variations are truly variations of a single theme if you want entirely different desings for what would practically be identical ships then a definite do not want from meedit if you want entirely different ships for all those alternative designs it seems like a huge waste to not have proper roles for them in advance you cant just ignore the affects they have on gamebalance just implementing new ships with no plan will lead to a lot of trouble and you are forced to do that planning anyways afterwards since the new ships are either overpowered making old ships obsolete or underpowered making them a huge waste of dev time
when an alliance conquers a station they should be able to loot the stuff left behind in the station ships modules random junk this would require alliances to be able to close personal hangars as well as corp hangarslooting a station should be tied to the salvage skill as that seems to be a reasonable skill to tie it to sit outside the station and turn on the salvage module success allows the character to open the station like a can and the level of success from the salvage randomizer determines what kind of loot from a random closed hangar is accessible i dont know how the current salvage random generator works but i assume it is a random number generator and i assume it isnt just 0 or 1 with those assumptions in mind i think it would be sufficient to create different tiers of loot to pull out of the stationbenefits to this1 losing a station hurts more as it should in my opinion2 the conquerors will end up sitting around in ships outside the station for the next several days sucking the loot out of it this allows small gangs to gank people a much needed boost to small gang warfare3 capturing stations will have more strategic value4 discourages holding more stations than you have need for as dropping and flipping undefended stations would be much more common5 less docking games as people will have a strong reason to get out and defend their station

i like the proposed ui changes but not so much the warp in part directional scanning is not probing in that it gives you a players approximate direction not exact location still though this should be talked about by the csm supported
just to be clear the mechanic of directional scanner is the same the only difference is the visual help but if the target is moving fast or is in a safe which is not between 2 celestials the hunter will have to approach the target location at foot exactly like the target did to create the safespot there is not warpable bookmark or precise point given at anytime if you are skilled enough youll eventually land on the same grid as your targetsome pilot already hunt like this but without a visual help this is near to impossible to locate a target in a safe not between celestialsi see that as a counter to unprobable shipsmy two more cents
i like the idea of scaning cone i wanted something like this for some time now

low sec systems in every way need a re balancing in the value to risk ratio supported
and that was a really horrible design difficulty of avoiding of being scanned in particular and other gameplay elements in general always may be a subject for discussionbut mimicking gameplay difficulty with poor ui is one of the most stupid and lazy things to do
1 using a bad ui to introduce fake difficulty into a game is a terrible idea2 if youre at all competent at probing you only need one scan to get a 100 hit on any probeable target that gives your target a window of at most 10 seconds in which to spot your probes if you need multiple scans thats your problem isnt ita better change if you wanted to boost missionbusting would be to integrate the minimap indicator that shows the angle covered by your current dscan settings into the current system map to make it easier to judge distances and angles when your target is significantly above or below the plane

i will not copy and paste a unlinked urlcan anyone tell me whats the similarities of the games the op is talking about
i will not tell you to get linkification or your browser equivalent
i really do enjoy the like and hate we have going on 
so after reading some of the battlestar galactica online forums looking at screenshots watching the videos and reading the site itselfi fail to see how it is a cheap copy of eve in anyway at all aside from them being both space based they have nothing in common bsgo has far inferior graphic quality it uses a wasd control system it is more like wow in spacefrankly it looks like crapactuallyit looks about as interesting as watching flies eat  which doesnt surprise me since the show had pretty much the same entertainment value so in conclusion i do not think it is a copy of eve at allif you think that then any game based in space is a copy of eve and there were many others before eve that were based in space i seriously doubt they look up to eve for inspiration either no threat to eve at all
its a cheap browser based game it cannot even hold a candle next to eve
tldr the game is in space so it must be a copycat of eve
ive actually been checking this game out so i may be able to provide some insightive been scouting for a free spacebased mmo because within three months my eve subscription will unfortunately run out with no chance of reactivation in the near future i saw this and signed upits a beta so there were naturally many bugs along the way they just had an update today and it fixed a lot the combat is pretty fun actually the turrets dont use tracking like in eve but rather in order to fire the enemy ship must be within so many degrees of the bow of your ship and must be within a certain range preferably your optimal missiles are similar but unlike eve they wont fire if the enemy is too close which caused me to get meh because i like spamming missiles  so in a way if youre smart and orbit correctly just like in eve you can get under the guns of an enemy in pve this is fine but even then its difficult so kitingfacemelt dps ftw the combat also feels more realistic i suppose for a spacebased game in that you dont have an overview to tell you the distancespeedrads of a target youre given a general radar and must figure it out for yourself its very easy to misjudge an enemys position which in the depths of space id imagine is quite accurate eves ships are more user friendly you could sayone of the things about bsgo is that its very grindisheven more so than running l4s in hisec your ship needs fuel tlyium in order to jump from system to system and to use afterburners so youll find yourself mining quite a bit to get it oh and while on the subject of mining unlike eve where every asteroid is neatly labeled and you know it will contain whatever minerals you need you need to scan each asteroid to see if it even has resources at all and most asteroids dont so mining is not an afk activity but a grinding activity luckily once you venture into more dangerous areas of space it gets more interesting but thenso does evebsgo features a passive training system similarly to eve unlike eve though you actually need to grind for xp points which you then invest into training a skill up the bonuses are invariably a pathetic 1 per level but then i do believe you can train the skills to up to 10 or something not sureone of the things that is in very stark contrast to eve is how long it takes to get a new ship be prepared to stay in the same ship for quite awhile unless youre willing to shell out reallife money for cubits ingame currency but then if youre going to spend real money on an mmo why not make it eve so tldr theres similarities to eve but in some ways its quite a bit different if you have money to spend on an mmo play eve if youre a college student whos just ran out of money for eve such as myself you may find bsgo a satisfying substitute until you can get back to eve

there is no nerf in pi you just need to pay more attention to detail of how you set up your extractor nodes also  resources depleteif other people are mining the same node as you you will get diminished returnsbe sure to watch the returns on your program cycles and adjust the nodes accordingly so the far right side of the programs will have the highest bars for maximum outputyou do have to change your pi layout about once a week otherwise you wont get good returnsalso try doign the 2 planet thing 1 with just mining and doing tier 1 refines then shipping it to a new planet to do all factory work

janaren i played through the wotg expansion they did not destroy the economy with their measures a lot of the stuff they changed were things that injected a lot of gil into the economy and a lot of people banned were ones that were doing crazy things like having 20 alts and gardening grass to vend people buy haguns with money they earned from other means you still had a lot of gil entering from bcnm and other types of activities and you still could farm i was there the impact was not as bad as you said it was part of the reason copera was so bad was because se didnt catch gil sinks in time and a lot of the bans and changes were to prevent a recurrencei could bring up the hnm scene also and how allowing claimbotting led to a few shells dominating each server and stagnated it thats another story though malcaniskeep in mind that any antibot measure will also impact players making pve harder will make it so people never leave hisec or the npc corp you cant make precision mining work when the player also has to spam the dscan every 5 seconds and be ready to warp if you have smart rats at belts you are going to make ratters prey
ccp already allows this its called getting your kids to mine for you
people who never build a station let alone have assets in the billions in sov00 stations should the  shut upthere are plenty of ways to destroy assets in the game as it is just cuz you want some ppl to greave some more or because youre greedy for some more profit doesnt mean you acctualy have a good idearisk vs rewards in 00 is fine as long as youre not a member of the ncyou lose plenty of ships defending your space andor fighting for your overlords especialy in regions where there are zero usefull moons so ofc no replacement programs exist not all of 00 is spilling technetium like a cow is milksure zero space gets more and more stations by the day but whats wrong with that eve is advanceing so is 00 ccp gave us the tools to grid thought these massiv amounts of hitpoints supers ofc the more stations a region has the more tireing it is to grid throught them but nothing wrong with that

i dont support thisthis would allow for those that have genuinely simply gone offline for an extended period of time due to unforeseen events in their lives such as hospitalization a sudden extended business trip or even incarceration to come back and find that their pos and its contents were repossessed in fullif someone wants to get the goodies from a pos they should firstly need to work for it as little work as it may be with sufficient alts consider that those alts need to all be paid for in game time as well as in system resources for the clients more importantly when you take down a pos you should be making a choice between blowing up structures as though they are lucky packets the contents of which you arent certain of nor of what portion of those contents you might receive or unanchoring them in the hopes you might receive some blueprints destroying any other contents they may have
copied from a similar discussion where i was encouraged to repost this hereok in this post i will do three things first i will examine the current system and identify where it is broken second i will put forth my own suggestioncurrent mechanicsnpc stationsa shield tanker st is in a fleet fight and has taken some damage he warps to the station waits for aggression timer to expire docks and can immediately undock i have tested this for undocking you dont have to wait for the session change timer and have full shieldsan armor tanker at in the same situation has to warp wait for aggression timer dock pay to repair undock still not waiting for session change if the at does not pay to repair he undocks with the same amount of damage he had going infor both if they both dock with full hp then they undock with full hppossif the st stores damaged his ship in a maintenance array he can board it again with full base hp if he docks his undamaged ship he still undocks it with base hp far less than he put it in with and severely crippling his tankif the at stores his damaged or undamaged ship it undocks with the same amount of armor damage as it had when it went in even if it was 0 damage i have not tested this but i have a hunch it is based on  damagethis mechanic is broken in three ways first my shields should not be fully recharged instantly upon docking at a station second i should not get free repair lastly if i store my ship with full shields in a maintenance array i should get back full shieldsmy proposalnpc stationswhen a st docks his shields should only regenerate at the regenerate only at the speed you normally would in space and if you change ships it should only regenerate at the base rate if the st should want to recharge his shield faster there will need to be a repair station available and he can pay to recharges his shield cost should be comparable to cost of repairing armor this removes the insta recharge that is broken and yet lets the player continue to get the auto recharge that is the shields strength just as they would if they were warping around safespotspossthe maintenance array should work pretty much the same i can store my ship and it will continue to charge at the base rate and if i dock my ship at 0 damage then i should undock it at 0 damagethis wouldnt be that hard to code all you would need to pass the the function that handles the process the damage and the time it was stored after that it would just be an algorithim to do the calculations and would just give the percent i think thats what armor does anyway percents otherwise when you left your ship to put it in the array it would explode
price is not and can not be a balancing factor just look at supercapsif ccp is smart they will not look into t3 frigates as that would obsolete many t1 and t2 frigates power creep is bad have to agree with goon here do not support
we are not talking about the same frig i think i am thinking about a frig that can be customized and have special role that would be reserved for it some people have talked about cyno jammer other thinks that it would be great only for interdiction nullifier i dont mind an invicible frig and we just cant make every frigate at the same powerin eve some ship are better than other caldari have ecm and are maybe the best ewar of all the race gallente got huge drones cargo hold minmatar got speed and amarr got good armor bonus its the way eve is planned to be we dont need to nerf down faction frig cause they are powerfull what we need is to add diversity after that dont worry about the fact t3 frigate would be too powerfull its not a jove ship idea t3 frigate are not invincible just because they use sleepers techt3 cruiser doest have maked t2 or t1 cruiser obsolete they are so much expensive that most people prefer t2 cruiser or even battleship thats why i firstly said that price would have a balancing effectsure you can be a demigod in a t3 cruiser its the way ccp wanted t3 cruiser to be t3 frigate doesnt need to be like their big brother thats the key of subsystems
there are also a lack of frigate if we compare to the cruiserthere is no logistic frigate why not make a subsystems that could give some bonus to different sort of logistichere is some exampleremote sensor boosterprojected eccmtracking linka subsystems that permit to fit gang module like 1 or 2we doesnt need to make a copypaste from t3 cruisers subsystems its 100 miles away from my main ideat3 frig should specialized as t3 cruiser can be but in different fieldif some feature must stays cloaking interdiction nullifier etcothers should be removed armor resist bonus etcand added cyno jammer warfare link logistic ewar counter measureof course a t3 frig would do maybe more dps than a t1 would it be interresting if it were not the case i think notthings been said im not trying to convince anyone i dont really care but i just think the t3 is a familly that need to be completed
we dont need frigates that can fit a gang module we need more versatile frigates for frigate specific tacticsfrigates that can fit better tacklefrigates that can fit better cov opsfrigates that can maneuver fasterfrigates that have higher warp speedsfrigates that can fit better dps and tankstrategic ships are about versatility in fitting not granting abilities better suited to larger craftremoterepping frigate  good idea ganglink frigate  bad ideafrigates are support craft
that would be the interceptorscov ops already fill that rolea vigil can pretty much come close to inti speeds alreadythis i can see but it should have almost no dps and tank you want a greayhound you have to strip it down to make it fastwe already have assault frigatesrr frigate is a bad idea and would get used about as much as the eas frigates an exequror or osprey can do more cheeper than a rr figate could ever hope to acheve if there is a role that isnt already filled by another craft or isnt to nich then by all means petition to put it in the game just because it sounds cool and neat doesnt make it good to put in the game
none of those matter we need a frigate with interdiction nullifier
roles that t2 cruisers fulfill that t3 can doewarrecondpshactankhictorswith bonus of the bubble a special exceptioncloakforce reconrrlogisticsgang linkscommand shipsthe point is that the t3 ships can do all of these things and more with special cases as noted they dont do it as well as any of there specific counterparts again with exceptions the strength lies in the fact that you can mix and match versitility is key in this caset3 tech in frigates would introduce a new era in frigate versitility and you wouldnt need to apply the standard cruiser roles either youd pull from the standard accepted frigate platforms as youve already aptly provided a covops cloaky interceptor with decent dpsgreat tank would be amazingi also wonder if youd say the same things about t3 battleshipsgerrick palivorn
ah i know your type please continue to yell and scream at ccp for the bright shiny toy that you want im sure your next move is holding your breath growing up i was promised vacations on the moon flying cars undersea hotels and a lot of other neat spiffy things that sounded great and still do you say you want a new era of frigate versitility i say you want a new shiny pwnmobile to show the scrubs whos boss as for battleships there is no versatillity to themunless you count smashing things with a brick versitile crusiers are the best option for t3 ships as they would have the tank and the versatility of the crusier line without the fragillity of frigates and lack of versatility of battleships
try not to derail topics with personal attacks if you feel that you have a valid argument on why t3 frigates shouldnt be implimented that is what you are supposed to do herehope that this clears things up still 1 for t3 frigs a more effecient platform of stepping up from t2 to t3 is needed and the versatility of frigates alone makes them a perfect fit for the next t3 evolution while i know that this wont happen for a while seeing as im completely baffled by the whole sleeper thing itll be a great addition to eve when they do emergepun intended gerrick palivorn

proposals to improve lowsec usually involve adding concord or other gamemechanicbased security improvements but these are rejected because lowsec is supposed to be dangerous and because they would interfere with pvp an alternative a few of us came up with over at fi was to have a playerbased security mechanism instead this proposal would put concord bounties on pilots with negative sec status while they are in lowsec amount calculated from the base price of their hull like insurance other players would then have an incentive to go into lowsec to hunt pirates thus balancing out the incentives for pirating vs antipirating so this proposal would1 make lowsec slightly safer for industrialistsminers without giving them any guarantee on safety2 promote pvp between pirates and antipirates and with carebears to the extent that more move to lowsecthanks for reading
so basically i could buy a ship insure it and then kill it with my alt to make a profitproper way to do it would be to fix the bounty system pay bounties for ship and pod kills from the total bounty pool that is set to the player where only the market value of destroyed items or implants is paid out
there is no evidence that supports the conclusion lowsec needs improvement second your proposal is totally exploitablenot supported
no because the lost ship taking into account insurance costs more than the bounty alternatively the bounty could either be taken from the wallet of the pirate or out of the insurance compensation the neutralizing any exploitability

sorry i worry you misunderstand the op absolutely just let me answer your questions belowany of the current ships will not be changed for my suggestion and the new ships will not be variations of any current ships they will be absolutely new ships their relationship with old ships will be similar with the relationship between vexor and thorax but with similar attributesi didnt metioned color or making variations the new ships will be real new ships not variations of any a ship and attributes will be simalar with the old ones only attributes it would be something from another topicas i metioned at first that their attributes will be similar or just the same i admit it would costs much in design and maybe the huge waste you mean but the affect in game will be on the industrial aspect more than pvp or pve actually it will has minor change in pvp for people might prefer to fly the new ships for their design but not for the attributes there is not really a defference with the old one
i told you theres 0 chance of it happening with the current ccp devs in chargeyou should have suggested it 4 years ago when they still had balls
lets nerf the 00 and suggest people to carry thing back to low sec good job man
how is that a nerf to 00with that feature you can loot your enemys hangar you get more stuff thats a huge boost to people who fight in 00
not gonna happen if they cba to recode stuff to make outposts destroyable in order to counter the station spam in 00 why would they even bother with a completely new game mechanic theyll just recap their argument about what about ppl afknot subscribed cant do that to themas long as ccp holds a hand over afk playersassetssupercapswhatever not a chance tbh
you will get absolutely nothing as theyll obviously trash the stuff which is of course a good thing stuff needs to be destroyed to nerf sov null not merely changing hands supported
configurable options are always good
basically the idea is that the higher your sec status is the faster concord responds when a suicide gank is attempted on you at 50 sec status would mean no one is allowed to shoot you at allpros hither quality game play for all and less idiots running aroundcons there is actually none for this proposal

hi everyoneas per imigos suggestion im breaking up the central points of my heroicallylong proposal surrounding sovereignty mechanics and related topics so as to allow for easier reading and hopefully more feedbackthe main point of this proposal is to shift sovereignty warfare from shooting structures boring encourages blobs and discourages smaller groups to control of colony sitescoloniescolony sites are locations where humans can establish a population usually at the behest of selfinterested capsuleers most commonly on planets or moons worlds or in stations in asteroid belts in functionality colonies would replace stations eg docking services etc below are some details on how the colonies and sovereignty mechanics would workhabitability economics and infrastructurenot all worlds would be capable of sustaining populations at the outset based on a random distribution of habitability factors worlds could be classified as one of three types uninhabitable vast majority habitable handful and ideal very rare population seeded on a worlds surface would die uninhabitable remain static habitable or grow ideal belt station are habitable by default but require ice products to maintain life support ie more expensive to maintain than worldbased colonies each type of colony site has a limited size in terms of surface area planet  9x9 moon  6x6 belts  1x1 meaning that the different sites will be able to accommodate varying levels of infrastructure and development a colonys population is important for two main reasons first the more population a colony has the more infrastructure can be anchored in orbit or built on the surface orbitals would be standalone infrastructure modules which would take over most of the current operations of pos ontheground infrastructure would allow for the construction of factories labs and other station services second population can be trained into troops which can be used for sovereignty warfare colony holders can either use their troops for their own military operations defensive or offensive or sell them for an easy profit sovereignty warfaretroops can be deployed on the surface of a colony by the owner acting as a defense against invasion by enemy troops troops can only kill each other off at a set rate meaning that the number of troops the defender puts on the surface of the colony will determine the length of the battle ie the timing mechanism troops have a cyclical costs associated with ownership meaning that stockpiling them to the point of a functionallyinfinite timer is financially impossible the costs also provide a pricing mechanism for sovereignty meaning that the price of holding sovereignty over a site is equal to the cost of holding it ie how much it is worth to the alliance this battle mechanic has the advantage of divorcing sovereignty from dpsthe sovereignty system itself would be hierarchical and scaled down the smallest claimable unit would be individual colony sites rather than whole systems this means that overlapping sovereignty claims become possible and in such cases the dominant holder can set restrictions on the lowerlevel holder such as limiting the types of orbitals that can be anchored at their colony or charging fees for stargate use the index system could be revised and linked to minimal trooptopopulation ratios needed to claim sovereignty this means that active space will have a lower minimal price of claiming than inactive space and that alliances have a financial incentive to maximize the use of their space this has the added benefit of making small raiding parties more relevant as they can increase the cost of sovereignty or disrupt it entirely if indexes are sufficiently harmed thoughts
i dont see any mention of spaceships involved in your game i think that concludes it
if im talking about sovereignty reform why do i need to change how ships work in this proposal ships are used to transport troops between colonies as well as disrupt enemies attempts to do the same
if i wanted to play an rts id play an rtsnot eve
i always support the removal of cheating from a gamehowever your proposal offers no implementable solution just make it a priority what exactly are you suggesting ccp do
yes we shouldnt even be asking for thisccp sort it out no excuses any more
they are the developer who made the application which allows botting on there game and they wrote the eula which botting violateswe shouldnt have to propose anything on how this is implimented its something only ccp can solveput it like this when guildwars had a bot problem ncsoft and arenanet dropped everything to solve the problem they didnt ask for a customer solution but gave them tools to help
despide any problems might be in the topic the directional scan ui is need to be improvedalthogh i dont agree the last stuff there lots people cant handle directional scan welljust try to get it more friendly please ccp
i rather like the fact that the people who do not want to put the effort into becoming really good with thier scanner are not able to use it efficiently as it is already rediculously fast and easy to narrow down a ship at a celestial or plain 5deg scan for someone who is good with thier scanneri see no reason why it should be made more efficient easier to do with less effortnot supported
i suggest adding a new notification type to the mail window named calendarhere calendar notifications should be sent by the system when or before events start it should be configurable by the user if he wants notifications which notifications he wants and how long before the event starts they should be sent

simple idea here all missionimportant structures need to be their own type of object you shouldnt have to dig through layers of overview settings to show forcefields so you can target and shoot the forcefield in the missing convoy you shouldnt have to have all building structures listed on your overview just to target and shoot the pleasure hub in damsel in distressif im doing a mission the only thing i want on my overview is mission critical structures acceleration gates enemy ships player ships wrecks cargo and if i choose stations  gatesthats it
configure multiple overview tabs with different settings and switch between themi find mission and everything helps quite nicely
dont worry about that i dont feel picked on im right there in the boat with you with my market alt im fighting a market bot every day so i totally get your frustrations and share them i bring up a way to deal with one type of bot because thats how i solve insanely complex problems irl one step at a timewhat do you think would be a good solution to the botting problem
i couldnt agree more a number of them really threw themselves into it
ho let me help you2009 stuffanother thread about wallentethere are plenty like these to show up csm its useless for what the game is about spaceshipsbut hulkageddon and jump bridges are so important im pretty sure all your eve lifes are completly changed and better with that stuff
well they are being honest when you are honest sometimes that means telling customers some things they may not want to hear i wasnt happy to hear this either but from a business perspective and the work fw will require to do right i can understand they are currently trying to do incarna right and that requires large amounts of resources if they want to do fw right it will also require a large amount of resources i just hope whne december 2011 rolls around they will be able to start making it as good as it should be btw when they released apoc 15 they said they would continue to update fw i think that was the intent but i think they then realized they had to change some of the actual mechanics

wtf with facecrap eve gate is that useless or pointless that we must use the biggest p orn network in this planet to vote for spaceshipsridiculous
the csm6 facebook page has nothing to do with voting it is a community page created by a few players interested in taking the initiative dont wanna go there dont go voting in csm elections will take place on the eveo website as it always has as for eve gate it offers no support for creating community pages right now or we might have considered using it

this thread was originally posted here and met universal praise from the people who commented i figured id post it here and let the csm take a look at itas of 223 this idea is being considered by csm5 and has a chance of being presented to ccp thanks go out to csm5 and vicechairman dierdra vaal for discussing the proposal with me special thanks go out to the players for their supportas of 36 this idea was passed unanimously by csm5 and will be presented to ccp hot dog despite eves constantly changing atmosphere one thing has remained relatively constant the wallet increasing the usability of the interface is one of the stepping stones to ensuring the survivability of this game in the long term i believe i have made some progress in that directionintroducing tabbed wallet browsingas any market guru will tell you keeping track of the dozens if not hundreds of orders can be a time consuming task with the ability to sort and tab your orders under various categories checking and updating your orders will go a long way to staying efficientthe ability to also search through orders if one desires to update certain orders specifically would also be a boon adding a new tab is also easy as all one has to do is click that little new tab button in the righthand corner of the wallet and a little window pops up for conveniencehow to add an itemorder to a tabcurrently i have developed two different avenues one may take to add an order to a particular tabavenue 1 orders already placeda simple process since we learned while playing eve that rightclicking practically everything is the 1 rule to follow i wanted to follow this line of thinking here as well simply rightclick a particular order as you usually would do when canceling or modifying it and the usual context menu will appear but with a few extra choices avenue 2 when placing new ordersto add a new order to a specific category simply open up the custom sell order window and tabbing options are present another nifty thing not present in this window would be the ability to save items so they automatically go into a tab that you designate thank you for readingaddendum proposali had also developed a shopping cart idea allowing players to view update and save shopping orders but i have yet to decide if it should be included in this proposal i am unsure of its usability
the ideas are well thought of and make sense  would be stupid not to support
i like this but only if they introduced tabbed asset management at the same time 
looks good
this would make my lifef so much easier 
definitely 1
in case there was any doubt liang
1 yes please i am also a big fan of the shopping cart concept as long as1 all loadouts can be right clicked  add to cart with saved loadouts being automatically setup in your saved shopping carts2 before purchase all items in the shopping cart 
this is worth logging in the forum fenix

hehe i so love this ideaccp needs to get a small team checking this out as lag is an adapt or die situation that cant be conquerd by rl tech no matter how fast people will always chew up server response time in a big battleto put it simply activating a set of guns with lag appearing in the situation goes like thisyou click to activate ur weapon on someone the module cycles constantly until its out of ammo and reloadsyou click again to activate and nothing happens why because according to the server thats trying to chew through all the other requests going on your new activation request has been put on the back of the queue which will probably take the server around 2 minutes to get toso your module seems to stickbecome unresponsive for 2 minutes generally that tends to lead to reclicking compounding the situationwhat the op intends is to add a multiplyer in the range of 0 to 1 on the end of many of the formulas that govern time based elements of eves combat systems slowing the pace of the onscreen game play slowing module cycle times for example so that youre not clicking on things that appear to have run their course client side but have not even begun to take effect server sidethis is the only viable way of making lag battles understandable and playable in eves universeim unsure if ccp are trying out ways to implement this but it would not be tooo hard to assume the sansha incursions are a testbed for adding additional exceptions to combat code to see if an augmentation of combat formulas can be achieved system wide with neighbouring systems being affected toochanging formulas governing alpha damage potential and resist levels differ between formulas using time based variables only on context and can be augmented just as easily the only issue is scale as time based variables are in sooo many formulas used in eve so it is achievable im very certain of that the only issue i can see is the moments of misalignment and realignment of true server time and perceived bullettime game time

sounds a lot better then the current solution
it makes so much sence this has my support 100also since the lagg is nodewide the slowmotion should also be nodewide as it is you arent able to play on the same node as a big fight anyway so i dont see how that would be something bad

great idea would luv to see this incorporated into the game for large engangements
good idea im not sure that it technically makes sense but it could be tried
i fully support this new way of creating a new way to live with the lagin this way we can reduce the incoming and outgoing commands which will slow down the game but also will reduce the laggreat idea
doing something is better than doing nothing at all
any idea that may help is worth trying
great ideea  honest im sick of playing who loads grid 1st wins if ur on the loser side u get the soul crashing lag popup window and ur basicly stuck in space for 5mins to 12 hoursthe incursion part of eve should be taken out it only causes more lag old things should be fixed before new things are implemented810 months ago everything worked perfectly2500 men fighting in 1 system with no lag now u got 10001500 people and u cant do anythingi support the ideea and hope its getting implemented
supported
x
if it solves lag i support it
there are a couple things here it appears most ppl missed the part about slowing down eve as a whole there would be no realistic way to slow down just the area effected this would cause a difference in time between the people involved in the fight and everyone else in eve if 1 system time slows then all must i would think there would be no easy way to regain the time difference between combatants and eve in wholei think some people are thinking way to extreme in the slowdown as well as it stands ccp has already stated that 1 tick in game  1 second if this were changed to 1 tick  2 seconds this would double the amount of tasks the servers could accomplish in 1 tick so realisticly a 2 or 3 second lag is barely noticable but would allow the servers to do 100 to 200 moreas for the servers not allowing clicks someone already brought that up it would increase the server load to make that a server side responsibility if it is client side it would do nothing but help server load
one word awesome ccp lets test it
the way it would work is not to slow down the server ticks compared to all other systems but augment the formulas that govern anything combatnavigation related that have a time element so speed dps cycle times lock times tracking times missile timers explosion velocity etc server speed and tick time doesnt slow down just things that govern combat and movement so combat slows to allow the server time to catchup and not be overloaded with requestsedit this would work system widemultiple system wide or node wide much like the incursion effects that reduce dps and decrease damage resistance 
good stuff
i support this
i support anything trying to be made for a fair fight for everyonealso how about using an alternate server for big fleet fights ie if the number of people in system are over 300or we the solar system server will automaticly move to an upgraded server idk if it is possible just out of my head
anything to fix the awfulness that is large fleet battle
supported the legion gets a 4 mid and 6 low configuration when you try to use a 6 gunmissile configuration the proteus however can get a 3 mid and 7 low configuration when using 6 guns which allows for better tank andor dps the proteus and loki also get drones for their gunmissile subsystems and the legion dont get any drones for its laser or missile subs the drone synthesis is useless youre better off in an arbitrator if thats the case if the legion were to get no drones it should get more dps bonus for its lasers and missiles subsystemsthe legion in its ham configuration only does 6 more dps than a nonkinetic ham tengu when using kinetic the tengu does 20 more dps than the legion and it also get a range bonus while the legion doesnt the tengu gets a 75 rof 5 kinetic dmg and 10 velocity bonus the legion only gets 5 rof and 5 damage bonus on the hams there is something seriously wrong with thisthe legion does only 8 more dps than the zealot while having the same weakness of having no dronesthe legion does only 3 more dps than the harbinger when the harbinger doesnt use its dronesthe legion definitely need a fix

nice to see im not the only one d
due to the lack of action ccp is taking against all the botting going on right now its pretty much already legal to do so
noit can be stopped ccp just hasnt prioritiesed it or let on they have
hmmmm no
supported it is possible to reduce botting a great deal more than has been done without annoying those players who do not bot ive seen this done in another game with a type of botting botting similar to macro ratting and it worked also in the very same game some types of botting similar to macro mining were allowed the hybrid solution worked i dont know how hard it hit the rmts but it didnt seem to affect the player economy in a negative fashion allowing macro mining while clamping down on macro ratting could workif ccp cant or wont reduce the botting more than they have they should make it legal for everyone a level playing field is just im tired of seeing players i know are macro mining doing nothing else in the game to earn the isk they spend on ships etc complaining about them through petition does nothing they either stop for a week or two and resume or simply train up an alt and resume macro mining with the alt ccp just isnt tough enough on these cheatersthe economy of eve would suffer an initial and possibly large hiccup but it would also quickly settle and none of the more lucrative and legal isk earning activities would really suffer in the not so long run there truly are people in eve that enjoy the activity of mining and they would find fulfillment in managing their new macro mining programsregardswindjammer
i would quite like to see the same sort of thing rolled out to trading allowing people to play the markets algorithmically instead of via the usual 001 isk gamesthis would need to be combined with a more dynamic price granularity and possibly some other changes i havent thought of yet
i endorse this product andor service
thank you for the input and i had failed to consider that however if ccp finds out that the offline poses are causing the massive lag you know that they are going to do right everyone with an off line pos thats been off for months will be gone regardless of war no refunds for it or even the items back
dram dont have interdiction nullifier interdiction nullifier is what t3 is all about anything else can be done in other ships yet no other ship can do what t3 can whatever it is that you do you cant do it if your ship is bubbled and blobbed therefore t3 can do everything and everything else can do nothing err yeah
9 kms overheated is your interdiction nullifier d
guessing its too soon to add any more t3 in yet they can easily unbalance the game even more t3 wont be much of a use the game already got alot of ships and some not even used much
this is a very specific argument but nobody is really talking reality here the reality is that in all arms races new technologies and specializations result from the desire to overcome old technology and gain an advantagenothing remains the same ccp should allow for a natural progression of innovation and technology in spaceship design not just for tech iii frigates but for all ship classes this also goes for new weapons systems as well think of the possibilities it would completely open up the game as new configurations and tactics were applied to new designs and weaponsin the real world all aircraft eventually get retired even b52s id like to see that in eve as well tech iii should only be the beginning
supported randomness in some the game is fine but when that randomness is a random decision on whether or not you actually get to play assuming youre focusing on incursions is a bad idea
agreed we need moar incursions moaaaarrr
first of all i can see why there is a limit to the number of incursions and why the delay between them if there would be high sec ones all the time people would not even think about wasting their time trying to get to low sec oneshowever i do believe that the current system of randomness is not a perfect one since people have no clue when the next incursion starts those who focus on these tend to find themselves in a limbo where they are waiting for a new spawn even though it is like 8 hours away and they could easily have done something else in the meantimethere should be some predictabilty in the incursion spawns and possibly even an approximate timer to when incursions will vanish or how long before a new zero sec low sec or high sec incursion spawnsnot neccessarily the exact number but something to give players an idea so they can plan around the events im thinking something along the lines ofmore than 12 hours 612 hours 36 hours 13 hours less than an houralso it would be nice if the reward curve for low sec could be a little less steep so you would get similar rewards for a low sec site with 2530 more people than a high sec site with the optimal number of people it would help a lot with the organization of lowsec incursion gangs as you can be more flexible in your fleet numbers while still receiving comparable rewards to runinng high sec onesi realize this might upset site balance to an extent but considering the time it takes to actually finish an incursion you have to be able to adjust your gang sizes in a wider range compared to high sec as you are working from a severely limited pool of people who would be willing to go for lowsec incursion
if you give it a timer then everyone will just swarm the incursion will be done quicker its zero sum this boils down to supply vs demand more specifically too much demand and too little supply of highsec incursions there is no demand for lolsec incursions no matter what you do it has suffered enough already instead of trying to revive it have some mercy and let it die
there defiantly needs to be an incursion up all the time right now we see more people in an incursion than there are sites to accommodate them and as far as randomness goes 3 weekends in a row of incursions spawning on an aussie schedule isnt exactly random in the least not trying to take anything from the aussies here we all know how often they get the short end of the sticki for one am enjoying this new content when its available to me witch is far less than id like but between today and yesterday i have nearly 24 hours of chat logs of bummed out subscribers dosent seem fair that they didnt get to participate in any incursions this weekendor last weekendor hell the one before that as well as far as randomness witch there is no such thing as random seems kinda greedy to always be screwing someone just so things spawn a bit differently than you are used to now if they could take over 100s of systems i could see where your coming from but as it stand i think they can take over a total of approximately 42 systems out of over 5000 7 possible incursions average 6 systems per incursions where they show up should give you that random feeling so in the end we arnt asking for much just enough content for everyone
when you realize that people dont go to low sec for killing pirates and its relatively safe for industrialists youre on right track there game mechanics already encourage fighting combat fitted ships aka evil griefers instead of haulers or miners because of general loot value which is ridiculous
ivy league and electus matari seem to do just fine being antipirates in low sec without this seems to me it might be a mental block as all research has indicated
citing the exception instead of the rule proves the exact opposite point
ivy and em are examples not exceptions there are many antipirates running around these daysif you really want to make it so i can sit there and farm an alt endlessly to get all the isk i could ever ask for then im all for it even if it did work to get more antipirates and even if there had not already been 3 consecutive years of antipirate game tweaks in every patch this would not get people to the belts mining in low sec
currently the sin is the laughing stock of black ops as its bo bonus is useles 5 to agilitylvli propose that instead the bonus be 1 drone controlled bo level without changing its bandwidth you will still be able to only use 5 heavies or 5 sentries at a time to maintain balance but then with bo v you would be able to field 10 med or light dronesthis would fit in line with the other races dps outputs and be a fitting bonus for gallente who are supposed to be drone centric
in battle retreat is a tactical manoeuvre that is sadly missing in eve the reason one cant run away before ones ship is destroyed is warp scramblersdisruptor modulesremoving these items from the game has numerous benefits1 it will encourage more pvp because there is always the option to disengage and run away2 it wipes out the scourge that is the 1v1bait you think youre getting a 1v1 but the other guy has 4 mates in faction cruisers waiting ready to warp in once youre aggressed you can just make a run for it when they appear3 following on from 2 1v1 will be made easier4 following on from 3 more pvp combat5 hauling into lowsec will be easier6 more people in lowsec7 following on from 456 more economic activitybefore the inevitble grieferwhine ensues i would point out that other aggression mechanics such as cant dockcant jump while the timers are active would still be in the game
meh nothing to even laugh at
your proposal would further nerf solo and small gang pvp by requiring people to have enough ships to alpha a target so it couldnt simply warp away worst idea ive ever seen on these forums 310 if trolling as its hard to take this idea serious but it does make me want to smack you
i have a sad this is not literally exploding with supportto the top once more
anyone who does alot of roaming or flying around eve will probably be familiar with the bug where autopilot can often take the same members of a gang in the same place through two different routes to the same location its not a major problem but it is rather frustrating when it does happenone way i thought to fix this issue is the autopilot could take you to the gate that is the fewest au from your current position or the gate could automatically choose the route that would be shortest overall travel distance between star systems as shown on the map its a small problem i know but i dont think it should be a problem at all dark
posting for my own support 
not all ships run the same autopilot software
gallente t1 ship line is inconsistenttristan is the highest tier frigatemost slots best fitting room yet the counterparts are missile frigates like inquisitor kestrel or breacher that also use same hull for t2 covops frigatesincursus should take place as highest tier in gallente t1 frigate line as it is a pure hybrid platform and same hull is used for assault frigates
your probably refering to the t2 varient hullsbombers usually consist of the non top tier frigs with the exception of the tristan and the nemisis while the incursus is the af hullas far as i see it the incursus is the better ship than the tristan plus the tristan makes sense as the bomber cause of the missile slots changing something as trivial as a tier item will only confuse people leave it begerrick palivorn
that is the point if this thread  inconsistency in t1 frigate hulls tristan is the top tier t1 gallente boat which should not incursus needs to be instead

sooo stop using pi more isk for meseriously the old pi was a tragedy its good they changed it even thou its more difficult to get full production chain on single planet even for a p2 productsit forces some logistics into equation transporting goods between planets is now a must in most production beyond p2 or alternatively you can try getting close located resources and switch ecu resource every now and than and still do it on one planet
im trying to find out why you cant move items either one at a time or all together from the launch pad to storage silos without the stevedores are hung up with red tape and paperwork wtf is that all about i think its bs anyone else think so im trying to set up a pure p2 production planet with all materials imported into the system

ccp should setup some sort of reward system for the loyal players that come back month after month year after year if you resubscribe for a month then maybe a reward of x number of skill points maybe 2 days worth of free training a 2 month subscription x2 and so on for those that subscribe for a year maybe a free remap and no skill points
how about you get skillpoints added to your account if you keep it active and those who dont cant get any sp or connect to the game server a system like this would keep rewarding people who subscribe and those who arent loyal dont get anything since they dont pay anything
im ok and just saying but active acount under condition not active by plexnow this is fair

supporting further discuss some interesting ideas i like sovereignty scale and financial burden of troops is good and should be expanded into other types scientist janitors etc i dont agree that troops can be sold for easy profit instead population is weighted towards workers scientist troops etc should become a base resources these can harnessed like with pi and used to produce something appropriate like troops scientists slaves and colonists to populateestablish other types of coloniesallow the process to be reversible so that homeless  refugees can be reintegrated into the population
second population can be trained into troops which can be used for sovereignty warfare colony holders can either use their troops for their own military operations defensive or offensive or sell them for an easy profitthis sentence and all of them following are what i do not like everything before it sounds great but i think the method of sov warfare in this idea needs to be rethought
oh noes someone might call on all the people allied with him to help get him elected so his portion of the game doesnt become worse this sounds absolutely scandalous seriously even if you had all 00 or even all nc members its not like they would ask ccp to make 00 suck more sure they might not put much effort into hisec but the extreme worry they might idk cheat or something is dumb especially with the fact that csm does more towards informing us than actually making a large impact on eveidk i love my dictatorsoverlords in 00 i find most people that dont like them simply dont like working in a team to accomplish team goals as opposed to working towards their own personal agenda in 00 we are blobbers not 2 man get as many kills as you can pirates of course if your 00 alliance leaders are stealing your isk you might be mad as well but few of the big power alliances do that its mostly the fail pets

nothe game already has a monthly fee start to charge for expansions if you must  but in turn an expansion will have to have actual content and mechanics in it not just some silly gimmick but putting microtransactions into a game that already has a monthly fee even if it is just cosmetic no no thank you
hell yeah
yesno respectable alliance will put a gallente ship on a reimbursement program because they are such fail ships exception  maybe logis and capitals all the people who started gallente and pvp just wasted time at this point you can go any number of ways here at this point  any direction is a good directionchange anything doesnt matter just change
supported other than the fact that gallente ships look cool they stink
supportedive only been playing for a month but even for a complete newbie who only tried gallente minmatar and amarr up to battlecruisers is is glaringly obvious that gallente need some major work done going from thorax to rupture was like the difference between night and day
increasing yar by 10
as of right now2005 people have read this thread78 have supportedof those 78 at least some are alts used to boost the numbersthis should tell you that things are finenot supported
with people like this guys developing the game is obvious gallente are finenever send your cv to my company cant waste more than 2sec reading that kind of toillet paper
as i said in the previous thread this is a much needed addition to the walletis the csm from csm5 still active or are they relieved until new candidates are voted in
yes please
support this and let the testing begin
i am colonel stfu and i support this message
i endorse this product andor service
great idea
hii support this great idea needs some thinking about people outside the time slow down zone and how to resinc but great idea
what makes you think that i dont think you have understood just what happens when you slow down the tickrate
actually this is just pure  awesomenesscount me in
definatly something that needs to be tested like every change if it can be exploited it will it might be the temp fix we need until something better comes along
i am supporting this idea  1 if nothing it at least worth to try on singularity
1 would like to see this implemented
u sir are a genius
of course
does ccp consider those it at all
yeah slow motion would be really badass 
fully supported my favorite ship is the legion and its outgunned always by corpmates in tengus proteus lokis sometimes even in damn tengusthe only thing a legion is really good at is beeing a minibhalgornsupported  10
seems reasonable dont see a lot of people flying the legion this change makes sense amarr ships should have plenty of low slots mid slot heavy laser ships are sansha not amarr
i just cant support buffing the legion more amarr is king of so many ship classes not being king of t3 is fine besides the ham legion works great so your crying about how it is utter crap is falsegallente has the proteus which is a good long range tackler soon as it its close it suffers from hybrid turret syndrome basically it is edham legion has great speed selectable damage type can apply said damage without having to get in scramwebneut range oh and by the way as far as drones goes the ishtar still outclasses the proteusif any race ship gets looked at it damn well better be a gallente one the entire line up is outclassed by some other race with ease
i agree with this something has to be done about this like various posts before me have said its easy to fund a war as it is now from popping 2 rats imho this makes wardecs horribly underpriced imo what a wardec essentially is is a way to bribe concord who will then allow your corporation to not only destroy ships without consequences but also pod pilots this sort of mechanic while i believe that it is needed to balance the economy needs to be changed if this game wants to be as realistic as possible then a 2mil bribe to concord would be laughed at imo a wardec should be a big dealhighsec wars should be very few and far between and have purposewhich right now only includes griefing and preventing other corps from starting up right now the risk associated with declaring a war in high sec are vastly underscored by the gainfun of declaring one where the potential loss of the decced corp vastly outweigh the cost to the agressor increase the amount per week required to declare war and require a certain standing with either concord or the faction whos soverignty the corp is based inpro less highsec wars for griefing a wardec becomes a big deal even newsworthy players who rage quit the game would not leave if they were not harassed every time they tried to make something of themselves eve player base grows as such also the current corporation skillsets allow corporations of thousands of players but the largest corporations are only 100 and very well established ones of 200 this would also increase the probability of bigger corporationscon new isk sink as stated in prior postsbut is that really a bad thing less pvp not correctthis has nothing to do with lowsec pvp and is an addition to pvp
outside of personal preference there is no reason to nerf war decs you think the ability to wardec for long periods is griefingothers think of it as a lucrative business model many people are ambivalent to current mechanicsseems pretty balanced and fair for all players to methat being said the best way imo to improve the ops idea is to erase it
ive supported a similar idea before noobships and their mails are annoying as that said please give us a pod when we get podded or else people will have to buy a ship just to get a pod in their clone station currently the free noobship does this  you can jump into the noobship jump out and destroy it
noban themdisband the corps they are indisband the alliances they are inconfiscate the assetsif you dont want to play the game  then dont play it supporting afk playing is idiotic at best
we said no
if morons would stop buying isk there would hardly be any botters other than a few miners doing it for their own personal isk perhapsdefinatly not supporting this you want to make the game even more dull might as well take away everything pve related if you dont want to do anything for it
initially the decryptors items such as assembly instructions test reports etc were used only for cosmos bpc construction they were only found within the respective cosmos complexeswhen ccp introduced invention for tech 2 items they simply used these exisiting items this led to camping of the various static cosmos complexes where these decryptors spawnedeventually ccp removed the decryptors from the cosmos spawns and put them in various exporation sites instead at that point they should have simply removed the requirements from the cosmos bpcs as the cost of the decryptors now makes manufacturing of the cosmos bpcs stupidly expensiveremoving the decryptors from the cosmos bpcs would go someway towards seeing the cosmos items used more frequently
cosmos modules are currently not worth building
bump for more interest  keep the support and ideas coming guys
supported and how about evemailing bookmarks
eve is a game that at its heart is about a world where pvprisk is always part of the equation it deliberately has no safe space only safer space it is a game where simply leaving your hangar can have disastrous consequences where the motto has become dont undock what you cant afford to lose and not dont pvp with what you cant afford to lose every interaction with another person in eve has the potential for risk from the potential for scams and competitive trading in the marketcontracts to social engineering and espionage in personal relationships and shiptoship combat in space the proposed new content in incarna however does not follow this pattern and therefore breaks with the core content of eve that which makes eve what it is and that which makes eve great and unique as intellectual property more to the point the announced content for incarna is uncomfortably close to space barbie we can play dress up we can go socialize at space bars or play space poker or get space haircuts but none of this adds anything to eves actual content whats more an area of complete and total security runs counter to the very concepts that eve is founded on operating in complete safety is antithetical to eves nature for these reasons there should be a commitment to iterate on wis there must be some kind of actual content in stations that players can experience and ideally something that is tied into the greater landscape of the game players should have content available to them in stations which will impact the larger game world be it unique missions that can only be gained in seedy areas of stations a chance to kill rivals away from heavily tanked powerful ships or other yet unexplored possible areas of content how this content is implemented will be a separate issue and is being discussed in a separate thread all in all walking in stations simply must have meaty content that players can sink their teeth into porting over some of the fluff from the vampire game is all well and good but tossing trinkets out to the eve gaming populace is not going to cut it if eve is supposed to be definitive scifi simulator than make it live up to the promise if two pilots have been fighting tooth and nail out in space where there is no such thing as safe space even where theres a police force thats so lethal that avoiding their retribution is an exploit its unreasonable to think that those pilots would then play nice and enter space barbie mode objections and counters 1fiction doesnt support it  actually it does violence and danger have been depicted as part of life on stations even if it had not ccp is in charge of writing the fiction and can rewrite it as it sees fit additionally fiction does not inform gameplay before recently there were no super weapons that can fit on a single amarr battleship and wipe out a while enemy fleet there still arent in game 2 stations are currently safe space and that shouldnt change  no personal hangars are currently safe space stations do not actually exist except as models in space personal hangars can stay 100 safe space as they are now 3 you cant download your skills to a medical clone without a pod  theres no reason this has to be the case see the fiction objection maybe the jove release a new bit of technology that allows only those who are capable of being pod pilots to be fitted with a remote clone implant that allows medical cloning within a 50km radius maybe a wizard did it doesnt matter 4people want stations to be completely safe  and many of the same people would like empire space to be completely safe too neither is a good idea and both violate the fundamental dynamics of eve as a game and the concept of a fully functional scifi simulator even without guns an adversary can still snap a mans neck
dont we get bars casinos and new types of labs in incarna not really combat but still is something todo mind you baseball bat warfare sounds like fun too
playing bartender in space barbie isnt really anything to do that you cant do in second life and weve already got eoh for poker
tldr
clever trolling and novel too
how are you supposed to kill a capsuleer in the elevator when you get turned into a splatter on the floor in milliseconds long before the spoon connects with the eyealso getting your medical clone disposed off by concord for breaking the yulai treaty doesnt seem that smart to me even if you inconvenience another capsuleer by forcing them to restore from a backup use an alt isnt really the answer as theres no way an alt would ever be willing to die for real for you
i suggest we also include ganking in forumsstill fuzzy on the mechanics but we should be able to directly gank people via the eve online forums maybe via isk bidding or random numbers in each post or maybe killboard statsthis would increase pvp making the forum experience much more enjoyable for everyone thank you
this has to be the most awesome thing i have read on the forums in at least 2 weeksi loldin my pantsrepeatedly
who cares about walk on stations in a space ship gamebarbiekaneshamanhuntercookiesproffit no
there will be pvp in stations of that i am quite surehowever its probably not the kind youre asking for here expand your horizons my good sir expand your horizons
there is no violationthanks to the widgetpowered deusex device pilots can now have their consciousness downloaded to medical clones even if they die outside of their pods science marches on next up heres tom with sports the fiction in eve exists to support the game not the other way around and fiction doesnt necessarily make for good gameplay either do i get my amarr superweapon that fits on a battleship and can destroy and entire enemy fleet now or do i have to wait a whileeven in eve there is no such thing as total security and youre overstating what the fiction actually says if stations can be bombed with crude explosives a determined individual can sneak a gun onboard or at least break a bottle and slit someones throat eh not a good solution and not a good precedent if the antipvp folks can get that much why not empire space too part of the driving logic of eve is that nowhere at all is completely safe yeah this is eve its a sandbox game you dont get to decide how other people play the game let alone that their actions should be mature and thought out if you need to control how other people play the game this is not the game for you combat is 100 allowed in every single location in eve that is not your personal hangar everywhere there is no reason to create a special space for stations where combat is physically impossible pvp in a pvp game the devil you say but you think that there should be actual paper money in the ultrafarscififuture do you think when people go and buy faction battleships for hundreds of millions of isk are they counting out the cash in 20s or in 10s
love it ing love it never going to happen but i love itdid i say i love it already
im against it eve is a tactical game not a shooter for hyperactive childrenthe only eve ground combat i support is a pc dust version that maybe can be started from inside eve but not in stations
theres nothing that says that shooting cant be tactical besides arguing that there should be combatfree zones in eve because combat is tactical is slightly misleading eh engage logic then post
there should be combatfree zones in eve because there have always been combatfree zones in eve theyre called space stations and they should stay that wayand no fpss cant be tactical because fps players are the single most moronic crowd of gamers and eve is not designed with them in mind if you want to pvp in station join a game table or go to the market screen if youre not smart enough to win there undockthere have always been supposedly three major career paths in eve the combat the industrial and the business career the first two have had tons of content added for them through the years so think of incarna as the long overdue expansion for the third theyve always called stations their home their pvp is one of numbers and spredsheets now they get to move around a bit as well last thing they need is some numbskull with a gun as if combat types dont already have 1 million things to shoot at
it would be nice if you at least played eve ya know there have never been combat free zones in eve that is simply fictional and no space stations were not combat free because if you actually played the game youd know that they do not exist and never have except as graphics in space hangars are the only place thats safe from combat and they would remain so under my proposal yet again engage logic and only then post combat doesnt have to be fps any more than ship combat in eve is fps to say nothing about your absurd broadbrush ad hominem nonsense yet again even ignoring all that your basic rhetoric is absurd fps combat would inherently be nontactical you claim so therefore there should be no combat at all rather than nonfps style combat the rest of your nonsense is appreciated however yes joining a game table is the kind of tactical pvp that youre supporting
i wouldnt make counterstrike jita of it butit would be nice to sell for example illegal drugs in highsec via person to person trade at some corner of the station it would be nice to be able to have like a small cargo pocket where you can carry drugs little bit isk and stuff with you other players can sneak on to you and steal itsmall stuff like that which would make it much more interresting not breath taking omg ueberpwnage wtf lewlt lazer pointing to my head stuff butt small funny things built in betting system fro the minigames where players who are watching can bet who will winto keep it a social like expirience i would keep it small but emorageablewould give much more reasons to emorage and declare war on someone brjoker
again combat doesnt have to be fps style hell transplant the ship combat style and put it in stations just with different graphics and since nowhere in eve that you can go is safe space stations shouldnt be either
problems need for more content customization and progression within null sec need for more resources that can be attacked that will also generate conflict need for more pve and pvp diversity within null secsummarydominion features had initially included talk concerning the addition of agents to null security space through upgrades installed by player entities within territory that they controlled but this did not happen due to technical difficulties that would have been involved in implementation could we examine the feasibility of spawning mission agents in ships in space and utilizing the system for spawning anomalies and complexes to spawn mission sites for these agents this system would add to the topography of null security space it would create more interesting and varied pve content that could possibly draw players into null security space it would create flash points for short term conflicts ranging from small scale to large scale if possible the addition of another separate but viable lp store within the game would act as another isk sinkthese agents would be added as a secondary index to the military index is filled by completing missions for these agents the initial agent is allowed after reaching a specific point on the military index in addition to this the destruction of these agents by players would decrease your alliances index rating if the rating drops too low then agents that require that level or above in order to operate will cease operations within your territory alliance members will lose access to the missions and lp stores provided by the lost agents until the index is raised againthe nitty gritty i have attempted to outline some ideas of how these agents should function i have attempted to address the problems that i could foresee ie time zone warfare game balance gerrymanderingagent features creation of a secondary index for the military index that allows the alliance to import agents into their space index has 5 levels and allows access to more valuable agents as it increases tier 1 agents are allowed at the first level and tier 5 agents are allowed when the index is at level 5 agents are part of splinter corporations aligned with the various pirate and outlaw factions negative reputation with the agents parent faction will not block an allianceplayer from interacting with them performing story line missions will result in a small increase with the agents parent faction performing missions with the agent will cause the playersalliances reputation to shift relative to the other tier agents splinter corporations alliances are allowed a maximum of 5 tier 1 agents 4 tier 2 agents 3 tier 3 agents 2 tier 4 agents and 1 tier 5 agent within a region agents are distributed randomly within the region they are assigned to after downtime more than 1 agent may not be placed within a single system agents must have a minimum amount of space between them and another agent ie 0 jumps between tier 1 agents 1 jump between tier 2 agents and 4 jumps between tier 5 agents alliances must control a minimum amount of space in order to gain access to the various tiers of agents ie 1 system for tier 1 agents 3 systems for tier 2 5 systems for tier 3 and 10 systems for tier 5 alliances may designate a time period in which the agents are active the minimum duration is 16 hours agents will enter space at their designated time  3 hours only 1 tier 5 agent is allowed per region and the alliance that has control over the most space  and has at least 20 of the region will be able to enlist its services
 only 4 tier 4 agents are allowed per region the alliance that controls the most space and has at least 20 of the region will be able to enlist the services of 2 of these tier 4 agents the remaining 2 tier 4 agents will be split between the next 2 sovereignty holding entities that control the 2nd and 3rd highest amount of space and at least 20 of the region agents may be attacked and killed if they are killed then the owning alliance loses a specified amount of rep from their index if the index drops below the necessary level for an agent then those agents will not spawn again until the index is raised back to the required level higher tier agents will be harder to kill but will result in a greater hit to the index ex tier 1 agent with support could be balanced for a 510 man pvp gang and a tier 5 agent could be balanced for 3040 man pvp gangs all agents should use enhanced ais agents should generate some sort of warning message when under attack agents will be blue to the alliance that sponsors them and possibly to the blues of that alliance all other players will be red and will be fired uponmission features missions should be balanced for multiple participants and geared towards pvp fit ships if possible tier 1 missions could be balanced for 23 players tier 2 missions 35 players tier 3 missions 510 players tier 4 missions 1015 players and tier 5 missions 1520 players mission rats should utilize enhanced ais mission rewards should utilize a reward system with a built in diminishing returns system ie such as the one detailed for incursion that gives increasing rewards to players until they exceed the designed capacity of a given mission higher tier missions should require players to roam farther in order to complete them all missions will occur within the region they are assigned to and within the sovereignty of the alliance that has summoned them tier agents may periodically offer missions to players that require them to hunt and kill their competition that is working for other alliances hi security agents aligned with the empires ie republic fleet may offer missions to mission runners that require them to go an kill tier agents within null security spacemission rewards and lp store develop an lp store that is separate from current lp markets develop items that do not imbalance current pvp mechanics but that are desirable to players balance the isk rewards so that they are competitive with null security anomalies offset isk faucet of bounties with lp isk sink possible lp store items may include pirate faction drones possibly up to and including fighters and fighter bombers pirate faction combat drugs with increased side effects as well as buffs pirate faction implants side effects and increased or new buffs and pirate faction capital turrets faction drones and modules could increase certain stats at the expense of others in order to decrease the chance of upsetting the current balance present within the game tier agents would have access to limited amounts of items higher tier agents would have access to larger quantities of items each tier of agents would have a separate lp store list bigger and better items would be available from higher tier agents the loss of these agents would deprive alliance members the ability to purchase them until the agent is restored items are purchased at the agent in space they could either delivered in space in a cargo container or to the nearest station
you have some ccp quote to support that from what i recall it was a player idea not ccp
exactly ccp gave a response which was it is hard to do due to technical reasons
yes please
agree
what manner of discrimination you asksimple when you think of tanking what kinds come to mind shield and armor but you are wrongccp has discriminated against the manliest of tanks that of the noble hull tankso where is the discrimination you ask surely not in the massive possible ehp you get from slapping seven reinforced bulkhead iis on a revelation surely not however what about those of us who wish to hulltank something else what of those of us who want to make use of the hilariously unnecessarily high number of midslots on the legion for an active hulltankno sayeth ccp you armor tank that what of those of us who wish to hulltank the mighty caracal and actually give it a tank worth havingno sayeth ccp ye who wish to hull tank shall have ridiculous cycle times and obscene capacitor usageand what of those of us who wish to use the aforementioned hulltanking revelation because of our massive balls but do not have a capital hull rep mod with which to do itno sayeth ccp we shall do what we can to crush your manlinessso what exactly am i proposing not a buff to the ehp side of hulltanking rather a decrease in cycle time for hull reps and a decrease in capacitor usage and if i should be so bold to dream capital hull reps now im not saying that they should be as capacitor efficient as armor tanks or as fast as shield tanks nay that would be overpoweredbut at least bring the hull reps into the realm of plausibility if only for those of us with massive balls and it might actually bring the minmatar carriers into usefulness give them the hull rep bonuses because then you would know when you fight someone who brings a hel or nidhoggur you are fighting real men
hull tanking absolutely needs a boost there is absolutely no reason other than total lulz to use an active hull repper they use far too much cap repair far too little and the fitting reqs are sillystealth gallente buff
signed more plausible hull tank
there would have to be an option to purchase fitting without requiring all items be bought from the station youre in many times the modules you are purchasing are strewn throughout the regionconstellation and you should still be able to buy them in one shot youll just have to go get them yourself
intelligent proposal supported
so the reasoning behind the officer nerf was literally valueofficer difficulty has been increased to reflect their valueby making them harder you basically need a carrier to kill them or have subcaps die to them while killing them it also means the solo ratters who are out there in tengus and proteus cant kill themso supply of modules are going to dramatically dropsupply vs demand officer module prices are going to skyrocket also thusly how long until they have to make officers even harder this is stupidmake ccp change back to old stats and if they want to make the value warrant difficultly make them spawn more often to increase supply and devalue the modulesdisclaimer just got tuvan in my ishtar didnt lose my ishtar and did kill him he didnt drop any officer modules fffffff
having killed an officer recently i understand their difficulty now its tough but doablei do believe that increased difficulty will result in slightly rarer drop rates and half the officer income will be shifted to the big alliance people  who are typically rich enough as it isi wouldnt mind keeping current difficulty if spawn rate was increased
supported if they dont fix the loot tables as wellalso note that only some items will go up in valuedamage modstracking compstracking enhancerscpusmeta 14 enamsinvun fieldscapacitor modsofficers guns and launcherslolwebs and scrambssmartbombssensor boostersecmofficer neutsmeta 14 passive hardenerscloaksbut anything that can be xtype will be ignoredenjoy the jita loot rush
not supportedi do not think this change has anything to do with whatever percieved market value they have and what difficulty should be attatched to thati think this change mostly has to do with another subject that so many complain about so if the changes as introduced do not bring the sought after effect then i would expect more changes to the officer spawnsmore frequent spawns are not likely to reduce the price anytime soon especially for the top items and would likely increase the amount of automated hunters exactly the opposite to the intended effect in my opinion to manipulate their prices to a to a level that is consistend with their former difficulty some of the mods would have to be changed extensively such a solution may reduce automated hunting but would not be welcomed by any of the current owners of those modules
the officers have been changed because it makes them largely botproof ccp probably arent going to revert that
if ccp would care about the botting issue wouldnt you think they would do more than sometimes give 1 to 3 day bans for people who bot 2357 this has nothing to do with botting at alleven if it would how long exactly do you think it will take them to adapt bots
which bot adapts to the new officers by trebling the dps and tank of your ratting ship
wait you fought tuvan in an ishtar and killed tuvan and didnt lose your ishtar if anything maybe they should make officers harder
officer mods are expensive because the chance of a spawn is so rare increasing the difficulty will not increase their cost that muchin the mean time your tears are delicious
the ones that call in help from other bots shouldnt be too hard to make that switch to another ship that works against officers if an ishtar can do it so can enough other ships might not be ideal for general ratting like for example a blaster proteus but works against the officer or just that send an email to their owner and skip the belt
so you killed him solo and still you are complaining wtf
nullseccers are used to eve being easy mode naturally he takes offence when it requires more than twenty seconds to get xx million bounty and a possible billion isk drop ps yes i firmly believe that the vast majority of issues with null bots bridges sc spam etc is rooted in people there being lazy as hell wanting something for nothingmake officers even harder and give them sleeper ai and escorts they are officers for goddess sake
no they should make the ratting like incursion sites i would love to see the tears and people have to work for isk then  rather than botting
ratting needs to be harder it is almost as afk of an activity as mining
increasing difficulty will have significant impact on item availabilityfirst you got many loners who used to go into npc 00 in hopes of finding an officer if they know they cant kill one now they will not clear belts entirely but start bs chainssecond lets say that 30 of all officers used to go to the botters  there are a lot of bot farmers after all now botters cant kill officers theyll just ignore them thats 30 decrease in officer mods sold on marketsthese are rough estimates but still you should be able to see how inability to solo an officer will result in both less spawn rate fewer people try farm them and less actual kills botters ignoring officersitd be reasonable to demand a boost to spawn rate maybe 20 more often
this is true indeed itll just make bots adapt and avoid officers i dunno if bots even contribute to officer mods anyway can they even loot wrecks i suspect not the only change is the 99 of people in 00 who have no idea it was changed or just wont be able to gtfo and will lose their ratting ship instead of normally killing the officer and getting lootsthen you either dont know how much pew or you dont understand supply vs demand
negative he killed a raven drake and 2 canes before we got him down
rofl if theres officer someone is going to kill it speculating about prices ftwand that said who cares if mineral or module prices go up someones just going to make more isk while someone loses more boost gallente
wut
to fix bounty hunting simply make killrights transferrable either directly to other players or to an npc bounty office which then spawns missions to kill the criminal in question with the reward paid by whoever gave them the killrightjob done
the downside of the transferable kill rights method is that as i understand it it would only apply to a single pilot rather than to anyone wanting to become an antipirate more generally as an incentive structure i dont think it would make that much of a difference
you realize that piracy has this making money by killing ships component rightwhat do you think will happen when the bounty comes out of the pirate wallet it is simple the pirate needs to reduce the risk of losing ships to around zero and the best way to do that is by using overwhelming force and avoiding a good fight like the plaguethe same thing that happened when fw hit lowsec will happen again the current pirate entities will combine forces to reduce risk and hire more personnelless fighting more ganks and even more overfarming the carebears population because there are now more mouths to feedbad idea overall you should probably try to live in lowsec for a while before you propose anything
one would hope theres already an incentive to behave in this fashion in any kind of profitseeking pvp that kind of incentive ie to gain more than you lose will always exist by that logic hisec must be a pretty dangerous place
no you just dont get the logic in hisec the prey population is strong compared to the hunter population the risk for the individual is still there but the chance that it hits another animal in the herd is bigin lowsec the opposite is the case and if you scale up the required kd ratio to keep a profit the pirate has to adjust to meet that ratio the obvious way to do this is to kill more ships with less losses and losses are avoided best by making sure the victim does not even have a remote chance to fight backthe antipirates that you assume will come to lowsec are just more prey at the end of the day and the pirates will scale up their numbers to ensure minimal losses according to the required kd ratioagain go live in lowsec for a while before making proposals that concern lowsec
but thats the whole point attracting more pilots combat and noncombat to lowsec and the more pirates there are in lowsec the more of an incentive there is for increasing numbers of antipirates enter lowsec
will the iskhr be better than l4s after accounting for riskif not then people dont have a reason to go to lowsec anymore than they have now
this lays on the premise to the new changes to the officer rats to make them more of a challenge in most cases this is seen as a good idea since being able to solo the top end officers in a poorly fit thorax is kind of laughablethe proposal is to extend this new feature to all non complex faction spawn you could increase this to complex faction spawns too but this could get out of handthis would mean that macros would be useless against such rats as they would not be able to solo them in t2 fit ravens or whatever is the normas a side effect itd also help ccp sort out the loot tables so that faction loot can justly drop once again as ammo and tags which is fair at the moment can be very disappointinglastly if these rats could also be escorted with frigates or have warp scramblers themselves this would improve the amount of marco deaths to the system
hum im pretty sure macros will simply avoid officiers spawn and do something elsenot sure it will help muchmoreover scramble would hurt the real player bot will know ennemy is too dangerous way quicker than real playerhowever there may have solution on this type of things
one thing that would go a long way would be to actuially ban bot accounts and remove any isk they created
i agree and definitely not the pointless two day bans they give out these days if you believe the reports on the forums
ccp employ over 600 people make 1 persons job to hunt bots and give them 1 year or permanent bans destroying their isk would also be good 3 day bans and relying completely on players reporting is not working
this bring back the old problem of you bring a knife ill bring a gunif ccp cracks down on botters they will just add random to the scripts and use alternate characters or some crapif ccp changed the rats to make them more surprising or harder they would not bother as a low skilled cheap raven pilot would have no benefit to them so they either stop or buy a expensive ship which canin short ccp would make the game more fun for us the player less rewarding for bots and everyone wins right
actually blackops really need a boost in generaland for hotdropping the sin is pretty good having the second highest cargo capacityas blackops are right now dropping a sin on someone is dumb but the same applys to all blops except the redeemer reallyi dont support the modifying of one blackops which gives ccp a reason to push fixing all of them to the back of the queue
black ops in general need a change and this idea is bad
sin pilot here sin is terrible for pvp because loldrones with redeemer or panther i can jump in on covert cyno and you can lay down instant damage while aligning and moving widow is ecm so isnt terrible either way for combatsin just cant be mobile and instant nor can it cloak whenever because of dronesnow that doesnt mean we need to change it like that moreover i think all the blackops need to be unprenerfed so lets think of something that would benefit all the blackops1 warpcore stab being built into the ship would be awesome or being immune to energy neuts and nos those would be awesome for blops
bumping this just because its so stupid
pointless pvp is pointless
while were at it lets just take dying out of the game that mechanic leads to nothing but tears and sadness
maybe you should actually try doing some pvp before you post about it and make a fool of yourself
i was actually quite sad this idea got support till i noticed who supported it and realised it was a troll support
this idea is so bad it doesnt even warrant a serious reply but there is also one point in the op which makes the request totally unnecessary retreat isnt missing from eve it just isnt very likely if youre a blind fat man so either use the intelligence tools available to avoid getting tied down when you arent willing to fight fit modules to break lockskill the tacklers or fly a fast ship retreat is possible but it just doesnt come without riskspoint being you arent asking retreating to be included in the game you are asking to have the ability to escape from a fight in almost every situation that is like taking the ability to prevent people from escaping a fight and removing it entirely from the game horrible idea
if you dont like being tackled you can use any of an easy dozen options there are actually more but these are the most obvious1 neutralisers to break the tacklers cap2 sensor damps to break his lock3 ecm to break his lock4 deaggress and jump through a gate or dock5 use speed to get outside his tackle range you will probably need tackle of your own to do this6 kill or drive him off using your 2 midslot advantage your tackler7 use a cloak to avoid being tackled 8 use a scout to avoid being tackled9 use the map to avoid dangerous systems10 bring friends so that you are an unattractive target11 use bookmarks and gatespots in combination with your onboard scanner to avoid being tackled12 use warp core stabilisers to avoid being tackled
rather than discourage gangs from swooping in and taking out lone pilots in lownullsec i suspect it would actually encourage more of it without the ability to trap target ships pirates would instead have to focus on popping them before they can warp out the most likely way that they would do this would be to for miniblobs so the whole thing would be selfdefeatingalso my understanding is that the devs want more ships to be lost to avoid asset accumulation so this would be counterproductive in that sense
better idea if you give me 900 trillion isk i will pvp all the damn time i will lose titans on gates when i run out of isk give me another 900 trillion i guarantee there will be an increase in pvp going on
lets just take the full leap and divide into two servers pvp and pvewould that make you happy
xestria you just made baby jesus cry
wow did you even think about the ramifications of your proposal it is so stupid that the only thing i can think of that makes any sense is that your post is a troll1 it will encourage more pvp because there is always the option to disengage and run away no it would have the exact opposite effect why bother shooting if they are going to get away2 it wipes out the scourge that is the 1v1bait you think youre getting a 1v1 but the other guy has 4 mates in faction cruisers waiting ready to warp in once youre aggressed you can just make a run for it when they appear boo hoo welcome to eve dont play stupid and youll surviveobviously youve been scrammed and destroyed because youve done something stupid rather than take responsibility for your own stupidity you are going to try to garner support for altering a fundamental part of pvp lol3 following on from 2 1v1 will be made easier4 following on from 3 more pvp combat you already said this so its kind of obvious that youve not put any thought into your argument5 hauling into lowsec will be easier by easier if you mean boring then yes6 more people in lowsec possibly but why is this a good thing7 following on from 456 more economic activity with a massive reduction in the number of ships and items destroyed it would have precisely the opposite effect
we need to do the reverse add a 60 second warp spool up every ship found in a belt needs to be destroyed that will give much more pvp
fit warp core stabs die anyways

ive never tried but i dont think you can trash the corp hangar contents that get locked down when you lose a station after the station flips and everything gets locked down shouldnt be able to simply trash it to prevent someone else from getting italso supported
sounds good tbhit will also allow many stations to be used rather than one or two and all other stations used for timer laming
ccp is not going to do anything to discourage returning players including the loss of a players gear and ships at a station if you come up with a system that does not harm the prospects of a player returning then you might have somethingas long as that something doesnt include random generation of loot of course because then you will end up with people just swapping stations over and over instead of actually defending them
ok before i get flamed if i do please read this idear first thank youat the moment gangking in high sec and low sec cuase you only take a 20 of your sec hit witch realy does not equate to what the ship is wortheg hulk geddon is realy silly killis at the moment totaling 20 bil on average a day kills in emiper and us with not much prtction at all other then oh sorry play another game somthing i dont think ccp realy wantsso what to we do leave or change the way things happen and this is why i have come to you guys on cms to help us do itif some killis you in high sec the hit on the peson should be compered to how defenceless a ship reay is eg guy in a hulk riged for mining on a average day gets hit up buy a bttle ship the the guy in a bttle ship should take a 40 drop in sec hit but your mining in battle ship eg 2 then the guy in the battle ship killing you takes only a 20 sec it or somthing colse to that been a long while since i ganked some onethis would only aplly to empier becuase we all enter 00 and low sec at our owme risk plus thers a big message waring you about entering them systemfor the folwing reson if you dont want to take a big sec hit you could just simple war dec that corp witch is the way the game it ment to be rahter than been ganked buy a coward or some one shooting a man with no wepons bcuase most of theses ships dont allow wepons i thank you for your time and hope you aregee but if not no problem at all rember please keep your postings cealn
that creates a pretty big incentive for people to just fly defenseless ships in hisec doesnt it
not realy becuase they still can get ganked
then why does it matter what theyre flying in the first place the whole point is to make attacking defenseless ships more costly than attacking defended ships so that fewer pirates will attack the defenseless
cost is rarely a factor for well anyone lolganks will still happen because its funny big ganks ie ganking ships with lots of stuff in them will still happen because its profitable
besides the protection of your bottingerrpassive income why do we needwant this again
funny how u pretty much stopped addressing low sec at this point and turned it into a suicide gank whine if u honestly thought we would miss that then u deserve to get flamedor as a 2003 player u can apply the simple concept that u should have learned of not flying what u cant afford to lose or do u think ure somehow entitled to an eternal gravy train as a vetso by your logic fittings have absolutely no relevance to how defenseless a ship is shoot a can flipper in a hulk and then in a mining battleship and see what difference it makes go aheadand u also undock at your own risk since newbies in rookie ships dont get suicide ganked then it falls on u to learn to playwait a minuteure a 2003 player and u still dont know how to play seriously do yourself a favor and go back to wow since u love the guaranteed safety of designated sanctuaries and battlegrounds in your case however u might want to avoid their pvp serversthey can still suicide gank u while ure in a neutral town news flash its a sandboxtheres no single way its meant to be played how u failed to realize that after all these years is mindboggling and btw the mining alts that 00 and 10 players hide behind r always in npc corps for the war dec immunity and yet u still want to talk about cowardice as a 2003 player theres no way u couldve missed this unless ure just that ignorant or ure also one of those cowardsmostly likely both
cuz we has no actual realistic space but ridic space with instapolice gank there also haz to be ridic ganks cuz bear no want that all space free pvp instea d dumb mechanic police instakill no skillz required if all low sec we no suicide but every1 cool
great idea
i aggreewe need a new module to build  a powerstationthis would allow for larger setups on a planet
this i got loads of cpu and no gridi got no real problem with pi atm its rather hard to get rich off it anymore though but it runs well if you leave it passive mostly
amen
hi maxyou need to upgrade the link between launch pad and storage
clearly the op was recently victim to a suicide gank no doubt in his pimped out tengu or somethingalso lol perkone
i have a better ideain order for concord to respond the attacked player has to fit a concord distress module when attacked by players this module will allow the victim to call helponce clicked concord will spawn within 812au of the target and will have to warp to the attacked victimconcord should show up on directional like any other ship warping around if the attacking ships warp out before concord lands they get out free otherwise they get concorded properpros no more magical concord protectionmore carebear tears in highsecconsnone from my point of view
the reward already exists in the form of charging less overall  a 12month subscription is significantly less money than 12 1month payments
re wyke mossarione of the downsides of having a really unlimited colony system in the spirit of sandboxeve is that somewhere someone will build a really huge colony that is capable of generating large numbers of troops on a constant basis without necessarily being able to fund an evergrowing army because troops have cyclical ownership costs if we let them seed troops back into population it creates a bit of a feedback loop basically there would be two options 1 force them to trash massive number of troops or suicide them on enemy colonies2 let them sell them the second option has the benefit of providing an entirely playerbased source of troops for new entries to nullsec or downontheirluck alliances with isk to burn but no securelarge coloniesre jhegaalaim certainly open to alternatives unfortunately whatever the sovereignty system ends up looking like has to serve a lot of different masters in terms of its goals at its most basic the system has to1 accurately reflect control over space2 have a timing mechanism that isa controlled by playersb cant be abused by players despite ac doesnt come across as totally arbitrary 3 link infrastructure and holding space then there are some of the newer concepts4 make sovereignty costs perfect so that established powers are held in check while new entries arent totally pricedout 5 link insystem activity with infrastructuresovereignty costs and the ongoing demands of the gamebase and devs6 reduce power projection range ie create locality without totally nerfing 00 pvp7 reduce incentives for blobbing either by splitting up targets or disconnecting sovereignty from dps8 try to make the whole system as plausible and nonarbitrary as possible 9 implement without too much disruption to the status quo there are certainly others and i have a lot of empathy for the devs trying to balance all these demands for what is one of the most important aspects of the game once you take into account all of these demands the number of systems possible starts to drop i think

this candidate is for a nerv of all logistics in 00 so that freighter and hauler convoys getting a new and bright future and that everyone in 00 will be forced to work 95 of his game time to make logistics instead of making pewpew its the typical attitude of a low sec griefer dont elect him
it seems as if you havent got even the slightest gist of what you are talking about if there however are any genuine questions about this matter that was discussed in the last csm summit ill be happy to address them
whats your take on the rampant botting and how are you going to persuade ccp to dedicate sufficient resources to the problem and convince them 24 hour bans are not going to stop ppl using bots
well like i said b4 allout offensive but that requires resources and were only going to get those resources if we put enough pressure on ccp via the csm of course for instance csm could advocate immediate account deletion after proof of botting in stead of a 1 day ban after which the owners start botting again ive seen several ppl admit to this happening they say as long as they dont go into rmt they are pretty much safe from perm bans that is quite shocking to me personally
what are your suggestions to increase small gang warfare in 00
how should the community view you in light of the dbank debacle
he will scam ccp for all your plex
put a scram on your hic fixedif this is the calibre of your ideas i do not hold much hope for youwhat would you do to increase small gang warfare in 00 atm the sov holders just dock up a minor annoyance at best
i replied to this earlier and my history with dbank means i understand the needs of md players and what does not work in the current system i always have taken full responsibility for what happened with dbank and while i have mixed feelings about it the experience gained from my involvement makes me a unique candidate that would be valuable to csmi actually removed this concept from my campaign after significant discussion here and in game i am actually compiling a concept to push for small gang warfare that will be more a compilation of current concepts i have that will be steps towards more small gang warfare i will be updating here when that is completed hopefully tomorrow night
im a passionate eve online player that would like to see this game continue to improve it is important to focus on fixing and growing current features of the game and as a csm representative i will serve as a check to remind ccp that looking backward is equally important if not more so than running forward communication between ccp and its players requires significant improvement and the company needs to be held accountable for all of its actions both in and out of game when you combine the potential of the sandbox that is eve and the ingenuity of its players you may imagine nearly limitless possibilities a vote for me is a vote to explore those possibilities to improve our experience and to build a better eve
personal backgroundmy name is tim pluples and im 23 years old living in queensland australia as a fulltime it manager for a government agency i am currently engaged to a beautiful fiancUFFFD who is 100 supportive of my passion for eve online and the need to be awake at all hours of the morning in eve i am known as killer2 and im the deputy leader of morsus mihi i have been playing for almost 6 years and have experience with almost all aspects of what eve has to offer i find it one of the most complex interesting and addictive games ive ever had the pleasure of playingi have strong communication skills and am a practiced negotiator in a word i am not afraid to speak my mind and i do not give up that said stubbornness is a virtue only when it serves a noble cause if im unfamiliar with an issue i will seek out an expert no matter where they live in the galaxy to solicit advice and information i sit and learn as easily as i stand and teach  it is a talent made possible through consistent diligence and reliable awarenesswhat i representvuk lau and elvenlord have both been elected as csm representatives in the past and served as chairman in previous councils they have dedicated an unprecedented amount of time and effort in ensuring that you as eve players are seriously represented and that your voices are heard by ccp game designers and developers their unfailing efforts have effected serious change in our universe and i will be a part of their legacy i will continue their work with passion and dedication to ensure that this game continues to prosper as we focus on the real issues that need the most attention the underlying issues ill be fighting for right from the start areremoving the backlog  can we fix itimplementing a shiny new toy or new functionality in expansions is nice for a little while but we often find ourselves repeating the same old argument about existing bugs issues and bizarre unintended features that impact everyday game play ccp has taken a step in the right direction by dedicating an entire team to fix bugs team best friends forever nice to see ccp getting some inspiration from the northern coalition however this isnt enough the backlog is huge and it needs real and desperate attention from ccp to resolve each item before any new piece of functionality is releasedaccountabilityfor years on end ccp has exhibited an alarming lack of accountability on various fronts whether it is promised features that were never delivered simple misworded devblogs that crashed entire markets or even inconsistent decisions and poor customer service from gms im sure weve all experienced it at least once in our careers as pod pilots each of these issues requires ccp to be accountable for their actions and to realise that everything they say or do has a direct impact on how we play or perceive the game the fundamental element to all of this is managing the expectations that ccp sets and holding them accountable communication has improved eversoslightly over the years however it is far from perfect and this needs to be addressed persistently with ccp to ensure that it is forever improvingsummaryby electing me to represent you on the csm i promise to give nothing but 110 to ensure that the real issues decided by you are brought to ccps attention and given the priority they deserve the approach is simple fix whats broken then focus on delivering new features all the while improving how ccp communicates with its players there is unlimited potential on what this game can achieve a vote for me is a vote for a better eve
thanks killer2 i know the csm is in good hands with you you have my votethirlerceothe arrow projectmorsus mihi
really that easy he describes himself and gets your vote wow maybe i should have ran for csm i like making huge wall of texts that are as simple as vote for me i will fix everything you sayexcept we have heard this before i think it is in your best interest you shared some of your ideas what you feel is broken and why then explain in detail how you will fix it after all you cant agree with what everyone says so you cant promise ccp will change everything players ask
what do you feel about small gangs in 00do you think that they should have some way of disrupting large coalitions like yourself atm all they can do is afk cloak to be a nuisance or camp jbs if they are set up incorrectly not really much that they can do apart from ganking the odd careless ratter all these activities are terrible gameplay really for smaller entitieswhat would you push for the small gang so that if they entered your space you have to react to them there has been talks on other discussions of maybe having the military ihub attackable with small gangs and although they cant damage it they could knock it down an index thus forcing the defender to defend atm all the large coalitions do is dock up until the gang has passed a minor annoyance to them at worstso what would you push for to make small gang roaming in 00 worth doingedited to addalso do you believe that jbs are overpoweredi personally do there are swathes of nc territory where you can move across the map from one side to another without even using a gate do you think that this adds to gameplay or detractshow do you feel about technetium are you of the opinion that it is game breaking or that it should stay the same
hey killer2 good to see the announcement from the perspective of someone with first hand experience of trying to make 00 worksome similar questions  points that i think people would like to know and would help clarify your positionforce projection in 00 is a hot topic with capital jump drives and jump bridges at the core what do you feel the best role these things should play long termyou mention fixing old things in the game what are some of the core issues you feel are important herelarge figts in 00 are inherently problematic from a hardware standpoint would you be for changing game mechanics to force spread deployment if it was feasiblei wish you good luck in your running having nullsec mechanics determined by players who dont live in it and dont intend to may very well kill it for its inhabitants having a knowledgeable 00 representative on the csm is therefore important for me
ive known killer2 for a little while now ive seen how he plays and takes orders as a subordinate and ive served under him and taken direction from him he is discrete trusting and decisive he is one of those people who might come to an opinion on an issue but if you approach him he is more than willing to sit with you for thirty minutes and have a strategy session to hash out ideas and detailsin the real world he deals with problems of some extreme significance that require being both involved and tactful so i think he would represent every eve player fairly and responsibly  its part of his ethos his instincts the fact that he has been exorbitantly involved in the 00 experience obviously makes him a strong advocate for those of us living out in the fringes but at the same time this gives him important perspective of the needs of the core galaxyim sure k2 has some specific answers for some specific issues and we may agree or disagree on certain issues of mechanics or development but overall im looking for someone who is experienced dedicated and fair minded regardless of which way he happens to fall on any individual subject for my money ive found my candidateand while he has rebuffed my physical advances numerous times he does have a cute butt so theres that

was thinking the same thing multiple objectives over constelations once the constelation because shall we say rf then minor objectives can be achived in that constelationbut taking the constelation needs to be the tricky and the hard part while the minor objectives can be achieved by small gangsgood thought process m8 v goodjamus
hey all thought id use jita speakers corner for this as its much more informal and collaborative way of putting an idea or set of ideas togetheranyways i wanted to get peoples thoughts and ideas on making eve feel more physicali do not mean adding additional properties to in game things to make interacting with them more interesting im talking about making combat and damage feel more realobviously you can only go so far when you only have a screen and sound as outputs for a game but i wanted to consider some things that fps games use to make damage taking seem more natural unlike having a gui to say how many health points you havei am not saying scrapping shield armor and hull hp indicators im saying include more humanlike reactions to damage taking in addition to the visual and audible hp indicatorsthere is a bit of rp that ties in with this from the eve online universe and the way capsuleers are incorporated into shipscapsuleers are connected to their ships akin to the idea behind the film series the matrix once connected the ship is you its sensors are your senses and when your ship explodes the connections are hardcut and your pods ejected into spaceat this point your human senses are still cut from your brain and your pods electronic sensors are the ones you feel with the first iteration of incarna coming soon youll finally be able to dock up remove your frail body from a pod and get back to organic sense of touch taste and smellwhat i want to do is inject a bit of the human element into how you feel the effects of combat in your eve experience anyone whos experienced a migraine youd know where im going with thismy main idea was a bit of a redout experience when taking hull damage and some very temporary blurring effects when taking considerable hits on shields armor and hullwith blurring effects becoming less temporary once you take hull damagehere are some videos on youtube with the damage effects im on about you dont tend to see these effects on most space sims as most sims you sit in a ship conventionally not jacked in matrix stylebad company 2 gameplaycall of duty 2 gameplaycrysis 2 gameplayi think you get my idea thoughbtw to all you lag fanatics this can all be done client side with no additional info to and from the server

what are your suggestions for fixing small gang warfare in 00
its that time again where csm candidates go all out in becoming a csm theres several threads atm that all say the same thing which is we will change stuff vote for us things are brokecan we actually see some ideas being suggested to give a rough idea on how you will work and what you favour can you break down each area on eve and explain in detail how you feel about it and what you would change and what your priorities will becurrently theres alot of issues from fw to 00 what do you feel is wrong in those highly criticised areas why do you think people complaining about them and how would you fix itfaction warfarelowsec00hi sec warssupercapsposesfield command shipshybridsthese are some examples obviously some of the issues are obvious but could the csm candidates in their own words explain why each one is criticised and what they would do to fix the issuesit is fine if you dont see an issue with some or wish to include your own issues

im about ready to delete my vherokoir character due to the horrible new avatars gender and bloodline only affect appearance so i see no reason why a microtransaction shouldnt be used to modify these thingsit could easily be explained ingame due to the whole cloning system which uses a dummy corpse and implants your neural map in it its not like this change would modify the characters reputation since thats linked to the name nor employment historysupported

i like your ideas especially the ingame interface you mentioned about negotiating an end to a declared war and the prohibition period that would followalso however i wouldnt agree about the griefing corporations comment i was a member of a corporation that had reached around 20 members and was wardecced for no reason we had not offended anyone interacted with any alliances or corporations we werent even recruiting in recruitment we were just wardecced and forced to disband for no reason other than lolz and i think that is what people want to stop from happening when they talk about grief

definitely combat in stations is preferably to yet more forcibly introduced pve content as long as it stays optional small derail  alas ccp doesnt have the most austere track record with optional do they incursions and that crappy useless extra chat channel ingame anyone which cannot be closed while in the incursion constellation ace game design there ccp kudosso for it to work wed prolly have to throw in a fully thoughtout game mechanic for it in the faint hope ccp takes like 10 of it screws up half of the addded brain of their own and needs three patches to fix the patch that introduces it regarding current and recent trends of what we get in terms of content well prolly end up with some sort of wrestling arena for pvp lets hope they dont call it a battleground for the lulz
i support the overall idea of making the wis environment dangerous however much has to be done to prevent the whole thing from degenerating into gangs of disposable characters running around spooning everyonesevere penalties would have to be introduced to make offing someone personally a last resort action sudden death ss loss skill point loss access loss and maybe even some type of incarceration as well as countermeasures to prevent a disposable noob alt from having much of a chance as opposed to someone who took the time to train andor equip whatever defensiveoffensive hardware that may be available npc stations would probably have the most severe penalties maybe based on the system ss player owned outposts could have the capability for percharacter settings controllable by the ownersthese are just thoughts a lot of checks balances are required to make this work in a realistic manner
finn i enjoy your enthusiasm in this post as i have in many others but i think you just need to slow down a tiny bit you have to understand that this is completely new territory for ccp this will be a staged launch that potentially in the future will be just as playable and important as spaceships what is coming with the first iteration of incarna is the most basic of the elementsif you read the blogs about upcoming features they are rife with statements about staged releases and having a new approach to the way they release content  namely that they want to do it slowly and deliberately so that it doesnt blow up in their faces and make us hate themi think what ccp is trying to do is create a space in the game to connect players more solidly to their character in so doing they can appeal to and retain more of a demographic of gamers that they might not ordinarily lure in with the promise of soul crushing lag i mean superawesomeepicmega fleet fightsfor these reasons however what ccp seems to be doing is tiptoeing around to figure out how this completely new game will fit in with the current one they are developing give them timehowever i would be remiss if i didnt throw out an idea or two as to how to make incarna content scalable to riskrewardhow about concord shows up in the stations as soldiers patrolling around they have super crazy battle armor and they will engage a criminal with extreme prejudice they could be supported by sentry towers and cameras in heavily populated areas of stationsthe security status of the systems the stations are in could also dictate the effectiveness of concord troops ccp uses this as a metric in space why not in stations it could also possibly be more granular in stations however 10 stations would have troops that vaporize you immediately lots of troops lots of guns and such but 04 stations could have only a couple of sentries and a sleeping mercenary guard in the security officeplayer owned stations could go one of two ways or both in my eyes there could be npc bought sentry guns or mercenaries or it could be left to the players themselves to police the stations it being that station access rights can be set by the sovereignty holding entity i dont see much of a problem in that respect but npc 00 stations could be extremely interestingwith all of that being said i can only say that i believe it will happen one day and not in an arena style of combat we just need to give them time to fully realize and implement any ideas they have without alienating their playerbase
i only support being able to kill in elevators if i can do it with an injection of window cleaner injected into the buttocks it leaves the brain last to die
thats why i said they should iterate on it not have it be combatready with the initial launch

make this happen ccp my suggestion would be to maybe move the hullrep to a lowslot using mod would be a main galente thing or somethingmakes no sence we got the modules for it but absolutely useless compared to the other 2 tankswould give eve even more diversity making it even more awesome than already isceb
and btw thumbs up
i hull tank if rl why cant i do it properly in eve
i really want to try my hulltanking brutix
it would be awesome if hull tanking offered something different from either armor or shield tankingperhaps the ability to counter massive amounts of dps but consume a very large amount of cap doing so or some other severe drawback
technically i would say it already does it can grant you massive buffer due to bulkheads being percentage based as opposed to flat numbers it is extremely slot efficient one resist mod gets you to 60 on all resists and the buffer is lowslot with the reps being midslot but its just really really bad at it aside from a few shining examples brutix taranis lolrevelation the thing is all of those rely on buffer and i want the ability to plausibly active hulltanksure itll need to be less effectiveefficient as armorshield i understand that but its different and more variety is always awesomesauce
not supported for the reason of ball shrinkage  hulk tank buff will mean it takes less balls to do it
i support i would like the speed loss to be reduced on reinforced bulkheads too annoys the crap out of me that the hull tanked domi i have is slower than the triple trimarked triple plated one
just realised i forgot to support
if i remember the fit rightlolmoros3x large capacitor control circuit idamage control ii6x reinforced bulkhead iicapital shield booster4x cap recharger2x capital guns either fit siege modulecyno generatorthe thing will laugh off a doomsday have 300k ehp left pop a cyno i need to go on the test server for this last bit then if allowed drop into siege and start a cap stable 10k ish tank
a humble damage control ii sets your hull resists to 60 across the board takes up only 1 lowslot and is virtually impossible to neut since it only drains 1 gj per cycle this is by far the most powerful tanking mod in the game statwise i believe actual hull tanking would be a difficult thing to really implement without unbalancing things
you can easily put another ship into 0 cap and knock out a dcu and once that things off its oh hai insurancemoar honour tank

make officers harder please the tears are awesome
no carebears must suffer but seriously slightlytougherthenregular rat dropping billions in loot when lucky the effort was laughable compared to what you have to do for deadspace mods
the last 3 officers i killed dropped barely 400 bil in lootas far as iskhour goes doing deadspace plexes is much more profitablei have done those with 2 accounts so i can compare from experience
yup ccp did that to  over ratting bots imo
carebears must suffer not supporting
less factionofficer modules in the game the betteri see nothing wrong here
qq more
supported in that difficulty should have been increased but not to this degree
supply wont drop if theres an officer in a system and someone says there is its gonna die regardless of if one person alone can take it or ten people gang on it
as far as supply of officer loot goes i think we shouldnt argue and just demand statistics from ccpdemand ccp to reveal daily average of killed officers since the patch and before the patch if they do not have this data we also need to knowif it is revealed that supply has fallen the spawn rates need to be upped accordingly and if supply is constant no need to do anything we can agree on that right
why is there some god given right of carebears that entitles them to a certain amount of chances at winning in the lotteryso what if supply is decreased by a few percent just means the unlucky carebear has to get used to a slightly longer period of single digit billions in his walletofficer crap is only really used on the blobbing ships du jour supercapitals so what if they have to make do with a deadspacenavy module here and there  the blob will still conquer allbesides less supply means you can charge even more for it when it finally drops for you only difference is that the wealth will not be shared between 10 people but rather 78 instead  big whoop
make it 34 drop rate of factionplexofficer items is ridiculously high
hirana yoshida im interested in officer loot for pvp purposes i am concerned about prices becoming too high because it would mean less people risk officer mods in pvp shipsas it is now supercarriers and titans are primary consumers of officer mods high sec carebears are secondary and small gang pvpers like me probably 3rdim sure the supercap people will have no problem affording higher prices and the high sec carebears rarely die so it is the small gang pvper that is most sensitive to price increaseits good when people use expensive mods in pvp it makes pvp more exciting and lets some people make big money from pvp activity as opposed to resorting to carebearing we should encourage high cost elite pvp dont limit it more than it is already on supply side
this and to expand on it even if the low sec pirates dont have the numbers at the time theyll just simply dock upsafespot til they do have the numbers again in reality theyre just as riskaverse if not more so than any carebear only its all reward and no riskso op if u really want to fix low sec cut down on their riskaversion such as no dockinggate jumpingsafespottingcloaking during gcc because the fact is no amount of rewards will catch a riskaverse pirate which is pretty much all of them u want them to be hunted make it so they can be caught which means preventing them from running at the slightest hint of risk this alone will be an incentive for antipirates who have at least similar numbers as the pirates because now they have a real chance of killing them instead of putting up with the usual run  hide crap
its not about the iskhr its about having fun  and pew is fun far more than missionsat this point id like to point out my proposal here it details a bit more behind the reasoningworking for this kind of proposalthe thought is to take players who would normally be carebearing in empire and avoiding pvp at all costs and give them an incentive to get a group together and go out hunting pirates particularly if they wouldnt otherwise if this worked it would give pirates more targets to shoot and make more pew happen making more ships go boom and more loot drop sure there are pirate hunters out there already but this should encourage more and possibly rich inexperienced ones at that tying it to insurance payouts would ensure that it couldnt be exploitedto be perfectly honest pirates should be on the run from the law  otherwise wheres the excitement
i understand what your saying but i do not think that you have thought it through completely as you note the people you are trying to reach are players who avoid pvp at all costs by supplying an isk faucet the op is trying to entice those players out of highsec however there is no financial reason to leave highsec unless the iskhr is greater once you calculate shiptime loss and if you are unwilling to ensure bounty hunting makes more iskhr than highsec l4s then it is pointless to offer a financial incentive to achieve your goal they would still be better off running missions in highsec for isk and then coming to lowsec for pewpew fun as i said however the pewpew fun incentive is already there therefore there is no newmore reason to go to lowsec than what is currently the caseadding an isk faucet does do one thing though it makes it easier for people who wish to shoot everything that moves to stay operational financially meaning that those who have by some peoples accounts overfished lowsec are being rewarded
low sec and even null sec belt rats are pushovers yes this is very obvious and for their rewards its quite balanced howeverif the rats were harder and not just a little like a belt would take a good five minutes to clear more reward obviously low sec would be a lot more popular not only for ratting but also ganking due to the time it takes to rat alone atm it takes me less than 20 seconds to toast a guristas battleship using lasers for 800000 isk and maybe 100k in modules garbage money garbage shipi know were capsuleers and and all but its still annoyingly boring to rat feeling so safe and secure increase their damage active defense and overall buffer while at the same time increasing their bounty meta drops and even tech ii maybe and security influencei am very pleased with the changes to commander npcs btw
you somehow assume that more people will come ratting to low sec because it will be easier to gank themi am not following your train of thought there
it will be worth the reward right now why would someone go into low sec for 800k if theyre lucky enough to find a bs in low sec when they can just run a mission with tens of battleships worth more than that
also  my alt for starting with ahave to switch every ing time
because this will only encourage and reward blobbing even more especially when theyre just waiting for fish to bite because anything less would not be enough to killtank the buffed rats in time before someone interferesnot supported
if that was true 00 space would be full of people eager to exploit the local riches yet 00 remains the least populated space in eve
youre right guys  low sec lets just not come up with any ideas and not change anything cause it will break everything
i am for increasing the difficulty of your every day rats including missions and such may be a stretch but having to use more than one unless elitefit person to run a level 4 mission would make things a bit more interestingalso increase the bounties and rewards proportionally to the increase in difficulty with the rats
that would be good even if it probably will not hurt bots for more than a few days about the employ 1 person to hunt bots only i suspect ccp has more than 1 guy doing that lets look a few numbers 300k accounts around the world no more than 8 work hours in a day lets be very generous and say that you can investigate 6 bots at the same time and that you need 1 hour to be sure remember ccp need to be 9999 sure it is a bot that each guy is a botresult 48 suspected bots investigated in 1 work day 5 day a week 240 suspected bots investigated less than 11000 of eve population with those numbers you cant even keep in check the rtm guys and you check only 1 time zone every day and a single botter if not reported as suspicious could go on for 3 years without being bothered
rather than manually investigating each and every player in the game wouldnt it make sense to build routines that flag activity by tracking players with the most exceptional activity most of the player base can be eliminated from any investigation for example playing 100 hours a week without going afk for any amount of time doesnt make you a bot but it is suspicious mining 10m m3 of ore in a week doesnt make you a bot but it is suspicious completing 250 lv4 missions in a week doesnt make you a bot but it is suspicious killing 5000 belt rats in a week doesnt make you a bot but it is suspiciousby investigating only the players with the most suspicious levels of activity that 1 employee wont need to investigate all 300k accounts once an account has reasonably been proven to be a bot its not much of a reach to find out who the bot is working for and from there any other bots working for that player once you have an active player thats known to be operating bots looking at the players he associates with is likely to turn up many more bots much like pulling at a thread in cloth once a single thread comes loose the whole thing starts to come unraveled once you have several players that are well documented bot operators dont just ban the bots very public banning of the bots and their operators is needed in order to show players that there actually are repercussions to breaking the eula once players at large understand that ccp does take the eula seriously and is doing something about it much of the nonrmt bot problem will disappear on its ownsure smarter bot operators will change their activities in an attempt to not stand out but if its the most effective bots that cause the most harm to the game wouldnt having all bots actively trying to be less effective be a minor victory1 for getting rid of bots
durnin the routines can get you only so far lets say ccp has a routine flagging accounts logging more than 16 hours day for 3 days in a week week at that point the employee should activate more advanced tracking routines aimed at the accounts you cant have then always tracking every account it would require too many database calls and use too much cpu after some day the employee should check the first results  the subjects have reduced the activity to normal levels  keep them under observation for a time this kind of choice can be done automatically the subjects continue to do an abnormal level of activity the employee need to check what they do and that is where he start spending a lot of time that is hard to automatize the first part of the process selecting the people to check is almost totally automatic but the actual check to be sure the guy is a bot is time consuming sure you dont need to really check every account selecting them randomly but then there are plenty of new accounts every day and following the tracks of professional botters can be hard i suspect that my hypothesis of around 50 accounts checked not tracked but actually selected for the latter part of the check for probable bot use is fairly preciseccp can do mass bans only when the botters use programs with some identifiable routine and they buy the bot available on the net to check for identifiable routines it was in a dev post some time agoor if they get a key guy in a rmt net and can ban all the linked accounts in one go then there are the tricks that a botter can use to reduce the chance to be identified if i was a rmt guy or even a normal guy botting to increase my income i would not run the same account 23 hours day i would accept a lower return and run 2 accounts botting for 11 hours with each of them that way i would be under the radar for a lot of automatic scan systems if the numbers that we see for the bots are right loosing the isk to purchase 2 plex instead of one will be the last problem for the botter i am sure that someone dong that for a living will find way better ways to foil detection that my simple idea so it is not easy and it is time consuming ccp is a company and they will try to balance around the point where the benefit of removing botters is equivalent or higher to the personnel costs they are incurring to ban them that is why they are hunting rmters way more vigorously than normal guys botting better return for hour of work
i understand that and agree entirely theres only so much that behavior tracking can do before good old fashioned manual investigation is required over time behavior tracking will give you a much better signal to noise ratio and a place to start investigating but thats all it can doid think that the balance point would more likely be where bot accounts removed and cost incurred doing it is offset by player accounts saved and recovered theres probably very little evidence showing that in comparison to the number of new accounts created specifically for botting players are leaving in with any frequeancy specifically due to botting or that players would return en mass if botting were eliminated that lack of data would make the math rather one sided in favor of the status quo
while we are at it why dont we just take out all weapons systems completely ooh i have a better idea why dont we replace the ammo with innocous stuffed animals and make laser weapons shoot out rainbows insteadseriously tho if pvp isnt to your liking dont pvp

a similar topic was posted on the features forum a few months ago and the comments where equally unfavourable in the other post it was suggested that warp disruption would not be possible in lowsec i can understand why people already resident in null and low would find this sort of change so upsetting because it would totally change the environment they operate ini notice that the comments here are much the same that were posted in the features forum most focus on the adapt or die it would kill small gang pvp and whats the point if people can just warp off im not entirely sure that these comments are correctadapt or dietrue you can fit your ship so that you increase your chance of avoiding combat but as every pirate who knows their trade most fits can be easily countered in many cases just being faster than your target is enough to make a fight very one sided it would kill small gang pvpi think this change would actually encourage solo and small gang combat given the option to run i think more people will be willing to have a go granted the chance of getting a kill are reduced but i would hope the number of engagements would increasewhats the point if people can just warp offim going to assume that wartargets and criminals bounty hunting anyone can still be scrammed this means that legitimate from a concord point of view targets can be locked down and destroyed without mercy i also think that some pilots will fight to the death especially if the fight is close ive heard many stories of people choosing to stay and fight even when they could warp offthere are many negative aspects to a change like this the piracy and ransoming professions would be severely affected it would also be a very unwelcome boost to macro miners and macro ratters i dont support such a draconian change but i do think that idea has some merit ultimately we will never know how players will react to such a change until its on tranquillity
did you wake up fall and hit your headlet me help you out broif disruptors were removed there would be no kills at alleverybody is a  at heart and nobody likes to lose ships so its oh hitting low armor time to go everybody would just constantly warp off so kills wouldnt be reduced they would literally not happen at all and on the off chance somebody did die youd probably be laughed out of your alliance or corp because why didnt you just warp offi swear some of the ideas posted here are from bleach drinking s cause this is the dumbest  i have ever read in print
i guess the red mist came down before you read the sentence that said the op was not supported the only reason that i suggested the op had merit was that if it was applied to 04 sec for example it could allow people to transition from hisec to low and null
is this good or not
there should be a way to filter guests when docked at a stationif i want to trade to a player especially in jita i should be able to at least say show me only corp members  high standing people  red standingsuch a pain to try to right click on a toon when its constnatly getting shifted up and down as people dock and undockjust a thought
if youre docked in a station with someone who is in the same chat as you you can right click their name in the chat box alliance corp personal chat and select trade even on the address bookthumbs up cause it wont hurt
im not sure what kind of advanced mathematics go into finding a route so some explanation of these esoteric formulae would be nice if nothing else the ability to drag the current route through other star systems similar to how most mapping websites do or a layout of the various options would be nicesupported
atm pvp is very hard to escape from unless you have scorpions and falcons when youre tackled discouraging people from engaging even when the odds are eveni believe a lot more pvp would take place if warp disruptors had a reuse time of one minute and disrupted for 30 seconds and scramblers for 1 minute with a 130 cooldownsure youd lose a lot of kills but at the same time youd also get engaged a lot more if someone knows they have a chance to escapei trol u not
and the need to bring even more dps to fights would result in even larger blobs and yet more lagi call bs on your claim of not trolling us
er if you have 2 people with a disruptor you can permanently disrupt someone if you time it right troll rejectedalso wtf you think people actually fit disruptors in blobsits called a hic
dont think just in terms of 00 warfare pvp in lowsec is a difference beast altogether one where solo and small gang warfare is quite viable your proposal would nerf it by like de said causing people to bring enough numbers to ensure a kill rather than rely on an unreliable modulealsoif theyre smart yes doesnt matter if youre in 00 lowsec or wherever unless you are a logi or antisupport ship ie falcon you always fit a point in pvp if for no other reason other than to have multiple redundanciesbackups for when the initial point failsnot supported
the point of pvp is to kill the enemyif the enemy escapes the entire fight was completely pointless your idea makes pvp pointless
100
the obvious consequence to this would be that everyone uses stations in empire and npc 00 to store all their junk and holds a bare minimum of ammo and 1 or 2 spare ships in alliance outpostsi mean if thats what you want to happen then fine i guess but it doesnt actually result in any of the benefits that you list
tend to agree with this assessment changes would be negative for pretty much everyone attacker and defender bothwhen hangar divisions for personal hangars make their appearance it could potentially apply for whatever is in the general tabfurther it should apply only to noninhabited hangars so that the presence of a clone in a given station exempts those assets then it would make sensebut nothing even remotely resembling such a thing should be considered until acquiring a station takes more than blobbing like fat chicks in the snack isle and scs have their antistructure capabilities removed read when null is once again worthwhile
losing a huge strategical asset  all stuff in it is already pretty hurtingthis is a joke right a boost to small gang warfare it is a boost to supercapital fleets laying waste to everything they see while travelling at ridiculous speed arround it is a boost to blobbing since right now the main reason for a powerblock to not kill a smaller entity and take his stations is effort with this they wouldnt do much else so even more than now you must be part of a huge powerblock and then the looting part small gang warfare because they undock industrials one by one which you get cheap ganks on hint i wouldnt call ganking an industrial really small gang warfare too bad that will never happen better idea anchor pos on moon preferably instaundock moon if possible put a titan in the pos and one in the system where you want the loot freighters dock load undock warp to titan bridge unload bridge back etc within 12 hours max the entire station is empty and the operation is protected by their supercapital fleet it already has enoughthe ability to defend stations is completely unrelated to the amount you have which is one of the main problems with eves sov atm it doesnt take much more effort to defend 100 systems instead of 2 systems so a smaller entity cant just defend 2 systems against a slightly larger one with 100 systems if anything you need more stations to distribute your stuff moreand how is that related to docking games a dead ship doesnt defend a station  better dock and repair then get killed
bumpcould this be pushed through csm to ccp as gallente frigates are clearly out of the line
the problems with t1 frigates go way beyond this
definitely on the other hand ccp is most likely not going to make any larger scale balance changes as balancing isnt their priority nor much of an interest so this little and obvious issue might get an attention
tristan is actually pretty damn good better than a top tier hybrid platform would be takes a lot more skills due to split weapons but its a powerhouse thanks to the new rockst1 frigates are suffering badly from the tier system with only top tiers seeing any real use while the idea of a small change may look enticing it will still require the big picture to be examined so one might as well do it all at once
capsuleers are supposed to be gods in comparison to regular people they will never die and all have a great impact on the universe in every station isnt there supposed to be millions of people inhabiting it rich people in huge shiplike buildings regular joes in apartments and even fishy looking people in slumshow about making drugs boosterscarryable items so when you undock from your ship there are areas where you can go down and walk alongside the peons below to trade drugs with other legendary star ship podpilots who hang out in shady areas of course there would be a risk to this such as customs officers checking you notsothoroughly maybe depending on a social skillthis way you could take nonsnyth drugs completely off the highsec market seeing as how they are illegal anyways and make drug dealing a real profession
i dont think you need to worry about this from everything the devs have said so far incarna will focus pretty heavily on black market transactions

this problem kinda discriminates against amarr pilots doesnt itmaybe i think that cuz im amarr
while youre at it the drone sub could use some love as well possibly an extra turret to make it a better splitweapon sub
either boost the legion or nerf all the other t3s i prefer boosting the legion
most cloaky t3s have poor dps  its because of the cloaky sub the thing that gets me is that cloaky t2 cruisers get to have drones but cloaky t3s ie more advanced dont not even simply 5 lights or 3 even ffsi would say that the best improvement to t3s would be adding drones to all offensive subs just less but  0 for the cloaky ones
agreed
right now some of the named loreimportant npc like abel jarek or jamyl sarum got horrible random generated faces that have nothing to do with the portrets in evelopedia sure there are more important things to do but lore is important to some of usso if ccp has no time to waste on such things  why not to let players to do it it can be a simple event where anyone who wants to join presents the picture all ccp has to do is to choose a few most fitting avatars and add replace the horror we have now

dont lie because you self wrote00 logistics currently are too easy and cheap imoas im stated before dont elect this candidate because he will make your life in 00 to a hell
even though according to recent publications everyone seems to have underestimated the problem somewhat ccp has taken the problem quite seriously from what i could gather in the past csm terms it seems there is a need to do some more however and i will not hesitate to push that subject because even in the most optimistic estimates botting is having a huge influence in the eve economy and political landscape the trouble with fools is that they can be so damn persistentyou keep reading this very selectively and interpreting it as if it were a threat made personally against youthere is no doubt that the proliferation of supercaps and the ability of an army to move all the way across the galaxy in a matter of hours is having a quenching effect on pvp large and small whos gonna engage a 10 vs 10 when you know there is a hotdrop inbound who can afford to leave his homespace for a few days because the enemy could move over enforce tonight and siege it these are in my opinion some of the overarching problems that 00 and lowsec currently face and we have been discussing possible solutions at length ideas were let loose some of which are apparently so radical that people like you have difficulty realising that we are trying to think up ways of making the game better if you have alternative ideas on how to fix these problems dont hesitate to voice them because we are after all your representatives
you are mixing up force projection and logistics and i remaind poeple here what you have written 00 logistics currently are too easy and cheap imo i dont know wheter you are always was be active in corp logistics or not but you are showing no competance and messing up a good intention to remove force projection managing production and delivery a ship in an ongoing war can be an exhausting job if than one like you try to mess with the logistic chain this will be the death to many smaller entitys in 00 while big coalitions can engange their carebear force im a pilot that want pewpew and not endless convoys or the result that a small alliance isnt able to secure the supply thx for the fool i give it back to you
what if we can make the game better and give you more and more interesting pvp by tweaking 00 logistics what if we made construction in outposts and at poses easier so you can build stuff locally and not have to import everything from empire that would offset much of the inconveniences that regular players would suffer from a logistics nerf whilst at the same time making it more difficult to construct supercaps which currently is stupidly easyyou are completely forgetting the big picture there is a lot to be gained by everyone from an overhaul of the way items and ships are made and transported in 00 i want to make it easier and more interesting for the regular players and more challenging for the multibillionaires and their supercap toys
how are you planning on pushing this issue if i may ask i hope you will advocate for more rigorous punishment having a fleet of 00 bots banned for 24 hours and being back the day after is certainly not going to solve the problem for instance
the problem with bots is that you have to be damn sure that it actually is a bot before banning one to prevent losing legit customers and causing a pr disaster so improving detection methods with the aid of players who undoubtedly know a thing or two about bots  is one important factor as well as enforcing the eula by warnings and bans if a warning or temp ban does not suffice to stop the botting more serious actions may be appropriatechanging pve and market mechanics to make botting more difficult without hindering the players is also a possibility but again this has to be carefully considered
i get what youre saying here but botters almost never admit to botting and absent the ability to scan someones computer botting is a nearly impossible charge to prove people can claim to be drunk halfasleep really bad at the game etc all ccp can really do is the oneday ban for the first offense and wait to see if that player is reported againas i said its really tough to get a botter to admit to botting and interestingly its just as tough to get players to actually report bots because theres a perception that ccp wont do anything about the bot anywaychicken meet egg
ok fair warning this is a long response just remember you asked that really openended question thats an excellent question smallgang pvp was and is my first love in eve and its being slowly murdered by the blobfirst this isnt a problem that one person is going to solve something im going to do even before the elections is hold player roundtables on three issues pvp blobs jump logistics and empire wardecs ill be posting in the relevant eveo threads asking for interested parties to join me in a discussion on those three issues ill record those roundtables and put them online on my website that will happen in ten days or so once the official candidates list is out even if im not selected i hope the recordings will be useful to whomever is selected to csm6 obviously if im one of the people selected im going to formally write up the best proposals and ideas out of those roundtables and put them out on the assembly halland if the csm votes down those initial ideas then ill hold additional roundtables with more players after the elections until we come up with some proposals that the csm does like and feels comfortable submitting to ccpso thats the first idea i have get more players involved in the solutionnow with that said i have a few ideas on all three of these topics most of these ideas are probably complete junk thats where players come in to help me separate whats junk from what isnt the first problem is getting small gangs to engage a couple of weeks ago i was fcing a small intycruiser gang about seven total when we came upon a bait hurricane on our outgate he aggressed my scout and i obligingly ordered my scout to return the favor the rest of us jumped in and warped we had no logi our heaviest ship by far was my ship a vaga we had one other t1 cruiser and some t2 frigs uh oh says my scout turns out the cane was bait for a six ship gang that included two more bcs two t2 frigs and an oneiros six total way more than we could handle still we hadnt gotten a kill because every other gang wed come across had run from us so i gritted my teeth called the oneiros primary and the other fleet fled from us through the gate as soon as the cane could lose aggrohow do we get small gangs to engage thatll be the first question for the roundtable i personally favor either longer aggro timers enforced wait times on gates depending on traffic similar to current traffic control but much shorter wait times but much easier to trigger or both wheres the carrot on getting small gangs to engage not sure need some help with that onemore in my next post
continued from last postone idea that ive seen bandied about that i dont personally agree with is somehow trying to force sovholders to come out and play by allowing small gangs to attack sov structures this puts too much of a disadvantage on smaller alliances that cant maintain allaround tz coverage if your primetime is eutz and mine isnt you shouldnt be allowed to knock out station services just because you can put a small gang up at that time and i cant i would like to see smaller alliances hold sov allowing a larger entity to bully a smaller entity just encourages that smaller entity to join a blob  the opposite of what i wantnext thing blobs are out of control because they can be thats another root cause to the death of smallgang pvp and its almost zen in its simplicity if you put a fleet into fleet finder and open it up to blue standings your fleet will grow if you have a lot of blues it will grow until the fc is satisfied with the size and makeup i think it was trebor that said a fleet will grow to the size of available lag or something to that effect how to address this one would be the second question for the roundtable i have a goofy idea here that is probably stupid but might might work artificially limit the number of blues an alliance can set you can have three or so 10s you can have five or so 5s and thats it choose wisely might be an incredibly dumb idea probably some major downside that im not seeinganother related idea would be to bite the bullet and reconfigure the corporation management skills to cut the number of players that can be added to a corp with the sovereignty skill youre adding a thousand players per level thats just nutsfor the carrot on this one i think itd also be nice if eve had some kind of mechanic for fc rep this would need an addition to the api some kind of functionality that would allow each kill with more than five people and fewer than 40 people on it to be assigned not only to the pilots on that kill but to the fc for that engagement which would be the fleet boss at the moment of the killmail to encourage new fcs to keep trying you also get rep for loss mails suffered while youre fleet boss want to lead a 20pilot fleet build up rep points leading smaller fleets first this is very pieinthesky but i think fc rep would quickly become a status symbolanyway thats enough to start ive got a few ideas on this topic and have thought about it a bit as you can see but idea one is to get player roundtables set up to discuss this issue with players

why the goons are smearing metldr the mittani is running on a platform that only he and his friends can make the csm effective so its important to discredit anyone who can put the lie to his fundamental argument the bottom line is csm 5 has been extraordinarily effective and i am one of the biggest reasons whythis is why i am a huge threat to their plansin recent days ive been the target of a smear campaign by the goons claiming that all of my ideas are bad that im a dangerous idiot i find this particularly amusing since one of my core beliefs is that i should never try to lobby for my own ideas my job is to be a representative of the players and push for the things they wantwith that in mind lets consider what i did during csm 5 and the results they generatedfirst of all i did the prioritization crowdsourcings in august and november which helped get more csm issues addressed in incursion than ever before influenced the assignment of team bff to pothole filling in incarna and helped them populate their backlogthe csm proposals i raised were links in previous postsimprove overload user interfaceplanetary interaction omnibus proposalscanning colorsmodify or remove learning skillsuser interface  big wins fan favorites and low hanging fruitpossibly practical pos performance proposalall of my proposals passed all of them were developed by the players not one of them was one of my allegedly bad ideasthe results ccp has plucked some of the ui low hanging fruit and team bff is harvesting even more at this very moment and the other proposals are chock full of big bang for buck items so its likely that some of them will get addressed in the near futurethis has been my consistent strategy  to give ccp big boxes of irresistible little chocolates  each only a small amount of work  and let them choose which ones are the tastiest to give them a list they can go to when a dev has an extra week or two and needs something to do  oh look theres a tasty little caramel given the competition for resources at ccp its a strategy that gets resultsbut of all of my proposals the one i am proudest of was the one about learning skills  but not because i think it convinced ccp to remove them rather after the june summit it became clear to me that new player retention was a major concern at ccp and that removing learning skills was an obvious way to improve retention it was going to happen sooner or later so i made damned sure there was a new playeroriginated proposal that gave the players the best possible deal if learning skills went awayccp killed learning skills almost exactly the way the players who helped me shape that proposal suggested in fact the one tiny element they didnt implement caused most of the small amount of player dissatisfaction with the changei hope youll consider my trackrecord carefully and honor me with your vote and please read trebors guide to mud which addresses the consequences of the smear campaign on the prospects of other qualified candidatesthe mittani clearly considers me the greatest threat to his plan to pervert the csm to his own purposes that should tell you everything you need to knowafter all you can tell a lot about a man by who his enemies areso vote wisely and tell your friends to do the same spread the word this election is very important dont sit back and let it be stolen by a bunch of goons to make it easy for you ive whipped up a simple media kit it contains a message you can email and evemail a few minutes of your time could make a huge difference to the gamethank you for your time and attentiontrebor
well i know for one that you will get at least one or even more of my votesyou have been the voice of progress in this csm progress as in actually getting ccp to listen to you allgood luck
its the bunny slippers that got mei have watched the actions of the csm closely and you are certainly one of my favourites so atleast 1 of my accounts is going to vote for you
got my one and only vote sir it was a pleasure working with you on csm5 i have no doubt you will well prepared due to your csm5 experience to do an even better job on csm6 good lucki hope you get chair
caught you on a podcast when you announced you were running good interview you have my vote
 me you not running again mynxee
fraid not a career changeselfemployment will require all my attention this year i will have neither the time nor energy to do justice to a csm seat soi do hope those who might have voted for me will instead vote for trebor and if not him one of the other candidates i endorse
while i have completely different pow on the game compared to trebor i must give him kudos for his efforts in csm5 mature smart old notreallywitty old dedicated did i said old guy who puts lots of passion into csm if you are empire dweller trebor is your best bet he is kinda clueless about 00 and pvp but he is giving his best to approach every issue properly also extremely important he is one of the rare guys not biting my trolls and calming the discussions downanyway as i said already somewhere despite going on my nerves constantly he is one of the best csm delegates i worked with
while i obviously believe a vote is best given to me for those who intend on voting for robert i can only say that he is a good candidaterobert and i regularly have differing opinions about things more often than not actually however robert always welcomes and partakes in constructive criticism of all ideas is the majority of the time willing to amend his or find a compromise with others to reach a good approach robert sometimes doesnt know things thats true but he is willing to accept others knowledge to supplement his own a trait that has been lacking in many csm members in the pastrobert possesses an apparently unquenchable fountain of energy that he uses abundantly for all things related to the csm of all 4 terms i was a member of i can safely say hes the member who spent the most time and effort working on thingsbut god can he ramble on and on and on before making his point sometimes looking forward to seeing you in csm 6 robert 
sounds like my kind of guy anyone willing to push for refining what is already there and hopefully make eve challengingfun for the individual again is good people in my bookps make sure ccp doesnt give up what little momentum they finally acquired in getting rp back in eve
i know its a terrible habit i picked up from you stephan
i must say that you were a stellar delegate if youll excuse the pun and so you have my one and only vote heres to another year of improvements to the gameplay and fixes to the bugs er um unintended features 
im endorsing this candidate 
you have my vote for sure great run this year hope to see a lot more progress next year dbtw dont forget our poor dead horse
my goals as a member of csm 6eve online  iterations is the cornerstone of my campaign to me eve online has always been a game about spaceships unfortunately ccp seems more focused on some grandiose vision of creating the ultimate sci fi simulator instead of effort to improve the core game play of the best spaceship pvp game on the market they continue to push in all directions at once which might be worth buying into if there was some evidence of a cohesive plan that connects it all and gives each element a reason to exist in a game play contextmy main priority will be pushing for the iteration and balancing of current features sure i want to see new content as well but iteration of the current game play would virtually guarantee new content as part of the processi doubt im alone in stating that if ccp had spent the last several years refining planetary interaction  incarna to be more along the lines of planetary warfare  mech piloting there might be more excitement among the current player base even better a complete refocus on nothing but the spaceship aspect of the game would most likely have made a lot dare i say a majority especially of longerterm players happyecstatic even imagine where eve might be today had all of these art and technical resources been put toward sovereignty iteration factional warfare expansion a low sec makeover industrial balancing and just every day spaceship balancing and current feature iterationi am not interested in more stuff  i want the stuff we have now to be complete and work properlyeve  who am ii started playing eve in beta 6 back in early 2003 i have had at least one active eve account from the week the servers went live until today in that time ive played eve at every conceivable level my most well known role is that of the ceo of body count inc and founder and leader of the old mercenary coalition alliance ive known the joys of wiping out capital fleets and killing titans i know the pain of losing the sameadditionally i have been the ceo of one of the largest industrial corps in the game and also coordinated the activities of several smaller industrial corporations i have done industrial work involving dozens of t2 bpos and coordinated logistics for outpost and super capital construction although i am quite wealthy today i mined omber in a punisher for two weeks to earn the isk for my first cruiser bpoin my time as a player ive made several videos and written several well known war reports one of the most detailed of which was the north reloaded i have seen all the highs and lows that eve has to offer and my passion for the game still burns brightlyi am one of you and i want to take my experience as a player and a former dev back to iceland as a member of the csmrl  who am imy name is mark heard i am 37 years old married with a family and split my time between homes in the united states and germany i was a member of the united states army for four years before going to work for the us department of defense for several years in late 2006 i was hired as a game designer at ccp a job i held until february of 2010 when i resigned to return to work in the defense industryi dont care about free trips to iceland ive had plenty of those when i worked at ccp i dont care about getting a job there because done that im doing this because i want to build on the progress that csm 5 made and take it to the next level i believe that my experience as a former employee combined with my passion for what makes eve online unique in the gaming world can be a potent combination in representing the interests of the community

comfirming my endorsement of seleene 
seleene if i had another vote to give you would get it sorry trebor earned my 1 vote for his work on csm5 i believe you will bring something to the csm that it has never had before and that is a solid understanding of how things are done at ccp how best to communicate and the most effective potential solutions to getting around obstacles and challenges related to communications and process issues that have been stumbling blocks for every csm so far besides that i feel it is very important for the csm as a whole to approach their duties with understanding and consideration of all play styles not just the socalled null sec endgameeven though its clear that you can speak authoritatively on that as well given your experiences both in game and as a dev from our many discussions i am sure that you can do that knowledgeably and in a respectful way i urge everyone to seriously consider the unique value you will bring to csm6 and cast a vote in your favornow all that said what are your views on low sec and how it can be improved and whether  as some people ask  it needs to be improved
friendly bump
here i will help you get the ball rolling on your thread what do you think are biggest problem points in eve current do you currently have any ideas on how to fix these problemsif so how
read my manifesto summary the termination of nullsec renterspace stop the mafia extortion of paying for space elimination of powerblocksvacuums making it harder to maintain coalitions between alliances a fair chance to empire corporations alliances to settle in 00 space balance nullsec by making all of nullsec worth more technetiumneodymium fair play more challenge  a kudo system for corporationsalliances in order to reward participation the cost of clonecontracts should be reviewed  should be setup differently no fun pvp with a 45m clonecontractif you want to see the game changed fair and square then you need me as anti kartel csmto get me in csm 6 as anti kartel csm i need at least 2500 votes to get some power within the councileveryone deserves a chance to experience 00 space based on fair playno more petalliances and renter slaveshow see my manifestofree yourself your corp your alliancevote ms pacmanedit a topic started at scrapheap challenge
what i like to see implemented is that renting space to others can in future only be done through rent slotsrenting through a rent slot can be done by a ceo or added rolethe advantage of this will be that ccp will get control over rent space and their money flows ccp can then also limit the number of systems andor corporations that an alliance can rent out to othersexamplefictional system qbatestsovereignty demo alliancesystem licenced to rentingcorpthat is also what i meant by termination of renterspace as it is today as the way systems are currently being rented has totally gotten out of controlany other way of renting out systems should be a violation of the eula once rent slots are being introducedalliances wont be able anymore to rent space to other alliances with the introduction of rent slots this in my perspective to make it harder to maintain coalitions between alliancesthats why everyone not in these dictator coalitions should vote for the antikartel csm ms pacman if ms pacman would get 10000 votes she will be able to appeal to ccp based on her total votes when its needed
so your candidacy is based on removing the sandbox because you think some groups are playing in it the wrong waylol get the  out
your alliance is one of the kartels in evehow much are you charging for a system
theres so much at stake for so many players and ccpers alike that solutions are complicated and when they are unsubtle they are bound to ruin someones day short answers is its in progress
so you are basically saying the same as that guy above just with more words seriously considering the sorry state of so many core features not only but also 00 one gotta wonder who sets ccps priorities why when and in the way they are looks more and more like those decisions are made by people who hardly if ever play the game
youre more right there than you would likeand the csm is there to remind them what their priorities ought to be
ccps top secret priority list leaked1 walking in stations2 walking in stations3 walking in stations4 walking in stations5 walking in stations6 captains quarters7 appeal to other mmo players with a gimmick idea see 18 walking in stations9 walking in stations10 think about fixing bugslowsecnullsec11 walking in stations12 other content that nobody cares about
oops
and the first post trolls the opi think it would be an interesting idea my concern is that it does not add enough to the game to really make it immensely desirable i also get the impression you are assuming the pod ships are designed to integrate with painstress part of the brain which might not be the case need to check lore a ship exploding might not bother the capsuleer at all physically alright enough rp for me while i could see it being fun to have some human element the point of capsuleers is that they are improved humans a little more rp and really i feel this might take away from the game play of eve more than it would add anything make it optional i suppose
oh wow thanks for the lol i guess
thanks for the information
ya hybrids they need some thing more damage or more tracking or a new ability fluff wise they are the marage of energy and projectile damage but dont reflect that in realty there plasma guns in most games that puts them at the top of the damage list and in my head brings to mind super heated molecules but alpha is kinda the projectile thing may be give hybrids a dot like poison in fantasy mmorps representing the plasma sticking to the ship as it cools or a speed reduction for a second or two because of the added mass of the plasmathe ammos meterals like lead are not very light
hybrids rebalancing is most old and most important issue in the list
hybrids are on the first page with 2 separate topics of blasters 20 and rail gun fix
yes a new look on the pos would be great and a board room would even be sweet for meeting of said corp

they need polish better jump range 4 lytitans still have a job moving every thing else ever whats the use being sneaky if you cant get there and all should probably do ewar stuff and damage bumps and the all around t2 stuff they all getbetter fitting and race resistimho they should give them cov op cloak but with the above stuff they would be useful enough for now
no
no
noby doing this ccp will accidentally eve it will be bad
no
perhaps they should develop a release schedule that alternates between new features and polishing of old onesmaybe a release every 4 months but every other one isnt so much a bug fix do those in every release as a finish the missing parts of a feature previously introduced so we would end up with a new feature every 8 months but it would be complete ie excellent the 4 months after initial release would give them time to add the polishing touches and determine what tweaks should be made as well
supported
4th is needed and like there big brothers one ship should tank  one should gank tho an over hall may be needed for some eg caldari the tank ship is the missile boat witch is from the manufacturer that doesnt specialize in tank i dont know if thats the only one thats like that but i likes me some fluff and would like to see the abilitys reflect that
as of 223 this idea is being considered by csm5 and has a chance of being presented to ccp thanks go out to csm5 and vicechairman dierdra vaal for discussing the proposal with me special thanks go out to the players for their support
bridge madnesssame madness in another viewkill the bridges
ya hybrids in need some thing the races that use them both use different damage types with there other weapons maybe blasters doing more term and rails doing more ken and rails dont bring any thing to the table that makes them different there just a in between lasers and projectiles i like that fluff wise but they dont reflect that in game eg cant change ammo faster and cant change the flavor of damage
hybrids do need rebalance i agreebut this issue is at least 2 years old every time someone bring it to discussion a large group of minmatars amarrs drake pilots miners noobs etc break into tread and tell that hybrids are fine and nothing changes
hello everyonei have a few remarks about the new character creation system im aware that it is still in development and that enhancements will arrive later accessories tatoos etcbutwhere are all the fun and science fiction clothing all the clothing is now very normal and seems like regular nowdays clothing not spaceship pilot clothing why the change of stylehow come i cannot make my character fat or skinny are ugly people put aside in eve online does every character have to look like ken or barbie i feel that we see enough of this everybodyisperfectandbeautiful crap on tvwhere are all the fun backgrounds the ones with the colored strays for instance every background is now very depressingall the lights are white when will we be able to have colored lights againi tried to make my character smile and be confident as he was before on the old portrait i wasnt able to do it every expression is now very mild and moderate why not letting more freedom in the expressionsi can see that put much effort has been put in the new character creation system but maybe all the little details that can be tuned now jaw width color of eyebrows ears orientation etc are less important than more obvious things such as flashy clothes nasty faces and silly saladbowlheadwear i so miss mine those things make a difference between characters they allow players to have a character with actual character not just regular looking nonsmilingnorfrowning robotsplease dont take this wrong i love eve im just afraid that its original spirit is fading away with all those restrictions in the new character editorcheersrobin
the current cc is about as exciting as a bowl of lukewarm porridgeedit id like to add a usability feature to the mix separate the tintingcoloring options from the clothing model options you use a different color selection in every other category but the clothingapparel allow people to choose the model of the clothing like today but then have a separate option appear for the available color options for that piece of clothapparel that way it would be consistent with the other options and wont get so clutterd as new models are added
ill would to read some awnsers about this because i think we loose something about the originality of our unniversif ccp can talk about this itll be great
the way to make the community diverse and interesting to look at and to make wis attractive to new people is to give people so many choices that it will be rare for two people to look alikego take a look at the character generator on city of heroespeople want to feel unique i am one of the elite and imortal a pod pilot i do not want to lookdress like 15 other people walking around the station i am docked inand please for the love of the game put in some scifi styled itemsto be blunt you need so many options that some are rarely used
the new cc is very powerful and as much as i like the new faces i must admit a few trademarks are still missing not only tattoos but also plastic clothes dumb smiles and of course salad bowl headwearbecause i believe that the future of fashion lies not on the back of todays ordinary people walking on the streets but in lady gagas wardrobe im fully supporting this thread

wordeveryone looks the same now  the new character creation is a wonderous thing awesome and spangly  technically a brilliant feat and yetsomehowthe old one was betterthe distinct ethnicity of the newer bloodlines has been if not lost then watereddown to the point of being barely distinguishable as has the gaunt look of the sebiestorsthe list goes onthink this was a case of less is moremy ideal situation would be a morph character option where i could select my old character portrait and the clever new creator would just take all the important distinguishing features and remake it in the new systemoh yeah and i want my old guristas background backop is right why if i turn muscularity right down and weight right up can i not create an obese character if i wantor someone festooned with implants and cyberbioniclooking appendages or at the very least a chuffing great assault rifle with all spkies and sht onand whyohwhyohwhy does every single pair of sunglasses available look a exactly the same and b crap
theres a good deal of problems with the new character generator cybernetics like the deteis used to have transparent clothingvisors like the gallente and minmatar used to have earpiece comms like the achura had facial tattoos girth scifi clothing etcthe most disappointing part of the new character creator is the vherokoir and their squint eyes they took one of the most beautiful avatars in the game and completely trashed them imho not everybody agrees with this statement but most doseriously my avatar is as big as the eyes get even with muscular manipulation and all the character creator is off to a good start but its nowhere near complete and only leaves the playerbase wanting the old one for the customization it offered we dont want to build a house if all we have available is the cinderblock foundationssupported and for crying out loud if not at least allow us to change our bloodlinegender since those have no major effect to the game nor to reputation
agree herei like the new character creator but it miss something  the thing who make you say look  its an eve online character

you are talkig planet scale production thats like nuclear powerplants only for boss to show up the next day and say  you know guys we feel like mining coal todaythese networks arent suppose to be changed on a daily bacisthat being said 1890 clicks should not be the factor dettering people from doing it isk cost should
it would be great to have a bookmark tab in the corperation windows that contained tabs inside for different bm types wormholespace bm kspace bm etc etc and a download button that automatically send all of them to your peeps n places basically what the op said i just wanted to clarify the picture i gotso supported
i support the idea of pvp in stations now granted it doesnt have to be hand to hand combat or even real live combat imagine there was something like personal combat holodecks competitive paintballlike events could be staged in such digital spaceswhere no capsuleers are physically hurt instead their avatars run obstacle courses while others try to shoot them down or stuff like that such events could have associated costs or fines for losers so their wallets experience real loss and spectators could bet etc there are any number of possibilities which could arise out of that one idea alonean idea that immediately eliminates any concerns about real death in stationsthe point is pvp needs to have a presence in stations for incarna to feel at all like evehopefully the incarna presentations at fanfest in a few weeks will address some of these questions and wants csm has no idea what is planned it doesnt seem likely well see anything in advance but i could be wrong
this pvp in the meat you speak of is being done why make it a redundancy that competes with dust
it wont be dust does t take place on stations isnt for pod pilots is on consoles and will be a different type of combat
i think that long term and preferably not as long term as its taken to get incarna in the first place  it should be possible to kill another pod pilot effectively podding him in a stationi would say it would need to be quite difficult costly and only available to characters that are not throwaway altssimply  i think that random station ganking would be dumb and detrimental to the game but carefully planned and quite rare station assassinations like the one recently described in rixx jarvixs b would be awesomerandom thoughts belowto cover the difficulty  it could require an expensive skill rank 10  high security smuggling to get a weapon of any kind into the capsuleer levelsto cover the cost  a spot fine and an immediate security status revocation 100 oh and naturally station defenses will turn you into a messy pile in seconds and you will not be welcome in a high security station until your security status is repairedto make it unavailable to throwaway alts  either it should take a timeframe of months to set up in a given station or it should be only available to characters with over a certain number of sp such as 1 years worth wouldnt make a lot of sense lorewise but im sure something can be made up or perhaps better yet bothalso a form of unarmed combat with some kind of effect would be nice brawling should be frowned upon but not harshly punished  such as a temporary ban from the station and a small fine but it should also have some minor detrimental effect on the attacked party
sure station ganking doesnt have to be easy and sure maybe theres a rank 10 or 14 or whatever skill that allows weapon smuggling security hits or being banned from certain corps stations sounds fine perhaps modifiable by another skill that allows infiltration or what have you the specific mechanics would probably best be discussed in the linked thread this one was for generally a discussion of the idea that stations should have pvp content and that content should mirror the rest of eve in that it shouldnt be totally avoidable
there is already a thread for this which you also madenot supported gangs of disposable alts would quickly make all incarna content unplayeable i doubt ccps intent is to make desolated wastelands where only alts hang out ganking everyone for lulz
but now you get eoh pokerwith hats
i supported this thread back in post 67 but a few more words given its several months down the road and i have a much better understanding of what will and wont get responses from the game designers when it comes to proposalsgiven what ive learned about the process in csm5 id say youd be better off focusing more a proposal calling for pvp of some kind in stations and less on the specifics of how that should be implemented since none of us have any clear idea what ccp is planning for incarna into the second and third iteration nor what their limitations are technically or otherwise for what they are willing to implement spending a lot of time detailing implementation mechanics is largely a waste of time what they want is for players to propose an idea expressed as a solution to a problem high level implementation ideas to help clarify both the problem and how it might be solved are okay numbers and percentages and wellgame design there i said itno as ccp has stated to csm time and again game design is their job to figure out they just want your ideas for bigpicture solutions to problems that you have identifiedthat is the way any proposal from ah will have the best chance of being looked at seriously by ccp when csm submits them detailed implementation mechanicsespecially for ideas that are featurelevel in scopejust make their eyes glaze over most of the time because 9999 of the time the details just wont work for a variety of reasons game balance other plans you dont know about etc that said i support any proposal that puts more impetus behind the message that we want pvp of some kind in incarna
you realize that buy the fluff were only immortal in a podkilling out side of a pod would be real deathno neural snapshot no sending of data and that would case so much rage quit because of station gank that eve would die also if you want eve fps than push for dust
i read some where in the lore that pop pilots have security forces to do their dirty work what about being able to hire dust players  they follow u around protect you in stationskill anything u dont likea few ideasconditions for this to work 1 dust players get paid and have an economic intensive 2 the price is market driven ie there are going to be 10 pod pilots to every dust player right so supplydemand3 the dust players would be paid per every 10 mins so i cant just hire some1 and bore the crap out them doing nothing4 got to be able to talk let them know whats going on ie ive got a bounty and i want u guys to protect me5 the more the better hiring more than one dust player totally allowed but the cost goes up 2 for each one i dunno but seems weird some guy could if he wanted buy 200 dust players for a few mins and have a gun fight with concordkill evey one in sight6 perhaps you can see the stats of players and they can choose their rates so i can get a crappy player for cheap or a really skilled one for the big bucksproblems 1 dust players might find this boring and completely break the feature 2 how will the pod pilots let the dust players know who to kill and not to kill some sorta lockbroadcast thing3 would pod pilots be able to join in the fight i sure hope so4how do the dust players get all the way around the universe would they use generic bodies or only be able to work in certain stations 5 would be a huge isk sink not sure if this is even a problemedit for stuff
before you reply read1 high sec ganks sould cause you 0 docking rights in that faction space at npc stations for 24hrs plus you are red in the faction space for 24h for crimes2 faction crime was placed in should put a bounty on toon of min of 5k3 0 insurance payed for ganking4 attacking unarmed ships sould have 2x sec dropthis ideal is for 10 05 sec only and only for gankingtime for crimes to be crimes and not a free ride take a real look at the payouts on insurance on those gank ships no big loss for them time to put a real hurt on crimes
yeah that was pretty much it i have been searching for the dev post but i cannot find it i could have sworn that it was in one of the dominion blogs
not supported sov null carebear heaven does not need yet another thing to farm agents are already in npc null go there
you missed the part where people can kill the agents to deprive you of them if the agents are valuable enough then people will want to field forces to defend them this would generate conflict maybe and if not then you get to kill all their agents and deprive them of their stuff
yeah as much as you can kill the carebears in that system there are places tucked deep within the blue ass of some alliance where you dont see a single hostile for weeks on end sov null does not need yet another thing to farm not to mention what it would take to make killible agentsthere are agents in npc null go there even highsec carebears get suicide ganked while running highsec missions for crap pay what makes you carebears think youre entitled to private agents in safe sov null
yes please
would be nice
support 100 no question asked
so i can prime modules but not overheat them its the same thing the modules arent active when you toggle the overheatsupported
its small and fiddly as it is so make this less of a ui problem and more of a gameplay decisioncloaking stops you from activating any modules and fair enough but shouldnt stop you setting how you want to use them when you decloak
proposing better forum moderationa number of legitimate threads have been locked while caod and cp remains troll infested for example there is a legitimate reason a miner carebear would make a post in industry section seeking advice on hulkageddon locking that thread and linking the official thread in cp started by hulkageddon organizer does not help the population there is different it would be just tear delivery and the carebear in question will get no adviceassembly hall threads should not be locked for being duplicate of main discussion thread in another subforum which spawned it if mod has to lock something lock the main thread instead locking assembly hall thread effectively prevents a votetheres stuff like this
i agree while i am glad that they try there are just too few of them for how many posts are made a daya good way to do it is a mod for every forum category and some extras for the high traffic ones
make officers spawn more often to compensate the ones that will not be killed cause the dude is alone its a team game after all
i think this should be in the thousand paper cuts thread but owellis it just me that gets irritated by the fact that when i warp to a station there is a 5050 chance i land about 45km away or actually on 0 and insta dockis this actually meant is ccp trying to give people the chance to catch someone just before they dock i mean 45km really dosent make much difference for any sub cap ship could althought see how it would effect capitalsi dunno i just feel that its an annoying thing if your in a slow ass freighter or a hauler shouldnt it be 100 0km range all the time or always 45kmso whats everyones views
there is nothing special about a warp to a stationall warps are inaccurate by up to 25km iircthe reason for this is so that gang warps dont all end up with all the ships clustered on top of one another and therefore causing a huge bump fest at the end of the warpif you want to make sure you land in docking range  make a bookmark on the station undock or other suitable location and warp to that insteadif its a new station and you think you may get ganked  warp to the moonplanet at a random range first so that you can check the station with your dscanner
im well aware of how to avoid getting gankedi know warps are inaccurate to a certain extent but it shouldnt be with stations because sometimes it screws up the actual docking process
or maybe there should be some risk involved unless you make the neccecery preparations
this is true but on the flip side of the same coin while the fun factor is there regardless the loss factor is also there regardless this proposal is to mitigate the effect of the loss factor so it makes less of a contribution when deciding whether or not to go out to pew tipping the balance just a little you could sayso not just about making money from pirate hunting although making that more of a possibility but losing less to encourage people to try it out once people start the pew pew theyll wonder why they didnt earlier and thats what this is trying to promoteor maybe im just evangelising pew so much i am missing that carebears will always be carebears surely not though surely people just need to see the light of lasers and explosions
this is true but assumes that were trying to equalize lowsec with hisec on purely financial terms this change wouldnt do that but would at least close the gap between the two to some degree ie i dont think lowsec will be as populated as hisec but that it would be more populated than it is now especially by pvp pilots this may or may not have the knockon effect of making lowsec safer for miners and industrialists in lowsec and thereby increasing the overall population further thats a fair point would it be overpowered to have the antipirate incentive be paired with restrictions on docking for pilots with low security status during the gcc that way pirates will either have to render themselves inert cloakhide leave the system or be vulnerable to antipirates the danger of course is that we dont want to effectively ban lowsec pirating just balance it out a bit
this will be great right up to the point that1the highsec dwellers are baited and gang raeped a few times then the losses will outwiegh the gains again2pirates no longer have negative sec status due to having a perfectly safe null system to rat it back upthe more sucessful your plan is in the short term the faster it also burns itself out in the long termbounty hunting changes will not fix lowsec lowsec doesnt even need fixing by many peoples opinion
as a player who prefers low sec to high i would have to say that imho it doesnt really need fixing population wise i think its how it should be which is quieterless crowded than high sec not to burst bubbles but players that dont venture into high sec due to ganks loss gain aversion or whatever will never really be enticed to check it out they are not there because they dont want to be there it doesnt matter what rewards are there some perhaps many players just dont like loss and stay out of low sec for that reason alone
this is the simple truth lowsec is perfectly fine as it is and with minimal social andor mercantile skills it is easy to live there as a pveindustrial playeryou will have to be on good terms with the local pirates and the militias but that is not an issue as long as you can give something in return if you arent prepared to give something in return then dont expect it to be the hello kitty adventure clubwe got a few industrialists we have set blue they actually make good profit by selling to us and ontop enjoy having protection available on call plus very little competitionthey want to get their freighter in and a neutral battleship is sitting at entry gate with them call your piratemilitia friends and jump the 20 friendlies sitting on the other side gonna solve that problem for youpos under siege by some random asshats call in your friends and laughwant to trade in t2 modules strike a deal for loot sales with your local pirates they all want to get rid of the stuff quick profit
i posted this in fi discussion but someone suggested i post this here insteadhow about letting us have shirtsjackets with npc corp logos on them as well as custom shirtsjackets that have our own corps logo on it if we have one someone also suggested having patches that can be put over either breast on either shoulder put on the back etc which i think would be a cool ideaps a custom shirt logo creator that is based on the guild logo creator would be cool too
yes i do like this ideal i would love to have a t with quafe on it
ill put this down as if intented to a subnormal 4 year oldim a long time pc player and i enjoy a good game regardless of the genrethe definitive goal for any commercial game is to attract a great number of players so that it may grow and eventually incorporate diversificated gameplay to cater all tastes eve fails despite many years in activity because of its communityeve today 2003 graphics albeit with shadow maps and hi res texturesno particlesno damage texturespathetic all your weapons hit the enemy ship same spot without impact effectsdestroyed ships dont release debris what remains in space after a fierce battle is a jokeps for all raging dribbling idiots since the dawn of computer games you can toggle  with a checkbox in the options menu too laggy youd just uncheck more debris in options no deambulation community is actually a forum and an ingame chat channel in 2011this thing is like the duke nukem forever vaporware deambulation coming since forever oh yeah itll be this summer it was sponsored what 4 years ago pve content is ridiculously repetitive especially since its divided into categories and level 5 agents have all been moved into low security space which is utterly stupidplus the fact that you often need to jump several gates to get to a mission is annoying and dimwitted as if it were intendedwhy not issuing missions in the same sector youre in if the problem is isk influx reduce the rewards the drops etcevery non ed player can agree that its more fun to get straight into the action than to travel like an idiot back and forth especially since you  need to be in the same space station as the agent to accept turn in missions in the year umptenthousand pvp theres absolutely no player skill involved only five different types of activable modules anyone weapons painters webbers jammers vampires neuters and thats it combine the modules thats all the combat skill you needif there were ever a fair fight winningd be as easy as having more money and having an older character which is ridiculous for todays games communitieshowever theres no chance that youll fight a fair combat against a single opponentall game instruments are in favor of cowardish and miserable approach to warfare its come to a point that it has its own word for it gank gang killing super pathetic if your ship is configured for pve you will be defeated in a pvp setting and equally on the opposite actually excluding the possibility to have fun playing both without taking ages to defeat an enemy if you defeat it at allin particular the fact that theres no way to maintain an individual occasional economy and a high tier pvp game style is retrograde to say the leastespecially since insurance is a joke that doesnt cover your modules or the actual cost of your ship for example a machariel can cost nearly 1 billion isk yet itll be insured for 90 million simply absolutely ed 99 of pve is a gangbang of 4 fools camping a low security gate or sector and destroying an enemy without a chance of course theres hughe fleet battles too where everybody performs like  regardless of pc power or internet connection most important of all the utterly idiotic idea that a frigate can jam scramble a battleship 30 times its size and 3000 times its mass with a single module can only be the mind bogglingly miscarriage of a subnormal game designer i talked about eve with two dozen people over the years all of them tried itthey werent put off by the economy or the learning curve they were driven away by the lack of actual gaming detail
pass
yet the csms worry about i dont even want to waste my time anymore reading the ridiculous crap they you as a player have come up with over timetldrneeded urgent fixes only a  shouldnt have figured out by nowomegathere is more detail into the spreadsheets than there is in the game mechanics want people to dwell into low sec give them a chance for s sake how much could it take to think this outa big ships with only 8 weapon modules that cant defend against frigates outofmind imbecility in actionb a frigate can jam scramble web a ship bigger in class with a single modulec insurance system is a joke it is utterly ed even a 4 year old can see thisd player economy is dimwitted when a module can cost up to 1 billion isk yet you cant insure it or replace it how are you supposed to use it knowing the riske pvp nuff saidf pve annoying ideas that wound up adding to repetitiveness to a truly saddening game experienceg all ships undocking from stations exactly from the same spot superimposing eachother and intersecating eachother disgustingfixomega pay for concord escort theyll be there to fight as ai wingmen create a escor duty bulletin board where people put themselves up for hirea add additional specific largemediumsmall weapon slots for increasing ship classes make it so that targeting limits the amount of weapons you can fire simultaneously only a completely brain damaged idiot would not agree that its about time to fix this absurdity about frigate vs battleshipb again a design flaw that cant be tolerated there is no reasonable in game or out game rule that would possibly allow this debatable fix the bigger the ship class difference the more of the same modules you need frigate vs battleship 5 modules not enough slots get a bigger shipc is there even need to write about this dont you get it already full ship insurance purchase value  module value youd only lose cargo can be exploited sure but its a start add time on service battles fought parameters to the ship so you can show off that your vessel is in service since a long time and that youre not an insurance abuser piece of  also add a public ship cemetery for each player to make things easierd somewhat connected to c point is theres no way to warantee an influx of isk to the casual player to allow him fuel a combat activity mining hauling for fighting pathetic you possibly can throw your lives away mining for hours on end while watching  on the other screen to raise a few mill and waste them on a ship that gets ganked 10 hours later a non brain damaged player he wonte with previous points fixed pvp shouldnt be an issue at this pointf cant warp to bookmark inside a gate teaming up with people actually reduces your rewards and fleet cant warp to you when youre inside a gate i could go ong like many other graphical aspects weapons always hitting the same spots no debris no ricochet or particles on projectile laser impact etc itd take just a few hours to bring actuality to the game
ok and suppose battleships get to wtfpwn everything smaller than it what use does anything smaller than the bigger ship have thenwell lookie theres our use for them but oh wait you want bigger ships to be able to instapop themeveryone knowshtfuloss whiningincursions wh space 110  1010sthey did try and fix thatstupid as hell get some friends if your moving your freighterrefer to firstseriously man gtfoyour trying to propose we change the whole dam game
well that was a whiny rant
iokaa wroteread it like thisif your battleship can be owned by a frigate whats the use for the battleshipsince im sure you still dont get it what you typed reads like thisif your frigate can be owned by a battleship whats the use for the frigate just defend large and medium weapons cant hit frigatesyoure obviously a ed  that doesnt play the game to be unaware of what it takes to instapop a frigate in frigate vs battleship combatyet youre ok with it not my fault if youre a subnormal piece of  thats ok with supporting a flawed gameperfect comeback for the argument i wrote about fwooshh flushed awayrofl only an idiot played this games pvp and came back for more i lost four ships total in pvp in 4 years an obvious instance of you writing about something you dont know  aboutjust exactly how much pve do you play obviously zero you ignorant idiot another nonexistent counterargumentthe only thing they fixed was the jump carrier jumps bumping players around you dont know what you write about once moredude do you even read what you type obviously you didnt read understood what i wrote i write about making the game better more flexible and you reply with an obviously nonworking current game feature thats not convenientyou should better do it in the first placepropose we changeyoure ccps buttbuddy or somethinglol im sure you successfully invited several of your real life friends to subscribe to the game over time enough saidtrolling comments removed  adida
he madi disagree with most of your points thus i do not support itsorry 
he is indeed madopalso not supported it is obvious from your ranting diatribe that what you want is a game that isnt eve please go find that game and enjoy yourselfalso you might want to consider an anger management class
only gonna touch on a few points of yoursinsurance it actually isnt insurance its a scrap refund based on mineral prices not ship pricesbs vs frig if you lose any bs to any frig 1v1 you are a moron at fitting also all bs carry drones well t1 dont know about t2 or faction so they have anti frig defensespvp simplicity in a bs v bs fight 90 is fitting dependent however in something like and af v ceptor at least 50 is pilot flying skill as in rl skill there are plenty of times that a lower sp with weak fit can beat a higher sp better fit solely because of player skillyou also do not have to be in the same station to complete all missions just somealso for active modules you missed some target comps and disruptors sebos and damps scrams reppers remote reppers for fleet or drone combat obviously hardners i think thats everything
bs vs frig drones
calling this as a troll post 410 made me smirk when people took the bait but made me cry reading it 
410  pffttroll cursing all over the place is a noobie noob in trollingi heard they do not use grades in a first year at school to not harm fragile children minds have mercy too
this is a pvp game important issues are about pvpgraphics dont matter at all graphics are just there to convey proper information about the battlefield how pretty they look is completely irrelevantpve is good enough as it is after all its just a grind one does to get money for pvp just means to an end
this far will i agree with you then you went on a rant i like that people are forced to move around claiming pvp takes no skill makes you look like someone who doesnt do pvp especially when you follow that up with a rant about how it isnt fair hint you are probably doing it wrong i like that the game doesnt allow for a uniuberfit i like that losses hurt i would rather no insurance in the game if you think a bs cant hurt a frigate it is probably because you arent properly fit hint a bs can fit all the same modules that a frigate can fit and more for the love of peanut butter claiming this game doesnt have depth is like claiming the ocean doesnt have water i would argue the depth is part of why everything seems halfmade you can do a gazillion different things but half of them were never iterated ondwell in low sec oh here we go you want to do stuff by yourself and be protected from all those big bad people who talk to other people in game and convince them to help each other out concord escorts hell no the need for other people is what makes this game better than other mmos it is why i look past all the problems
tldr i dont like eve the way it is if you disagree with what i say youre an idiotunfortunately starting like that pretty much kills any possibility of discourse even if one agreed with anything you sayso simply put not supported on the basis that from where i stand we dont even seem to be playing the same game
too obvious
curious in game its called insurancethe fact you justify its ridiculous and ed implementation with a differnt name is like trying to use science to explain the time travel theory in the twelve monkeys filmits not a matter of losing a bs to a frig or not its the sheer imbecility of accepting the mere possibilitythis could and should only happen if the bs is completely inactive and shields down but you and me know that theres countless real game situations and configurations that would allow this edness to happenfurthermore a 1 month old player character can dispatch t2 light drones easily with a destroyerdont even get me going on the miserable drone interface you dont know when they are being targeted until they instapop or take damage among the most utterly ed issues since foreveri did not mention even once same class ships combat situations i have nothing against current frigate vs frigate cruiser vs cruiser battleship vs battleship its the superlative and abysmal edness of crossclass combat that its mind bogglingyou dont know what you write aboutfixedyou also do have to be in the same station to complete all missions just some you do notyou are right sadly still these few more dont really add the skill factor in a gang vs ship gang vs way smaller gang combatps youll excuse the fact i deliberately ignore the insignificant subnormals that replied idiocies
all the above are examples of why you appear to be a troll if youre not trolling you are doing a very good job of shutting down any desire to engage in a discussion of your proposal which is entirely counterproductiveill wade in anyway with a reply to your issue with the fact that a frig can jam scramble web a ship bigger in class with a single module  so what bigger is not always better and eve forces you to make tactical decisions regarding fleet composition so you dont just have a big fleet of one ship type red alert tank rush some ships are good at pounding stuff some are good at disrupting electronics etcthink of it in terms of modern warfare  the battleship has massive guns for pounding big slowstationary targets whereas small fast boats say a torpedo boat can get under those guns and launch torps to sink the battleship this is why ships travel in fleets so that the most important ships carriersbattleships are surrounded by picket ships like destroyers for taking out subs and aegis cruisers for ewareve models this really well simple as that
this proposal aims to add other form of defense that differ from ships and armor overall the goals of the proposal are give players additional options to defend their ship and outsmart their opponent allow ships to tank with high slot and therefore make marauders more useful discourage generic fits and encourage intel gathering three potential form of active defense will be discussed here1 ciwspoint defenseflak gunsimplementationciws are fof guns high slot use turret hardpoint with high tracking high dps but short range ciws will only target frigates drones and missiles point defense would come in medium large and capital varieties t2 variants should exist for medium and large versions all point defense guns use the same charges but larger ciws have much higher rate of fire point defense can be activated without a valid target in range but will only shoot and use charge when they have something to fire onspeculative stattracking 100rads t1 120rads t2 charge damage 40 t1 50t2 60factionrate of fire 20s mid 16s mid t2 10s large 08slarge t2 2s capitalrange 44km mid 55 km mid t2 66 km large 7575 km large t2 1010 km capitalfitting requirement identical to midsized autcannon of the same sizediscussionthis weapon is not very effective against missiles because once a missile volley enter their range the guns will only have the chance to get off a volley before missiles hit a fixed defenders launcher should be much better at missile interception role cwis is devastating against drones but smartbombs are stronger in that role outside highsec however cwis are weapon of choice to force tacklers to back off and to kill fighters and bombers before people complain about the huge dps id like to point out again they cannot target anything beside drones missiles and frigates 2 decoy launcher flaresimplementationdecoy launchers are launchers high slot use launcher hardpoint that reduces incoming damage a ship with at least one decoy flare launcher equipped will only receive ship sig radiusship sig radius decoy sig radius damage from guns and missiles decoy flares offer no protection against smart bombs and doomsday devices decoy launcher consume charge rapidly when active to discourage leaving them on decoy launchers come in small mid and large varieties because carriers dont have launcher hp anywaystat speculationcycle time 2s charge size 5m3 capacity 50m3small 100 m3 mid 200 m3 largedecoy radius 50small 60small t2 100mid 120mid t2 400large 500large t2fitting stat identical to long range missile of same sizecycle time unaffected by ballistic control systemsreload 10sdiscussiondecoy launchers reduces incoming damage according to the ships radius this lend ship without microwardrives effective invulnerability for short period of time and is countered by target painters it provide an effectively alternative to speed it can be used for frigates while tacking or by ecm ships to survive concentrated sniper fire

your point defense system seems to fill the same role as smartbombs already do except its overpowered
i like the idea of being able to use high slots in more ways than are available now particularly in the form of creating more diversity for playing style strategiesthat being said i dont agree with some of the specifics of your proposalsfor instance i like the point defense idea but i think it would be better to be activated by ewar scram jamming dampening etc but otherwise inoperable the dmg should be universal regardless of ship size its fitted to to balance them the range and tracking should be similar to the sentry drones you see in lvl 4 missions i think not too much but enough to scare off ewarbased ships that traditionally have no tankas for the decoy launchers why not have them actually be like real decoys and have incoming dmg and ewar target it instead of the ship for the length of its timer or until it loses all its very small amount of hp basically a possible getoutofjailfree card the opposing ships would need to retarget the ship and can do so even if the decoy is still operableif theyre paying attention and target manually to balance it it can only be fired once every 2030 seconds maybei like the stealth mod idea as is though 
the largest defect i have noticed so far is not the clicking but the actual production procedure there is one big no realy big problem the failure of any extra product in any production facility to be returned to point of origin if production is changed in real life manufacturing this is called a return to location ticket or rtl if we with current technology can do this why cant the most advanced society in the known eve universe have this for pi it is the only production type that does this in the entire gamefor those that dont understand let me write it outwhen you start production you rout product to a basic advanced or high tech production facility if you send too much product but not enough to do a production run it sits till you either add more product or switch your production queue to something else if you switch your production queue you lose all the product in the queue this may not sound like much but when you add it all up there is billions of isk lost every second from just this simple flaw that ccp failed to account fortheyre programmers not manufactures so i can forgive it to this point i personally have found ways around it but in every other production type it is impossible to have extra product just disappear suggested solutionmake it so product is only moved in full production runs so if you need 40 units of toxic metals and 40 units of reactive metals to make a product the manufacturing plant will only move multiples of those numbers so if you have only 39 toxic metals and 40 reactive metals in your source sitelaunch pad storage c center it will not transfer to a production facility thus not being wasted and said facility can be changed to a new product line with out loss of product this could be expanded to make a production list like in station production queueswhich i love btw if you dont have the product on planet then it skips to the next item long term this will reduce the clicks on the production side and keeps your planet which you sometimes cant get to running like a manufacturing facility should247365 with minimal managementlet me know what you think the director of evil doukyou
i havent noticed this problem at all i have my factories hooked to my storage facility and everything seems to work fine i make a lot more of one product than another and so i always have extra in my storage and it continues to grow as normalthe only reason youd have a mistake like this that i can see is if you bought the supplies and shipped them down to the planet i dont know how that would work as my facilities always give me the exact number necessaryfor most intents and purposes not supported
please enlighten me on the intent or purpose of several meters cubed of my good dissapearing into thin air the cost  ya know
i think they need a small help like 11 slots instead of 10 simply and usefull considering they are bigger than any other frigates
i have 2 suggestions that would be both easy enough to implement and extremely useful for all enable an icon that can be displayed to signify afk status in chat i recommend it as an option to turn onoff via a rightclick on ones own portrait in the chatbox folders are needed in the watch list i dont know about you but my watch list is cluttered with characters from various wars and other undesirables who i need to keep tabs on and it would be advantageous to be able to sort them into folders eg war targets  corp name
today during our successful shield fleet takedown of a sansha nation mom in amarr high sec it came to my attention that ccp has not addressed what is apparently a very common and obviously broken incursion experience the mom loot ninjai am aware that like normal high sec ops people are capable of stealing and getting flagged however in the 80 man environment of a mom battle with said mom constantly dropping from overview it is impossible to prevent an assault ship from stealing 100m in a secondplayer itc today took our ts pds and a bp for a phantasm how are we supposed to stop him i could see scramming him in low sec or putting a bubble up in null sec but tell me how high sec pilots are supposed to prevent people from taking the loot they worked all day to make im just looking for a solution to what is obviously a design problem from ccp as i see it how do you prevent someone from ninjaing the main loot from high sec moms its bad enough we get lower payouts no mom ship drops and restricted incursion opportunities due to sec statuswhich we can grind i understand but my point being oo doesnt have the problem but this is simply wrong to have to deal with any 1 day old character could ninja this stuff consequence free i would even prefer that no loot drop in highsec rather than give them the pleasureawaiting your replywtf
cross posting this to achieve what
for a vote apparently idea threads that gain steam in other boards end up here for a vote not only is it not considered crossposting its the correct procedure
i dont see any big problems with what you said highsec competition for any limited rewards has always been about speed and not about who did the most work to make the lootingsalvaging a possibility in the first place there is also a some reward in that work so its not like you arent getting any reward for the work if you want the ability to kill them go to lowsec or 00 highsec security is there to protect everyone from unwanted aggression so your complaint just boils down to you being on the recieving end of that mechanic this time
three minutes with a bunch of people telling him to get over his sense of entitlement doesnt look much like gaining steam to meninja looting is ninja looting sure the stuff this ninja looted was pretty valuable  but he got to the wreck first there are simple ways to ensure that ninja looters dont get to the wreck first some require personal sacrifice such as smartbombing the wreck alternately be first to the wreckif a ninja looter can get to the wreck first someone in the fleet should be able to use the same technique right

i would like to introduce myself to you all as a candidate for the 6th csmwhy am i running for csm 6as a long time player of eve i have always admired the grand vision of the game and the scope of possibility it produces this in conjunction with the great work that has been done by the last 2 csms has focused my attention to the way ccp interacts with its player base and the way the csm has worked together to bring this interaction to a new levelmy previous experience as the ccp qa delegate to csm 1 as ccp lingorm and the commitment that ccp hellmar has consistantly shown has convinced me that good candidates and excellent team work from the csm is going to build a better game and i would like to be a part of thatmy goals for csm 6excellence of execution ccp has been trying to build on a theme of excellence and csm 5s solidarity showed ccp that what the player base thought of as excellence was different from what ccp thought but that a common ground exsisted and that by actually working together good results could be hadi want to continue this push of excellence keeping the csm focused on getting good results for the issues that the player base raisesi am also a huge adherent of the api twice running the api roundtable at the eve fanfest and will be pushing for increased capability and functionality of the api while there are a number of other issues that i am concerned with and will be pushing for a resolution on i am not set on what that resolution is these issues are things like  viability of low secafk cloakingplayer owned structures posmy history in evei have been playing eve since march 2004 and other than for a short period in the middle of last year i have had atleast 1 account running at all timei have been involved in most aspects of eve over that time and have experienced the joys and the sorrows that eve bring most recently i have been focused on industry and the isk that brings but also the clickmadness and rince and repeat slow interfaces that plague this part of evemy most famous moment in eve was during the eve fanfest in 2005 during which i used the time on stage as the player from far far away to propose to my then girlfrien and now wifewho am i reallymy name is shay mcaulay i am a 35 year old married to an eve player computer programmer and agile systems administrator for a large insurance company in auckland new zealand i work for ccp from 2007 till the end of 2008 as the qa engineering team lead i have also worked in a number of other industries always from a computing side but i still had to understand the industry including but not limited to telecomunications logistics consulting and coaching scrum software developmentmy linkedin profileother informationi am working on a site that will go into my goals in more detail but i have been a little busy over the last couple of days with work related to supporting our efforts in the wake of the christchurch earthquake but will have it comepleted this weekend and will link it here

what is on your mind to make low sec more viable
i have a couple of ideas that i would like to investigate furtherrandom faction npc patrols  the factions have random patrols through low sec that will act on any illegal agression now these are not concord so they can be tanked and destroyed difficult but not impossible this will bring a random chance element to low sec making it a bit safer for people to enter thus also increasing the profitability of pirating as the greater population means more opportunitiesability for players to build services  whether this is done with a new pos system or as rental on parts of exisiting stations i would like to see players and corporations have the ability to build more services in low sec we have a sortage of labratories and in some places factories i think players and low sec would be a good way to look at solving this i am not 100 sure on the actual implementation of this but the service offered would have to be better than high sec to offer extra inducementability to sell kill rights  i think a good system that implemented this combined with a revamp of the bounty system could also prove interesting but need to study the possible ramifications for gaming the system before really settling on anythingi have also seen some other suggestions that i would like to see looked into further for partial consideration viceroy comes to mind herei am not 100 convinced that these will solve the problem but i think they are worth examining and spending some time looking at the viability of
well we can all see that the current system is not working and how sure do you need to be when players continue to play for 23 hours a day for prolonged periods of time you dont sound like someone who makes comming down hard on bots a priority if a warning or temp ban does not suffice to stop the botting more serious actions may be appropriatenews flash it doesnt suffice you know that we all know it but still you wont go any further than stating that more serious actions may be appropriate wow that all sounds a bit like what ccp has been telling us about the issue it does not sound like the guy who will do thisit sounds like a politician who is not willing to touch the subject too much cuz it wont sit well with his potential voters in this case being the 00 botrunningcondoning crowd perhaps
well you dont exactly have a record of participation in the csm very little in meetings youve missed the most ones from all csm 5 members with the least notices in advance of dropping out with the except of mazzilliu but hell she is a self admitted free trip to iceland member and theres very little besides banter and fun visible from you in the meeting logs linkis that going to change reliably i mean sure you vote a lot on issues raised but its about what you do as a csm member
will you support the nerfing of drakesa concerned officer
botting is bad and people who do it need to be banned i completely agree there but ccp needs to be careful in their measures against it to prevent fallout we and ccp are very much aware that if someone is online for 23hrs a day that its probably a bot but tools need to be put in place to automatically detect their types of behavior and flag the accounts and that takes a lot of research development and time they showed us in the june and december summits that they are working on it and if they dont have anything tangible by fanfest then we definitely need to start pressing them in case ccp does start massbanning bots again like with unholy rage they should also keep a very close eye on the economy because bots have a significant impact there and maybe even be ready to interveneand no i dont serve no 00 botting people  they can all diaf what i do as a csm member is think along with the subject at hand and then voice my opinion based on experience and input from players and then vote csm5 had very few issues to discuss because frankly csm 14 went over so many already there wasnt much new the meeting record also isnt quite complete i missed two in january because i was away in the jungle for a uni project but those are not listed as excused and looking at those numbers it kind of seems like you deliberately tried to single me out for fingerpointing because the differences between members are small
continuedalso during the june and december summits i have kept the public informed with daily updates that have been copied by numerous other blogs and forums something i considered especially important because apart from the minutes that usually took awhile to be released the summits were kind of nontransparent to the public i havent flown or faced them a whole lot since the last round of adjustments so i cant comment personally is this a new structural imbalance or just the latest fotm whine
while i do indeed endorse your candidacy and we have talked some about it already would you mind sharing your thoughts on low sec here there is always a lot of interest among us pirates and other low sec dwellers about csm candidate ideaspositions on our preferred part of new eden
hee another tough question and this ones my own fault i was mentioning that i thought i was getting really tough questions here so mynxee throws me another tough one thanks ok first im smart enough about lowsec to know that im probably a complete idiot about lowsec i lived there for about 67 months doing faction warfare you can read about the careers ive had in eve but thats the limit of my experience that said i have some thoughtsif it were up to me first thing id do is push the supercaps back to 00 lowsec should be as much as is possible newbie pvpfriendly and supercarriers promote an environment that is anything but that fw was most at its most fun when it was destroyer and cruiser battles you got popped you collected the insurance you docked up you came right back out again nobodys gonna want to do that with nyxes roaming lowsecsecond thing lowsec needs is a reason to exist of the many ideas ive read for this the one that speaks to me the most is smuggling lowsec residents should be smuggling masters bring back the inactive smuggling skills  theyre in the database just shut off  but make the skills available only to people with high standing with the pirate factions with high smuggling skills you can manufacture illegal boosters in lowsec and then truck them to jita profit if your pirate faction standing goes down though the smuggling skills go inactive until you correct that situation you lose your smuggling contactsnext step remove every pirate agent from 00 they can keep the rats but take me for an example i live in nc space which means on the rare occasions that i rat i shoot guristas but i also have easy access to hpa in venal which means i have also have easy access to guristas pirate missions this is dumb dumb clear those agents back into lowsec where they belong while this is going on reduce the scope of pirate 00 in general some pirate 00 is fine it provides good staging points for lowsec residents to attack into 00 but the pirate areas in 00 are too bigedit edited to clarify that i mean pirate 00 areas are too big stain venal etc not npc 00 in general see post 28 belownext i also like the idea of pulling all booster gas mining into lowsec give the miners something unique to go after and give 00 one fewer thing they have total ownership of itd also be worth looking at reducing the volume of lowsec ores spud is the same volume as bistot which is silly if you reduce the volume of some lowsec ores the value goes up because mining happens in volumeminute its an easy database change to make lowsec ores should all be worth around 18m iskhour for a perfectly skilled hulk imo right now most of them are half that though noc prices are helping hemor and hed a great deal right nowfinally fix faction warfare this is something that team best friends forever needs to get on right now its not something ill have time to do before the election but if im elected ill hold a fw roundtable on a ts server and collect ideas for fixing fw from people currently doing it and get those posted to the assembly hallwhew ive spent a ton of time reading on this topic and some of these ideas are probably dumb for reasons i cant think of but those are the wibnis i have for lowsec
oh and so this is totally clear i dont mean remove the pirate stations the stations can stay the sov for a constellation or two can stay but move the agents out the stations would be agentless
hey trebor many people are familiar with the crowdsourcing activities you spearheaded in assembly hall what in your view were some of the strong and weak points in the process as you conducted it during csm5 and have you given any thought to how it might be improved for csm6
well it has been a learning process ive tweaked the process each time ive run a prioritizationone suggestion that was made the last time around is to allow people to not only vote for items they liked but antivote against items they didnt like and use that to get a multidimensional perspective on opinions its relatively easy to do and not much more work for the players doing the voting so ill probably implement that the next time aroundthe nice thing is that we can test whether or not it is useful without affecting the existing system because i can generate the output either with or without the antivotesi might also put up some sort of webapp that makes it easier to votei will drag out the rotting carcass of the dead horse and dump it on the ccp conference table whenever the opportunity presents itself
id just like to say well done to all the guys on csm5as a longstanding player of several years id just like to say what you guys have achieved and the legacy you have created for csm6 is massiveyou have my vote trebor and i think your style will continue to work wonders with the icelandic contingentone additional thing id be pressing foruser acceptance testersas someone who actually loves ccp for their wonderful creation i am so embarrassed time and time again when they release upgrades stuffed with crappy bugs surely they can afford to get a team of volunteers from eve to test their releases lets face it the players spot all the bugs in the first few hours after each release why cant they spot them please csm6 bring it to ccps attentionvote trebor
sorry based on the december minutes i wouldnt vote for any current member of the csm we need fresh voices not the same ole same ole
ive been bothering more candidates about this so its only fair i will bother you with it too so here it comes whats your take on the rampant botting and how are you going to persuade ccp to dedicate sufficient resources to the problem and convince them 24 hour bans are not going to stop ppl using bots
well singularity is supposed to do some of that however one aspect of this problem that has concerned me for a long time is the horribly broken state of eve bugreporting the nonpublic nature of bugreports means that players reinvent the wheel constantly and cannot collaborate to nail down reproduction cases in addition getting a tricky bug report past the bughunter filter is an exercise in frustration i have one cute ui bug for example that gets repeatedly filtered despite the fact that i uploaded a video showing it in actionhow many bugs dont get reported simply because people have given up on the bugreporting system out of frustration and despairok i could go on about this for pages but heres the cliff notes version rmt and botting are overlapping problems but there is botting that is unconnected with rmt and viceversa rmt uses passive income as fuel that is income that requires little or no human effort and cost to acquire botting is a way of converting active income to passive income the best approaches for fighting both botting and rmt are those that are cheap for ccp to implement and maintain but expensive for the botters and rmt operators to compensate for the cheapest ways of fighting botting are gamedesign changes that make botting harder and reduce their income potential if these changes also make the game more fun for honest players winwinconsider the following gamedesign change which i provide merely for the purposes of illustrationevery account has a resource extraction license every day 50100m rels are added to the license with a maximum capacity of say 1b rels every time you pop a rat or mine or do anything that creates isk out of thin air some amount is deducted from your balance roughly equivalent to the isk value of what you just earnedwhen your rels run out your mining lasers stop extracting you dont get rat bounties rats dont leave wrecks you cant get missions etcwhats the point of this well it wont impact the play of almost all legitimate players but itll hugely nerf the earning value of a 237 bot account  raising the costs of the rmterssome may argue this will be dropping a turd in the sandbox but they should give the current sandbox a good hard sniff before they complain too hard  the next cheapest methods are behavioral botdetection systems this is effectively a spamfiltering problem ive already suggested this to ccp several times tracking down rmt networks is the most expensive method  its very laborintensive i would like to see more of this but given limited resources the other methods are more attractive at this point
i think when the socalled opposing party  ie the 00 csms clearly state he is a valuable asset to the process as a whole plus reading he is someone who doesnt see things black and white but ackowledges there are various shades of grey i think hes a damn good choice for the next csmwe need someone who will enter a discussion either with a clear focus without clinging onto it at any cost or who enters a discussion without knowing anything about it but listening learning and willing to contributesecond account vote has just been securedkeep this up and i will actually start convincing other people to vote for you
you seem to have an informed opinion on the subject good your first idea is terrible i think though but i like the basic thought of twarting botting by making the game mechanics harder for bots in no way can this be the only measure taken against them of coursewhat are you thoughts on anticheating software implementing in eve and what do you think of the penalties ccp gives to botters reading listening and chatting it seems that as long as you are not involved in massive rmt ccp only dishes out extremely short bans at least those are the stories that reach me recently i spoke to 2 members of goonswarm who claimed bots were widely used by alliance members and that they simply didnt care about getting caught bcuz of the laughable punnishments id like to hear your oppinion on that 
i would never expect an offthecuff sample mechanic to be the best solution but note that you dont offer reasons why its terrible the bottom line is its an example of how to screw the earning potential of 237365 bots while not significantly nerfing real people it could possibly be tweaked into a buff actuallyi would approach the idea with extreme caution lots of opportunities for things to go wrong and it is a significant technical effort i think there are things to try first that have much better bangforbuck before it should even be considereda 1day ban for botting is at face value laughable but before i go nuclear on ccp in any particular case i would want to know more details of the circumstances so far ccp has not seen fit to disclose details of its antibotting efforts and policies to the csm
problem that ccp is facing i think is that there is no paper trail that can prove beyond doubt that a given character is a bot could just be a person inbetween jobs or a person workingstudying from home  this uncertainty is probably the reason for the reported short temporary bansit is a lot easier when it comes to plain old rmt as there are plenty of logs showing transactions back and forththe trickiest problem facing eve at the moment for surechatterbox daehdoow where do you see lownull in a years time in terms of gameplay your vision in broad strokes will suffice

i can certainly understand your frustration i wrote this post in my blog a few weeks ago to address just this issue i hope you take a few minutes to read it and maybe it will help some how much actual impact does the csm have
low sec is in many ways the lost lamb of eve despite players begging for iteration or improvement for years the only thing that can be considered as a low sec expansion was the release of factional warfarethere is this huge gap between the solo carebear style of empire and the maniacal demigods of nullsec it stands to reason that there should be a more proper stepping stone between the two that caters to the smugglers small gangs of bandits and all around bad guys people who arent in it for the glory or the conquest of worlds just pilots that want to carve out their little back alleys and take care of their fellowsi have always wanted to see low sec evolve into something all its own an area of space that reflects its in between status both politically and through solid game play your standing with a faction npc should have real weight to it factional warfare was a first attempt at this but it falls far short of the overall potential of what could be accomplishedone example of this might be that through your actions you rise to the attention of the local faction you and yours are sent on a series of tasks which might entail anything from assassinating another player to just securing a system against the other scum in the area kill xx player and be rewarded eliminate xx number of negative security status bad guys in a constellation do enough of this and eventually you might rise to the notice of special agents of a faction which would then in turn offer you elevated positions within their space viceroy of a planet or an entire system with special benefits for you and yours that allow you to do things in their controlled areas of space that no one else can do imagine a corp like veto with verone playing godfather to an entire losec regionthis is just a random idea of what could happen some of the mechanisms are already in place to support a system like this it would simply be a matter of adapting them around a proper framework the point is that corruption is everywhere eves low sec regions should reflect that there is a place that operates between law and lawlessness on the edge as it werei could go on and on about other likely professions in detail but the point is that ccp knows the low sec problem is a problem it has been the subject of countless internal meetings and public discussions when i say that i want to make sure that eve is an enjoyable experience for all players this is exactly the kind of thing i am talking about i want to see the current game play we have now moved forward and low sec iteration is certainly one of the most important aspects of that

leder it seems that your biggest concern is primarily about comms bottlenecks this is coincidentally the single biggest problem faced by the csm as well hopefully csm6 can make more progress on that front but only if the right people are there to do so thats why its worth it to vote for people you think have the best chance of being able to help overcome those challenges
seleene is an excellent candidate who will be a great asset if elected to the csm as others have pointed out we seem to have complementary talents and stylesso if you have only one account vote for treborand if you have two accounts vote for trebor twicebut if you have three accounts or more accounts consider the possibility of perhaps thinking about throwing a vote seleenes waythen give all your votes to trebor
i really like your ideas for eve and the iteration cornerstone however i do have one concernyou state that you want ccp to focus on iterating internet spaceships instead of the ultimate scifi simulatorhowever time and time again ccp have stated that it is their goal to create this ultimate scifi simulator and i would just be worried that you are wasting time trying to push them in another direction which they have clearly made their minds up on i would just like to hear your opinion on this thanks
alright i have a question which has been chewing on my mind since seleene mentioned he may run for csmseleene how can you hope to have any real impact as a member of csm after having been a developer with ccp in game design youre asking for votes from the community which has been giving feedback to you game designers for years now if you didnt take the opportunity to use it and exact real change when you were being paid to how will you being csm be any better you speak of knowing which devs are open and receptive to the csm and that it will give you an advantage in advocating for the playerbase couldnt that work against you too having been an insider at ccp and now you are potentially pushing from the outside this may create some tension at meetings where youll know more than ccp may be comfortable with
i approve of this product andor service

should we worry that your past as a developer may prevent you from being impartial when working as a csm im thinking particularly of issues bought about under your watch  if csm discussions turn to say debuffing supercarriers or changing some aspects of the dominion sov system will you be able to put ego to one side and be willing to take the axe to your own creations in the same way as you would that of others
sorry seleene just stole one of your votesthere are some more left though
nope sorry youve already been in the csm and you were a former dev we need some fresh perspectives not same o same o view
seleene was never on the csm
seems that iteration is the buzzword for the 2011 cycle about bloody time it became more than something used to berate fringe elements who have been clamouring for it for years as whiners where would you like to see nullsec heading ideally speakingwhere would you like to see lowsec heading ideally speakingbiggest questions imaginable with no easy answer i know but they are very important nonetheless and many will be voting based on them
former dev not getting my vote and shouldnt be eligible
i never voted for people to get free tips to iceland  but you will get my vote if someone can scream at ccp ears about on how fixing stuff its you1
thats nicenow get out
an axe how about a flaming sword bear in mind that anything created on my watch wasnt purely my own but the result of some sort of team effort that may or may not have been what was originally intended or desired i know there are several things on tq which i would have wanted to see come out differently or finished as a case in point the old sov system was a dead end from both a technical and a game play standpoint the new sov system was designed to be able to be tweaked iterated on and balanced on the fly multiple objectives tiered goals and all that stuff yet theres so much that didnt make it into the first release of dominion that it was gimped from day one ive waited for two expansions and still not seen any sign that they are going back to it or finish it properly all i see is vague talk about how jump bridges will probably get nerfed or fixed or whatever but probably not oh look a butterfly lets make more npc stuff etciteration is all about updating tweaking and even scrapping things that do not work this should be happening much more often than once every six months or every two years its one of the main reasons i am running for csm  so i can go back there and ask in person where the hell is xxxx sansha wtf and a lot of other things
this is an awesome question but it has a very simple answer  a normal employee has to keep his mouth shut and swing the awesome bat while simultaneously trying and often failing to push points that would be common sense to most players an employee cant talk to massively or rock paper shotgun or blog about what a failure the last meeting was a csm member can do all of these things and more the csm has come much further than many would believe i remember when it first kicked off and folks inside the company had absolutely no idea what to make of it most wrote it off as a neat idea that probably wouldnt amount to much more than a big pr stunt yes many of them are just as cynical and bitter as the rest of us and with good reason over time however things changed due to the fact that the composition of the csm evolved and began to come into its own the analogy of the monster that ccp created grew out of control is pretty apt in this case im sure a few people such as hilmar fully realized what the csm could become due to the media exposure and the uniqueness of the concept most still didnt but reality crashed down on the csm skeptics last year when csm 5 presented a united front and presented their own version of excellencecsm5 worked because the members shared a common thread  they werent there to have sexy time with the devs they had a job to do and sought common ground whenever they could being a productive member of the csm requires you to understand not only the game itself but how to address your concerns to the people making it with a united front which leads me to your next questionif ccp were concerned about this then they wouldnt let former employees run for the csm i trust that the people the csm will be meeting with arent going to let such perceptions color their interactions some may not like the csm but due to how its grown they can no longer ignore iti left the company on good terms and dont plan to go in frothing at the mouth im doing this because eve is worth it for all of us as a community as people yes i would bring a new element to the table that hasnt existed before and it will be interesting to see if i win a seat how ccp deals with it i also know of a few other former employees that are watching how all this plays out so i dont think i will be the last person who attempts this hopefully i wont because i think it would be great to see a former qa or gm employee bring their own experiences to the table on behalf of the players 
seleene is an ok guy and wouldnt do a terrible job at this
about as awesome an endorsement as ive ever seen made by vile ratin turn i view seleene as a musthave addition to the csm he has a thus far unique perspective to offer that can vastly contribute to the csm team extensive experience demonstrated ability to work towards goals with others priorities in order and complete lack of any potential ulterior motivesolid mind experience and attitude1 vote
seleene is a guy that looks extremely uncomfortable when speaking to a crowd ie fanfest and so he gets my vote
roc the vote
roc the vote
hmm a possibility for a voteill ask some questions when i got more time
hiwhat do i think are the problem points in evewell personally i would have to say that there are far too many for a start a few points that i would have to put forward first just from a personal stand point are ship balancing factional warfare small gang warfare and too much progression with half finished productexpansions being placed in game with no view on fixing them or updating them to work with the current player baselooking through all the post that are in the assembly hall and features and ideas you quickly see a million individual problems with eve some confined to individuals wanting the game to work a certain way and then more importantly massive groups of people having the same problems and are being ignoredhow would i fix these problemswell that is a very difficult question for me to answer simply because the ways i want eve fixed might not be how the majority of eve wantsneeds it to bethe only way for us to fix the problems is to really listen to the players not just a half arsed post saying put your ideas in this forum and they will be looked at im sure some do but from what i have seen over the years is that they get buried under hundreds of other posts and are then forgotten aboutwhat i will be doing is organising these posts and cataloging them so rather than get pilled under loads of rubbish they get the chance to be seen by people at ccp and how strongly the players feels about things that need to get fixedso simply for starters when ccp come to me and ask what i think should be changed within eve the simple response will be to look at the points that have already been brought up many times in the forums but overlookedi hope i have tried to explain out your question a bit but if you have anything else you need to ask please do im 100 for working with the players directly rather than reading posts and forgetting about themone last addition sorry if any spelling or grammatical errors are in my posts i do try and read through everything and spot things some times things do slip througheve truth
all the brave nc warriors vote killer2 for ze csm 
man are you serious it comes across as a clone of the rent is too damn high campaign
rent is too damn high videorent is too damn high video 2
having looked through the various threads of the csm candidates i noticed a lot of similarity between their positions but none yet which seems to match my own viewsso ill go ahead and ask  are there any candidates that dont think the game was better back in 2003 and dont think we should stop adding things until lag is fixed and every ship is balanced and hell freezes over or whatever are not so much interested in small tweaks and thousands or papercuts but the bigger picture  worst thing that can happen to this game in my opinion is design by committee and creativity being snuffled out by a mountain of requests i want the csm to function as a conduit for our major concerns and our problems and especially demands for information on our behalf not deliver blueprint copies to the ccp assembly lines for production are excited about incarna and have ideas on how it should evolve so that it can be awesome and relevant rather then just fluff  will keep us informed about it and pressure ccp on releasing information unlike the current csm   want to keep a brisk expansion schedule of at least one major expansion per year if two is untenable i can accept that  think many of the expansions were pretty fun actually after the week or so of troubleshooting it took them to stop deleting bootini  want the weaker parts of the eve experience revisited faction warfare guys please but not timidly boldly the problem with those was always lack of sufficient features and being way too scared to rock the boat not allowing fw or pi for example to matter enoughso in short who wants the total scifi experience 
thats really the point isnt it it not about the majority that dont get involved in voting dont use forums and couldnt be arsed if they didif about the vile types who get upset and cant keep it ingame  on forum and will misuse anything they can lay their hands on and in these google timesi said something similar as the op did a long time ago not feeling comfortable exposing rl just to be listed as a candidatenot that there is much special about that its about knowing for a dead cold fact that having pointy views about some things and segments if getting into a position of influence and actually get some measured against them passed usually equates to ing off some really nasty types who in a very real sense will try to cause grievous harm if they get the chancenot that i have any delusions about getting voted in if i applied hence i dont even if it was anonymous its just the principle of the thing knowing that it might deter other good potential candidates
thanks for the feedback btw  i guess i just dont believe in anything that performs 100 right up to the point of it being totally destroyed which to be honest is pretty much how ship combat works at the moment i know u tend to get a reduction in top speed if ur ships taken major hull damage but thats it i guess ccp ran some simulations on sisi and realised anything more will up the lag in  considerably in large scale fightsi wouldnt want to suggest anything that adds complexity to server calculations and therefore increase lag on server nodes so i thought instead of augmenting how ships react when taking damage augment the ability of the player to understand and reactthats what lead me to think of adapting full screen damage effects like the ones u see in fps games they dont require massive overhauls in base code and they dont require any increase in server requests eithermy thinking in terms of lore is on the basis of any human sensation driven to the extreme has effects that augment your sense of reality bearing in mind capsuleers senses are connected to ships electronic sensors being bombarded with massive amounts of energy when in combat in a human context pain is just an alert message informing you of the fact your body is taking damage its just the human condition that id like to see replicated a lil morein terms of game play i see it more of a shift toward player ability and a shift away from the notion of my high sp beats your low sp because the skill comes in actually dealing and working through these effects everyone would experience the same level of effects
interesting 1
eve has no aimbot and its not on xbox its played by old poeple like me who didnt get married when they were thin enough and thus have the disposable income to buy screens so large that most of the overview and some channels fit on themalas what with years of gaming and you know no wife the eyesight isnt what it once was and it was once okso yes a font i can actualy read at this res would be nice
as were all constantly hearing hybrids just arent very good right now blasters suffer from lack of range as well as inadequate tracking within that range rails suffer from heavy cap use mediocre dps weak alpha and poor tracking  all of which is supposed to be compensated by extreme range  currently useless in todays fastprobing combat environment either lasers or projectiles are more effective in just about any high probability combat environmenttime for a fixin order for a fix to be implemented it needs above all to be easy for ccp to implement the fewer things it changes the more likely to be implemented we also need to avoid making hybrids a pale copy of either of the other two kinds of turrets we dont want lasers with ammo or capusing autcannons ideally hybrids should be as distinctive from lasers and projectiles as they are from each other not a pointless halfway housewith all that in mind here is my proposalcurrently hybrid ammo like the other types is ranged on a damage vs range continuum lower range  higher damage and vice versa my proposal is that we change that to a tracking vs damage continuum all t1 hybrid ammo would have a 0 range modifier with the lower damage ammo having a higher tracking bonus and vice versarailsthis will have a dramatic effect on railguns theyll be doing their best damage to the most distant targets but theyll lose effectiveness as targets close in itll be a little harder to get completely under the guns of a railboat because they can switch to high tracking ammo but theyll sacrifice a lot of dps to do so what well see is almost a reverse of falloff they wont obsolete arty because arty will retain the advantage of high alpha they wont obsolete beams because beams wont lose trackingdps as they close in this change will restore rails as the kings of extreme range turret combat but it will redefine that range to be within the paramaters of fights that actually occur these daysblastersthis change will solve or at least mitigate the two biggest problems that blasters currently have range and tracking by switching to a lower damage ammo the baster user will be more able to hit similar  or even smaller  size targets with no range penalties bs sized blasters at least will start to have a somewhat useful range a rokh with no range mods will have a 713km range this will put it within 50 falloff on jumping in from a gate even using antimatter with tracking enhancers well see blaster bs actually be able to usefully engage outside web rangeon a personal side note the poor old megathron with its whopping tracking bonus will once again become awesome with these changestracking mods  tracking enhancers tracking computers and target painters  will become as useful to hybrids boats as they currently are to projectile platformsit is also worth noting that if it becomes difficult to balance rails with blasters egl the one becomes overpowered with ammo bonuses that are appropriate to the other we could also add a falloff modifier to the ammo as well as the tracking modifier ideally i would prefer not to do this as projectiles are supposed to be the falloff weapon but the option is therei have deliberately avoided putting any specific numbers in to my proposal because really that kind of detail is for the balance teams to work out but i think the core of my proposal could be at least a good starting point to reviving the poor neglected hybrid turrets for instance blaster boats could still need some tweaking with respect to agility or mass to be effectivecomments and suggestions
this is a fairly radical proposal interesting nevertheless definately an option however i would like a reduced reload timer in order to make use of this ammo
having damage without tracking whats the point in both cases you lose damagei have way more evil ideamake hybrids capless and projectiles using capthis will fix issue with cap burned for catching your target and help gallente being active tankers as they are supposed to be also it will nerf minmatar boats that have utility slots combined capless guns which is plain dumbgallente boats are already using autocannons anywaythe rest of the blaster fix is the ship speed rebalancing mostly and removing selectable damage type on projectiles
doh i forgot to put that part inaddendum the reload time of hybrids would need to be changed to be approx 50 of that of projectilesaddendum the t2 hybrid ammo will probably need to be reworked from scratch and i havent got a satisfactory answer as to exactly what it would look like i would particularly welcome suggestions for that
even if lead ammo gave 25 tracking boost it would still not make me want to use blastersit would also not make me want to use lead over antimatter for blastersthe tracking boost on lead would have to be 100 in order for me to consider it worthwhileim speaking from perspective of pvp pilot who can choose any ship and weapon type and wanting most effective short range combat ship
need more support you know you want toalso this would include a 100 to shield recharge you cant repair your armor while cloaked so it would only make sense that shields dont passive rechargeremember people this is for noncovert ops cloaks only
not supported
i could swear i supported this alreadyalso the shield recharge thing
good ideamay actually reduce the number of laggy situations if bringing enough players to crash a node is no longer a valid strategy
am i understanding it rightif lag happens the server till reset all mods to have longer duration timelike if the lag is 3 seconds all mods will have 10 seconds more duration timeif im right i would support this idea
youre starting to get the idea say the node that the fight is on can support up to 500 players completely lag free and then another 500 jump in and start fighting youll experience lagyour modules cycle and dont disengage or dont turn on when u click them contacts that are already dead still appear on ur overview for a moment longer than normal etcthe server would slow down everything that has a combat or navigation element in it in the systemso dps is reduced alpha is not reps per minute is reduced speed is reduced explosion velocity reduced etc everything used in combat and navigation that has a time based element in the calculationswhat this means for the server is less requests by pilots trying to do stuff and because of that the lag is reducedremovedso those extra 500 pilots that jumped in would force the server to add bullet time to 100 so everything that took say 10 secs to cycle would take 20secs to cycle and because of that the server would be able to handle twice as many pilots that it originally could without lag as such
anything to reduce the lag monster

i once was a nc member and i can see their point why make life harder on the 00 players then it occured to me once upon a time we lived in 00 without jumpbridges and logistics occurred just fine i do support buffing manufacturing and industry in 00 though or perhaps tax empire logistics so 00 can compete i support the removal of jump bridges entirely
as this is a strawman it doesnt really need to be addressed but you do realize that this is the same set of errors thats been repeated again and again and again in this thread rightnot only did massive coalitions and blobbing exist before jump bridges and will exist after it logistics was a dramatically different situation too mineral compression carriers that had massive space rigged transport ships that could fit in carriers and carry cargo rather than just chargesthe game isnt the same as it was before bridges were introduced and acting as if it is is an absurdity you shouldnt make claims like that if you dont know the terms as it happens i didnt use a strawman there is also no objective need to make eve bigger just a subjective preference eve was also a lot bigger when it was almost unpopulated and you could fly around for hours and not see another person you could reduce warp velocity by 99 and eve would be a whole lot bigger you could make it cost liquid ozone to activate a stargate and yep eve would be a whole lot bigger but there is no objective benefit to having a bigger eve especially since a smaller eve is largely the consequence of the games increased popularity and subscriber count yes but weve already gone over the actual facts that dreaded bridge network doesnt allow people to fight a war on two fronts the drone regions bridge network didnt allow them to repel a coordinated invasion effort its bridge network didnt allow them to stave off a failscade pointing to the number of jbs and getting upset is all well and good but the actual facts gainsay your claims
ah repeating the same debunked nonsense again good plan
fight fire with fire
ive got a whole proposal over at fi for nullsecsoveriegnty onepost summary here with one of the goals being more selfreliance for sovereignty holders i havent really linked it with the idea of removing or nerfing jump bridges though
i support the decision to remove or alter jbs
remove those damm things atm they only serve those that dont need it the blob alliances have more than enough members to escort any ship from high sec to 00and while youre at it get rid of ewarfare frigs least used ships as ccp screwed everything over with the nano nerf logi ships seriously how big do you want the blob to be 100 man in fleet is 50 pvp ships and 50 logiships resulting in neverending fights only serving the one with the biggest blobalsointroduce a doomsday scriptone for aoe mode one for focused fire
i wont repeat my eve tribune rant but ill pick one detail height in wis everyone will be the same height  thats just weird more veriety would be better so supporting more fuitbowls and gallente plastic shirts
this is so lol aint eve just fun d

i dont mind telling my factories to produce a different product 1 by 1 but the routes stay exactly the same yet i have to redo themyour nuclear powerplant also doesnt have to switch its electricity network when switching to coal loleve has an import function for planets so large scale production is a perfectly reasonable way of pi add to that fluctuations and daily demands of certain products and to make a profit you really need the daily margins the prices of finished products can vary 50 from day to day
dont u know ccp has shares in logitech
sounds like to me youve forgotten the first rule of industry  researchyes 1800 click to change your product entirely is a bit of a hassle but thank god those production facilities can switch with no cost to yourself unlike real businesses that would have to pay considerable amounts on new equipment thank ccp for not making individual facilities for specific productsany1 going into mass production pi wise should research the product theyre making i never manufacture anything if its got an erratic selling history because its not good business sensein industry stability is key to reliable profit
this is definitely supported i will be adding this to my campaign blog
yep thats something id really like to haveid also like the linkage on the bulletin or just link a bm in chat or something why cant we just drag a bm into chat and all pple can add it to their bmsremember to tick the check here if you want to give your support to the ideadiscussion going on guys

yeps im sure every wormhole corp wants this
massive thumbs up good idea
im highly sceptical about letting players loose with any system that allows them to quickly and easily create vast amounts of items that could be used to induce lag i would not put it past some fcs to have their whole fleets share lots of bookmarks in order to crash a node and prevent a fight from taking placei could not support any easier means of sharing bookmarks unless it was kept separate from the main inventory system ie there should be no way to move corp bookmarks into a hangar container or cargohold and these should be kept on a dedicated node there should also be a limit on how many bms one can move into the corp or alliance shared folder at once  probably no more than 5 at a timesupported subject to significant provisos
this is true if i can buy a vanity item of molles frilly pink hat with a plex i may support space barbie yes its almost as if the chair of the csm told me that i should make an elevator proposal thread to discuss the general ideas without mechanics being the focus go figure its somewhat unseemly for you to fabricate game mechanics for a feature that hasnt been accepted let alone implemented by ccp and then claim that the game mechanics that youve invented are a reason not for ccp to accept let alone implement the feature
supported but i think rafias comment is a valid concern ccp will have to very careful how this is implementedthat said i agree that pvp in stations is essential for continuity with the rest of the gameambulate safe o7
well look at the comment in contextit wasnt a complaint that if ccp decided that disposable alts could easily gank preparedproperly tanked players itd be bad but that there shouldnt be pvp in stations because it would make stations a desolated wasteland since there would be disposable alts running around easily ganking everybody not only is that not a necessary consequence of simply allowing pvp in stations the fact that we already allow pvp in absolutely every single location in eve other than someones hangar the idea that it would necessarily lead to a wasteland is fearmongering sure ccp should balance the new content properly and mechanics should ensure that people arent ever 100 safe anywhere but that its not trivially easy to murder someone whos got a clue absolutely but jumping straight to the claim that simply allowing for pvp in stations just like it is everywhere else in eve will ruin the content blargh
oh i agree mate i support your proposition for a reason all im saying is that the potential for abuse such as rafia describes is there if the systems arent designed carefully the fact that rafia has indulged in a hysteria fuelled bout of reductio ad absurdum doesnt alter that potentialnow is the time to try to foresee potential problems and think about possible methods of avoiding them hence my pointing out 2 such in my post in your other thread after release given ccps track record of rarely looking back will be too late
ah then yah cheers and i agree of course itd be easy to screw it up and id want the csm especially to provide a hell of a lot of feedback to make sure ccp got it right but if its done properly it has the potential to be an awesome addition to the game
support
i support the concept of ganking in stations to maintain continuity with the rest of the versethat said i think there are 2 major issues that would need to be addressed to make it a viable proposition1 latency not everybody lives on top of the cluster therefore whatever system is adopted needs to account for differing pings nothing would be more disheartening than to be walking down a corridor only to have your image stutter and finding your cooling corpse on the floor 100 metres behind where you thought you were never even having seen your attacker2 cost by which i mean that a potential ganker will need to put serious effort into setting up their kill and not just log on a throwaway alt to cut some random stranger for the lulzambulate safe o7
yeah ive got no problem with those sort of mechanics i dont think station pvp should be twitch gaming or that it should be a simple matter to gank someone whos taken basic precautions
full supporti like to say that what i dont like to see is something like fps i like to use as possible the same mechanics as flying target enemy and start figthingcould be nice to click on corners and walls to get cover another plus could be to hire some bodyguards so you can go through a low sec station with protection these bodyguards act like concord copscould be nice ywo ways of shootng one normal that alarms everybody and one more sneaky to stealth assassins need skills of coursein high sec it will be safe due to guards in low secwell its low sec right only for hard guys hire some protection if you are afraid
so as a balancing mechanic to ganking in stations will people who clearly disobey the law be denied docking privileges maybe you will be denied weapons first then any kind of body armor and finally docking privileges or being confined to your cabin seems to me from reading the lore that only the seedier places in the universe even allow people to carry weapons on stations anyways maybe there will finally be a reason to have a positive security standing other than a number next to your picture maybe you would need a higher security standing to even leave your cabin with a weapon perhaps even high security areas that deny access to people without the proper standing you want to be an assassin go right ahead but it shouldnt be a one sided free for all either
i like this quite a lot i think a lot of it should come down to the ui though no names of toons floating over your heads to point you out from a crowd of npcs etc that alone would solve a mess of easy assassination issues if you had to absolutely know what your target looked like otherwise you go and shoot some random npc and station security does what it does best
yes you can kill the ratters in system this is true these agents however have the possibility to allow you to force them to fight to protect what is theirs they give a target for small gangs that can have a meaningful impact on null sec sovereignty what if these were just one of many small targets within null sec would this have the possibility to increase small gang roams through the area would this help alleviate the following problem that you suggested there are places tucked deep within the blue ass of some alliance where you dont see a single hostile for weeks on endon the topic of farming this is not another thing to farm it is a thing to farm instead of sanctumsas far as difficulty goes ccp already has agents in space these are cosmos agents and one of them actually has you go kill another one during the minmatar mission line now i am not saying that these things are the same and i do realize that my proposal would be difficult but if you use this reasoning then ccp should not have created mission agents null sec wormhole space complexes walking in stations or planetary interaction you may not care about any of these things but the point is that they were all difficult to implement in their own waysthank you for your questions
i support this proposal
supported and already added to my campaign here
thumbs up
i just got kaikka in a belt it was a nightmare to kill my tengu couldnt break the tank so i ended up having to bring my alt in a phoon 20 jumps to where i was exploring i guess the change isnt that bad it just kinda crushs that awesome feeling when you get an officer because now its a pain to kill
can i say that i find this combo a bit fun you want hard normal rats but soft officers for pvp purpose
venkul mul i was arguing for my idea of increasing officer spawn rate to compensate for increased difficulty which would result in supply decrease of officer lootnow that i killed 2 officers since the patch i understand their strengths and weaknesses and find them acceptable
well see there isint much risk anyway tbh its just something i found as a minor annoyance
there is a nonpublic skill warp accuracy  wish they would make it public
the more annoying situation and one that should be addressed is telling it to warpdock at the station when it arrives at a distance it heads to the station but forgets that it was supposed to dock thats annoying
well the pirates who r willing to take risk wont be banned at all because i dont think anyone suggested to nerf their gank so theyll still have the same amount of killmails as before its only their ability to escape their consequences that will be affected so actually only the riskaverse ones aka the ones afraid of taking one loss compared to all their easy blob ganks would effectively ban themselves from this and its those same ones that will still remain unaffected no matter how many rewards u throw at anyone for killing them because even if there was a blob of antipirates the riskaverse pirates will just run and hide even harder simply because they can thats why atm its not worth it to chase them down because ull get nothing out of it since they cant be caught
thats where i stopped reading
yeahwhy even botherop supported buff all rats actually both null and low in terms of difficulty and reward current ones are a bit of a joke espeshially after seeng sleepers
its funny that in the old days 00 rats used to be stronger altho player ships had weaker defenses tooand there were many more warp scrambling ratsthen ccp decided to boost npc bounty and reduce npc power  made it as bot friendly as possible its like ccp was designing the game for botsi still want more warp scrambling rats every elite frigatecruiser spawn should have a point nonelite spawns should have 20 chance of having a 20km point
fixed for younano nerf faction ship buff projectile buffwhine and you will be rewarded
sometimes we sit and really could use one more item slot on the hangar desktop cos you sit and have to split up salvage loot and then thing you buy so why not make it possible to have 2 item menues a normal item and a backup item slot of somekind
use station warehouse
so we have to go out and buy containers now why not just split the item up i dont want to be forced to buy containers
cross posting is bad
can fire an aoe weapon that detonates throwing flack from the origin and causing damage to all ships within its area of effect as ships move farther away from the origin of the blast damage is reduced dreads must be in siege mode to operate artillery and must select the range at which the projectiles explodeammo selection varies the radius of the blast range at which the projectiles can explode and the reduction over distance in damage that targets take as they appear farther from the originartilery must be sighted and ranged manually and fire after a loading delaytbh i would love to be able to manually control some kind of gun in this game even if i only got to fire once every 50 seconds p
sounds like the titan before apocrypha just remind the reason why ccp changed the doomsday please
kinda like a bomb launcher would be interesting to allow bomb launchers to fit on dreads or some similar cap ship
lag from killmails being produce among other reasons
i was thinking more of a cross between bombs and smartbombs adjustable range high damage but small aoe titan dd nuked the grid artillery would be more for breaking up logi groupsalt of op btw
i think it would be neat if the targeting system for this specific weapon type worked off of the scanner probe method artillery pilots could select where they want to bombard on a 3d map and use combat probes to locate groups of enemy ships overall this kind of weapon would be powerful but hard to aim of course longrange would be ideal
they need to warp cloakedmy bs major is gallente but a dominix for 500mil why would i ever fly that over a dominix for 60milif you are just going to use it as a bops bridge fair enough it just needs to exist and have cargo enough for fuel but to justify taking to the field it needs to be 12 the price or better still use covops cloaki know i cant bridge in a normal domi but i can bridge in t3 or recons and actualy be usful i could also move through gates with some hope of staying alive once im ini do support bops change but not more drones  just means more lag and op vs smaller ships 10 bonused hamerhead iis on your cruiser 10 ec600s on your anything thats op
give all black ops 150 ms to base speed and you got yourself a truly unique and desirable battleship class
it would probably also have a cooler name spacebasket you can have that one for free

u mad brook seriouslyeve has always been portrayed as a game where everything is possible from the aforementioned frig taking out a battleship through to creating an industrial empire where trillions of isk flow through your corporation not to mention the devious side of espionage and corp theft there will always be limitations based around hardware and coding and time only a few days ago we were discussing the options availiable to the devs regarding upgrading hardware to take care of lag devs take a look at the hp superdome series hard core iron for a hard core game p  the problem that i can see from your posts is that you dont understand the complexity and demands of an mmo when you are talking about changing the gameplay and ambulation etc in a single player game i would definatley agree with you this kind of almost unfinnishedness would be completley unacceptable meaning that the game would never even see out 7 years let alone be thrivinghowever this is an mmo and as such is not based purely around you but around 350000 people all inhabiting the same space lets take for example wow sorry for swearing guys that game has many of the same limitations your talking of in pvp combat if you are on your own and 5 people come up to you in pvp guess what you will get ganked your damage always hits in the same place and way lol seeing any similarities here nearly every point you mentionied is the same just in a slightly different way and as for insurance guess what when my ship pops it gets replaced for me by my alliance wi best dot thats the advantage of running with a large group of players they got your back and lets not forget that in wow if u get ganked okay you dont loose several golds worth of armour and weapons oh wait no you kinda do its called a repair bill just in eve if you get away you get a repair bill if you dont you get a replace bill its not that differentthe fact is that the changes you would like would kill eve for almost every player bar the small american whine bags i refer you to swg where after much complaiing sony made the jedi class a selectable class from outset rather than something you had to work for yes swg trolls i am also painfully aware of the combat changes that also contributed boo sonyeve has its issues none of us are denying that we would all like lag free fights we would all like insurance that coveres our ship modules and a bj from the 10 hookers drunk of spiced wine in our cargo holds but that aint gonna happen just like i would like 20 million pounds and to be stranded with the entire female cast of the russian ballet on a yaht somewhere nice and sunny but hey in eve as in real life we dont get what we want all the timeps join a decent alliance stop running missions and enjoy eve for what it is if you feel so strongley about these changes run for csm and propse it to the devs yourself oh wait after this you would not get the votes my bad maybe you would be better going back to wow or hello kitty island adventure

so basically youre trying to compare real life to eve and then you use science fiction to justify pathetic and miserable game design decisionswonder what was your aim there what were you trying to do actuallyyou have a point regarding scam cost and insurance but itd be me as a player who decide not the idiotic flawed thinking behind the current system thatd dictate how it worksif i spent 15 billion in a frigate and i want to insure it for 15 billion i should be allowed to do sodoes not take a genius with the current system nobody is encouraged to invest in costly ships and modules and to actually use them to full potential since itd be ridiculous to risk high tier equipment in a ed ganki believe theres a simple reply to those idiocies you wrote regarding pvp is good ok just how many real life friends did you invite to eve and kept on playingtoggleable graphical optionsim sorry but you must be a sad imbecile if you havent understood this basic gaming concept yet or more probably youre one of those ridiculous fanboiiis that get their panties in a bunch when somebody criticizes their precioussssall non fundamental graphical options can be made toggleable no hemorraging of playerbase to be had if you think the solution for  15 secondsi was hoping to see smilies or something after that sentence but there are noneyou are actually trying to be serious about thishave you ever played anything different than eve in the last five years for s sake are you simply ed to even dare think about such stupidityhmmm just how much pve do you play preciselylets put it this way eve is in the poor dire and miserable state it is right now because people is just ok with things even if theyre idiotic or just plain annoyingdifferently than youi love the gameso i want it to become betterwithout the annoying bits with its ed issues fixedas i wrote if theres any concern about rewards and iskmaking per minute lower rewards drops etcany player worth its subscription will immediately agree that its better to have things without the stupid and boring travel than to have them more profitablebesides the point i made included another issue regarding accepting and turning missions in you gotta dock for that to work in the year 100000000 yet you conveniently avoided that argumentyou obviously dont play pve for  and the fact that you agree with the original  priceless proof that your arguments are worthless rubbishyour reply is surely more deserving of respect than iokaas but you eventually dont deserve to play eve for s sake
tldr luminus mallus still fails to see some of the flaws in his epix rage and slnder postwell to start i am heavily dislexic and have issues with my spelling granted i may not be a gramatical genious but never the less i have spent the last 5 years of my life field testing various games for numerus game companies i have worked ondeadspace 2fallout 3batman arkam asylamlegostarwars 12bfbcvarious mmos includingstartreck onlinefinal fancisy onlinelego universeontop of that there are countless flashbrouser games that i have had a hand in testingimprovingnow thats out of the waymy pve experiance consists ofl45 missions in all faction spacesnew incursionsexploration in serpentis infested regionsmining at the begining of my eve careerproducing items for marketsand trading had my own mini low sec heavencompleated 4 of the 7 epic arcscompleated all cosmos missions for gallente minmatari dont profess to know everything about eve but it would seem that i have a better grip of the reasons behind most of issues that you say existinsurance mk2so how dus this sound you want to pay 25 bill to insure your ship ur only gonna get 25 bill max back what if u lose that ship to concord concord mails the insurance company that would look a little somthing like thisto insurance guyzfrom concordto whom it may concern the ship armageddon class battleship owned by insert ur name here was today involved in an agressive act against a non sanctioned targetwe at concord promptly removed this ship from the field using excessive force resulting in the loss of all crew members and stores with exception to the pod pilotwe have now sceased the wreckage and are holding it for inspectionreguards concordnow the letter you reciveto your name herefrom insurance companyfor the recient loss of your ship we pay you 000isk crime dont payreguards insurance companyps lol ur got ownedthis is what u wantas i sed b4 if u wanna risk flying it the do so just stop complaining about insurancemissions mk2i have never had an issue with docking to recive hand in missionsits makes good sence in game terms firstly the agents in stations are not pod pilots game mechanic it brakes up mission time reduces ability of bots to chain missions efectivlythe only way for an agent to contact you is to send you an eve mail there is an exception to this however in some missions cosoms epic arcsthere is also the fact that a high proportion of missions require you to collect an otem of some kind that needs to be returned to a stationdont get me wrong though i would like to see some missions that i could accept in space not sayin they dont exist just that i have never had one to the best of my knoylagetravle times eve is not about instant gratification if u want that then go play a more generic mmo like ffo wow or fso failing them any fps graphics mk2ok i think you missed the pointto add better graphing to eve ccp needs to improve there servers and software this means that they will have to upgrade and replace old hard ware with newer varents to cope with the added strain of the new content by doing this ccp will inevidably have to raise the bar for minimum specs because people who have played eve are not running the same setup as ccp people get ed when game companys do  like thisits all well and good doing it to a stand alone product that has boxed expansions but to an mmo its rairly herd ofthe best example i can think of in ricent history is eas battlefield badcompany 2  it was reliced with the ability to tern everything down to minimum including low res screen formats 8pl
friends that i have introduced to the game10 or 15 i think i do however have 5 that still activly playi myself was introduced to eve via a friend and quite franckly i would argue that is is byfar the best mmo anyone has ever showed to me the fact that i am still here sez thatthere are people out there you included i would bet that find games like this get good at them and expect everything to be easy and dumbed down enough for the brainless masses thankfully ccp has done a good job of weeding out the bad eggs although some remainthis game is for people who actuly are invested in there charictors not just in the i kicked ur ass bragging write of over online games there are no best in slots only different setupsif you fail to pay atention for even a second then the game will crush younuf sed
this proposal is so terrible i dont even know where to begin unless op is trolling in which case well played sir
i too suffer from verbal diarrhea
ok im done somebody takes the time to show you their different perspective and this is how you respond not just this example but time and time again if you want to put forward a proposal expect that some people may disagreestill not supported on the basis that you refuse to see anything but your own narrow view and are either exceedingly rude or simply a troll
confirming the fact that eve doesnt have any veteran players
read the original post dimwit just because i use a couple of strong words doesnt mean im raging or slanderingthis this is actually incrediblesince you obviously write testing as in downloading pirated copies and wasting life away in their forums i believe you sadly youre pathetic for thatwow i did those too the others even your grandma played themin all honesty only an imbecile would take your word for this what you write shows actually wholly the contraryyou lose it to concord you get your 25 bill back thats how insurance works you   regardless of the reason you pay to cover an expense when the insurance conditions meet you get your money you can tweak insurance conditions all you want ie being concordokkened doesnt apply for refunds but it is still insuranceyou obviously dont even have knowledge of the most common and basic tools of modern society and you want to comment on a game which is a complex derivation of said tools patheticthis is the actually only good reply of your whole postscifi explanations are for idiot nerds honestlylast time i checked 1 second ago eve was still a game developed to deliver a fun experience to attract playersits the year one million in game you can communicate with your fleet members instantly through a voice channel you can communicate with your corporation members from across the whole universe with a keyboardyet your agents cant give turn in missions unless youre dockedonly an abnormally stupid person would be ok with thisbest argument ever rofl youre patheticagain eve is a game reducing travel times does not mean instant gratification it only means getting rid of edly staring at space doing nothing dont even get me started on autopilotrofl dude your ignorance on the subject is gargantuan graphics are not server side you ed piece of ricochet shield effects damage textures shell casings everything can be made two dimensional and client sidedo everybody a favor and never reply to anybody else in any game forum you ignorant  
hahahahahahahahaha no this is too richdo you think that i wrote the original post for the peoplethat agrees with meseriouslydudei wrote it for youthe people that agrees with meisnotplayingeveadditionally you wrote take their time yet what most here did was not take their time they shat on their keyboards took a dump on their keyboards and pressed post reply wasted everybodys time with their idiocythat might be ok with you but it doesnt sparkle with meeve is a mediocre game that cant satisfy a general gaming population a game that is not evolving into a better game because its hardcore population is so dim witted and they have their heads so much up their asses that they dont want to see the obvious flaws and even less they want them fixed period
i enjoy when people gank me i like fighting against the odds sometimes iwe win sometimes that is luck often it is because iwe outsmart the enemy in some way that is skilli misunderstood the complaintexcept that once upon a time when i was noobish i did this i ventured from high sec to low repeatedly i learned from my mistakes i started killing them back i got better i joined a bigger corp i got better it doesnt sound like you really even tried low sec in other news the greatest loss of ships in one battle in eve history happened in low sec uemon 20 super caps dead in one fight low sec does get actionof course you would so would everyone else it would also be heavily exploited it is counterproductive to the game such a mechanic would promote selfsufficiency no one should be self sufficienti have been in fleets that were beaten by outnumbered enemies i have been in fleets that won while heavily outnumbered you might be surprised but that is as common as a bigger fleet beating a smaller fleetno ship can fit all forms of offensive at the same time i see sensor damps fairly often they are highly annoying neuts vamps sensor links tracking links command modules painters webs points bubbles smartbombs bombs the list goes on they are all used
and yet while the big budget mmos rise and fall eve continues to steadily increase in population maybe ccp is doing it right and the other mmos are doing it wrong
well just one word for op abuse reported
locking this as a trolling thread its ok to express your ideas that you would like to bring to the csm but please do this in a constructive manner attacking everyone that posts that they do not like something of your idea isnt appropriate on this forum everyone is entitled to their opinions

the goal1 to greatly reduce effectiveness of gatecamps as the means of controlling and securing a volume of space 2 to create more opportunity for small and medium sized fleet to enter someones sov space from nowhere meaning spawn deep withing thei territory and have a real chanse of doing some damage before appearing in all intell channels3 to ease logistics for small entities when jumpbridges are removed whihc i hope they are these wormholes cannot be used to supply a large alliance due to mass restrictions these wormholes mustbe easier to scan down from empire than from nullnot allow passage of capital shipsconnect to both hs and lsallow a medium sized fleet to pass there and back that means that we need more than 2 billion of massknown space known space connections already exist albeit they are quite rair not nearly frequent enough to make a real difference this is a very lowcost solution that will only require ccp toincrease mass restrictions on some wormholesmake them more commonthe resultsyou will have random roaming gags appearing out of nowhere and disappearing into nothing without warning possibly doing damage and you cant camp them out the average dude can get his  to empire easiersome more trafic to lowsec and many whs will connect there
as far as increasing the number of kspace to kspace wormholes significantly goes i fully agreehoweverall these things are not necessary
i agree with the idea in principle i proposed it myself in the csm minute thread when the jb rage started i agree with omara that most of it isnt necessary just increase the number of k space to k space wormholesliang
also supported but keep wh mechanics as they are  just increase the number of kspace to kspace whsincrease travel increase trade increase trouble

dont agree with random faction patrolsthese will have a detrimental impact i think unless they drop something really nice and if they drop something nice itll just be pirated to death so that within 3 months no one goes after themyou can already put pos up just need to fix the code that allows you to rent slots in labsassembly arrays to other entities something that has existed in the code but never been fixed properlyability to sell kill rights could be an interesting fix for the current bounty system
whats with all the former ccp employees applying this term 
ccp employees and csmits almost like the deck is stacked to make sure the csm remains stagnate and meaningless
nice to see other kiwis playing from dunedin myself and even standing for csm i sincerely wish you all the best dealing with the chch earthquake aftermath  insurance is going to be important in the coming daysweeksi see you mention afk cloaking  whats your stance on the topicpersonally i see it as fine the way it is ive been in systems with afk cloakers hanging around and been able to get on with business as mostly usual ive also gone to hostile systems and cloaked up to hunti also have kids this means that i need to be able to step away from the game at a moments notice so in that sense cloaking is a very important part of the game for me  it might be afk it might not but either way cloaking makes nullsec life feasible
as i said i am also not 100 convinced these will solve the issuethe problem as i see it is that the riskreward is not enough of an inducemnet when compared with the riskreward or either highsec or 00 so you either have to reduce the risk random patrols or something else or increase the reward now the risk in lowsec is very similar to if not higher than that is 00 which makes balancing the riskreward equation even more difficult so something must be done to deal with the risk before you can get a balanced progression from high through low to zero secthis will nto be an easy or easily accepted fix but to restore some balance something needs to be done i am in favour of small changes to slowly try to bring things into balance rather than a complete rewite which introduces to many variables
nope not very pleased with the meetings notes ive read we need new people in the csm not keep sending the same people and expecting a different result
i think that a certain amount of consistency would be a good thing  to prevent every council from having to start from scratch getting to know each other and ccp but at the same time new people with new ideas should be given a chance so take your own pick
so im assuming the epic arcs dont actually use agents in stations and you are ignoring the npc agents in places like outer ring ore agents and you dont care about lp for faction gear from those factionsdont get me wrong  i would be shocked if most folks in npc 00 systems did missions but i know folks who did and they did it for lp for specific itemshow does removing agents from npc 00 stations make any impact on the game positivelyeditfollow upreducing the size of npc 00 eliminates the room for smaller alliances that cannot stand alone against the supercap onslaught to grow in places like syndicate and outer ring foster alliance growth allow them to learn the ropes of 00 and earn a decent amount of isk when rattingplexingmining you totally lost any chance of my support at all with the stupidity that only allows carebear nation and sovereign sprawling slumlords
ill be watching you on this point precisely where i expect from ccp once and for all to take a serious look in to gallentehybrids stuff but not only all other races need here and there some adjustements and i havent seen any serious action from actual csm in this matter nor ccps coments to some threads existing now since 2 yearsi support you because im convinced you will do your job seriously but make no mistake ill be back to get answers
i just wanted to throw a few words in here in support of trebor the last go around i split my 6 accounts equally between dierdra vaal trebor and mynxee since mynxee and dierdra arent running this time ive thrown my hat into the ring and i sincerely hope that i will get to work alongside trebor in csm6 i know he understands that the csm has a lot of work to do and hes certainly proven his desire to push things forwardso after youve voted for me if youve got an extra account left vote for trebor too
good to know youre running again what are your thoughts on proper accountabilityaccounting for character transfers to make them more transparentspecifically the difficulties faced in looking up histories based on forum postings  that may or may not have been successful transfers there is also a big question mark on personalfriendly transfers not involving the forumhmm  let me dig up an old an buried ah post 
trebor gets my vote for nagging and pestering ccp to not lose focus on the little things and for awesome ui improvements 1
that depends entirely on the resources ccp applies to the problem of redesigning them as always there is tension between bright and shiny new stuff fun for devs to work on and remodeling the old stuff not so much fun to do but much more fun for the current players it is no secret that i am in favor of more emphasis on the lattersome people in ccp have this position that players dont do game design but even if you accept that position as true which i dont it is also the case that no game design survives contact with the players for this reason i have consistently recommended that any proposed major changes like a nullsec revamp be tigertested by player expert groups during the paper design phase one would hope that ccp gd devs are confident enough to be able to engage with the players in this wayas for my personal opinions about what might be interesting to consider here are a fewnullsec move away from timerbased hpbashing sovwar perhaps to an occupancyactivity system as many have suggested organic blob limitation so after a certain point while you can bring extra guys to a fight they dont help that much adjustments to forceprojection and logistics which are not the same thing and which have subflavors improvements in manufacturing infrastructure to reduce the dependence on the jita tit note that most of these are interrelated and need to be addressed as a coherent wholelowsec lowsec faces a unique challenge in that it is in many ways the worst of all possible worlds for example lets say you want to make piracy more viable as an eve career path well more pirates means you need more fat merchantmen attracting fat merchantmen means there must be rich resources for them to exploit but if the resources are rich enough to make it worth the risk as opposed to sov nullsec which will be safer then governments alliances will move in to farm and tax them squeezing out the pirates just as in the real world piracy is a marginal occupation fixing lowsec is probably the toughest gamedesign challenge in evehaving never bought or sold a character i have no experience to draw upon but suggestion in the thread you link to  that transfer history be exposed in the api  is not unreasonable at first glance
the wizardry games were awesome
thanks finnbtw everyone if you support my candidacy you can really help out by entering the billions for ballots lottery and then putting an endorsement and podfather link in your forum sig
good because we all know that at the moment the value of ingame isk is far over the value of icelandic krUFFFDna
trebor has my vote ps vuk laus comment about how trebor doesnt know anything about 00 pvp only sealed the deal  anything which moves the game away from the ncs idea of pvp is good in my book
well until ccp actually defines what exactly they mean related to the ultimate sci fi simulator and produce a roadmap that is all vaporware iterations is based on real stuff that is already startedexisting saying they want to create a sci fi simulator is just big empty words and im not much of a fan of big empty words or things that are awesome until backed up by an actual plan meanwhile iterationsi have accepted that things like incarna will be a part of eve because the powers that be have deemed it essential to both their marketing strategy and necessary technological milestones i am at odds with this design paradigm for the simple reason that to me eve online has always been a game about spaceships however as you pointed out eve is no longer going to be just about spaceships ccp are in the process of adding a whole new side to it so we all have to learn how to deal with that this means that all sides of eve are going to need iteration which means working with the csm with a view on how to approach thatin that sense the csm isnt a waste of time because it can play the role of guardian for the interests of the players it cant prevent but it can make visible things like ccp wasting lots of time on things that really dont matter to players although it is no use to oppose everything the csm can still ask the tough questions about what is being allocated either to incarna or to spaceships that is to the benefit of ccp and to the players at largei hope this helps clear up how the csm can be useful with regard to helping keep ccp honest about how they intend to apply their resources as csm5 has shown it is in ccps best interests to convince the csm that what they plan to do is in their customers best interest how are the players that the csm represents getting the best bang for their buck these are the questions that need to be asked and ccp needs to be answering them with more than it will be awesome
the csm is not guardian of the game populace yeah thats the pr line but its not truetheres no real need to ship folks to iceland after all with video conferencing etc technologies it could be done just as easily over such medium and require no real travel its pr nothing more nothing less much like soe ignored its senate with swg during the cu and nge development ccp has mostly ignored the csm in both cases a few minor things have been changed as a result of said groups but ultimately major game changes are decided independently of them even if said groups are led to believe they have input
what is your stance on bottinghow far are you willing to go with discussions regarding bottingare you aware of the full extent of bottingare you aware of the full extent of rmting ie alliance leaders rmting through rentersedit what do you think about microtransactionsplex for remaps for or againstwhat do you think about plex for ship customization
whatre your feelings on pvp in wis
woot will definitely vote for you couldnt believe it when i saw your csm sig on another forumthe above poster beat me to the bottingrmt question but im also interested in your answeroh can you please send those free tacos kthxbye
an obstructive csm will only lead to ccp getting even more out of touch with playersseleene worked on a bunch of stuff when he was actually at ccp
would you consider delayed local and the associated changes to dscan an iteration or new content
vote roc
we both know that communications from ccp can sometimes be unclear or less than timely what do you foresee as csm6s key challenges in that regard and what ideas have occurred to you for tackling those challenges
what sort of improvements are you forthe game incidentally cant survive without a stream of new content but fixing old content should be of equal importance as well
hello my name is imigo montoya you play eve prepare to be represented on csmso why should you vote for me to represent youfirst of all i love this gamei want to see it reach the full potential it can while retaining the awesome unique flavour that it has i started a couple of years ago and moved out to 00 with my corp as a one month old character and have been there ever since while i prefer the freedom of nullsec i have also done a lot of empire both high and lowsec based activities with alts i currently run three accounts and even got lost in a couple of wormholes so ive experienced a lot of evesecondly i am well qualified to represent the voice of the playersmy professional experience includes it support multimedia production management and lecturing in particular cosc360  computer game design in my spare time i design and make games and have even won a couple of awards i have significant experience dealing with the kinds of real world issues that ccp deal with and finding ways to overcome them both technical and gameplay this places me in a strong position to put forward player concerns and desires to the devs in a way they can appreciateso if you have any questions ask here or in the ingame channel imigo for csm if you want to catch me when im online to discuss anything
cross posting from another threadsnip unrelatedseriously though while i havent been able to experience all aspects of eve particularly those things limited to certain levels of skillpoints like flying supercarriers i have delved into every aspect that i can to see what its like even if it doesnt particularly interest me eg mining pi spying regardless of whether or not i personally enjoy an activity i will try it because what i do particularly enjoy is analysing game playbecause of that i have a broad understanding of all aspects of eve which i look at with a critical often pedantic part of being an academic eye i really like what ccp have done with this game even if some aspects dont specifically appeal to me because what they have created draws in so many peoplei recognise eve as being built from the ground up to be a massively multiplayer online game unlike many which are online with massive numbers of players all engaged in a singleplayer experience im looking at you wow the things that people often gripe about afk cloaking can flipping suicide ganking are mechanics that encourage player cooperation to defend against in these examples this to me is what makes eve special and i will fight to preserve thatamongst many other reasons of course so just vote for me already
yes i am runningyes i have a clue as to what this is all aboutyes i would be a good choice for some of you to vote for but that is true of a lot of the candidatesthat last part is important even though you are getting one vote per account please remember that you are electing a council not a president we need a team that can work together and manage to present strong messages to ccp some folks seem to be looking for their candidate be it null sec faction wars whatever if you are looking for someone who is only going to focus on one issue well then    move along nothing to see herei have written digests of past csm meetings i read the raw logs to see how things are done not just what was accomplished i read the other peoples platforms and campaign messages but for a different reason than you might expect i read them to see what the people i hope to work with are like the csm needs to be a team not a set of individuals who each have their own personal axes to grind if you asked i could point to folks i would like to see on the csm council with me that is the key here the council is supposed to represent the players and make decisions that make the whole game better so we duke it out in forums and blogs and campaign slogans we fight for our little piece of a woefully small active voting population some candidates are depending on their own alliances to propel them to the top others are famous enough that they have a fanbase that might do the same those are how they will be elected fine i am looking for what will happen after that will they get along will they try to reinvent the wheel and rebuild the csm to make it more efficient a common first topic of new csms it seems will they listen to you the voters and more importantly will they talk to you when they are allowed toelect a team elect people who want the whole game to be better not just ones who are sitting on one issue elect people who know that they are not going to do it all and they may not succeed every time ones who can go the distance and wont burnoutoh    elect me because i am one of those peoplehonest have i ever lied to youmike azariah    csm 6ok i hope you will now ask questions about specific topics and keep on taskyeah i dream a lot it is the roleplayer coming out in mem
this product and or service has been endorsed by megoodluck mr azariah
best luck in your bid for a seat mike you have been an avid csm supporter and in my view have a very good awareness of what some of the key challenges are for the councilhow about your take on low sec and how the csm should approach bringing such complex bigger picture issues to ccp
i believe you have some unrealistic goals eve is about might makes right renters pay rent because they cannot hold the space on their own and thus not paying it means the neighbor will overrun them in fact most of your topics deal with that and really are unrealistic goals the rebalancing of moons is a good idea an expansion of the decoration system would be nice to have the coalitions etc shrink you have to increase what a single system can sustain currently a single system has a hard time supporting more than a half dozen folks even at top end military index it cant support more than a dozen regularlyyour manifesto is unrealistic and will lead to a worse eve not a better one in addition since your the alt of someone that has already served on the csm extreme was in csm2 its time to say no and let someone else have a spot not been to impressed with whats come out of the csm from its inception
greetings for those of you who dont know me im kalrand and im running for csm i have an eleven point plan of csm ideas which will be shared over the next few daysfirst i thought it would be nice for people to get to know me the player before i jumped into the political stuffive been playing since january 2009 and ive been very active in the more economic aspects of eve ive run empire manufacturing corporations been a prolific 00 moon miner and participate heavily in the market discussion forumi urge people to view my posting history herethe overriding idea of my candidacy is the followingi believe that the in game economy is the lens through which ccp should view any proposed change or actioni am willing to answer any and all questions in this thread
do you have an etsy account if i vote for you im going to want a tshirt ill even consider paying for it based on how much of a coolkid it will make me at next years fanfesttldr shirt or gtfoedit in all seriousness i read your ideas in md youve got my support good luck in the running
please fix the l4 stealth bomber farming it is extremely silly
a thread that seems to make sense and not filled with bias talk personally id like to see ccp post proposed changes to anything and make them testable in sisi before implementing them in tranquility
they do that a lot in the programming world its called the unforseen bugs of doom unless everyone was to be on the test server and try out the patches then ccp wont find all of the bugs but then again out of all the people on the test server only very few actually look for bugs
lol i just laugh when i see stuff like this a company makes a game that earns them money and you believe that much effort isnt put into it wait till you start programming and doing business meeting deadlines and youll know whats upforums arent made for whining like this but to actually fix things that have been tampered with or didnt come out well during inductionmicrosoft would have found a way to totally annihilate viruses from their platforms if it were possible they have a system for reporting bugs which ccp also has they test releases before introducing them in main server im tired
viable solution if minnie ships get more cap and gallente get less
despite their adherence to hybrids are meant to be different really the only thing that needs to be done here is hybrids made just as effective as autocannonartillery are now but given boosts to either damage or range simply because they use cap and the projectile turrets dontthis of course would entail buffing gallente though  something ccp seems completely unwilling to do  which even though it would also buff caldari no one cares about caldari turret hulls anymore
i specifically didnt put any numbers into my proposal for just this reason if you think that lead would need a 100 tracking bonus to make this work then thats cool lets run the numbers and see if that makes sense
interesting but you should consider the cap use part too the different hybrid ammunitions has a different cap use your change should require a cap use rebalance too
meh im not keen on your ideahere is one i posted a while ago
why would we need to change the cap characteristics
i will support anything that results in hybrids being looked at because frankly they cant be made any worse at this pointthe more i use them the more obvious it becomes that they are completely broken right now compared to other weapon systems currently flying a myrmidon with autocannons  easier to fit higher damage from further away selectable damage better tracking no cap use theres absolutely zero downside
well i like the idea for rails for blasters however you would need insane tracking boosts to archive something useful
although i love gallente and blasters it is inevitable that they will give one of them a buffthat said this is the most wellthought out and best idea proposed by someone who isnt me supported
this is a really quite interesting ideai support that this be considered in the options for buffing hybridskinda off topicgallente ships have trouble getting into range with other ships  why not give them instead of giving them enough cap or reducing the mwd cap the ability for a short burst of speed to pounce on a target once or maybe to burn out of a fight  but not to sustain high speedsthis would probably be best represented by giving a bonus to mwd speed whilst keeping cap as is not enough to run mwd  guns for long or a bonus to mwd overheat speed bonus
would ephemerons suggestion of 100 for iron be sufficient
gallente less cap why oono it would remain intactminnies would get boost depending on cap use of new projectiles
i loved this when read originally not only is it a viable alternative it maintains the different but useful concept that so many beg for should be considered as a viable solution that actually works for two racial sets not just one
your general idea is interesting has option and i like the honesty about avoiding numbers endeed this is ccps jobhowever one point the reduction of reloading timethe nonsens is right in this 350rg ii gets 4m3 of capacity and the largest one 425rg ii gets 2m3 same nonsens with blastersnow i understand the need of reduction reload to swap ammo for the blasters but instead of this i would rather like to see a third dmg type be included em for distant ammo and explo for short amo giving them the right in tha face blasters should be and they are notwould this change the tears about i want to swap fast my ammo noreload for missiles is 10sec and if i remember well not conected right now minies stuff too the only ones swaping instantly are the amarrians honestly i dont think this reload time should be shorter but hybrids should shoot mutch faster and so have more capacity than they haveedit capacity with trackingrofdmg tweek either dmg types or dmg values should not make them op but make any pilot fool enough to get in to te falloffop range of blasters think twice avoiding the actual easy situation for a vaga double rep ab on to keep blaster bss at 20km smiling all teeth out gotchajust an opinion
excellent question actually not this easy to answeriron deals around 4167 of antimatter damage keep this in mind when you read this i did run some graphs in eftiron mega 1 web 3x cormacks tcs with scripts  101 better tracking against a mega with just a web but antimatter since i was mostly monitoring the range of 05km the range difference isnt this important t1 ammo normal pvp fitsplategank mega plategank ruppiagainst a ruptureplate gank scramweb no ab 45 degree movement  orbit your break even point is around 2km after this antimatter out damages it however the it prevents the rupture for shaking off next to 100 of the incoming dps till 200m while this point is around 800m for the antimatter mega at 1km the antimatter mega deals around 36dps while the iron mega can do 157 dps break even point is mostly 2km where antimatter surpasses the iron  100 tracking by raw dps if we put antimatter in the iron mega the numbers look a lot better it pulls off a 378 dps at 1km against the rupture what is 10 times more than the mega does today peak would at 5400m with 797 dps for the 100 tracking mega with antimatter and 718 for the normal mega at 6900mbtw the 100 fit with antimatter scales up really well against a ab rifer beyond 5km till it reaches nearly 380 dps against it a 10kmstandard mega deals like no damage at all against it till 95kmas you can see it is not so easy even more so if you consider that you are not in the position to dedicate the range in a blaster ship as you where before qr within web range the numbers look good as you only look at them in theory but with the lack of range control you will end up with the worst case more often then not where even a massive 100 tracking boost doesnt change this muchfor situations where you really need it it would probably still not sufficientcombined with the problem that it does far less damage by itself if you look at large blasters and solosmall gang pvp where it creates the most issues this days on the other hand it would slaughter stuff at bigger ranges than point blank really quickmegarokh for instance and would create in gangs a rather huge sphere where smaller ships can hardly enter without getting slaughtered even without hard tacklescramswebs it basically boils down to the problem that tracking scales rather bad with range and something that tends to be balanced at close range can be quite a bit out of balance at other rangesthats basically one of the few reasons why i would prefer the stronger web over far more tracking it scales better gives you a far better range control and by this it reduces most of the problems that you face today to manageable levels for a experienced pilot while it doesnt change much for bigger gangsfor reference medium turrets track by default around 400 better also before qr a blaster pilot that did know what he did could force the target into a situation where he did track 2000 betterby playing a bit with range forcing the target to turn his mwd on than now if the 400 improvement over nowweb wasnt sufficient to get the job done quick
im not implying that at all are you too lazy to scroll up and read or is your comprehension really just that low
i suppose ccp should have seen this coming back when they changed the way af resists are listed too many people are just too lacking in intelligence to realize they dont know everything and that there may have been changes to the game before they ever started playing that they arent aware ofeditdont know why i bothered to reply twice youre probably the same guy typical noir
i still support another bonus thoughitd make my wolf even sweeterjust want to see people get their facts straight
checkbox
facepalm simple on the face of itlets do the timewarp againthere has to be a nerdy coding catch somewhere but we should be giving ccp enough money to hire the princes of nerdom to code this in somehowit would seem that anyone who is inside a system when it enters this timewarp mode would have to be tagged in some way tagged players cannot just jump in and out of the timewarp due to some wierdss spatial distortion effects on your clone or somethingthe tag is a timerrunning on time warp speed as it adjusts on the fly that makes a pilot wait before being able to reenterin addition i think that the system and every connecting system would have to be included in the timewarp to keep gate games to a minimum rattersplexersminers would just have to dealit seems to me that once a system enters the timewarp every pilot in that system becomes a copy that only exists as long as the system is in that state or until that clone dies or logs reintegration with all other aspects of the toonaccount would take place after one of the trigger eventsthis keeps skillpointsresearchingetc still churning along with no coding changes needed the battle copy is trapped in the timewarpit is like the system is cloned into its own sisilike spacetime so the rest of eve can access it is some ways but it does not affect eve
the idea though clever and certainly unique is selfdefeatingno matter how you achieve the slowdown in system increased cycletimes distorted  expanded time et cetera you invite more and more people to enter the battle because deaths would be slower the battle would last longer remember the rest of the eveworld is chugging along at normal speeds more time to batphone friends reship when destroyed whatevernew parties would be jumping onto the field like never before currently if you cant race to a system in time you get to drool over kms missed but under this proposal you have plentyotime and with each new entry  reentry that distorted time becomes worse and worse allowing for entire alliances to call up their bteams to get to the fray from further and further distances and their friends and so on and so onwhile the system wouldnt crash like it does now you would have fleets of ships just looking at each other perhaps making rude gestures out the window and doing little else for those of you who have been on the test server imagine move requests en masse on tranquility so you can go to work kiss the gf  wife develop oldage to get out of the battlepoints for a clever idea but imo  counterproductive
very interesting indeedsupportedslade
this would be the end result if and only if the node being used to conduct the battle on was an amstrad or sinclaire spectrum i hate it when people exadurate their points to the absolute extreme its ridiculous and completely unnecisary firstly this measure is to counter lag and only lag its not a full proof way of having 2000 player battles on any single server bladethe idea is to keep gameplay remotely playable between a mass of players converging and overwhelming a server and ccp reinforcing the node to allow full speed gameplay
in addition to everything above drone synthesis projector really needs a fix either more bandwidth to make it a proper drone system or another turret slot to make it a splitweapon systemsupported
dramiels are completely imbalanced in multiple roles and as a frigate pilot a few years now its sad to see them destroy the otherwise balanced frigate class now after rocket changes thx ccp ill quote my post from shc where we discussed this these are well thought out changes as from someone who both fly and fight dramielsneeded changes 1020 speed nerf get it below 800ms when webbed and using faction ab grid nerf so fitting t2 extender largest guns with only a micro core is impossible 150s are ok remove one drone bandwidth remove falloff bonus its too powerful to have both a tracking and falloff bonus and combined with its drones it means you can hardly beat it even if you could somehow kite it see hookbills make it fit arties if it wants to kite railrocket boats cut lock range to that of a taranis they shouldnt be fleet tacklersi was teaching my pvp class yesterday and kept thinking how well balanced most of the frigate bracket is now except for dramiels which are so stupidly op i dont even know what ccp was thinkingthe other big problem with drams is the price in combination with how good they are 70 mil means the only fights you will get with one is gotry abshield boost faction fits that wont engage anything threatening eg pretty much nothing and people will have backup to bail them out every time there are no casual duels with drams but because they absolutely have no disadvantage good dps best speed good ehp good agility good range good tracking people feel forced to fly them and this has ruined frigate pvp and created dramiels onlinesome have suggested removing a midslot which i disagree with because it will make it too generic and close to useless for soloing
i want my solo pvp environment back most places are a ghost town except for dramiels
what would the falloff bonus be replaced bysupporting anyway
long overdue
does it need another bonus i dont think so if you wanted to do it you could nerf the speed then give it 5 speed per level of minmatar frig until it was the same with the suggested 20 speed reduction you could also give it an optimal bonus instead to boost its small niche role as a kiting artillery ship optimal bonus wont change much for ac fit its just that falloff  tracking is too good combined and leaves no weakness to exploit
because dramiel
i would rather have the speed of the rest of the frigates increased to be closer to that of the dram
supported dramiels are the bane of faction war complexesminor sites were supposed to be run by destroyers and frigates perfect for the entry level tasks in militia fleets pirates and enemies camp this locations with dramiels and once they are in you are never out
im not sure thats necessary but i dont have strong opinions about it however you would still need to change the other stats i suggested to balance things speed is just one of the things unbalancing the dramiel
sounds good
did you try to fit a plate and web on a dramielhow about slicermake all frigs go inty speeds with af dpsehp or none exceptions like slicer and dramiel and speed difference between af and faction crap are silly
i second the ops opinion
not quite sure what you mean i guess its just a troll or do you mean that you want all ships to be the same or are you saying that slicers are too fast they are not they are slower than crusaders
yo
dramiel dual prop  scram  web  plate did you try that that directly refers to your suggested changes because i find your proposal too narrowed against certain specific fit rather than ship as a wholeslicer is indeed slower than sader but still way too fast for range ehp and dps it can project speed needs to come with dps drawback this was balanced prenano as you had to fill your lows with speed mods at the expense of damage because of stacking penalty and speed nerf this no longer works so you have ships like dramiel slicer or cynabal that get this speed without any penalty  they are fast have tank and deal good dpsif you want to have gtfo boats sure but dont expect to kill much with them  balance
yes
uhyeah
fast ships dealing high dps still fit in i think ehp is what is meant to be affected high dps and pretty fast with low ehp makes sense reducing dps makes you stick around for much longer which isnt necessary
no they dont and never did also neither dramiel slicer or cynabal have low ehp
so i take it genos is finally tired of the angel fotm not sure if all those changes are needed it is enough to gimp the fittings to a point where dualproptank becomes a practical impossibility ie dp or tank but not both
im against any more speed nerfsif anything other ship classes need a speed boost speed should play important role in combat  it is one of the few factors that depends on player skill more than character skill having a speed advantage should be very importantthe only nerf i support for dramiel is reduction of drone baydramiel should remain the most powerful faction frigate but it should cost more double the cost of bpcs and the price will justify its effectivenessdont make eve more boring by cutting the elite out of small scale pvp
couldnt have put it better myselfalso not supporting because op thread title is talking about balance for all frigates and then he singles one in particular out in his posti am a firm believer that if something is deemed to be out of balance balance should be sought by buffing alternatives rather than nerfing the thing thats goodtheres been far too much nerfing over recent years and i really dont like itlately things seem to have gotten better  for example this time last year amarr was clearly the way to go for fleet pvp engagement  since then minmatar gunnery has been buffed and all of a sudden with no nerfing required there is a genuinely valuable viable alternativefantastic
supported
you will get elite back if dramiel gets nerfed as myriads of shipfitting combos become viable again and people can more freely go about outsmarting each otherand yes i along many others in genos did exploit the living crap out of dual prop drams after the faction ship boost but thats what you get for being an early adopter tbh and i personally proved their invincibility a myth maybe 60 times but the fact remains that these days the frigate game is just dramiels online which makes it boring for us all i support the op wholeheartedly  id personally emphasize the changes to lock range speed etc to get tackling ceptors their jobs back as well as nerfing the falloff bonus to deny the ac dram the ability to both get under guns and kite in scram range with the same fit and ammo also for general 1v1 balance the dpsehp ratio does indeed need some toning down
the thing is frigates are balanced quite nicely right now except for the dram i dont necessarily disagree on an overall frigate boost balance shake but thats a thing that is a lot of work to do for ccp otoh putting the dram in place would be quite trivial for them and it is really making the frigate game much worse for a good while now
this already works right now you can kill a dramiel using something other than a dramiel a quick review of killboards would show that to be true there are even cases when a dramiel gets killed by frigates of other typeelite pvp is all about overcoming challenges if i get a 100 mediocre choices where every choice is just as good as the other then theres hardly any challenge you just pick whatever and go with it knowing whatever the enemy got isnt gonna be any better in that situation the number of people in fleet becomes more important than what each individual fliesthe blob hates anything elite the blob wants uniformitywhen i successfully kill a dramiel i feel much better about my accomplishment than i do killing any other frig i dont want to lose that feeling of accomplishmentthe only thing that bothers me is that dramiel doesnt cost enough it should hurt more to lose
well i dont know what exactly you did to prove their invincibility a myth unless you died a lot in them which merely goes to reinforce ephemerons point that fast ships require good piloting skills rather than high spas for the frigate game currently being dramiels online  i do agree but this can be balanced by buffing the others and thereby offering viable alternatives to a flying a dramiel and b killing a dramiel with something other than another dramiel  why make a good thing shtty when you can make many shtty things good
wut some other frigate can kill a dramiel thats outrageous
lets drop the elite moniker now ok its making the thread silly and its not elite in the slightest to fly a dramiel these days
dramiel and factionpirate ships are something like legendary gear so in fact yes it is elite pvp in wow thoughsadly in eve very soonalready too
why do you feel the need to drop the elite moniker when were talking specifically about a 100m frig compared to other 300k frigsyou might not like it but surely its reasonable to expect something special for that kind of outlay why not bring other faction frigs into the arena currently occupied by the dram rather than making the dram itself an outandout liability
how does price matter
this or boost nondramiel frigates xd
you could boost all other frigs but then you are looking at changing 20 ships instead of one pretty much all other frigates are balanced with each other right nowand yes dramiels die vs other frigates but it requires the dram pilot to be  or the other ship to be a complete bait fit that cant do anything but beat drams daredevils can sort of do it reliably but they are very limited for all other forms of combat so it makes up for them being very strong for this particular scenario they also cost a lot more than a dram to fit properly and die very easy to anything big
because the other pirate frigates do not have the same op status as the dramiel due to inheriting all the ails of their ancestry especially destructible dps and cap relianceall the frigsdestroyers are actually pretty well balanced with numerous possible noncrippling counters available except for that one eyesore
just make dram bpc cost 150 milproblem solved
you are hopeless
nope many drams roll 150200 mil shipfit already so its not a deterrent the players are not getting any poorer
the blanket minmatar boost was unnecessary and foolish resulting only in the problem being shifted from lasers to hybrids it was a classic example of power creep and exemplifies why a myopic fear of nerfing is fundamentally bad nerfing is just as good as boosting
supportindefinitely agree that the dramiel needs a nerf podcats ideas seem to be the most solid so far
just nerf the dramielkeep wormdaredevil as is
they would be if the prices went upand if dram pilots feel comfortable fitting expensive faction gear  isnt that a good incentive to kill them personally im always eager to try kill a dramiel as it may drop faction abmwd faction web or faction disruptorscrambler its the only frigate thats actually exciting to go afteri have no problem with people using overpowered ship if they pay enough money for it and if i can destroy and loot themwould people still outfit their dram with 200 mil in loot if the dram was no better than any other frig probably not so muchi know its easy to fly a dramiel but on the other hand it is hard to kill a dramiel the challenge of killing it is what makes it so fun
another whining thread full of tears stupid ideas and talk that makes sense its just funny that some peeps will benefit from this and others wont theres no one change to game that ever benefits all apart from small patches and  jumpbridges make life in 00 easy i must admitexperienced but im sure there are a fkn ton of peeps here that this change wont affect in any god damn way and they are supporting or either against it the internets for u
while i appreciate you trolling this thread simply hasnt seen enough of it eh eh the facts havent been debunked thats what makes them facts thats why youve opted for trolling rather than even attempting to respond to the facts namely that coalitions even large ones can still fall despite jb networks invasions can be launched without the use of jb networks jb networks can fail to prevent or significantly slow down invasions jb networks do not actually allow coalitions to fight wars on two fronts jb networks do not allow perfect safety for those who use them as its trivially easy to camp them jb networks can be removed the same as any other pos module or the pos itself and so onon the other hand youre simply pointing to the fact that there are bridges and grrr that makes you angry thats not an argument let alone a rebuttal and your claim that youre fighting fire with fire is some pretty obvious dishonesty
another day another episode of finnagains glorious battle against the trolls who make him sad cause they disagree with his opinio i mean factsarguing with finnagain is like arguing with a rock give him facts maps of bridge networks and logic and hell reply troll and give you easily debunked opinions and pointless metaphors with nothing to do with the situation at hand i still lol at ccp devs painting with crayonsif you go back on the thread you can see him cry over and over again in posts full of dishonesty and hypocrisy i would say dont feed the troll simply ignore him there is obviously no reasoning with him as this thread has shown and his debating skills are akin to a 5 year olds protip calling those who disagree with you trolls does wonders for your argument and credibilityon subjectjump bridges do not work as intended as stated by ccp and must go they provide force projection that leads to a stagnant blobfest that is more secure than high sec particularly in ncs superfriend carebearlandthey die and nothing of value is lost plus you get tasty finnatrolls tears
oh yeah why introducing some drawbacks and interesting mechanics to make jump bridge network more complex mechanics and tricky to usebetter to nerf them better to remove themi guess ccp cant be bothered with creative thinking these daysi am missing ccp as innovative developer that used to take on game design challenges but i guess what goes up must go down at some point
yes you are trolling some more i provided a whole list of facts about how jbs actually work you cant rebut them so you troll i understand if youve got nothing in the way of facts logic or a rebuttal it must seem really tempting to just troll troll and then troll some more as for your other bits of trollingmaps of jb networks are the kind of content free nonargument that people use to disguise the fact that they have no actual position the reality of what those jbs enable is fact and gainsays the fearmongering the mere fact that a map is used or the number of jumps saved is presented its advocates hope to scare people with fiction but how jbs actually work and influence coaltions blobs combat and wars proves that the fearmongering is fictional there is no logic thats being used to rebut anything thats why youre reduced to trolling if you had logic to counter the factual and logical chains ive set up you would you havent because you cant your total lack of understanding as to why examples have been used is not in fact a failure on my part each time i demonstrated the utter failure that were your attempts at logic you tried to claim that analogies were changing the subject youre still demonstrating your utter lack of comprehension some people trolled me by claiming that if i was saying that jb have no effect at all on gameplay not true as i never said it anyways that i should support removing them i pointed out that other changes that would have no effect at all on gampelay like replacing ship models with crayon drawing done by five year olds would be bad and could still be opposed ive pointed this out many times to you so your pretendfailure to understand is not an actual inability to comprehend a concept as simple as analogy its just more trolling rather obvious trolling at thatmuch like you pretend that dont understand what an analogy is you also quite clearly have no idea what hypocrisy is or just pretend not to so you can troll as for dishonesty all people have to do is look at an example like you describing analogies as changing the subject or your lies about me crying to know that youre trolling much like how your trolling has been proven based on the facts and youre pretending that its merely the that youre disagreeing this is a lie ccp have never said anywhere that bridges are not functioning as intended in fact they are working exactly as intended you are blue to the alliance that sets them up you have a password you can use them exactly as they were designed but your argument is a troll so you need to pretend that not only are they not working as intended but that ccp said so also a lie facts show that despite extensive jb networks defenders can lose their space attackers can successfully invade space without using jbs and defeat defending coalitions with jbs and jbs do not allow coalitions to fight on two fronts but your argument is a troll so you need to make stuff up about how jbs function then again youre also posting on an obvious alttroll account with no combat experience and cant state your personal experience with or knowledge of how jbs actually work in the context of campaigns post with your main already the reason youre using an alt to troll is pretty obvious
i would just like everyone to recognize the fact that there never was a proposal the op simply made a statement a copy and paste from the meeting minutes so this thread is not for or against any changes to jump bridges this thread just turned into a heated debateif anything this thread should be locked or moved to features and ideas discussion maybe even jita speaker corner
from the minutes yor argument here is just comedy goldif this was a fact the there wouldnt ever been any change in the political landscape of eve since jb was introducedtalk about taking it to the extreme jb networks makes it easier for alliances to do landgrab on space they really dont needuse it also makes it easier for people to compile into a blobif someone is thinking about showing up for a gangfleet theres alot bigger chance of him actually showing up if he can travel through 34 jumpbridges under pos defence compared to go through 15 normal jumps and risk getting ganked by a small roaming gang that is if he is travelling alonei have used jb networks i know what it cant and can do it makes travelling ridiculously easy a hostile gang is nothing but a nuisance unless the gang is big enough to actually start shooting pos structuresmods or attacking station services an alliance can simply ignore itgang is camping a jb hard to get rid of cloakers simply set up a new jb reconfigure the route and take the jb they have set up on out of service until they moveit as simple as looking at the jb going from m0 to d7zac ontop of that there is another jb going via another system that ends up in the system right next to d7zac its like people are afraid of moving through normal gatesbut i understand that you are afraid of loosing your safety net
even if that was true removing jump bridges would not change anything about space size or blobs because blobbing efficiency as tactics would remain unaffectedonly difference would be that moving around 00 becomes more or less tedious and frustratingit is same fallacious train of thought like if 00 space will be utilized and there will be more free systems people will come and grab it it did not workfor obvious reasons and now there is a seek for a new scape goat to put a blame on00 will be always about large power blocks there is nothing you can do about it as it is unrelated to game mechanics accept it and start your thoughts from there
protip finn just because you like calling your opinion facts it doesnt make it so and just because you say you proved something you did notlike when you risibly contended that jbs were fine because they only saved x minutes when both those minutes are significant and the areas you can avoid are also sobut you have proved repeatedly there is no reasoning with you so by the way when a ccp dev says something isnt working as intended then it probably isnt but hey what do they know changing anything stops the game from being a sandbox rightyou are so lolnot true the time it takes to get somewhere and to project force is very important in normal play most people wont move 20 jumps to defend space they dont use jbs can turn this into significantly smaller journeys they also enable a blob to form faster and move around better if you have ever experienced the jb train it is easy to see the difference it makes in getting somewhere and in covering vast amounts of systemsatm there is no downside to have enormous powerblocks projecting over mostly empty space because projecting their force can be done with ease if you take a look the only ones speaking against bridge removal are those with a huge vested interest and agenda like finn and some goonsother than that there is a consensus for their removal which shows just how much of a failed concept they are
if all people are lazy to move 20 jumps as you say there is no need to defend anything because there are no attackers that would move 20 jumpspeople will move as much as there targets they can find simple as that only difference will be that they will need more time to find targetsthe territory you control has nothing to do with force projection it is purely depending on force you wield if my fleet is 2k ships i will beat other 500 ships regardless how far they are again the only difference will be travel timeargumentum ad populum facepalm
blah blah blah its only huge alliances that can really benefit from this stuff if you dont have a force large enough to deal some damage in the short amount of time why bother going to suicide in the first place the blob will still land whether you like it or not as its just a matter of minsso much attention on something that doesnt matter smmhh
do you really think that people are going to read that quote and honestly think that in it ccp and not just one guy who wasnt serving as ccps spokesman on the issue anyways said that jump bridges are not working as intended that they werent supposed to be used by blues with passwords to jump places or that theres an exploit involvedor will they realize that those who claim that ccp said theyre not working as intended are lying that bridges are working exactly as intended but that one dev said he doesnt like the ramifications of jbs working exactly as was intended faced with the fact that jbs dont prevent change arent required for invasions dont guarantee defensive success and dont necessarily allow coalitions to fight on two fronts you claim that those cant be facts or else there wouldnt have been change in the nullsec political landscape talk about comedy gold youre actually using the fact that jbs dont prevent change in nullsec and arguing that that proves that jbs do prevent change in nullsec yeah you have no idea what the difference is between and opinion and a fact just like you dont understand what an analogy is or what hypocrisy is or at least you pretend not to in order to troll post with your main post with your main not an alt troll and identify what you actually know about eve the fact that the travel time is not significant has already been pointed out to you as has the fact that you can camp jump bridges and you can incapdestroy them too youd know that if you played the game yeah no dev ever said that and youre lying in order to troll yeah nobody ever said that and youre lying in order to troll post with your main not an alt troll the facts show youre making stuff up as you go along pilots generally do not have the energy for marathon massive battles and then zipping around to go get into yet another marathon massive battles coalitions can and do deploy to front lines without jbs coalitions ability to project force can still be overwhelmed by a superior force while theyre on the defensive even if they have a labyrinthine jb network post with your mainyou are trolling with an alt with no combat experiencepost with your maintinfoil hat trollingin case you would like to stop lying and trolling for a bit the fact is that i generally enjoy small gang pvp in and around curse where not only does the nc have no jbs our enemies do and getting to doril requires about 30 jumps through empire to get ships there as a forward staging area but its easier to make  up about a vested interest and sling ad hominem tinfoil trolling i guessthe bandwagon fallacy is not called a fallacy because its a really excellent argument youre also full of it this thread has what 40something people supporting the removal of jbs yeah a massive consensus
this much is evident as is that you dont even live to your own fallacious appeal to authority yardstick of he with the most pvp experience on his posting toon is obviously right as proven a few pages ago how goes it oh yeah quit trolling and basically you posting every other post to say that you think jump bridges should stay so basically a landslide trying to be contained by your opinion heavy factually light trollingthe facts of the matter areccp asked if csm would oppose removing bridgescsm does not the democratically elected representative before csmjump briges are massive and save significant amounts of time and territoryits not realistic practical or feasible to engage in bridge interceptions or their disabling as the strawman has been put forth as has been repeatedly debunked by a setting up another is trivial and b there are redundant routes and intel channels that make those options an excercise in futility at bestand last but perhaps most significant the only real opposition to removing bridges comes from a single person with no arguments beyond fallacies and weasel allegoriespersonally i think your glenn beck im standing for the rights and freedom of capsuleers act was the best yet no replacement for you know an argument but one would be too much to expect from youand yeah most people seem to have read that quote and honestly think that in it ccp said that jump bridges are not working as intended and that he wished to make logistics harder and perhaps remove them to which the csm didnt object your lack of basic reading comprehension is expected but appalling
beams especially large beams use an absurd amount of cap its like tanking on its own rails need moar dps though
hey i support my proposal by the way

ccpsince you took it upon yourself to edit my character without my permission this seems like a pretty good place to put your brain to work redhint i wanted my fracking eyes closed morons
you can actually do this  i found out by accident and it may take a frustrating few goes for you to replicate it if you still have another go left on the character creatoryou may notice that when youre creating the character it blinks every now and then  after a bit of messing about with the pose i took a few photos  one of them had its eyes closed as by pure chance the instant of the photo had been during a blinknot an option you can select very hit n miss but it can be doneoh and supported btw
i think this topic is silly as the devs are inevitably going to add options regardless of whether or not you guys say you want them but it certainly couldnt hurt i guess shrugs
not sure its so much a question of adding options as requesting the retention of functionality available in the old supposedly inferior character creator that was better in the ways that matter to people
do double clicks really count as two seperate clicks personally i really only consider them one click in terms of clickfestiveness and thus your numbers are a bit inflated imo alot of routing can be done with doubleclick shortcuts and it drastically cuts down on the hassle that and completely changing an entire 5 or 6 planets of production terribly frequently is just poor planning
they should keep the skill book requirement to manufacture the items but yes please remove the decryptorsthis is an easy way to add content to the game by a simple revisit to an unused feature

i see no point removing decryptors some modules are worth more some less it might change any days when thing x changed in patch y most importantly if theyre not worth manufacturing its easy to just not manufacture themi think it would be more important issue to look what other stuff you can only get from static cosmos instead of like exploration whateva

personally pvp in stations is something that should not be done not because it wouldnt be cool but because its a can of worms that will split eve down the middle and create a bigger resource sink than ever beforeso imagine that i can walk around stations and meet people cool ehoh whats this someone has a spoon and wants to cut out my liver before i had a nice cozy insert ship here to protect my squishy innards now i dont have that luxary and since im here in person its essentially pod killing me and i lose my expensive implantsgreat so the risk of being ganked in stations far out weighs any social interaction that i would gain from itok so now i can fight back great so now i want armor  weapons to protect my squishy form now i will need special abilities in combat because lets face it trading blows isnt exactly very thrilling oh whats this its now become evecraftwhy cant i now get out of my shp get a can opener on my foe break into his pod and punch him in the facewhy cant i land on a planet and walk around there toooh crap the game has now become evecraftdust514and through all of that extra content all of the core gameplay is ignored alternativly the wis content is half done and the people who enjoy that stuff moan about not being able to do all the cool stuff they imagineyes eve is harsh and it should be space is a big scary place where there are plenty of places for the bad folks to hide and ram missles up your tail pipea station is different its confined and in many ways controlled would you get a concord like security form in stations probably but if people get podded while in stations the risk wont be worth itpersonally i can see it working like wis is more of a projection where your avatar is either in a matrix like world provided by the station environment so that you never actually leave your pod but you have an avatar that can walk around and no harm can physcially come to you as its a similationeither that or their is some sort of aggression barrier which prevents people from stabbing each other with spoonsif you want to fight then take it outside cus i dont want to clean up your mess p
uh problem is that the op is not going to ever see the bad side of this being an 00 alliance member probably in player owned stations of course someone who can control access to their stations would be in favor of this as no one can get to theirs to gank themthis would devastate it in hisec though
because hisec stations will run under null rules facepalmhysteria aside what makes either of you think that a gank in a hisec station will be any easier than in hisec space no incarna pvp information has been revealed at this point so your speculations in regard to spoon gangs camping your station are nothing more than that speculation well reductio ad absurdum springs to mind also
just the other day while i was in doril or sendaya i thought how awesome it was that i owned them and could control who docked in those stations you are also inventing game mechanics for a feature that hasnt been implemented yet how do you know that it wouldnt be just like ships with shieldarmorbody hit pointsive heard that second life isnt a pvp gamejust saying no pvp is the core gameplay of eve and has been since the beginning
thats actually a really interesting point i suppose itll depend too on how they sort out wis im thinking that names floating over our heads would be cheesy and imersion breaking but its probably what theyll do
supported what fun is walking in stations if i cant shoot the guy id be shooting outsidejita would be great fun with this
doesnt really make sense does itin the definitive scifi simulator youve been brawling with someone for weeks maybe even months or years youve lostkilled billions of isk in assets and collected many frozen corpses but once theyre standing on a stations deck instead of in a pod all of a sudden you cant even poke them in the eye
look some features cant handle pvp disruption theres thematic concerns and theres practical use if its possible to disrupt people to the point of causing them to lose millions of isk or more people will just not use the feature especially when the feature is optional or socialchat and social areas are already vulnerable to griefing i have no doubt well see all the trolls of eve on incarna launch picking up chairs over their heads and looming naked over you disrupting all your conversations giving those same trolls the power to kill random people is going to limit incarna to a very few stations and destroy it as a means of socializationits honestly like the eve population doesnt learn this how many areas or types of content have to remain barren before they do
not in a pvp game nothink about what youre saying seriously then look at suicide ganking hulkageddon factiondeadspaceofficer fit mission runners being targeted lowsec pvp null pvp wormhole pvp you have chat channels if you want to talk to someone without interruption use them
problem as far as i can tell is thisif you die outside your pod youre biomass dead forever
is not the wifi invented
agreed but on couple conditions1 mining any roids in high sec should come with a refining ban in all of that factions space  after all youre stealing their natural resources2 as a thief you should be attacked by all navy and customs patrols as well as station guns3 0 insurance for any loses  after all which insurance company would insure someone going into combat at 20  1 odds or taking industrial ships into dangerous pirate infested asteroid belts4 a realistic income and vat tax 10  50 range on all production and trade after all those station managers and gate operators have to make a living somehowafter all we dont want to ruin the 4 main empires and make them go out of business because of all the carebear free riders

hi everyonebefore im accused of having an interested in this i do i am part of the 2 alliances in the game that use the ore lp store i believe there is 1 alliance that uses the mordus lp store and im not entirely sure about thukker the point is the risk for doing these missions is high and the reward should be good in terms of lp the reward is fineyou get a good amount per missionthe problem comes with the general uselessness of the items you can purchase ore has the most spectacular example having a collection of modules that while expensive have such low demand that it is very hard to actually sell the modules once you get them for a strip miner i vs an ore strip miner the only difference is the 15000 v 17000 meter range that is it for the vast vast majority of miners this is more or less useless the only people who buy these modules are botters and this is shown by the abysmally small demandeven if there was a very small yieldcycle timeeven fittings bonus the demand would be reasonably high imagine if the only advantage to a domination gyrostabilizer was a slight cpu reduction same goes for harvest implants just to buy the set is a multihundredmillion investment and you max out at about a 33 range bonus this is also more or less uselessmordus lp store seems to have some of the same problems but at least the modules there have a very slight advantage over their t2 counterparts the jammers have 01 more strength and 5 less cpu the mordus implants are also of questionable use comparative to price as for thukker i have heard from those who mission for them that many of their rewards save nomad implants are falling into disfavor since the introduction of navy mapcsrepublic fleet shield extendersetcfor syndicate you can purchase some anchorable bubbles with a small bonusthis isnt a huge issue for those who dont live there but please add a little more flavor and some actual incentives to go out into npc 00 vs highsecproposaloreall mining modules should have 10 reduced cycle time this allows the same implementation for ice and ore harvestersadd ore salvagerscodebreakerstractor beamsanalyzersharvest set should have an equivalent yield bonus youre paying 4 billion for it after allmordusjammers should have 10 strengthcenturion should also boost strengthideasthukkerhave republic fleet shield extenders have extra hp thukker should have a teeny tiny sig radius increasenomads are probably finethukker nanofibers with a huge agility bonus but a smaller speed bonus they are the maneuverable nomads after allthukker istabs with a very small sig penalty and more agilitysyndicateadd syndicate boosters with tiny side effectssyndicate warp disruptors not sure on what the factional flavor should be here flesh it out as a criminal organization
while i dont support your particular boosts i do support the idea of boosting these things seeing as how ccp is likely to ignore what either of us say ill save some time and simply click yesliang
worth supporting even if i would like a more extensive rebalance of the lp stores both between empire factions and the different minor factions
how do you think i could improve them
comments ensure that there are sufficient stationsagents to make the lp rewards actually available in game and not totally monopolized introduce hg and lg versions of the implants at standard costs after all nomads are expensive because of the cost of the lp offer not the profit on the lp itself centurions  all ewar strength harvest  yield amount add faction ships with appropriate bonuses for instance adding mordus griffinblackbirdscorpion role 50 ecm range caldari ship 40 ecm strengthlvl 5 resistslvl would be pretty swellreally just flesh out the lp stores in a sensible way the same as they should do for the pirate factionsliang
not being able to sortie from a pos using a shieldtanked ship in anything like a timely manner sucks supported
supported silly to have to wait a few mins before you can join your pvp fleet due to shields recharging
agreed 
about armour damage afaik it is not  but absolute hp of damage in the past it was possible to have negative amounts of armour hp after leaving a fleet if you had received 100 damage while you had an armour boost bonusi have read that the negative hp issue has been fixed somehow but never got around to test it the problem is that when you store a ship it lose all the skill based bonuses even those originated by modules as almost all tanking modules require some skill to use when you reboard it the bonuses are recalculatedwhen it is done in a station you rarely have problems something it happens i have had ships leaving a station with less than full shieldwith the pos someone has taken some short cut and the new values arent fully applied wile i agree that it would be an advantage for shield users i think that the easier solution to implement would be to fix the shortcut that was used in pos and lets the ship undock at maximum shields a possible fix for now have you tried boosting your shieldsi know pvp ships rarely mount shield boosterswhen you undock from a station at less than full shields boosting them fix the problem giving you maximum shields i am not sure if rr work the same way
this isnt true for the armor amount kinda unfair that it occurs for shields between this gang bonuses and implants it is clear that ccp hates shields
can do nothing but agree
i as a member of the hull tanking elitists fully endorse this product andor service we have been oppressed for far too long it needs to changei call on ccp to remedy this injustice within 18 months or fear the wraith of my resignation
as ceo of the hull tanking elitists i too support the concept of improving hull tanking as a viable form of ship defense it is rediculous that for as many years as this game has existed and been alive that ccp has not been called to allow those of us that wish to hull tank to do so in a viable mannernow is the time for us to demand these changes this is the generation that must demand ccps compliance with our wishes lest they ignore other vital parts of eve as well ccp must learn that we are the players and being the players we hold a significant share of the way this game will continue to evolve we are ccps customers and as all good buisnesses know the customer knows besti personally have posted before while not directly on hull tanking it is very related my proposal falls directly in line with yours and if i may be so bold i would suggest that hull repair modules be moved to be fit to the high slot so that they would remain balanced in the face of their improvementsother instances of forumgoers discussing this concept along with highlighting the need for changedoes anyone hull tankwhy use hull repairers
i support viable hull tanking
yeah the piddle rep a lhr2 does is pretty sad especially when you consider it is 11 caphp ratio compared to 13 for armor roughly and 12 for shields roughly add to that the silly cycle time and yeah needs to be made functional or just removed as it is pretty much a waste as is
such a great if perhaps unoriginal idea deserves more support
hii like to share this idea because i think that this could add a lot of content and mechanichs to the eve universethe actual state of the game consist of travel gate by gate from your position to your destiny this make feel like im in a room instead the deep space pirates just have to wait in the gates to catch you and create a lot of lag due the acumulation of people in some gatesthe idea is to have two different ways of travel thorught the eve universeone classic stargatesfast just warp to the gate and jumpdangerous lot of piratesgankssecond a new one openspaceslower two or more warps needed and one or more capacitor rechargesituationyou have a valuable cargo an want to travel somewhere but you are in a dangerous zone you know that surelly will be pirates at the gates you are alone no help and you like to take a detour leave the road and go space thorught to avoid problems at cost of more time need to travelhow it workshere a simple sheme
yeah ill explain why i dont like the ideaits garbageseriously theres so much wrong with it theres no real point in going into any detailyou basicly just suggest adding empty solar systems and using them as jumpgates
so you cant see new mechanics giving the chance of avoiding stargates
i didnt say that we already have jump drives after alli just think that eve doesnt really need more empty spaceadding a slower alternative to jumpgates could be done and make sense but how to do it welli dont know
part of the function of gates is to create a bottleneck otherwise you would never come across anyone
travelling using openspace could be about 10 times slower than using gates two warps  one capacitor recharge its safer but its balanced with the time you need to do it im sure that people will use both ways pending on the need
arguably openspace would be even more dangerous than using gates for one pirates could just sit in it and run regular scans when a ship warps in they could be on it in seconds and the new arrival would have no means of escape until its cap recharged moreover this wouldnt so much remove the room effect as it would just create more rooms rooms where there are windows instead of doors
thats a point but an opensapce could be realy big maybe 8 times bigger than a standard system harder to scan i think that the chance of being catched must be balanced with this maybe the area to scan is so big that you need some lucky to find soemone maybe is smaller and your chances increase anyway if you want to catch people easily wait in a stargate the openspace sorrounding 10 systems are high sec sourrounding high sec are low sec openspace and sorrounding low sec are null sec openspace is true that this still looks like rooms but it is because this is the less agressive way to make changes in the game engine and make you warp from a system to another in a factible way im not talking about remake the game system just add new content i like eve as a sci fi game in the deeps of the far space stargates are great but i cantt gtfo from these closed systems with people and civilization i like to eve to bring me some day a way to feel the freedom of being no where in space and exploreplacing these empty and huge areas is a way to travel without being desintegrated by a stargate or a pirate camp the warp is the connection and lower sec areas sorrounding systems adds a new layer to the enviorement
i wonder how ccp keeps up with all this whining
my ideakeep the two lowestgrade officers as belt rats but move the highend officers to extremely rare ungated miniplex escalations that are granted after completing highend anomalies this would allow for far more stable and easier coordination for their killingthat being said i do support a decrease in officer stats not anywhere near a full reversion which will make them difficult or unmanageable for a common beltratting bot but not require capital or overlyspecialized intervention to kill the fact of the matter is that this was snuck in under our noses with no chance to explore or examine the changes before they were made live that alone warrants a reexamination of their statssupported with reservations
400b and youre saying your iskh is bad
there is the fact that there are way more players wanting to participate in incursions that end up sitting around waiting to get into fleettoo many lo sec incursions that are ignored completely because of low sec population count and the fact that low sec players and corps might be busy defending their spacetoo few hi sec incursions vs the number of players that want to be involved and the time zone effect vs when ppl can actually play what about 2 incursion time lines with continuous overlapping spawns that enable players with different time zones and limited daily play time to participate
as it stands with the current 10k m3 cha space on carriers its very difficult to carry even a single alternate capital module in addition to other neededdesired items while retaining the extra 4000m3 needed as a placeholder space to swap out a currentlyfitted mod since im sure its out of the question to suggest shrinking cap mods to 23000m3 my solution is to add another 2000m3 onto the existing 10000m3 cha sizethis would enable 4k for a hodgepodge of extra fuel noncapital refit parts and miscellany while allowing storage room for one reserve capital mod plus that allimportant 4000m3 empty space needed to hold the unequipped mod
supporting my proposal
stop moaning and deal with it
troll rejected
carriers both kinds need to be nerfed to force them to have to rely on tendercompanion ships  not the other way around ccp are not likely to change cynojump mechanics in any significant way too many whiners so gimping capitals when alone would do nicely to slow them down as it werewhile they were relatively rare a selfsufficiency argument might have been valid but now that they cost the same as 23 fitted tier3 bs and are available in bulk off the rack that loses all meaning
supported in all caps
you should have stopped posting as well
why dont you guys try to fix npc 00 space like syndicate instead that region of space is completely dead if you want to hunt pirates then hunt pirates nothing is stopping you and you have a huge advantage with gate guns on your side if anything concord should somehow reward you for killing pirate ships with sec status gain for killing a pirate 5 or below
more whiners here also 00 has the best rats but going there to rat is prolly suicide id rather join an 00 alliance than die to huge blobs just because of a couple mil of iskies gathering your corpmates to run incursions with you is already hard enoughi support this though itd be nice if low sec systems had tons of npc ships with insta locking frigs at gates
the problem with lowsec specifically is that being pinned in place for five minutes fighting a tough rat opens you up to anyone who enters the system as an easy pvp target a group of three tough rats and youll be so tired of mashing dscan youll go back to hisecid think some would be okay but a global increase would drive me out for surenot everyone can gank a battleship so fast and lowsec is very appealing to lowsp people for ratting
banning of bot accounts for long periods will be abused especially if you have to report one ccp cant employ investigating bots and make it work its using too much man power on something that isnt worth it the man power can be used for better stuff just remove plex and lets see guys rage
if you dont want to buy some cans theyre rather cheap to help yourself organize your hangar too freakn bad for you your proposal is basically asking ccp to employ a gamewide change in order to give you what is essentially a free station can which you dont want to buy yourself for some strange reason serious lol buy a can lol

i support this product and or service
look everyone another guy claiming that hes going to go be an amateur game developer even though ccp has expressly stated thats not what the csm does let me know how that works out for you
i support this product and or service
i have say one advantage of resolving longterm cloaking which i rarely see stated is that some of the bots in null would be able to be hunted more easily they often cloak up when a hostile enters system and theres no station to dock up init wont prevent nonprobable ships but thats a different problem
i actually like the idea of intermittent patrols into low sec by the faction police most especially in systems where there have been a lot of ship kills response might not be fast but it should be heavy no scramming which is not to say an opportunistic pilot or two couldnt jump through with them and snag a ganker or three letting the police do the heavy workit could also potentially allow transports to get some cover heading into low the most important point should be the jump directly out of hi sec make the bottlenecks equally as dangerous for the pirate at least intermittently spice it up for all concerned get more players into low and everyone winsawesome to see a kiwi go for the csm good luck
ok i am going to clarify here a bit i am not against afk cloaking as such i am against being able to camp a system while not at the computer people complain that botters make money while not being at the keyboard afk cloaking has similar impacts in that it prevents people and in some cases botters from earning money for no real riskwhat i would really like to see is some method for sovereign alliances to deal with cloaked ships in their space i would also like to see more of a penalty for putting a cloak on a ship that is not designed for it  but this is a personal issue and is not high on my list of must do items for the csmas for the situation where you are called from the pc i think a better system would be to allow a ship to powerdown once the agression timers are clear and to basically go dark rather than have a module for dealing with those situation of course after powering down you will need time to power up you systems when you return  but again person idea here and not directly related to the afk cloaking issuemy belief is that eve is a game all about risk and reward but afk cloaking breaks that riskreward pattern
well this would be a very big handicap for solosmall gang pilots while it doesnt affect the bigger gangs also it would make even fair fightsthe rare good ones very likely to get one sided quickwell you could just set up a science pos in low seclots of free moons factory slots are a no issue in low sec well the idea itself sounds noble however in general most people underrate the effort that it takes to hunt down individuals a lotkill rights against 5 and below players are worthless you can engage them anywhere also kill rights against people in low sec are not very valuable since you can shoot them anywayyou save the sec hit and 15 minutes gcc thats it the only thing left are kill rights vs people that only from time to time pop into low sec and do her regular stuff in high sec however if this players are clever they are hard to hunt down and this is mostly done by personal desire to do so not really for real gains somebody that buys kill rights however doesnt have this desire he is in for the gain you could similar to this simply hire a merc corp they pay the dec against his corp and hunt him down the key here is that this is to expensive for most people so they think a bounty hunter will do it for less even if he is pretty much in the same boat regarding the effort to do so
jonathon silenceexplicitly and literally by what mechanic or process do you intend to get your pet topics pushed through to ccp when it has been expressly stated by ccp ever since the advent of the csm that the csm does not exist to be amateur game developers
actually that is rather easy for my pet topics i will write them up clearly and post them in the csm sections of the forums and try to get support then if enough support is gathered work with the csm to make sure ccp understand the reasoning behind the request in other words the way it s supposed to work i admitt that i might personally work on the other members of the csm to get more support but no rule breaking 
as i said i am not 100 sure any of these will work completely all i know is that lowsec is the poor neglected middle child and needs some love and supportas for the labs in lowsec that is fine for any lab work that has no material requirement and no output because it is owned by a coporation that i am not a member of i cannot put stuff into the pos for the lab to use to complete the work nor can i collect any outputs returning the original blueprint is not an output but copies or invention prints arei would like to make small changes first like getting some mechanism for real public science and industry and see how that changes things and then look at the next stepi guess what i am saying here is that i want to get a commitment from ccp to iterate over lowsec and give it some attention to make it more attractive
the gisteve is at risk of losing itself as it stands right now the tutorial should recommend purchasing a second account to tag along and to me thats a bad thing eve shouldnt be reserved for those with hundreds of players on call so i want to help balance the scales i see doing such things as helping restore dignity to the once proud command ships and adding some much needed balls to the fat and ineffective assault and ewar frigates i will do my best to show players and devs that there is more than one solution than bring a friend mechanic and balance changes are in order be it simple things like armor rigs reworking of riskreward or the more delicate tweaking of eccm there is work to be done before the influx of funny hats and my five years of eve experience in fleet sov small and solo warfare will work in your favour its time ccp took a look at the little guys its time pvp was less about the number of players and more about players ability vote prom4csmwwwpromsragecomabout myselfin eve i only have one character that i have used since i started playing the game in 2006the character is prometheus exenthal of genos occidere and through him ive made 13 well received arguably influential pvp videos including the frigank series and honourable samurai my skill set started largely as piloting frigates for all races but has since grown to anything up to the command ships as well as gallente  caldari battleships i try not to discriminate since all the races have something to offeras for myself my name is adrian mugnieco from ontario canada im 23 ive studied 3d game design  animation as well as web design  programming so im very familiar with the game development pipeline and short timeframes outside of eve im all over the place i enjoy 3d modeling snowboarding and am very much into motorsport or anything fast for that matterwhy im runningover the years ive done just about everything from my starting out as an empiredwelling mission runner to a pawn in 00 sov warfare to my current and most enjoyable position as single thorn in every fleets side i feel its time i try to give back to the eve community in a more direct fashionall of these experiences put me in a unique position i have a wealth of game knowledge a solid understanding of how the game is working and im routinely helping people with their fittings and theories plus im constantly making new videos so i can show people my vision of what is possible with some determination no lifelines and a little creativity also iski love eve eve is the only game that ive played for numerous years and never really stopped the social concepts the people the ships the vision of what eve can and will eventually become all of this keeps me herewhy youd vote for mefor starters its because you want to get eve out of its bloated downward spiral everybody should know that adding new features while ignoring the broken old ones is not how you make progress cracks in the foundation need to be fixed before any substantial building beginsive played with just about every aspect of the game from generic foot soldier in sov warfare to pos control in wormholes running guerilla tactics to standing ground until the bitter end ive got a good grasp on what is and what isnt working when it comes to pvp the current mechanicsall of this results in the understanding of individual ships and their behaviour how they perform on a micro level how their weapons work what will hit what will miss how to adjust accordingly all with no room for error as any bittervet will tell you its not something that can be taught
pvp and youmany of you probably know what i do im a solo pilot i fly on my own and i fly without links and scouts its my firm belief that fights neednt solely be 100v100 as that is simply one aspect of the eve dynamic people will argue that eve is an mmo and as such im supposed to fly with many players to that i say i do im just the enemy and i fly against now solo isnt just some little niche thing that nobody tries some players would jump at the chance to solo if the opportunity arose and many have tried and failed via the vertical difficulty however it isnt simply black and white as in between the large and alone there are the small scale players groups anywhere from 510 players going about the universe and generally gumming up the works for the big alliances theyre people who have an overall goal and use their individual piloting ability to assist the group theyre the people who will gain much more than the standard solo pilotchanging for the futureship balancingim starting with the ships classes as they are the foundation of the game poorly designed ships result in poorly designed choices when it comes to offense and defens there is obviously more to it than this but i feel that is beyond the scope of this writeupcommand ships have long been a staple of fleet warfare but since the additions of the tech three ships people dont see the need to train longer for a less powerful ship because of this i feel that the entire class should be looked over most of the fleet command ships can do with some more damage and overall something as simple as significantly higher agility or sensor strength would be a welcome addition in the same vein tier one faction cruisers need a bit of love it isnt because they are terrible ships but largely because they dont really line up with the tier one faction battleships being quite good they arent meant to be unstoppable just worthy of their money and time investedassault and ewar frigates are arguably the two most useless classes in the game at the moment ewar frigates are plagued with being incredibly easy to kill with support ships and painfully useless when fit to counter such things they can be extremely effective but statistics show that pilots would rather pay the extra isk for a much more versatile and survivable recon cruiser assault ships have a different problem in that they are supposed to hit hard and tank hard they dont do either very well anymore since ccp decided to boost the faction line of ships i have done a couple of writeups on the subject on both eveo and other forums and i feel there are a couple of reasonable solutionssimilarly destroyer hulls have long been imbalanced there isnt much to say about them other than that they are very much skewed in the favour of one race which shall not be namedmechanical balancethis is has potential to be a pretty broad topic but there are only a few aspects i want to bring up since they will have the largest impactfirst ewar changes for caldari  gallente dampeners need a tweak be it through ship bonuses or module attributes ecm changes need to be tweaked and i feel that racial jammers should only work on their intended race in addition to that slight sensor strength increases across the board for everything except recons and capitalssecondly weapons need to be looked at little more faction fofs should be added back into the game i cant see why they were removed to begin with its possible that they were broken in the past but there is no reason for them to be omitted now also medium and large blasters need to have their damage and tracking increased in order to actually compete with the current mechanics blaster ships are designed to be brawlers yet are not any more powerful to accommodate this fact
mechanical balance contalso ships that rely on armor tanking be it active or passive suffer greatly from the penalties armor rigs add they make slow ships slower and in many cases make it very difficult to maintain range or tackle the armor penalty is not balanced when compared to shield tanking which hampers a ships performance in no waylastly is the risk versus reward aspect of pvp as it stands right now there is absolutely no reason not to fly in a large gang no reason not to camp a gate and just wait pilots dont truly pvp for profit anymore and instead just do it to maintain space or prowess this does not scale well for the little people not associated with owning space or stroking egos the risk is far too great and the payout is far too small there is very little ambition left in the battlefield and the easy way out is just as profitablethe benefitsideally these slight changes will help reduce player dependence on having more numbers to be successful eve doesnt need to be a game that consists only of large fleet battles but recent gameplay changes have put the balance largely in that direction sure some changes may drastically change the way you play but i wager that they will be for the players best interest additionally im hoping that these ideas will help change the developer mindset when it comes to future adjustments and expansions ccp has created a great game with eve and id like to see it evolve into an even better battleground long after this csm term has endedprom4csmwwwpromsragecom

prometheus exenthalexplicitly and literally could you please walk me through the means by whichin other words by what exact mechanics or specific processesyou intend to get your pet topics pushed through to ccp bear in mind that it has been expressly stated by ccp ever since the advent of the csm that the csm does not exist to serve as a group of amateur game developers i am genuinely curious how you intend to bypass the stated position of ccpthat doing things is not what the csm is forso that you can deliver on your promise to do things or get things done
i am not claiming to have the beall endall of ideasi would simply like to direct their attention to the mess they are leaving behind before all attention is on incarnai am not interested in talking politics with ccp i dont have the patience for it and that doesnt help anybodyim not looking to make changes on future content without fixing the old and rotting foundationi am running because i know pvp and i know it better than any other space politician trying to stir the pot with words
i will probably cast one of my votes for you if you can convince me through a post on this forum that you are capable of arguing convincing debating and otherwise politicking on caliber with the mittani as you may or may not know he is a successful attorney when he is not flying a sabre and as such one would suppose that he has a fairly good command of both the english language and the rhetoric intrinsic with getting groups to accomplish goals these seem to me to be necessary things for a csm candidate if one is to be seriously useful to the eve community as without them communication with a solid and unified message does not and cannot occur
it should be expected of every delegate to be taking everything ccp says with extreme skepticismnobody should be willing to roll over simply because a new feature is said to be the most awesome thing eve has ever seeni expect that those who win will leave their rosetinted glasses behind because this isnt supposed to be a picnicmittani doesnt ensure anything more than himself shouting at ccphe promises what every csm member shouldnt have to proclaim because it should be expectedand hes doing all of this without any insight to sharea comparison isnt really necessary as he doesnt need any publicized help getting into the csmif the swarm wants him in it wont be because all of those players care about his vision it will be because its just another thing to stamp their names on and laugh about down the roadfor all anyone knows he could simply show up and be voted in without saying a word to the publichere the power of numbers is obvious and doesnt need to be explained especially when its in regard to a notoriously manipulative player who happens to lead an exceedingly large and arguably obedient playerbase for those who actually want to try and make a change vote in support of the pvp foundation of eve vote prom4csm
serious questionwhat gives you the idea that any of your issues are possible to inject in ccps roadmap considering that the next few dev cycles are already mapped out dont get me wrong man good points but weve all seen how ccp deals with such mattersyou get the party theme promises 18 months what do you have for plan other than a grand idea with detail stuff which ccp doesnt even want to look at read the pc gamer interview lead game designer statements there are very insightful
if the players demand for fixes is significantly larger than that of new hats for their avatars then ccp should obligepersistence is key and voting in players who see the problems with the current state of the game should have an effectthe results arent instantaneous by any means but all it takes is some keys changes to set the events in motionits true ccp will eventually end up doing what they want and they might even ignore the past altogether but having the right team for the job can help deflect some of the bull they will undoubtedly try to peddle as well as help prevent future gameplay and balance blundersi cant guarantee anything nobody can dont let anyone tell you differentccp can become completely disagreeable with the csm on a whim if they so choose no actions past present or future are set in stone
i like what you are saying but i would like to hear more about the team part of your platform what do you think would make up a good team on the csm what kind of people do you want to work with which candidates do you see helping you make the most impact to get your goals on the table and addressed
enough is enough please click this link to vote for the mittanithe mittani for csm6
enough is enough please click this link to vote for the mittaniwhy all the truthtelling when im making a run myself why arent i promising you a tengu or a special hulk that fires disco lasers while it mines when its worked so well for the other csm representatives im the leader of goonswarm i dont have to blow smoke up your ass just to get a trip to iceland i can get on the csm but merely getting there isnt going to be enough i want to deliver a mandate to expose the hypocrisy of the whole process i want to unite the csm into an effective body for advocacy to do this i need more than the goon votes or nc supporti need youyour vote can help me end the lies and change the csm into something useful something that matters for that i need the chairmans spot  i need your help to get therewhat is to be donethe csm does not implement features its a sounding board for ccp ignore everything the other candidates say about their positions on certain features because features are irrelevant at this stage in the game pay attention to the general attitudes of the candidates instead as you will never find out what they said to ccp due to their nondisclosure agreements if i promised you a new feature or a specific game change i would be lying to youlets not waste time with bull if youre the obsessive type who wants to know about how i feel on every aspect of eve you can read my tentonhammer columns im not going to write a 3000word paper about how i feel about any particular issue for the purposes of this election as i cannot make any promises about anything except my general attitude towards the csmi believe that it is time to transform the csm by electing a hardline player representative that will forge the csm into a strong united body that can fight for the playerbase and shield it from idiocy with your help and the chairmans position i can do my best to make that a realitywhat i can offer youthe raw ugly truth no pretty illusions no false promisesevery candidate is going to tell you that they want to bring your ideas to ccp i want to bring ccp to our ideaswe play their game we pay their upkeep we use their features and we suffer from their shortsightedness for this they give us one resource the csm and they treat it like a mere focus group not a stakeholder to be respected on the csm ill do what i can to make it better but im not going to promise you the moon and the stars because i cant deliver on thatwhat i can deliver is me being a ruthless manipulative bastard and you need that if you want to see the csm become a real advocate for the playerbase one that cannot be dismissed by ccp thus far the csm has never been united it has been a cacophony of individuals mostly deluded by the false notion that their election has given them a designers position bleating out their personal fixes and being surprised when the devs ignore them a divided csm isnt an effective advocate for the playerbaseif the csm doesnt band together to oppose ccp when they suggest ed things the interests of the playerbase get steamrolled obvious preventable imbalances get implemented you need someone who knows how to build a coalition how to make people want to work together how to make members feel like their voice and their opinion makes the collective union stronger i have brought together a coalition of people who normally cant agree on the color of an orange and directed them in a war that most players can only dream of if i can bring these people together i can do the same for the csm as its chairenough is enough please click this link to vote for the mittani

got my vote
regardless of your ingame politics and your feelings about goonswarm or whatever a vote for mittani is a vote for the continuing success of 00 space
myyyyyyyyyyyy ceomyyyyyyyyyyyy csm
send your regards to the mittani today
cannot rep this enough
mittani is a lawyer irl btw and knows his stuff just ask him aout his puppysabrehow he bought his house with cash
i expected more words
if you want to understand how the mittani thinks feel free to read his regular articles on ten ton hammer i think they give you a good view of how he thinks
you have my vote when the voting is posted
i will go out of my way and make a serious goon post please read what he is saying and dont focus on the alliancecorp i know even the most hated enemies agree on most of the points that he is writing so please vote with your brain and not because of a free tengu
if anyone can make the csm actually effective in any way its the mittani
posting in another goons scammed me thread
i believe in mittani dent
the word enemies can refer to several different groups in this context while it is true that people who are identified as enemies via the ingame standings mechanic can probably agree on the principles that are being espoused here those enemies all represent the same overarching group of 00 space dwellers those guys are often seen as enemies to the people who live in empire space because there is a perception among empiredwellers that mechanics put into place that involve 00 space in a good or indifferent way will somehow result in a negative backlash for them you can see this in the propositions to remove jump bridges and to penalize 00 space holding entities these suggestions come from people who believe for better or worse that mechanics which benefit 00 space dwellers are a direct detriment to the fun and opportunities available to empiredwellers this case of the havenots wanting to take things away from the haves in regards to 00 space will be a major obstacle to overcome in winning the hearts of many players
the entire csm process is full of liars but i dont have to insult your intelligence just to get a votei hope that my campaign can at least expose some of the ridiculous hypocrisy of this process and the streams of frothing excrement being vomited forth in the other threads in this forum
we need more pseudo intelligence duchebags on csmvote for comfy mittens
i wish the mittani was the ceo of my space corporation swoon
you have my vote mittani
as a csm 6 candidate i can only speak for myselfive promised nothing ive worked with ccp before i know what types of obstacles may exist to be overcomemy platform has been of integrity a commitment to maintain open communication between ccp csm and players and make sure that at the very least the concerns of new eden are heardim not lying to you
you said you would call after that special night we shared and you havent
the mittani would make a great addition to csm hes logical fair and realisticyou have my vote unless i forget to vote
liar
liar or just dumb
im not trusting a guy who needs to tell me he isnt lying to me colbert
cripes jump bridges do appear on overviews rocdear god
good luck mittens youve inspired me to actually vote this time good to see someone who gets it
this guy just inadvertently served as a perfect example of how people who dont hold 00 space have no idea what theyre talking about in regards to it apparently both he and his entire alliance believes incorrect information about this topic if not a single person in his entire alliance knew or could be bothered to google up the right information about this topic then how clueless might he be concerning a breadth of other topics
i like the idea of a no bs csmi also like cheetos dipped in peanut butter so there you go
looking forward to seeing you in iceland mittens 3
i unironically support this candidate
owned by his own quote edit i approve of the mittanis message for dictator of the csm teamoh god this is such a horrible idea that he definitely needs to be kicked out
youre already secured of the chair
my ceo just reading some of the other threads here its painfully obvious that highsec players are utterly clueless about what goes on in nullsec and that ignorance has resulted in them making some seriously stupid requests a vote for mittani and a vote for vile rat are a vote for intelligence
voter with 3 accounts checking in vovps call out some idiot whos running on a bs platform and publicly humiliate him please kthanx
that literally happened just a few posts before yours
oh dear
you have my sword
what you think i read threads before i post in them
and my axe
the idea that anyone in eve bar goons would trust someone who lauds himself as a liar in every aspect of his life is laughable
please tell me morei do not understand
the idea that anyone in eve bar goons or other groups of people who come here from some other community would trust anyone else in eve is laughable
the only thing politicians and good talkers are good for is to get the best part of the cake everything else is a pure scam theyre wortheless but we must put some clowns over there to entretain us
while there is one and a half years between the posts i was quite amused at seeing a distinct switch in your stance on sun tzu and similar theory of war on ten ton hammerin this post about the delve war you say sun tzu wasnt writing about a drugaddled icelanders idea of an internet spaceship game then later in this post about the cluster invasion of fountain you essentially embody the principles of sun tzus philosophiespersonally i agree with the latter stance and also funnily enough agree with most of your stance here csm is about being the voice of the players but this is already the mandate of the csm as stated here the purpose of the csm is to represent society interests to ccpim also standing for csm on this basis and having dev experience outside of ccp i will make the ideal player representative because i can speak the devs language
hello there although we have never met ingame i had the pleasure of following a part of what you did your campaign message brings up the interesting question of the real power of the csm and what we can hope to dolets be optimistic  we all know about the scandals the resignations some talented csm 5 members not willing to continue we can only go as far as ccp allows us to but the recent improvements made to eve and the work of several dev teams makes me think that our voices can be heard this is going in the right direction im looking forward to steer this boat in the good direction with you
youre far too naive and earnest for the job my moneys on the lawyerspymasteri like your recipes though
sun tzu is a recurring injoke  sun tzu the art of war
youre electing a political representative if you send a saint to do a bastards job youre not going to get anything accomplished
your sig is broken
thank you for your support i have no problem whatsoever being held accountable i encourage it in facti am indeed ignoring npcs corps that could logically own sov such as soe ore and the like im also not looking at syndicate great wildlands or like regions with this those regions are populated by npc corps not pirates im only interested in the pirate factions those should be pushed to lowsec in particular i love syndicate just how it is be shocked there are indeed people that focus on 00 pirate missionrunning but i think it should be pushed back into lowsec not 00 as i said its just not logical if i live in delve i have both the option of shooting blood raiders and because of easily controlled access the ability to do blood raiders missions that doesnt make any sense to me with these very lucrative pirate agents and their lp items moved to lowsec thats one possible way to improve the lowsec experienceyep youre completely right i misspoke i meant pirate npc space should be shrunk a bit in 00 again syndicate outer ring and great wildlands would be unaffected delve and pure blind would also be unaffected i think the size of the pirateheld areas in these regions are about right im thinking of regions like venal curse and stain which are totally ruled by the pirate factions there the pirate sov in these regions should be shrunk to open more of that 00 to player conquest
ripard tegexplicitly and literally can you walk me through the means by whichin other words by what exact mechanic or specific processyou intend to get your pet topics pushed through to ccp bear in mind that it has been expressly stated by ccp ever since the advent of the csm that the csm does not exist to serve as amateur game developers i am genuinely curious how you intend to bypass the stated position of ccp so that you can deliver on your promise to do things or get things done
im not answering for him but your this statment is the same for all candidates including yoursif ccp doesnt cares about a single point like they do since 2years now for hybrids you can call youself rip or claudia sheiffer they will just do nothing
actually this brings up a relevant point about candidates and their positions while i am happy to inflict my opinions on anyone foolish enough to ask for them i dont think it is the role of a csm to attempt to get ccp to implement a particular pet feature or tweak in a particular wayso its perfectly ok for me as a csm to say something like game design changes are needed to address lag in the longterm and even here is an example of how that might be done that illustrates the problem but not if i am elected i will get ccp to fix lag in this particular wayas the csm has evolved its become more of a forum for challenging ccp to justify their resource allocations in its role as a stakeholder and also its proposed solutions to particular problems in its role as a focus groupthis is not to say that csm candidates shouldnt be encouraged to present their proposed solutions to particular problems but they should be viewed by the electorate as a way of gauging the way the candidate thinks and what resource allocations they think are the highest priority
youve got my vote
i do not understand your point hereshowing ccp how much time they wasted isnt going to help anything you noted yourself that the game development is rather driven by marketing and technical milestones thus wasting or not wasting their development time is not really their interest as long as new shiny is pulled out basically you are pointing finger at something they consider a low importance
i appreciate that games development is a team effort but there have been instances where you nailed your colours very publicly to the mast  im thinking specifically of the supercarrier buff and the nozh vs abathur episode between dominion 10 and dominion 11dominion 10 supercarriers were hilariously underpowered but many people im one of them feel that the current version has pushed a little too far in the opposite direction see this thread if the topic of supercarrier balance comes up are you really the best person to be impartially debating the argument or do you risk even if just subconsciously allowing your previous position to get in the waysome kind of live balance team to continually examine issues along these lines and push out tweaks and fixes would be much appreciated the current stat of play where ccp give the players a year or more of complaining and crosstraining to the current fotm and wait for a space in the next biannual patch to drop the nerfhammer satisfies nobody
in a perfect world id like to see it completely eliminated i worry that ccp may be taking an all or nothing approach when it would seem to be more effective and efficient to follow a phased plan but i do not know exactly what ccp is doing or planningwith regard to this specific issue so uninformed speculation isnt really productivethis really depends on what ccp has to say on the issue when asked about it it is certainly a topic that will persist on my agenda until they provide satisfactory answers and evidence of taking action to eliminate the plague of bots in the game personally i would like to see them have a team devoted to this issue as i feel botting does more to unbalance game play than almost anything else in eve its a problem that has to be approached with a realistic assessment of how willing people are to take the easy way out especially when punitive responses from ccp are laughably light how determined they are to to do so and how sophisticated and pervasive the software is its unclear whether ccp is being realistic with themselves about the problem but its pretty hard for them to claim ignorance given the information collected by players and provided to ccp over the years especially in the last few monthsall too well aware yes if you are familiar with the series of articles published by e24 i was one of the people poking manfred to well say something about it see if anyone else speaks up as well ive initiated conversations with several players in the past months about this issue and its also something i get asked about constantly i plan to put a lot of effort into keeping the issue on the table and making sure ccp addresses iti think this is inevitable because ccp is a business and they want to make money there are certainly a lot of things in eve that have the potential to be developed as mt items i am completely opposed to mt allowing you to pay for anything that you can currently achieve through normal game play though for example you shouldnt be allowed to go out and buy a tobias warp disruptor for  i have no issues with mt for vanity items or things which do not directly affect game play if someone wants to pay 150 for a pair of minmatarskin boots thats up to them againstthis falls into the same area as my mt answer  if its a vanity thing and not an actual game play item thats up to you to decide
seleeneexplicitly and literally can you walk me through the means by whichin other words by what mechanic or processyou intend to get your pet topics pushed through to ccp bear in mind that it has been expressly stated by ccp ever since the advent of the csm that the csm does not exist to serve as amateur game developers i am genuinely curious how you intend to bypass the stated position of ccp so that you can deliver on your promise to do stuff
those would both be iterations of current game play
well first of all i dont have any pet topics except to support that which involves iteration of current game play over the introduction of new features that is my main priority so im not going to lie to you and say im going there to do stuff if elected its up to me to be part of the elected council that presents a united front that provides incontrovertible evidence from players to support csm positions on different matters and encourages ccp to do what is best for the game im going to work with the other csm members using everything i know about eve and my time at ccp to give the csm every advantage possible as we work together to move things forward
whether or not wis should have pvp
i am exactly the right person especially on that issue because i was there and know exactly what happened and why i understand the ridiculous communication breakdowns that prevented proper iteration from taking place and as a member of csm6 i can share that knowledge with the other council members in order to try to break the gridlock that said believing that old ideas are still the right ones is shortsighted it is foolish to be married to ideas based on the way things were csm6 members need to look at all ideas in light of the here and now while taking into consideration contextual references from the past that may still be usefulmy goal is to be one of nine people prepared to impartially debate all matters as best we can with the most information possible laid out on the table i want to be on the csm so that i will be in a position to share knowledge and insight the rest dont have i am not tied down to any particular notion of how something is supposed to be in eve regardless of if i was on the game design team that worked on it or not that is why my main platform centers on iteration a live team is something ive wanted to see for years and it looks like this might finally be happening there is currently a team team bff that seems to be focused on just this i want to see this kind of thing continue
no need for me to rephrase again what had been said by quite a few posters  csm members or former members so far you have a truly unique position and point of view that can make you an invaluable asset to the csmmy vote will go to me ofc but i hope to see you there
vileratforcsmorgfrenchrussian translations available on sitegreetings friends it is time to discuss the future of the game we are all guilty of playing eveonlinei have sat patiently hoping that things would change on their own that csms of the past would press to have the core issues addressed but all ive seen are minor changes around the margins the state of things are not good and those who follow the political game can clearly see that events are leading to a conclusion instead of a continuation of the sandbox environment weve all enjoyed the dream of one day becoming the new strong power to press your claim to eves overarching story is dying and the notion that every ship counts has become a lost and forgotten phrase when battles occur they are slideshow presentations between massive power blocs and frankly your contribution does not matter at all things must change and this change i fear is beyond the ability of those 00 stakeholders in power because intended game mechanics make the necessary change an inferior choice if you want to be the strongest the bestso whats wronga great many things from ship balance in the form of whole classes of ships becoming obsolete to the lack of economic scarcity making losses matter little to all involved there are a distinct lack of goals once you take those first feeble steps into the unprotected space of lowsec00 and this makes gameplay stangnant and pointless once my original corp goonfleet made their start in a little pocket of syndicate eventually rising to become a power who could influence events unfortunately this possibility seems out of reach and foreign to those starting today you join with a massive power bloc or you get crushed if you attempt it without and there are few exceptions to this rule what can we do about it i offer you no simple solutions because quite frankly there are none i am not offering you a checklist of impossible implementations that will be shattered in the first meeting with ccp that would be irresponsible nobody running for csm can promise that they will make assault frigates better nor can they promise that they can make mining worthwhile again and if they are they are lying to you i can however promise you a voice in the direction of this game and the knowledge that i understand whats wrong i know the key elements that are causing stagnation and rot that are ruining the game i pledge to keep these issues at the forefront in every meeting and press for real solutions that will break this cycle of decay like many of you i am concerned about massive bloc warfare silencing any other activities and i am concerned about the prevalence of supercapitals which have ruined the importance of any other ship class i am concerned about the broken production system that causes massive bottlenecks in certain moon minerals that break intended income distribution and i am concerned about having other end game goals aside from watching a stop motion broken combat system where you sit back and hope the enemy becomes more frustrated with the mechanics and logs off before you do this isnt how this was supposed to be when we started and this is certainly not what this place can be i promise you nothing but my undivided focus on bringing pressure to fix these core issues and i ask for your vote so that i may be your voice in the csm
current game mechanics allow power blocs megaalliances that control large swathes of spaceprevious changes to sovereignty mechanics only served to accelerate the rise of bloclevel politicsnullsec player behavior has grown in sophistication and has bypassed intended game mechanicsthis clearly wasnt intended and i vow to work with ccp to come up with solutionsthere are no goals for smaller entities in sovereign 00currently there is no goal that a small group can achieve that a larger group cannot achieve more effectivelythere should be goals that a smallersized fleet can achieve in 00 for which larger groups would be less wellsuitedcurrent game mechanics favored far less diverse fleet compositions than in days pastcurrently fleets favor a more homogenized fleet makeup ie drake blob alphafleetfleets should be encouraged to incorporate a wider variety of ships to ensure successlarger ships are increasingly making smaller ships obsolete this is especially true in the divide between subcapitals capitals and supercapitalscapitals and supercapitals should exist to support a subcapital fleet not replace itthere should be measurable disincentives for using topheavy fleet compositionsthere is a distinct lack of balance across racial lineseconomic scarcity is beginning to break down for more wealthy playerseve was designed as a world where taking losses mattersthere is an increasing number of superwealthy pilots who are allbutimmune to lossessome of these pilots are benefiting from previous game mechanics and ccp action that gave them continuing advantages t2 bpo lottery ultrarare ship giveawaysothers benefit from massive disparities in moon mineral pricesothers are benefiting from ostensiblyillegal behavior bottingthere should be a greater focus on drawing isk away from players of all income levelsthere should also be an increased dedication to combating automated isk generationmining is a subpar method of accruing wealth and minerals compared to other methodspvp is the core of the game but its too difficult to find it in reasonable proportionsthe differences between pvp in empire lowsec and nullsec are vastthe risks and rewards of operating in low security space make it far less appealing than either empire or 00 spacefaction warfare has become a largely irrelevant and underdeveloped form of gameplaythere should be a serious effort made to balance risk and reward in low security spacebut more importantly i dont just want the opportunity to bring my own ideas to ccpi want to bring them your ideas on how to improve eve onlinei vow to give all player concerns ideas and criticisms a fair chancemail me with your concerns to bring to ccp
i support this product andor service
i support vile rat
notice vile rat isnt promising you the moon and stars he doesnt claim that hell suddenly become a game designer when elected and magically be able to fix blasters unlike just about everyone else running for csm vile rat isnt lying to you
i support this product andor service
vile rat actually plays eve online vote for him
i unironically love to play eveonline
what makes you qualifiedmotivated to speak out about balancing the game for all players rather than just those in nullsec
best man for the job
please consider honesty over falsehood if you only know goons for griefing think about the fact that we cant grief if eve online has no playerswe do actually play the game too and the csm can only make recommendations like the skill queue which everyone knew in beta needed to be implemented yet it didnt happen till how many csm cycles laterif you honestly think csm can force them to fix blasters which need fixed or fix electronic attack frigates youre kidding yourself only person who can fix this stuff is ccp
actually a very good question as to motivation all aspects of eve play into each other you cant look at 00 as its own entity when what happens in empire directly impacts 00 gameplay and vice versa the economy the learning path everything leads in theory from one to the other and tie in if you arent motivated to make all aspects improve then youre fooling yourself as to qualifications i think our forced relocation to empire has granted us a wonderful recent opportunity to enjoy all it had to offer seriously though i play in empire as well ive spent a great deal of time in 00 and find it fun but the core gameplay issues arent all that different from what youd experience in highsec you rat you mine you run missions you grow corportations and relationships just like in 00 and anybody who thinks that empire means safe hasnt played this game for very long
i assume that you are familiar with the many frustrations expressed by csm5 related to communications bottlenecks and a certain lack of ccp engagement with the csm particularly on incarna i do acknowledge that after the june summit ccp engagement with the csm on nonincarna matters improved markedly what concerns or thoughts do you have regarding bottlenecks like that and possible methods for overcoming them
this would qualify as a hard question with no easy answers ccp will respond as much or as little as they want to i could throw a simple statement about lots of vodka and a sizable amount of lobbying but that would be simplifying it to a great extent going into this all candidates must first realize that were running out of chances to get them to see things from our perspective but let me say it this waythis is going to take a lot of work this is going to take an amazing amount of us doing our homework its going to take a large amount of collaboration between the csm delegates to formulate a solid coherent front that keeps ccp focused on these issues if we cant come together and get our ducks in a row before we even begin dialogue with ccp then our priorities will be scattered and diluted if we cant form that united front then i dont see how were going to be able to have any more impact than in the past so thatll be a key part of what must happen knowing the candidates as i do its no surprise that you have a sizable number of lawyers and even foreign service members going for this all people that know how to convince and make people see things the way they doso no easy answer were going to break the bottleneck because were too damn stubborn and care far too much about the future of this game to let our concerns die
i support vile rat the mittani and a unified csm
i support vile rat and meaningful changes to eve through the csm you have my vote and those i can convince to see the light 
its not so hard really ccp gave csm the tools to do it its called pressure management you achieve that by applying a little bit of clarity on workflow and a healthy bit of accountability how simple but only possible if the csm as a whole does it without falling for social engineering or the party linehave everything transparant and visible to everyone an nda slap does not prevent  as we have seen  from making clear the heart of the matter it only hides the ugly and the detailscommunity with each other and with ccp and the general public on alland do all that consistantlynext time a team incarna runs away because csm is evil or a lead game designer runs for the hills for new shiny and complains about customers but also next time a good team in ccp delivers well or engages well that combination provides that pressure managementsince it is all public transparant consistantly kept visible and communicated that can greatly aid both playrs and ccp alike but also very well expose when failure happens and who and why constructively obviously and independant media help as does social networking
this one shows promise
hello new eden im proud to announce here that i will run for csm 6 and hopefully represent you at the csm here is a preview of my campaign message so you can get the general picture about me more quickly as it says please proceed to my campaign website for details i can see there is a lot of interesting and perhaps less interesting  campaign threads starting here some by very well known characters some completely unknown and amongst those faces i see some people i have a feeling i will enjoy working with people who already carry the voices of a part of the community people who are deeply invested in eve it gives me a good feeling about what your vote can make the csm become that said of course i can only suggest you voting for me why voting for me because i care i care for your voices your ideas behind every crappy idea there is a concern that can be refined to something insightful useful to ccpi was carefully following posts from the previous csm particularly those of mynxee and meissa and i know perfectly what im heading into i know the csm isnt a candyland where you ask for stuff and ccp makes it appear before your eyes i know the atmosphere of the previous csms was sometimes a very hard one with some members expressing a string disappointment at ccps choices but no matter what you think ccp cares about the csm and with your help i can make a differencelike most of you i read the mittanis campaign message hes not wrong but a bit pessimistic but rest assured people contrary to what he suggests i will not lie to you i will not fix lag i will not give supercaps to everyone but i will do everything i can to make sure eve which is one of the best games ever get one step closer to perfectionlets make eve our eve the best game of all time of all time 
your website hurts my eyes
demonstrate to me in a post in this thread how you intend to argue convince and debate among your peers and with ccp the points you wish to express better than a successful attorney couldbecause thats your opposition mittens is a lawyer he is kinda smart 3
i like how the two of you are quite busy reviewing all the csm candidates topics the mix of constructive  unrelated replies is also quite cleveri have an habit of not feeding the trolls  which often amounts to not feeding the goons here on eve  but ill humor youactually i dont believe mittens is my opposition hes kinda smart indeed and even if sometimes its hard to tell when hes being serious and not i have no doubts about thatit may be misplaced pride but i like to think im far from stupid myself and sadly youve chosen the wrong question in the limited set of questions youre copypasting on every candidates post the csm is not meant to be a huge fan pushing hot air i strongly hope that no matter how successful an attorney he is the mitanni doesnt plan to bore us to death with unnecessary courtlike arguments i dont want a seat at the csm to argue but to represent my work as a csm representative would not be to brainstorm with my peers as its not the purpose of this organ to decide what will be the next development for the game  something youre very aware of i will listen to the players sort ideas organize them clean them to find the hidden jewel lying under any poorlyexpressed concern and escalate them in the way described in the csm white paperim not there to argue convince and debate about my personal ideas
no seriously dude your website sucks transparent text is bad for the eyes when it constantly readjusts to the changing text i design government websites and i dont deal with any of that bs scroll up and down and youll see my pointedit this is a good example of excellent web design

why am i runningfor a long long time now ccp has seen it fit to improve the quality of life for a lot of people in eve online and i can fully support that choice the problem however is that a lot of the improvements were meant for the pve crowd with little to nothing being done to improve the life of pvpers its time to change that trend and thats why im here eve doesnt need to get any softer it was meant to be a harsh place at timesnow dont get me wrong its not about just that ive got a whole list of topics that need to be looked at theres plenty for everyoneit is to this end that the main focus of my campaign is to simply improve andor update the current game instead of just adding new content without doing anything else for the rest of the gamewho am iingame i am known as arden elenduil member of suddenly ninjas and tears i specialise in highsec warfare piracy ninjaing and all things dastardly enough to make people cry ive been playing the game for almost 2 years now and im reasonably confident to say that ive got quite a bit of experience in just about any aspect of the game pvp however remains my preferred pastimeive gone from carebear to nullsec rookie to god knows what im currently part of the eve online ninja blog pack and am a halfway decent blogger or so id like to believe and ive been called a polite piratei also tend to get involved in some of the weirdest situations imaginable in eveout of game im known as jef keunen im 22 years old and work as a mainframe consultant in belgium im a semiregular globetrotter and tend to get along reasonably well with most people i love discussing topics that catch my interest and have a knack for thinking outside of the boxwhy you should vote for meill be fighting to push through the topics on my campaign list though only if they are properly discussed first outlining the pros and cons of each and every subjectfurthermore i aim to improve the game itself and not just haphazerdly throw in new stuff commit to excellence ccplast but definitely not least is that i listen to the players well over half the issues on my list came from players sometimes friends sometimes people that ive never seen before the csm is a council that represents the players thus as ccp should listen to the advice of the csm the csm should listen to the general opinion of the playersshould you have any questions suggestions or otherwise want to contact me feel free to send me an evemail to this characterfor a complete list subject to change of topics ill be adressing please check my blog

arden elenduilexplicitly and literally can you walk me through the means by whichin other words by what mechanic or processyou intend to get your pet topics pushed through to ccp when it has been expressly stated by ccp ever since the advent of the csm that the csm does not exist to serve as amateur game developers
white tree for csmwwwwhitetreedesignnetwhite tree has been put forward as test alliance please ignores council of stellar management candidate after undergoing a strict preliminary process which was designed to accommodate every individual in tests desire to submit themselves as potential csm candidates from there test conducted a democratic poling process in which white tree was the victoras a result test alliance please ignore has submitted white tree as their chosen council of stellar management candidate for the 2011 council of stellar management electionsas a player white tree has a long history in eve starting his eve career in 2007 and maintaining a linked relationship with the community as well as monitoring the development of the game ever sincea capable and elegant individual white tree is able to tackling problems head on working with others can help to find solutions to the problems of the average and the advanced pod pilotbut we need your helpthe problems that affect the game that we have chosen to address here cross the lines of alliances corporations system security and beyond only by working together can we achieve the goals that will help make eve online a better gameso dont forget to vote for white tree as not only tests csm candidate but also yoursplatforms armor improvementsplayers will naturally begin to separate and throw out systems and tactics which simply do not work in player versus player combat and in todays fast paced smallgang and sovereignty warfare shields dramatically outclass armor on the battlefieldthe reason for this is quite simple the penalties for armor are dramatically more restrictive for the penalties for shields shields offer a signature radius increase in exchange for their increase in effective health or regeneration rate while armor offers a significant penalty to maneuverability and speed in exchange for their benefitsgiven that the gallente faction simultaneously uses the shortest ranged weaponry in the game and fly some of the slowest ships an entire faction of the game is unable to competitively compete in player versus player combatwhite tree proposes a reduction or an alteration in the nature of armor penalties which would allow for greater speed and maneuverability on the playing field hybrid improvementshybrid weaponry more specifically railguns in this instance  have long since fallen out of favour with the playerbase and admittedly out of favour with ccp its time to really push for an examination of the nature of railguns as an effective weapon in player versus player and player versus environment combatboth the caldari and gallente factions make use of hybrid weaponry though to many they appear to be considered a secondary weapon the caldari make use of their missiles as their primary means of offensive might and some might believe that the gallente make use of drones however recent developments in the dominion expansion have made drones not only undesirable on the battlefield but also potentially dangerous given the weight they load onto the serverswhite tree proposes an increase in railgun tracking and a slight increase to their damage to bring them in line with other longrange weaponry and believes the proposed changes to armor will significantly improve the viability of blasters
white tree for president
 skill improvementsskills and training times in eve havent been examined in a long time the most recent alteration was the removal and refunding of learning skills to the playerbase the first step in what could be a line of improvements to the nature of skills and the way they interact with each other in eve onlineimprovements to skill descriptions as well as improvements to the ways in which skills are structured reduction in prerequisites for certain skills and reductions in training time modifiers for other skills that are outdatedwhite tree plans to explore new ideas for the improvement of skills such as potential spendable sp rewards for certain types of missions and other ingame activities in addition to experimenting with new ideas alongside ccp and the csm caldari improvementswhile the drake may have become the backbone of support fleets throughout new eden much of the rest of the caldari player versus player options remain mediocre and unattractive the tengu while a powerful ship has a price barrier which puts it out of reach for the humble pod pilotthe caldari tech 2 line specifically the cruiser tech 2 variants not only lack power but the ability to act as competitive player versus player combat platforms in spite of their apparent advantage to be found in using shields which grants increased manoeuvrability over their armor using counterpartswhite tree aims to improve the tech 2 variants of caldari vessels by increasing their player versus player viability in smallgang and sovereignty warfare improvements to slot layouts bonuses and working in conjunction with proposed railgun improvements will offer the caldari a brighter future in offensive warfare starbase improvementsstarbases have long been a staple and enjoyable component in eve online nothing is greater than being able to set down a structure in a game which can be seen by all and is semipermanenthowever the player owned starbase system could use a dramatic facelift and its dated interface system is potentially confusing to players both young and oldwhite tree proposes the development of a modular system similar to ship fitting layouts which is modified in a fashion also similar to the tech 3 cruiser line this would act to alter both the function and the physical appearance of the starbase in addition to proposing experimental features such as passworded docking clamps for supercapital class vessels which would allow players who own these sorts of ships to leave them in relative safety and get into the down n dirty gameplay they once enjoyed
balancing improvementsbalancing problems continue to plague eve online long after its release and its understandable that a simple change in the mechanics of the game can have dramatic consequences throughout the world of new edenbut its important to understand that while something being slightly overpowered is one thing to have entire factions of ships be dramatically superior or inferior in comparison to another is unacceptablewhite tree intends to propose dramatic improvements to the caldari and gallente player versus player viability and to help polish and buff out the outstanding and almost indomitable strengths of certain faction class warfare vessels some of which have almost entirely invalidated certain classifications of vessels in player versus player combatnew player improvementscurt schilling of soe once called eve online players real men in terms of their gaming prowess and dedication and while the sentiment is flattering most eve online players want to share the incredible and progressive gaming experience with the rest of the world were excited about our game and we cant wait to get everyone involvedbut there are still real barriers that every new player must overcome before they begin to make their way in the wide world of new eden as a member of a corporation that actively attempts to steer its new player in the right direction white tree understands the challenges facing every freshly awoken pod pilot in new edenwhite tree proposes continued improvements to the new player experience in eve online making the learning tutorials not only enjoyable but active and engaging with rewards that keep the player interested showing them in their infancy the side of new eden that older players have come to love this in conjunction with proposed skill changes will come together with the help of ccp and the csm to improve eve online for everyonewhite tree for csmwwwwhitetreedesignnet
curt schilling actually did say that to me at new york comicon last year i support white tree
i support this post
all my 5s good sir lmao xd
hmm i do enjoy trees and whites this candidate looks pretty good
so in a year where ccp has to come up with some sort of link between dust 514  eve where incarna needs to be delivered and iterated upon where the spaceships environment has major issues with several niches already clear to be iterated on and where ccp has a list of polishing things on the side already worked out  you expect any of that to even be theoretically considered by them  in the roadmap they have already done well ahead of these elections  yeah  look be realistic please best possible scenario was already demonstrated for these things collect and filter via crowdsourcing pass to ccp come back in 18 months except for a few short lists of a few detail level tweaks here and there but csm as a whole can and does that thats not a platform btw the new player experience is already clear to be changed for incarna but that is it
i believe that the in game economy is the lens through which ccp should view any proposed change or actionadditionally i believe that the following eleven points need to be implemented small bands of players should be able to afford conquer and hold parts of 00 space industrial command ships should be expanded to include a t2 orca a pos module to allow t3 subsystem changes in space should be implemented a redesign of level 5 missions to focus on group play t2 battleships should be reconfigured to have a better defined role in the game salvage drones should finally be implemented moon minerals specifically technetium need to be rebalanced further action should be taken to combat botting faction warfare should be more lucrative for its participants and the ramifications should have an economic effect on the systems captured the ingame market tools should be overhauled much like the contracts system mining and manufacturing should be significantly more rewarding in low sec space due to its danger also small corporations should be able to claim the resources of low sec systems preparing them to move to 00
if you live in empire you should seriously vote for kalrand because this guy knows what youre into
mike does all sorts of fantastic things he got me a convo with chribba thats still on my bio that i would never have gotten if mike hadnt invited me to helpmymission channel at the right time mike just knows whats going on like thatthen when i was organizing griefergeddon a hulkageddon resistance contest where you win prizes by killing gankers mike gets the hermit hulkageddon winner who we somehow manage to kill every year and me into the same chat channel  and thehermit donates 50m for his own corpse this was subsequently won by a person in local who was doing their own antihulkageddon fleet and didnt know about mine they had to join our contest to get the prize so the number of kills we have have doubled on the spot once all of them posted to our kill board all thanks the the hermits donation which is thanks to mike azariahs chat channel and then the hermit offers to take me along on a drunken roam with them i dont want more kills sitting there permanently corrupting my character sheet but it seemed only good form to accept so chribbaworshiping carebear ends up invited to a drunken roam with the bastards thanks to mike azariah thats the sort of thing that happens on a fairly regular basis with mike around i wonder if theyll be drunk enough to let me fly a smart bomb fitted hulk  i like killing stuff in my hulkas to the burnout issue i can vouch for that that lazy bum will never burn himself out in eve  that was affectionate sarcasm for those of you who are getting ready to click quote on that bit there and trash it

i having to redo this because apparently you cant send your message the way you want to with out people complaining about the font size and how its wrote if you cant read a paragraph with out hurting your eyes than dont bothermemilitary service 8 years in the us armyingrained on ldrshipstrong work ethicsoutspoken i will be addressing issues from every stand point of a change as owning something or using changed or having it used against i will have voice of the people heard with reason and without faulter and get the answers addressed back to the people so all knows what took place00 csm 5 wants to get rid of jump bridges and cripple 00 logistics making fleet movements harder and longer along with other numerous downsides with out measuring the impactslow sec low sector space has been of no interest for a very long time due to the number of pirates and so called anti pirates bounty huntersthat ive grouped into pvpers because even the antipirates fire on any one and every one and pvpers lock down any system of valueempire hulkageddon has been running for 4 seasons now 2 times a year for 2 years their targets have gone from hulks and macks to orcas and now all industrial minded ships with the continued ganking of combat ships in empire with anything of value hulkageddon will expand to all ships in the future for longer periods of time forcing the pilots in empire to log off or stay at stations
put ten kids in a row whisper a story in the ear of the first and let them pass the word at the end of the row you get something like that paragraphyou are positive you get eve yes
this is from the minutes over the topic of jump bridgesthe csm was somewhat divided on how aggressive ccp should be with any nerfing however one csm suggested with respect to the nerfing of jump bridges get rid of themgreyscale anyone disagree with that csm response varied between nope nah and a simple nogreyscale sweet  meaning that option will then not be discarded when the topic of jump bridges will be on ccps tableyes ipod im fairly certain that hulkageddon will continue to expand and that more pilots would either dock up log off maybe even expand to 00 just to rat as there are players that do like the aspects of pvp hence why you have large groups of people that even some pvpers mission all day and when they want to pvp they go into npc 00 a few jumps away to test their pvp ships ive seen some groups do it in angel space where we had to run a gate camp at all times due to the numbers that would come out
you are aware of eve being a cold and dark place yessandbox
do they not teach proper grammar in the military that sentence doesnt even make sense youre an embarrassment hit ler would have a better chance of getting elected to run the red cross than you have of getting elected to the csm
yes im quite aware im just stating itll reach that point and those things will end up happening while i dont mind hulkageddon it does make manufacturing difficult during the time as their not afraid of being concorded and using battleships to take out an orca and freighters the actions cause the market to go up a great amount as before even hulkageddon started prices have already increased on a number of ships across the galaxy
no one wants to hear it lawyer people are trying to have an honest run for the elections and dont need people like you question us word for word
what exactly do you think an election is about then your entire platform is terrible so of course people are going to ask about ityou are telling potential voters to  off if they cannot be bothered to read your illiterate ramblingsthis is a complete generalization and not representative at all of anything csm5 has actually done youve obviously not done your homework at all but ill try one anyway  of the current announced candidates who do you think would be best to work with
that was on the other postingm ive fixed this one so back off and i dont know the other runners as its not posted on the site list as i several surely havent posted
shut up how your leader is a lawyer and the best at everything no one wants to hear it and you all hammer every thread against csm runners stay in your corner of space and fight evoke who is moving through it there are 13 spots for csm so every has their chance their isnt a vote for the president of america where theres only one spot so stay out of it ad allow the candidates post and run in peace
didnt read
let me tell you about our lawyer that leads the goonswarm alliance
and his house he paid for in cashand his puppy
dont forget about his sabre
and his boat
i see great things coming from this thread
we have a leader and hes a laywer wtf
i too am a lawyer alas i have no dog
ok so here i go the names agondray ive been active since 2005 and seen eve change for good and bad ive seen a lot of nerfs and changer come around some which are really needed well ok a lot that arent im running for election now in hopes of making change and im not talking president obama changes either im currently serving military and i know how to push for answers to what the people of eve bring forward ill do my part in addressing ccp with problems brought forward by the pilots of eve after i have looked at the postive and negatives that a change can bring about currently csm 5 is trying to get rid of jump bridges and not addressing the impacts i will be addressing from every stand point of a change as a beiw of someone owning something changed or usingg it right down to being one of the other guys i will make the voice of the people heard with reaon and without faulter and gett the answers being seeked and adressed back to the people so all knows what took place that is my will and promise to the players of the game we call evei am agondray fellow pilot and gamer of eve onlinevote for me and thank you for reading
all done from my droid and what was on the top of my mind im bringing my work ethics and experience to the table going off of ldrship that was ingrained in me my interest lay in the game play csm 5 wants to remove jump bridges and kill the logistics in 00 limiting 00 fleets to their own areas as they wont have the time or will to go after an enemy or attack some one elses area unless its their own neighbors while hulkageddon has been going for 4 seasons now twice a year and the number of targets have increase from macks and hulks to orcas and now every industrial shipi believe it will soon turn to every ship with the ever increasing ganks happening in empire from faction ships to freighters and everything else of any value low sector space has been of no interest for a very long time due to the number of pirates and so called anti pirates bounty huntersthats ive grouped into pvpers because even the antipirates fire on any one and every one and pvpers lock down any system of value i believe that is all for now so stay tuned for more that i come up with
if you cant be bothered to capitalize the title of your forum thread or break your post up into easilyreadable blocks of text then i cant imagine youd be able to muster the effort to argue and debate with ccp and the other csm candidates
i agree i could barely read that without getting my eyes irritated
than dont post in the forum i have no problem reading it and i read many others like it like i said i did it from a phone 2 days on the road go be good goonswarm and go kill evoke thats invading your space as they just moved a freighter through instead of hitting on peoples post on how proper it should be
i agree i just burned the last 90min reading various candidate threads and going to websites a lot of talk about change  fix but no real statements about the future incarna endstatedust514 integrationfuture exapansion ideasetcthe reason i am concerned with these is because the ccp decisionmakers have made it clear that the future is where their concern lies if they expect the csm visit to be nothing but session for player representatives i expect they will attend begrudgingly and spend the time thinking about which kind of puffin they are going to have for lunchyoull end up just talking to a bunch of people like seleene used to be who have no authority and are too afraid to voice their opinions theyll go back to their cell drop their notes in the bottom file drawer and do whatever their boss tells them to doare there any candidates optimistic about the future of eve with ideas for how it will become the complete scifi experienceor is the job of the csm simply to be the whiney y bfgf
im looking forward to incarna in fact i already read their first ideas on incarna we need to get our current problems fixed for sure because every time one thing is fixed another thing gets broken to easily fw does need to be balanced because no ones want to do it for the biggest reason people are afraid of getting they empire area cut in half because of gaining standing its one reason i joined a corp for lvl 5 missions with a whole idea of having a pvp fleet standing by and the missioners doing the missions but the whole corp backed out because they were a gallente mission corp with their low sec and 00 space past amarr empire space btw i am running for this csm and have an open door policy
hi chin csm candidate white tree checkin in wwwwhitetreedesignnet dont think the game was better back in 2003 and dont think we should stop adding things until lag is fixed and every ship is balanced and hell freezes over or whateveri also dont think eve was better back in 2003 for the most part ccps changes to the game have been positive the company grows and learns about itself and its players and it even begins to understand its own product better advancing the development of content but also improving the content of the game is what the csm helps ccp to do and what ill endeavour to do if i get elected are not so much interested in small tweaks and thousands or papercuts but the bigger picture eve is a game where small changes have big consequences each csm candidate tends to pick a handful of areas that they feel directly affect them their alliance or their playertype i personally have tried to look both to the future and to the present with the changes that im addressing worst thing that can happen to this game in my opinion is design by committee and creativity being snuffled out by a mountain of requests i want the csm to function as a conduit for our major concerns and our problems and especially demands for information on our behalf not deliver blueprint copies to the ccp assembly lines for productionluckily for us we have an entire team of creative and thoughtful people working on our behalf at ccp but the csm works to steer ccp in the sort of direction that the players want to go in as well the csm wrestles with ccp but also helps ccp to explore aspects of their own development that they havent even thought about yet ill try to spend as much time as possible listening to the concerns of the players and bringing them to ccp should i get elected are excited about incarna and have ideas on how it should evolve so that it can be awesome and relevant rather then just fluff  will keep us informed about it and pressure ccp on releasing information unlike the current csm  unfortunately the csm does have to sign an nda so they cant tell us everything unfortunately but the csm should act as a conduit of excitement for the playerbase the csm cant really tell you whats going on if theyre not told too but they can help you stay informed and if your concerns are similar to the csms then if theyre excited you should be too and your concerns are my concerns so ill work as hard as i can to make sure your fears are laid to rest want to keep a brisk expansion schedule of at least one major expansion per year if two is untenable i can accept thati dont think anyone on the csm could argue with the idea that ccp continues to provide stunning new content to its players and that ccp continues to develop one of the greatest games ever made i know i dont so like all csm candidates before me and hopefully ahead of me  ill work tirelessly to keep that fire lit in the cold northern rim of iceland want the weaker parts of the eve experience revisited faction warfare guys please but not timidly boldly the problem with those was always lack of sufficient features and being way too scared to rock the boat not allowing fw or pi for example to matter enoughi agree lowsec desperately needs to be worked on and faction warfare is somewhat dated the csm and ccp should always work together to make sure the content stays fresh and no feature gets left behind in fact im fairly sure ccp is working to revisit the ded complex system as we speak but i know id work hard to try and make sure that they didnt let anything or anyone slip through the cracksso in short who wants the total scifi experience i do i love eves backstory as well as its features
i am deeply sorry for posting my own campaign thread a bit late so you couldnt have seen it before creating this topic i could do multiple quotes of your post and reply to every single one but in short id say that i i want the total scifi experience i want to continue dreaming of eve at night because i do that already and i want eve to be made of the same fabric than those dreams something that will stun us in awe
i like the its the end of the world cause it isnt the way i want it routine a lot of people havei admit 00 needs some workbut so does lowsec as for numbers even when us pirates fly about in small gangs someone always comes at us with a fleet of nothing but overkill00 isnt any more special than the rest of the game and its human nature to want to dump more and more numbers into a fightif you make it easier for sov warfarewellgood luck just means it will be ten times easier for your enemies to take all your space itd also give you way less time to regroup to hit them backonly way youd be able to make the ops dream list come true is if you somehow convinced people to not use 100 man fleets firstwhich wont happen although id bow down to you in reverence if you could manage that itd make my piracy a hell of a lot easier
wildly inappropriate approves of this thread
ccp is too hung on their own lore to fix gallente they cant even admit there is a problem if you are training gallente stop seriously
return of the bumpsmoving in rl sucks
great idea supported
remove security gain from every npc in game except for normal lowsec belt rats incursion npcs shouldnt give any gain even if they happen to be killed in a lowsec beltif you do the crime you should also do the time in a suitably unpleasant area which happens to be lowsec no more jump cloning back to your safe 00 home and undo the security hit in a few hours after behaving badly in empirea poll has been started over at fhc to do a quick check where people currently go for doing their sec status repairs
your argument is basically that there should be 1 elite ship that is easy to fly but hard to killthats the dumbest  ive heard in a whileif anything the 4 pirate ships should all be superior in some way but the dramiel basically says fly a dramiel or fit to kill dramiels or diethis is not a challenge its stupid and restrictive
dramiels dont really have a better target selection than other highend frigates they do have this annoying ability to try and see if the other ship is flown by a rookie though and get away if they realize quick enough they got in over their heads thats whats rubbing people the wrong wayin the end if you want fights and kills you are better off with another frigate anyway due to its reputation of being hard to hold down not entirely deserved reputation even as frigate pvp is almost entirely consensual pvp
just curious how you justify existence of supercarriers theres a ship class thats extremely overpowered absolutely ridiculous in my opinion it cant even be solo killedwhy is it ok for supercarriers to exist but not for dramiel probably the cost of supercarrier has something to do with itand yes i really do enjoy fighting hard battles its not all about the blob gank in eve not for everyone at least
stop derailing the thread please this desire to tone down the dram is very relevant from the soloers perspective and would help the soloers a lot to get enjoyment and variety back in to the game it wouldnt hurt the newer players either fwiw it is also from the perspective of people who have hundreds of solo kills in a dramiel and have solo killed lots of dramiels in a variety of ships including lots of lesser frigatestbh try joining the 1 v many underdog roaming crowd if you really like hard battles so much dont undermine our desire for a balanced frigate playground with poor excuses like that also im at your talk about hard battles all i see are loki kronos ganks on your 1st kb page but cheers for tricking packe to engage anyway also you dont seem to fly drams or even other frigates much at all just enjoy the pimper frig killmails so kindly sod off from this thread you will get your killmails regardless if we have a better frigate balance or not
dramiel is fine all other frigs need a speed boost
hahahaha nothe entire t1 frigate range is overshadowed by the rifter electronic warfare frigs are junk assault frigs are junk minmatar excepted and most of the faction frigs are hopeless rocket platforms still suck hybrid platforms still suck light missile platforms still suckthe dramiel is the standout balance issue because it so greatly outclasses every other hull but nerfing the dramiel without examining the rest of the frigate range will reexpose old imbalances although the crying from dramiel bandwagoners about their broken gankmobiles suddenly becoming vulnerable would almost be worth it
not true at all for t1 frigs merlin incursus tristan are all ok rifter might be more flexible but its essentially a situation where each of those will have a fair fight when flown rightseveral of the assault frigs are as good as jaguars ishkurs for example rocket vengeance and hawk are pretty strong now etc but the af class is a bit broken as well due to no mwd sig reduction and the fact that just plain ab doesnt really cut it outside lowsec ewar frigs are junk but raimo and i were more referring to actual brawling pvp frigs in 1v1 situations i wouldnt mind boosting ewar frigs quite a bit mainly on ehp and lock range but lets not derailrockets are pretty good now and a competitive weapon system railguns are still fantastic in frig duels but ok light missiles are pretty limited but its mainly due to scrams and the fact that crows dont do 10kms anymore you can still hunt ab frigs or mwd frigs if you are really good and kill them in your crow if you want also some faction frigs might not be epically good worm and cruor are the ones worst off rest i dont mind at all
errt1 frigs and rifter are balanced slicer hookbill sentinel wolf jaguarselectable damage type on projectiles screws up frigates the most as they do not have slots to plug resists holesi am not saying they are terribly imbalanced for sure not but especially t1 frigates are out of whack
only merlin has somewhat chance to stand against a rifter incursus is a joke and tristan does not have the dpsehp to competeincursus needs to be swapped with tristan as gallente t1 frigate line inconsistent with the game design for t1 frigsapart from obvious fitting ease and dpsehp of the rifter the issue imo is that rifter is simply too fast when compared to other t1 frigates of the same tier
nope tristan wins dps ehp but depending on the situation rifter might have better range control the fact is that both tristan and incursus can be scary boats in the right hands and more fun than rifter especially because of the rifter myth of course all of them die to a mediocre dramiel but all of them have a decent shot at killing a mediocre ranis or even comet but you dont see that many ranises or comets any more because they die to dramiels see where im getting with this
dpsehp might be better on paper but in real rifter pilot would need to be stupid to lose
rail tristan might still win dpsehp and easily kills any kiter rifter also stop derailing the thread
facepalm
rail tristans are strong feel free to fit up a standard rifter and fight me and ill prove you wrong otherwise stop trolling and derailing this thread from discussing my dramiel changes
youd suggest a blaster tristan instead with its mix of longand shortrange weapons
signed
make new character join fw and try killing dramiel with your 100k sp rifter in level 1 mission
assumptions are bad who said supercarriers were fineyou are terrible at this
i would leave falloff bonus but yeah nerf dram plx and give afs 4th bonus ffs
same thing happening in this thread as what was happening in the great nano nerf threads  also 40 pages each1 guy that cant shut up keeps trolling everyone derailing the debatei wish the forum mods regulated assembly hall a little more strictly and forcibly shut up people who are just trolling
actually several folks have been pretty consistently trolling and ive been asking them to stop but well they wont sucks but what can you do about it there were at least a few folks who were willing to discuss the actual facts and logic involved but theyve yielded the floor to the troll brigade a shame
strangely enough whenever someone opposes your view they are a troll whenever they completely disassemble your argument and refute it piece by piece by piece you start slandering their quotes and crying troll even harder while claiming any factual argument they make is simply a strawmanthe lack of intelligent discourse from your side of the table is disconcertingthe entire blob argument aside jumpbridges have made logistics much too easy in 00 i flew with invictus iron and mm about the same time you first logged into eve so pardon me if i feel i have a decent perspective on the issue there is no reason an alliance should be able to easily and instantly restock themselves from empire in a siege like situation there is no reason why a 00 pilot should be able to skip the 25 danger fraught jumps into empire by taking 67 safe jumps through the jump bridge system there is absolutely no reason an alliance should be able to carry out a op in the south one hour and be back home across the galaxy for supperincoming troll strawman
strangely enough you are lying in order to trollpredictably you will also complain about how im going to point out that youre trolling ive disagreed with several people without calling them out for trolling surprise surprise i call people out for trolling when get this they troll yeah youre lying in order to troll againnobody has taken apart my argument most of the trolls havent even addressed it or have lied and pretended its something else you also cant slander a quote so youre just babbling now sixteen posts starting 14 days agozero kills zero lossescharacter created 1 month ago obvious alt troll is obviousclaims about your experience from an alt troll are funnypost with your main if you werent an alt pretending to experience you dont hold youd know that logistics during a siege are neither easy nor instant in fact during max it was not at all uncommon for jb chains to be incapacitated and reinforcement fleets cut off as the jbs were camped and the poss defanged if you actually flew in nullsec youd know that titan bridging and rorqcarrier transport easily sidesteps that objection and carriers were even more heavily buffed for transport before they were nerfed if you actually flew in combat ops youd understand that the difference in jumps is minisculse and even saving 30 jumps which by the way you dont even from the eastern tip of vale all the way to pnqy in fountain fleet can get back home with just an additional 3045 minutes transit time and a fleet large and potent enough to have deployed half way across the map to aid in a conflict is almost definitely able to smash through any gatecamps along the way if it wasnt traveling by jbs in any case youre rafias alt yesyou too seem to have no clue what a strawman is you are trolling though so credit goes to you for obviously trolling on an obvious alt account and then complaining about how someone might point that fact out good play
actually you got a point herehistory repeats indeed  whining idiots and clueless ccp staff most people with common sense could already realize how stupid speed nerf was
bridges would be fine if they didnt allow one to shop in jita from the remotest 00 area imaginable and be home again before a highsec shopper setting out from a high system has even arrived in jita they didnt use fuel harvested almost entirely by automatons who in their right mind ice mines these days they didnt allow unlimited limited only by number of ice bots ships to move freely in a blockaded zone they didnt allow bs and larger ships to go throughetc etcthey are godsends but their detrimental effect on gameplay outweighs the benefits by a huge margin  even more so when spammed as is customarythank goodness that corruption of common sense was trumped with actual common sense and logicqr revitalized pvp like no other patch has ever done we went from bs  all  handful of hacs to almost anything is viable when flown rightif you still think it was bad then you must have made a bloodoath swearing to never fly anything but nanohacs or something silly like that
actually no nano ships arent my cup of tea not my playstyleweb nerf and scram changes were good actual speed reduction was notnanos are coming back i assume it is the same people who whined for speed nerf are the same who fit them now as they finally realized that you cannot blob what you cannot catchexactly the same applies for jump bridges high force projection is definitely good asset of 00 the problem is there are still missing objectives to go after apart from massive blobbing dominion sov changes could make it but failedso now people look for scape goat
so it is not the jump bridges and force projection that is a problem but their implementationi see you make some progress here
nah shell be back to claiming that bridges arent working as intended andor theres an exploit involved whatever exactly the content of her innuendo about bridges not working as intended really means and claiming that ccp said soedit also im still blown away that after so many times being corrected she doesnt understand what a strawman is pointing out that bridges can be disabledtowers can be taken downsov can be stripped from systems entirelybridges can be camped is not a strawman its weird it could only possibly be a strawman if someone said youve claimed that bridges can be disabledtowers can be and they hadnt shes been corrected on this point several times to no effect
finnagainwhat would you think about if the jump bridges could only be used by those who belong to the same alliance that owned the pos it was anchored at
what would be an objective of such change

balance of what
this is my main friend i got rid of my actual main last summer for personal reasons but i couldnt quit eve for long did you really think if i was bullting i would choose invictus and iron of all alliances invictus and ing iron i bet 90 of the people in this thread dont even know what invictus is thats more research that i would ever put into trollingif you want to look up my killboard go for it look for loire nothing to see though im certainly a terrible pvp pilot as much as i showed up and got myself killedunfortunately i dont really want to waste anymore time arguing with you so i will let you take the initiative here without going all glenn beck on me and claiming im a lieing degenerate troll alt tell me why you think jumpbridges are absolutely fine if you have done so in a coherent manner again without the name calling and the trolling above just tell me the post number so i can go read it i certainly wasent reading more than 4 pages of this once the coalition alts started pooring ini would actually enjoy an intelligent discussion with you beyond the snide everyone who disagrees is a troll help me out here
i would like to see jbs removed as well
yes i beleive that the skill requirements should stay that will make them a little more specialised to produce and yes i was hoping that this change could be thought of as low hanging fruit ie be easy to achievein an ideal world you are right the whole of cosmos the agents the complexes the items and modules need a revisit however i am fairly sure that ccp have stated i think its in a csm meeting log  minutes that they are not going to do this what i was hoping for is for a quick fix that will at least improve the useage of these items a number of the cosmos items like the abs and mwds would probably see greater useage if they did not cost so much to manufacture their lower fitting requirement come in handy at times the only reason the are so expensive to produce is down to the decryptors
stupid ideanot supported
brilliant factual rebuttal after all who wants pvp in a pvp game and you finish with the world of warcraft emote go figure
all features in eve are geared towards pvp obviously oh waitif you want a pure pvp game play counter strike or something
water is weti dont know how they do it in wow but you clearly know
thats the point apart from npc corp alts 00ers are shielded by distance and space even granting npc stations they simply wont see the population and griefing potential of any hisec hub or populated system and what way are they going to make it not easy isk penalties are nil because most people have more isk than what they know what to do with sec status doesnt stop hulkageddon timers can be evaded by alt accounts skill training is only a temporary solutioni can tell you right now youd just empower griefers with this and it doesnt have to be station camping it can just be bored people rotating alts through incarna social areas and randomly ganking old players look at incursions ccp had to remove the concordokken aspect of ccs during remote reps just to make them workable thats because giving griefers that kind of power to destroy would over time have made incursions not worthwhile this is a variant of this
if they add nonconsensual pvp to docked in a station including stealing the ships and plundering the hangar of those you killed permanently death out of pods is permanent i want to take advantage of those thousands of marines i havei will turn jita into a grave
yes they are abely everything in eve is geared towards pvp because eve is a pvp game strawmen about pure pvp dont serve much purpose but if you dont want to play a pvp game and would prefer that incarana be second space life welland of course you have nothing to add and no reasoning on your brilliant factual refutation of nuh unh and yes youre using warcraft emotes odd how you picked those up and are now denying even knowing about em
thing is eves pvp is actually the worst thing about it theres no decent objectives or incentives to do it apart from chestbeating and stat padding pvp does not affect the game in any real way its just cyclical petty warfare for the sake of shooting things up you are better off infiltrating an enemy and stealing their stuff if you want to cause them harm than fighting themmost pvp engagements rely heavily on frontloading the encounter and removing skill through numbers exploting gameplay mechancis concord station docking ranges or shipping up a game should never make the optimal response to pvp not engaging in it however thats the best response to way too many engagements in this gamei think this is why a percentage of the playerbase keeps feeling the need to demand changes to force pvp on others maybe a better answer is just to encourage pvp in real space rather than changing every new feature to continue to try and favor the same old same old
you dont even understand what youre saying yourselfyou admitted in the op that eve is about player interaction at its core and thats not an absolutepvp happens to be player interaction but its not the definition of it unless youre seriously disturbed
not supported also one whine thread from the op is certainly enough
this was a bad idea when you first posted it and it still is first looking at it from a realism point of view it makes no sense that weapons could even be smuggled past security scanscheckpoints sure someone sneaking a weapon in and assassinating someone else makes for a good plot in some eve chronicle but thats it if implemented it will not be that idealized world and we will no doubt see throwaway alts ganking everyone in sightalso theres two big differences between ganking in stations and in space first it would be easier to do in stations if it werent it would be completely beyond unrealistic second you would lose your clone in stations and that is a big problem there theres a reason why a large population of players does not travel to low sec and incarna will fail when that carebear population cant even enjoy the new content because of fear of stepping out of their captains quarterseve is a pvp game sure but there room for nonviolent pvp ie the businessindustry side of eve its not like incarna is going to take away the pvp that already exists outside of stations
a thousand times thisalso my main character is not only a godlike pilot able to fly at least a dozen of specialized ships but also have the equivalent of a lifetime of experience in trading manufacturing scientific research planetary management and so onnow capsuleers should also become expert martial artists or veteran space marines how far should we go into marysue territory and why would a capsuleer go anywhere without being escorted by a dozen of easily affordable bodyguardsand why would an npc corporation allow anything to happen inside their stationsin a station youre a guest if you desire violence so badly then go fly outside if stations are merely complement to the established social political and industrial aspect of the game so be it keep your deranged eve is only about combat dogma to yourself
truly its a good thing that theres so much trolling going on that and people repeating the same debunked nonsense shows that theres no honest rebuttal to putting combat in incarna if there was an honest way to argue it some of you would be doing it as for you freaking out because eve is a pvp game and calling that fact dogma while pretending that anybody said that eve is only about combat par for the course ah i was wondering why there werent more trolls here thanks obviously game mechanics are whining theyre also probably out to get you and the csm chairs advice on starting an elevator proposal thread also whining keep up that trolling i see youve read a different op and youre posting something thats hopelessly vague of course any game with more than one player is about their interaction team fortress 2 is also about player interaction it just happens that eve is a pvp game why theres hostility to that fact is anybodys guess in the game with ftl communications and blue water physics in empty space yeah the bull fiction objection has already been dealt with anyways the im making up mechanics for a feature that hasnt been accpeted let alone implemented bull has also been dealt with at least be inventive please yeah the ayieee ccp cant possibly make it so that if youre killed in a station you use your medical clone just as if you were podded bull has also been dealt with yeah the highsec dwellers can already be ganked absolutely everywhere they go anyways and it hasnt stopped them but it will totally stop them in stations bull has yep been dealt with its telling that the only negative responses are trolling and bringing up reflexive objections that have been shown to have no basis at all
just because you have no friends doesnt mean its true for other people
does long and large ing motion in the airthats about all there is to this thread really
like i said its a good thing that all you folks have is trolling and bringing up the same debunked points that have been put to rest again and again and again it shows that theres really no reason not to make sure that eves core content carries over to incarna and it contains pvp
you wont accept any rebuttaland why do you think you deserve any honest rebuttal you keep spouting the same old eve is a pvp game therefore x feature should reflect that mantra and if we dont entirely agree with your absolute vision of the game then we must surely hate pvp how dumb we must ing be to hate so much pvp while playing an exclusively pvp game herp a derpmeanwhile you refer to an eventual nonganking incarna as space barbie or space second life if you want to discuss this seriously you should stop using those childish derogatory terms and show some respect to those who doesnt wish for the same features as you dont complain about trolls if youre trolling yourselfbeside circular reasoning you dont have much to defend your idea of station ganking
haha youre still trying to argue with him
i think its a safe assumption that if implemented it would be easier to die than if we were in a ship im not following you here how is this dealt with already no this is the major problem with your idea theres a difference between losing your ship in a suicide gank and losing your pod im not sure how you didnt get my point here if carebears are too scared to lose their ship to the point that they never even enter low sec then there is no way they are going to leave their captains quarters and risk losing their clone even as a noncarebear i would not leave my captains quarters if there was a chance i could be killed its just not worth it
dont know if anyone has said this already but you could always hire npc or player security to gaurd your hangar or while you walk around the station checking markets and whatever else you guys do but you should force someone to get out of your shippod to look at the market in hangar on a computer instead of sitting in your shipmy writing skills are horrible so if anything seems weird let me know
i dont like this idea your hangar has always been safe space and it should remain so and wis shouldnt be mandatory and a time sink to engage in activities that were quick and easy before that doesnt add anything
itd be nice to have a reset button for the facial expressions on the portrait page quite a few times ive gone to the portrait page and liked the way a character looked then started messing around with trying to make it smile or this or that only to find it looked too plastic and i wanted to revert to the default expression but couldnt
as some of you may have heard there was a devastating earthquake in christchurch new zealand on tuesday the 22nd of february so far 123 have been confirmed killed and 200 are missing and thats just as i write this  the death toll is expected to rise even morewater and power infrastructure has been been disrupted and liquifaction has covered many streets in knee deep sludgeand then theres the property damage there are entire city blocks that will need to be rebuilt from scratch the effects of the earthquakes that have been hitting chch for the last year this was in fact an aftershock were only just being overcome and now this quake has devastated the city the region and the entire nationinspired by the plex for haiti drive i wanted to do something for the people of christchurch can we please set up a fund red cross are collecting to raise money to help christchurch through this disasteredit extending the request to japan too
naturally i support this
initial post was too mean ill save that for the csm discussion instead ill just sayno
supported
what do you think about the ore harvesting modulesmy idea regarding codebreakers salvagers and analyzers after all ore is the faction that makes the noctis
im a fan of salvagers and tractors but not codebreakers and analyzers seems like that might be more up syndicates alleyliang
i would be all over thati would be spending isk left and right on those ads
ive suggested something like this before everyone flamed me oh well i fully support this but it should have limited space and force people to auction for that spot and how long the spots will last based on a rate to get the starting isk price
one of the previous problems with this idea was the devs fear of messing with this particular code  the people who designed it are apparntly long gone from teh ccps and they forgot to leave a manual hopefully these obstacles are no longer relevant otherwise tis a great idea p
this comes up every month can we has ifinally
yes plox d
okay if i understood the dude correctly he wants to be able to travel out of a solar system to a solar system there is a whole ton of problems with thatfirst we already have jump drivessecond if you remember ccp deleted all deepsafes more then 10 au further then the furthest celestialanother problem is the sheer space between solar system if you have infinite capacitor 4 lightyear warp which is probably some of the shortest distances you get between starswould take you an entire day yes 24 hours lastly current architecture ccp uses needs players to swap between servers ie nodes when they jump through gates if you swap servers while the dude is flying he would get disconnectedthis topic comes up every couple months
should incarna be compulsoryfor existing station mechanics tools and servicescompulsory when you dock you must leave your shipand go into the incarna character mode to interact in stationoptional when you dock you can toggle between thecurrent or similar view or from the incarna character modeundecided there is not yet enough information availablefor me to chose either optional or compulsoryplease answer using one of the options given above to make data gathering easier include any comments 2 lines below your choiceedit please note that while the latest devblog is relevant option 2 this post is intended to help me confirm or deny a connection between a characters age and their interest in incarna and why you wouldnt want to use it aswell as to help formulate answers to some new questions on my pilot census in the hope of them being relevant and balanced thanks for your timeserious
there should be tings you have to but the stuff you can do right now should not require entering the station in pension
op l2readdevblog
compulsory
i think it should be optional either that or remove the 30 second time to switch ships because im sure loading the assets like the incarna characters will take a decent amount of time on most computers there are times when you just want to dock switch ships and gtfo and having to always be forced to load your captains quarters migt be a problem
l2readdevblogalso i suspect the option to not load station environments will stayokay its ccp maybe theyll remove that option
the only reason to want optional is to not have to load the possibly graphic intensive environmentthis is stupid upgrade your crap otherwise deal with it all the same options are going to be available to you you just wont be in your ship
optionalwhen i dock im not necessarily leaving my ship
they said theyre taking great care to not increase load times or slow down station interactiontrustmaybe its just me but portraits are now generated faster than the old ones werei wouldnt be surprised if the incarna stations load faster than the current station environmentalso not leaving your ship would hardly change load times and probably wouldnt change station interactionwhile i agree that leaving your ship every time you dock is kinda silly it doesnt really matter
these two things are completely unrelated the portraits load faster because they are now tied to the web based image serverincarna will likely be on separate servers but i highly doubt the load time will be faster
didnt consider that so theyre simply no longer client generatedexplains the speedup i guess
i guess it wont be compulsory according to this
i have read the devblog the purpose of this crowdsource is to see if anyone would care if they were forced to go into character mode and hopefully why regardless of it being announced as being optional im expecting the biggest reply to be hardware related
optionalas someone stated before  l2rdevblog it will be optional
hey all been toying with this idea for a while and it is based on current achievable evetech too so no ifs or buts on implementation here oi apologise in advance if this has been covered but i have searched a lot and only found a couple of off the cuff references to what im proposing on the forums but none in the csm meeting minutes as such and yes for all of you thinking u know what this is going to be its another discussion on hybrids pi completely understand the problems with hybrids and the fact that theyre immensely unpopular due to their performancei also understand the need to differentiate themselves from other weapon systems which from a game dynamic is completely understandablethe issue of optimal range and tracking is a sore one and a well argued one any solution brought about by arguments on it will never give hybrids a new perspective or unique selling point compared to the other weapon systems in eveso my thoughts on a unique selling point to hybrids is bleedthrough obviously there will be obvious opposition to this and i am expecting there to bewhat i am proposing is blasters to be a tailored gallente weapon system designed to work to penetrate shields of caldari vessels and give a tailored core that has a base damage bleedthrough equivalent to 5 of the primary damage of the charge say the charge delivers a maximum of 30hp damage the base bleedthrough damage would be 15hp this 15hp would be selectable depending on what charge u loaded and could be em explosive thermal or kinetic damagethe primary damage of the charge will be mitigated by shield resistances but the bleed through would only be mitigated by the next level of resistanceskey factor here is the bleed through has a base damage amount unaffected by the prior level of resistancesthis dual core design has a stable and definable punch but requires careful selection of damage type to be most effectiveblasters keep most to all of their original design of being high cap extreme close range weapon systems but have the potential rewards there that they dont have at the momentrailguns would be a caldari adaptation of this bleedthrough hybrid design designed to penetrate armour and encroach on hull damage much like earthly rpg7 and anti armour weapons instead of the bleedthough damage being selectable the damage stays thermal with the selectable charges differing between primary damage typesthis time theres no base damage bleedthrough amount but the amount of bleed through is calculated at 5 of the damage after armour resistances have been applied to the main damage typewhat this means is that to get the best bleed through u need to be hitting the weakest armour resistance in order to get a higher damage after armour resistances and hence a higher 5 bleedthrough into hullboth these systems offer a unique selling point i dont feel theyre in any way overpowered when running numbers the bleedthrough percentages  base damage equivalents tailor to the damage amounts of the charge sizes there would be no mental assault frigate bleed through popping a drake in a few minutesin terms of lore these systems operate more in line with what i believe hybrid charges are were originally intended to beboth systems operate the way the races are envisioned to idolisethe gallente thinking around a problem against their nemesis race and the caldari using might to further their advantage over an overthinking opponentthis kind of change could also see the rising use of both armour and shield logistics in the same fleet maybe even creating a 3rd possible hull logistics that could bring the oneiros back into use as something other than just a cap generatorplease please discusspsim tired and i think my eyes are about to die
also in relation to using this form of blasters against armour targets base bleedthrough would hit armour resistances that are equal across the board so using the blasters would mean its inherent advantages of selectable bleedthrough damage type is rendered uselesssame goes with railgun advantages against shield targets as the bonuses to thermal bleedthrough damage would be met with relatively high base thermal armour resistances inherent on all shipsonce again please please discuss
one question why you have 15 damage bleed through a drake has 5 k armor and 5k struture it will take you a year to kill a drake with this kind of bleedthrough damage apart from killing a ship whos tank you cant break bledthrough damage is going to be useless
it makes quite some sense railguns should be the ultimate armor piercing weaponif we say the shields work better against fast moving mass their effectiveness would be something like this in descending orderrailgunsautocannonsartillerymissilesblasterslasers being the most effective against shields
hybrids are pretty much fineand stop that gallentecaldari racism both use blasters and railsblaster damage melts ships and if youre gallente you got drones to add to even that blaster caldari ships are actually more useful than railgun ones since at least youre going to do damage even without damage bonusrailguns are currently only useful if you got gallente ship with damage bonus difficult to say if its useless to do useless damage from useless rangei think if theres a problem its with ammo types and smaller guns just look at craptor or longer range dmg etc
well u see i worked it out like this blaster bc vs shield bc brutix vs drakepure gank brutix can deal out close to 1k of dps bt most fits reach around the 500  600 markthe 30hp damage i used in my op was for 1 charge in one gunif the bleedthrough was 5 of base damage before resists then 600dps brutix would deal 30hp of bleedthrough per seconda drake with 5k armor and 5k hull would have 10k of hp to go through without resistances added say the damage type chosen hits armor resists that are 25 75hp of potential damage is removed and the armor 5k would decay at a rate of 225hpsec to chew through that would take 222 seconds or 37 minutes if the drake doesnt have a dc2 on the hull resistances are 0 meaning hull 5k depleats in 167 seconds or 27 minutes6 minutes 29 seconds to pop a shield tanked drake in a gank brutix by bleedthrough onlyat first when thinking of figures to go for this i was thinking percentages of around 25 but when actually doing the calcs itd be waaaay overpowered if youre flying a blaster fit boat doing 600 dps ur generally not tanked so the tactic is one of teamwork with a buddy providing logistic support for youeven at the current 5 base of theoretical maximum i think if you were flying a perma 800dps tanked drake ud be pretty ed getting popped from bleedthrough alone in 6 and a half minutes the length of time required to go though armor and hull is very much a massive alert to get helpthe blaster and railgun concept i wanted to share actually forces cooperative pvp as aposed to solo pvpit also pushes the use of hull repping as a preemptive measure as aposed to an after combat deep space repngo
not a bad suggestion at all
the information tab on wormholes is saying wormholes have 4 hours left on their life and closing like mad its happened multiple times recently and can be quite annoyingno they did not close due to mass both warnings were maxed and the holes have been closing anywayi could swear i saw a thread on this earlier but cannot find it as of right now please merge if neededthanksj205818 closed in evuldgenzo today at about 0200 server time unfortunately i dont think we recorded the other ones
assembly hall isnt some place you bring all of your problems dudebug report it dont clog up this forum with relatively new bugs
so you would like presumably the next csm to take this bug issue to ccp when they get a chancefile a bug report you moron
the only way i could be more moronic is if i was bumping a topic that i didnt want to be there in the first place on an altthanks for your advice i will let ccp handle it
i dont understand the problem
previously this system was in placethis system seems to be bugged some wormholes just close while giving no warning whatsoever this can be amazingly costly to playersif they made the change intentionally we would like to know if they did not we would like to see a fix or at least know that it is not working as intended and they will fix it
i see well that is a problem indeed seems like a bug but not a csm issue
ibtl
i would like to see that traders can sell and buy stuff directly from custom offices so that the pi user is able to sell and buy directly to othersthis would make the pi management much more interesting because you can deliver stuff to haulers or traders who can do the job as a businessat the moment buying and selling is only possible through a station we can keep it like that so people need to enter a station first to get the orders but the delivery of a courier contract should be fullfilled at the custom office
ive petitioned ccp to start a plex drive for the victims and families of victims of the new zealand earthquake tragedy and id like others to help make this happen by sending petitions of their own im not sure about how to best to make this happen so im hoping others in here from the csm and vets will help me get this goingthanks
not supportedthis isnt because im heartless though its because we can look at haiti and see that throwing money at problems like this doesnt really fix anything real effort to rebuild infrastructure is the key to revitalizing a country or area thats been devastated by a natural disaster and again this cant be done by simply throwing money at the families who have been devastated
already started herealso wrt money  its not just throwing money at the problem its bringing in fresh water food and medical supplies these all cost money and not just for the people effected but for the rescue teams who have come inofficial responses can only cover so much and in the meantime there are thousands of people who dont have these basic necessities money helps these things get there now when its really neededsupporting this one too
linkage
im sorry do you actually have a proposal you wish to bring to our attention if not ib4l
im sorry do you actually give a 
didnt think so
i think this idea would make ships more diverse where you can upgrade your hull to be stronger armor shield cap cpu weapons and all of course there should be a base multiplier or something to make it cost more and more as you research it farther and farther if you do upgrade something there has to be a penalty on something else say i upgrade the hull it has more mass and becomes slower also skills would have to be added to upgrade or research the ships instead of adding some new thing on how to develop your ships and whatnot just add on to the research tab and labsone step closer to a better sandboxsuggestions will be accepted and added
ive thought about that as well and i like to call it modifying to avoid confusion with i think it should be able to be done to almost everything in game ships modules etc etc be very skill intensive and use many different parts of of different source such as plexes missions some made from other items maybethe first thing that comes to my mind however is that it would probably cause a lot of load to the database as every modified item would create a more or less unique database entry with its stats or ccp would have to create another 20 versions of each item as we have 20 meta levels right now that would match pretty good to use that also those modified items would get the name of the person that did mod them just as the normal officer items so every item would also get unique in that way and would get a unique database entryif that however would not carry any weight then i would love to be able to modify every stat on every item that is in eve right now lol ofine tune my ship in every way possible make it faster give it more slots ad another bonus etc etc etcetcetc there should maybe be some sort of calibration points at which point the ships would fall apart cause you modified so much at it also some small chance for the item to get damaged and a even smaller chance for a item to get destroyed while being modifiedthere could also be different ways to mod ie the ultra carefull way 0 chance of critical failure and the crazy way 99 chance etcwhich would yield different grades of items and at a certain level it would be only possible to modify with a certain chance of destructionof curse all that could be also influenced with better items equipment and skills and moreand modifying a ship in certain areas could also effect others so for modules too making a ship go 100ms faster could decrease cap recharge or armor etc etcit would be cool however if you could chose where the penalty should go do i want to decrease cpu need on cost of power grid need or damage or tracking or any other attribute that makes sense on my large 800mm auto cannon iiagain all that could be influenced by better items skills etcah almost endless possibilities but i better stop now the catcazyps oh and this feature is so big that it should probably get its own full expansion other ways it cant be done in its full possible awsomeness
i had something similar in mind 2 months ago no one was interested howeverlinkagewould be cool if ship rigging had some depth in it
yeah it would give depth but i assume there would have to be a limit so no one has super powered ships if this idea doesnt go well they should add different hull shapes and or shield types and what they deflect the most bla bla bla gives a new marketing area at least
theres already a mechanism to upgrade ships by improving something while attracting a penalty at a cost rigs
increase fitting requirements for all plates and extenders by 2550 across the boardwill have limited impact on the bigger hulls bcbs as they generally have lots of room to spare and the damage output is designed to hit heavy tankswill close the chasm that the bufferparadigm has created in cruiser and below where dps is not scaled to shoot ehp equal to one class abovethank you for your time
basicly you suggest removing extenders and plates from the gamewho puts those modules on a bsyou want to make it so noone puts them anywherethe buffer on frigates already sucks so you want to remove these modules to nerf cruisers fitting large extenders and 8001600mm plates
ummm who doesnt active tanks on bs became extinct years ago and were replaced by 23 plates as the norm you trolling by any chancefrigatesdestroyers regularly use 400 platesmextenders those are cruiser modules  you can fit combat capable read viable frigates with 10k ehpcruisers regularly use 1600 plateslextenders those are bs modules  you can fit combat capable read viable cruisers with 50k ehpso you have frigates with cruiser ehp but stuck doing frigate damage and cruisers with bc ehp but stuck doing cruiser damage 
large extenders are cruisersized modules  their fitting requirements and the amount of buffer they add are similar to those of 800mm platesand cruisers can only fit 1600mm plates by downgrading their highslot mods or using fitting modsrigsedit and you have to go out of your way to get mses on shield frigates because small extenders are utterly worthless  they provide the same amount of ehp as 100mm plates which is to say that theyre a complete waste of a slotnot supported
oh well no not trolling just being an idiotthe 1600mm plates would be the only ones retaining their use if more expensive and really only on bses400mm plate on frigs arent exactly great already imho only the rifter and some pirate hulls can do it really welland a rifter will still have less than 6k ehp less than some frigs with 200mm plates
large extenters are for large shps full stop period if they are not something is wrong same goes for batlleships maybe if 1600mm plates actually costs something to fit you wount have every man and his dog buffertanking their ships
and large is how bigwhat about xlargesmall  uselessmedium  destroyercruiserlarge  cruiserbcxlarge  bsthere are no xlarge extendersas you can see frigates are forced to use mediums which they can rarely afford fitting wiseand bses are forced to use no extenders at all
frigatedestroyer  1 or 2x medium extender  200mm or 400mmcruiser  1 or 2 x large  1600mmbc  1 2 or 3x large  1600mmhurrdurr
exactly
instead of bringing more dps your targets should be nerfed instead
battlecruisers are already way too powerful compared to cruiser size ships and that includes hac and suchcould as well just delete cruisers from game and be done with it not supporting as i like cruisers
was a typo 400 mil loot per officer
make belts rats use sleeper ai and scram out to 250km
thats basically more what i meant thats what gets on my nerves mostly
back in time when it was useful to try ganking people when they landed at stations they used to do warp to 0 bookmarks at station undocks so they never landed off the docking range
i agree warp to 0 with station should always land the jumper within docking rangeall stations have a freaking gigantic 0m distance radiusonly a damn  would make it so ships always warp to 0 at the edge of itespecially since warp inaccuracy is well known
they still do that in highsec of all places tengus can be one volleyed by bs with a rack of 1400s suicide gankers wait off station in direction with a gate for ones that drop out of warp to a full stop now that all the carebears had instaundock bms wait at undock in a shuttle in irjune or motsu and you will see all the tengus warping into the undock where presumably the jet can had been its a headscratcher
how about doing the ing low sec00 incursions that no one is doing instead of asking for more high sec incursions once again high sec has a broken balance to low sec and 00 running a 20 man fleet through high sec for an hour nets you 200 mil nowi want to see a low sec system where 50 pirates get together and engage a 50 man logibs fleet even if its a carebearing fleetif anything the rewards in high sec should be nerfed severely
sansha isnt a botter his supply of ships is limited
no they dontlone carrier is a dead carrier i dont see carriers dropping on peoples heads like moms do today i really dont see them being overpowered
you all know i has to be like this i support this product and or serviceit sure is nice to know you all are theregood luck all semper fi
how
why by being serious of course
except they wont oblige look at the drama around incarna and that part of ccp simply walking away keep in mind there is no single ccp theres many people in it some who want to make the dream and others who just see it as a private ticket to status and others who have long passed that station and who really just want to do new shiny awesome and lolcustomers be damned
the ideal team would be a balance of players from different aspects of eveeach delegate has their own opinions which reflect those who support their background whereas the overarching goal between all would be to agree upon improvements to the fundamentals of the gamebeyond this ccp has their own agenda with new features feature specifics are largely unknown so a team specifically tailored to handle new eve stuff is not the way to gohaving representatives from all walks of evelife should ensure the csms ability to handily tackle whatever ccp throws on the tablethe csm is supposed to represent the best and brightest that the eve community chooses to represent their concernswith that said i feel its important for candidates to have a firm grasp on the game issues at hand not trying to grab at ones out of reach nonexistant or meta
not supporting a terrible crybaby of a pilot that prometheus is supporting another candidate who isnt a  thank you for your time s
ok serious question how are you going to approach it when you find out that the people making the decisions on game issues large and small have absolutely no affinity of what you are saying for example because they havent played in years have moved on and have zero care are merely interested in using eve as a platform for shiny new things or only play one tiny little piece of the game because that is all they know obviously that is a worst case scenario weve seen that theres a renewed will of ccp to balance acquisition and retention but with a fixd roadmap and limited resources how will you argue the case
i dont agree with limited resources ccp can delegate resources whenever and wherever they wanti get that ccp is a company looking to expand and make money and nothing gets more attention than new featuresthe flipside to that is keeping all those people you grabbed in the beginningccp seems to employ a system similar to cabals im confident that having a team of developers dedicated to only balance and maintenance is not a gigantic issue considering how little the teams effect and communicate with each other the trick isnt getting a team together but deciding what they take on and in what orderat any rate csm5 got the ball rolling and ccp appears to listen heres hoping they can keep it up
edit broke up my wall of textthis is where i stopped reading what you are saying is that the best way for the council of stellar management to present a unified voice to ccp in regards to things that should be addressed is for every person on the council to have a different idea of what should be addressed perhaps somewhere in rainbow fairytale land where true democracy is enforced by some sort of benevolent godwizard that is true if that were the world in which we lived then there would be no starving kids in africa the only power that the csm has to influence ccp is to react as a sounding board if the response to an idea pitched to the csm by ccp is met with a smattering of hell yeah and hell no and everything inbetween including complete apathy then ccp can rightfully say game mechanic idea c7xf41 has met with approval from the csm and we will be working to find ways to implement it with the next major patch what is hoped for in the mittanis stance which is probably a longshot to be honest is that by presenting a unified and cohesive response to ideas pitched by ccp the csm can stonewall bad ideas and overwhelmingly support good ideas in order for this to work then the csm needs to as a group agree on what general criteria exist for deciding whether game mechanic idea c7xf41 is a good idea or a bad idea you will not get that from a split council where candidate a is a smallgang lowsec pvper who wants to make highsec less safe and remove some of the advantages of 00 space where candidate b does nothing but run level 4 missions in a deadspacefit raven navy issue all day where candidate c is an ultrabillionaire jita tycoon who sees the game as a giant spreadsheet in space where candidate d is the average 00 space citizen who rats in a drake to pay for his pvp costs where candidate e is the leader of a space alliance that focuses on mining and research in highsec where candidate f is a roleplayer who wants the primary focus of the game to shift towards walkinginstations and character customization where candidate g has a hardon for the good old days of nanofit blaster ships and elite wulfpax in 00 and who hates the very idea of incarna and so on this is not a unified voice it cannot be their interests are diametrically opposed the only way there is even a slight chance that the csm will be able to present a unified voice is for the individual people on that council to have generally aligned ideasthe way to win the game in this day in age isnt just to set everyone blue its to get those blues elected to the csm
good luck prom you have all of genos supporting you
you have my vote i think especially from the recent changes to rockets its proof enough that ccp does listen eventually to the player base and as you say persistence is key all of the changes you suggest are necessary and would be welcome
 two shotsim not someone who knows every single aspect of the gamenobody does i cant tell you the most effectivesafestfastest way to mine arkanor but im sure someone canwould you want me working to make mining interesting at the cost of all of
i unironically enjoy your videos
this is stupid the most effective thing the csm has ever done was uniting around the excellence issue  an issue initially proposed by a director of eve uni and then driven forwards by a lowsec pirate and two members of relatively minor nullsec alliances if you honestly believe that people with different experiences and perspectives on the game cannot work together on issues that are obviously important to everyone who plays your position is flatly contradicted by the facts if your position is that there should be no room for dissent whatsoever on any issue even those on which the playerbase is split then youre arguing for an unrepresentative and pointless council of yesmen which is guaranteed to sink back into irrelevance post hasteanyway 1 vote for prom
you have my vote prom
and my axeerhm sorry but in all seriousness i wouldnt like anything more than to get a real soloer and a good one to have a few words with ccpthe solo and small gang gameplay of eve is still quite awesome and unique in the world of gaming on a good moment nothing can compare really ccp seems to have long ago forgotten that they even have such a thing  somebody needs to remind them and stop them from inadvertedly grinding it down prom has my vote
i have 17 votes can i help
i hate taking the position of the fanboy but i cant stand the goon propaganda anymore ptwo shots youre somewhat correct csm is bringing our voice the voice of the eve players regarding game features or problems to the ears of the devs and whos best suited for that job then our almighty alliance leadersthe problem with your whole line of argument is that you presume mr mittani to be a good csm candidate i mean he is a leader of an alliance would he find the time to commit to csm in times of peace ye sure but what if war comes down your way where would his priorities be we see all the time how entire alliances fail because their leader was away from eve most recent being it do alliance leaders even know what we the small folks are struggling with and if they dont how can they react correctly to a proposed feature that would or could affect the life of the lil folks the mittani himself said the csm does not implement features its a sounding board for ccp the question here is how would a decadent and slightly delusional if i may add alliance leader know the right sound when it comes to pvp ships i mean
well i think i just found the second candidate to spend some votes on
about timeprom for csm
doesnt seem like a terrible campaign good luck
ok so how do we cast our vote and if we have multiple accounts can we cast more than one vote
funny how many people dont realise that anyone can be lying even this guy usually someone who says he isnt lying may well be lying to just get votes his way remember a lawyer is not a leader
mittani for president
the man can snap his fingers and say hey guys this thing over here sounds like it might be fun go do it if you feel like it and thereby consistently summon up a fleet of a thousand people eager to go die horribly show me another leader who can do that without a bunch of threats vapid call to arms posts and general freaking out about internet space ships for that matter show me a leader who can do it with those things
the mittani is a man of great wisdom and erudition he has my vote and should have yours as well
what exactly is there for me to lie about the csm is fundamentally misrepresented by candidates and you need someone who can forge it into a working bloc to try to actually achieve power rather than being the whitewashing pr stunt that ccp presently has itoh look we listen to players we fly nine dudes to iceland a couple of times a yearif you think this is not the actual truth youre sadly deluded if you think someone promising to fix blasters in this forum can actually deliver on that  christ i dont even know
so how are your personal views less important if the csm is more like a feedback group ccp bounces ideas against than if you were bringing assembly hall ideas to the developers sounds like you just want to block them nerfing your logistics and limiting your ability to hold deserted space you never use or whatever important issues alliances are getting prissy about this time of the year by presenting ccp with a false impression of player consensusi dont think a feedback group should present an unified front at all
then you must be very pleased by all that the csms have accomplished thus far
considering csms have been elected with as little as 7 votes cast id be really worried if they had more influencebut last i heard they all thought removing jump bridges was a pretty sweet idea that was a nice show of unity there  what are your personal feelings on the issue 
removing jump bridges would be ed but ccp is likely to make a move on the bridge issue before the csm election actually goes through so i dont think itll have any practical relevance for csm6 which is a shame since the last time they tried to make a major balance fix in nullsec they created the hilariously profitable but unbalanced and stupid tech bottleneck welp
you never had any issues about the tech bottleneck when you lived up north where they were at now that you are down south you are expressing that the situation is wrongwhy the change of heart
mittens for president
you lie 1 i live up north in deklein 2 i called ccp chronotis a dunderheaded idiot in a column before the changes to tech even went through
on your website you make a big deal about the importance of getting the chairmanship what in your mind is the role of the chairdarius could motivate goons to go do stuff darius was also a laughably ineffectual csm delegate whose terms accomplished nothing of value for the playerbase or the overall state of the game he got himself a job out of it though yay why should anyone assume that an ability to motivate goons will translate to an ability to be a good csm delegate
 eve online 2011
your platform is fine but why does the king of the goons need my vote to get elected arent there other candidates that could be valuable to your magical coalition of reason that need my votes more than you
did you write thisso you are of the belief that all the seats of the csm should be held by those that belong to 00 power block sov holders only no one from high sec no one from low sec and no nonsov holding entities who live out in 00the idea of ccp removing jump bridges or nerfing them does not agree with youalso you seem mad
are you willing to break ndaif not how will you even be different from any other csm memberyour general attitude towards csm is commendable but do you even believe it yourself that you are able to deliverare you willing to report your own members to stop botting if it comes to thatyour alliance openly violates eula are you going to try and protect them when it is apparent that the discussion is going against your alliance agendaare you planning to say anything that isnt a lie
have you stopped beating your wife yet
mittens for god emperor
welcome to the csm candidacy mittens nice to see you finally throwing your hat in the ringhowever dont put us all in the same basket while many csm members in the past have got in by making promises to the general public thats not been the case for all of us i would actually say that the most valuable members of the csm over the past 4 terms i was a member of were the ones who didnt make promises of the kind you describei just want to address this pointon one hand you say im not going to lie to you i know how the csm operates were a sounding board on the other hand you say that process you want to be a part of failed to accomplish anything relevant pick one now since you agree we are a sounding board a feedback mechanism and a lobbyist group for things wed like you must know also that most of our accomplishments are not of the form hey we gave you this on our own because we said so but rather a continuous collaboration with ccp where features we promoted made it in with ccps design and our feedback on that design or things that came from ccp but we had a significant impact in altering to make sure it suited our needs desires didnt upset things more than was needed etc not always successfuly but we cant force ccp into doing anythingif you want other examples of things the csm has been responsible for providing significant feedback on to the point the resulting things were better microtransactions or lack thereof p ui redesign including but not limited to new contextual menus assets search contracts eve mail fitting savings titan changes naglfar changes fuel bays bettering the gm department work in progress but the progress exists and is relevant new player experiencetheres many many more thingsbut its a collaborative process not anything the csm can point at and say were solely responsible for so dont bash us for that you wont be able to do anything differentthat being said welcome again good luck with your campaignfor those who intend to vote for the mittani all i can say is that from the limited interactions ive had with him he looks like a fairly clever guy and im curious as to what he could bring to the table
voting for mittani would feel just as good for me as letting istvaan invest my isk for me
abstain
word
me likes this
mittani im just saying we dont know if your lying or not at all period you may have things to lie about you that you didnt show in your post the only reason your probably going to be a good leader is all those other goonswarm candidates will be elected at the mostyou shouldnt call people deluded you should convince them instead of calling them names good way to get another voter moron
hes not lying its not like getting on the csm is going to magically allow him to tell ccp to do anything he wants because we all know that the current csm structure gets almost nothing proposed done everits just a group that ccp bounces ideas off of then says hey look the guys you people elected agree with us praise the csm player interactionps get over yourself
one thing that i have learned from this thread is that drooling s are somehow capable of using mouse and a keyboard these daysthats quite some progress right there
with the exception of the wifebeating question the rest of these were pretty reasonable1 of course im not willing to violate the nda2 im a motherer3 i dont know if ill be able to deliver i do think ill be able to do a better job than nice csms but that could just be my arrogance blinding me still i have a solid track record of forging coalitions and making enemies into friends to accomplish common goals im also flat out more politically wise to the ways of human influence than most people angling for this spot 45 this is a common and reasonable question every alliance has eula violators its not the job of an alliance leader to play spacecop when ccp clearly isnt enforcing all on the botting front en24 has done a series of fascinating articles on botting and ccps utter lack of response to it on average they might only be banned for 13 days if you think its the alliance leaders job to enforce the eula youre not going to vote for me thats a silly position though if you consider it for a microsecond or two hey look i climbed to the top of  mountain lets resolve ratting disputes all day theres no point in being an unpaid ccp gm when ccp themselves dont enforce the things youre reporting onas someone who enjoys smallgang pvp more than massive fleets irony alert id prefer if botting was pursued aggressively as theres basically no solo pvp to be had since the natural solo prey  the idiot ratter  is now an automated autologging machine
the mittanis position as expressed in this thread is pretty badly flawed he extrapolates from the fact that there is no welldefined method for the positive propagation of game design ideas from the csm to ccp and concludes that anyone who lays out an agenda is a liar yet at the same time he recognises that the csm acts as a sounding board that gives feedback to ccp obviously this feedback will be based on the preferences sketched by the agendas of each candidate so these lists of goals do in fact provide good sources of information for the voters to see what the candidates will work towards whether through active propagation of ideas or in the more passive role of providing feedback all that is needed to make the agendas correspond with reality is a slight change of emphasis something along the lines of i will support general principles x y and z and will definitely support changes a b and c whilst i will not give positive feedback to ideas along the lines of d e or fwhat does the mittani offer in the place of an agenda that voters can support he offers leadership for the csm he does not say towards what ends however if his previous writings eg his ten ton hammer pieces are anything to go by it does not really matter towards what ends he thinks that what is important is that people should be led and not that they should choose he writes fulsome praise of the leadership style that restricts the choices of those being led because mere pawns cannot be expected to appreciate the vistas of freedom and will simply become confused and dazed if they are offered too many options so dont expect that the mittani will act in what you think are your interests if you vote for him expect rather to be told what is in your interest whether you like it or not remember also that this is someone who has spoken warmly of the pleasure to be had not just in beating people in the game but in driving them out of the game by ruining their gameplay experience this is the person who wants to be your representative in helping to determine whether directly or through providing feedback what that experience will be of course many goons will vote for the mittani he takes their votes for granted in the op saying that a csm place is simply his for the taking to the goons i say what has become of you will you ever again be able to look your heritage in the face if you pass up this wonderful chance to troll your leader and puncture his ego by voting for someone else there are other goon candidates available to you candidates who are not standing on the principle of divine right if you want one of your own at the csm table then vote for kalrand and show yourselves capable of independence and not just slavish obedience to an arrogant masterthis party political broadcast was paid for by md voices for kalrand a nonprofit organisation
how exactly is this any different from any other candidate candidate x who wants to fix blasters is going to support fixing blasters and shoot down other ideas as wastes of time if they are proposed because people are petty candidate y who wants to remove level 4 missions from highsecurity space is going to similarly cut down other peoples ideas and project his own as the best candidate z who wants to disperse 00 power blocs is going to oppose anything raised by the 00 power blocs in favor of his ideas what you have said about the mittanithat he is going to act in his perceived best interest at the potential expense of everyone elsesis an accurate description of how most human beings on this planet act every day what you seem to balk at is the fact that the mittani openly admits to being a manipulative bastard who is willing to try to get his way once he is in a position to do so rather than mouthing a bunch of empty platitudes about how hes not going to do thateveryone has an agenda most people try to hide it or flower it up with nice words about the importance of the every man if your problem with the mittani is that he has an agenda then dont vote for himor for anyone else in the csm race if your problem with the mittani is that he admits to having an agenda then help yourself to a sobering dose of reality everyone has an agenda the mittani loves you and has your best interests at heart
my agenda also involves relentlessly posting pictures of my puppy
the agenda outlined here is simply to forge the csm into an effective and unified advocacy group what is not outlined is exactly what it will advocate for once it is an effective group creating something powerful simply for the sake of having something powerful with an endsblind attitude is the kind of political position that makes me want to run a mile creating something powerful with specific objectives in mind is something i could get behind on the other hand now the mittani has referred readers to his ten ton hammer articles if they want to know his views and by implication the kinds of positions he would likely use the weapon he plans to forge in support of but this is just hiding these views behind several hundred pages of text why not just summarise them here what exactly is the agendaedit  cute puppy btw
so what youre saying is he needs an auditedit seriouspost thanks for your support
my views on the issues of the day arent particularly unique to me because i think there is a broad consensus about the problems of this deeply damaged game one of the biggest issues i think is that the csm itself is weak and easily ignored which is the primary thrust of my argument before we can fix blasters or change assault frigates or whatever you need a csm with teeth the single most obvious issue is the feature backlog and the rush to implement shiny new toys when core segments of the game are half implemented or just outright broken junior accountant role is still broken and its been weeks since incursions was released dominion is halfimplemented to everyones suffering the techenetium bottleneck was identified by market discussions weeks in advance and ccp made a hamhanded dysprom nerf that ed everything up all of this goes into the category of dumb  the 18 months business and oh hey we only have 22 devs working on eve itself dev blog were ing scandalous im antibot yet i understand that the reason bots exist isnt so much rmt because ccp cracks down on rmt very very hard but bad pve which amounts to little more than watching three grey bars turn red in world of warcraft people bot because they want to rmt but people actually play the pve because its fun not eyestabbingly boring ccp presently doesnt enforce antibotting for  though they do antirmt mainly because they realize their pve is godawful id like to see the pve experience made much more fun so people would actually play and that thus i could gank an honest ratting raven rather than have it autolog when i enter locali think supercaps are overpowered wow wild and crazy statement and ive felt that for years id like to see more die my personal view which i think is irrelevant in the csm process and ccp might come up with a better idea is that a supercaponly point would make these fights much bloodier the fact that fighterbombers can kill hics makes them not particularly threatening the biggest cause of supercap death isnt being tackled in eve 2011 its having the node die around you everyone says fix lag everyone even ccp find me a prolag candidate vov anyway thats the poop
i know mittens hates sycophancy so i should try to avoid being a sycophant so i can be sycophanticmittani youre a  but im voting for youhowd i doon a more serious note this csm campaign is more watertight than the others the mittani has been high up in goonswarm for years and knows alot about running sections and now all of an alliance he also has real world experience of an intellectually demanding job that requires knowing  how to lie how to talk how to convince people his points by using evidence he also has an adorable puppy a house he bought with cash has retired young and so can devote much neckbeard time to internet spaceships looks like dane cook with downs syndrome and flies a sabre this man is clearly the man for you for the csm chairhe also larps and stuff
he also makes good posts
you have my vote cant be any worse than the previous csms
swynet is exactly right either ccp cares about what the csm thinks or they dont either they listen to the playerselected representatives or they dont thats why i have no problem being held accountable for the things i want to do particularly my proposal for a perpetual iterative development team several other of the serious csm candidates such as seleene and roc feel the same way and if we collectively have thousands of eve players  as our voters  behind us in those goals ccp can ignore us of coursebut i dont think they willthe more dedicated members of csm5 such as trebor have shown us the way if you present real playersupported initiatives with real data behind them such as the crowdsourcing trebor did ccp listens thats why i want to do the same thing with player roundtablesand thats why i want to be on csm6 to continue that momentum and im willing to do the work to help that happenthanks for your question it was a great one
if its so great then could you answer it your response did not tell me the method and specific actions by which you as an individual are going to do stuff you talked to me about ccp and the previous csm
the best allround candidate in the running
trebor is all about what is best for the game and the players he is not corrupted with the what is best for me and my brosefs attitude like many of the other candidates out therehe has all my votes lets hope he gets chairman
despite the many good candidates out there its easy to tell that due to your experience in the matter and your sound way of reasoning youre perhaps the most suited person to become csm chairman i would have trouble choosing between you and seleene as both your backgrounds are interestingall this to say i wish you luck in your candidacy although you probably wont need it  and hope for a chance to serve the community in a seat next to yours
so to clarify you are shamelessly trying to buy votes by using isk incentives i like it
i think its awesome that theres another csm candidate that looks kind of like his portrait
1 trebor youve done a great job on csm5 fingers crossed you get elected to csm6 as well
shamelessly yes also openly proudly and with a smile on my face this is eve
would you support a change as drastic as removing sec status gain from every npc in game except lowsec belt rats
im sure everyone will draw their own conclusions about these admissions
this is what i have been screaming for a while now myself if concord doesnt care about the bad things you do in 00 why should they care about the good things i do like the idea of no sec status gain in empire too
how do you feel about the results of your supercap changes
given you were one of the developers involved in creating dominion in the first place what do you say to people who think you are in fact part of the problem
there has been zero indication that ccp is planning to put any sort of pvp element into incarna i would like to see where something like that might go but that entails having a planif you mean that low sec rats give you sec status gains and 00 rats just give you bounties  rewards from an rp perspective that would make a bit of sense if you are talking about low sec incentives i think there should be more than one way though of increasing your sec status than just shooting random bits of pixels in a belt as well id be happy to bash more ideas around about this especially alternative ways of raising sec statusi think its ridiculous that they have been allowed to sit as is for over a year and for nearly three years previous to that i have no idea why ccp seems almost scared to do minor tweaking and balancing every couple of months until they hit the sweet spot there should be a dedicated team of people that work specifically on this sort of thing actively soliciting feedback from players instead of working on things and then surprising us with dev blogs or changes on sisi from nowhere thats the entire point of my campaign the everincreasing amount of game mechanics that continue to sit stagnant year after year yet more new stuff keeps getting added to the pot well i worked on a lot more than just dominion but if you are looking for someone to blame for the state of play right now id suggest you look a lot higher up than me i was one man on a team and the ultimate decisions as to what would or would not be in dominion were not made by me as ive stated elsewhere the new sov system is just one of the many things in eve that were started and never finished you can watch the presentation i gave at fanfest last year for a few hints of things that didnt make it into dominion or sinceits not my decision that sov factional warfare losec wormholes or hell even certificates were never iterated on this is why im running for csm  i want to know why just like you do i know what was in the cooker before and i remember how many of these decisions were made i can use that knowledge to help csm6 work together better than ever before in trying to at the very least get some answers i wont make false promises that issue x or y will be fixed because i know all too well how things work
what are your thoughts on this
vile rat is the best of rats and will do great things for all
you say break intended distribution how soyou point out things that you view as being broken this implies that you can see things that are not broken what about moons would you like to see happen so they are not broken
the moons are fine they havent changedtweaks in production that shift bottlenecks around are poorly implemented and cause great damage to game balance
large fleet battles are epic so is small scale pvp do you feel it is possible for both to coexistwhat are you thoughts on jump bridges in regards to logistics and power projectiondo you have a black ops battleship if so do you get to use it much or how you would like towhat ship do you secretly love no matter how broken it gets if anythere is a ton more people playing the game than five years ago what are your thoughts on the increase in players per system and that into the vast unknown feeling is it still there for youyour last truly satisfying small scale pvp experience where strategy experience and skills were used in every aspect that gave you felt good about
im going to dis you goonswarm people because of your ceo hes lying now go troll his post
no longer must we be subject to the sycophancy of the csms of the past a vote for vile rat is a vote for the wellbeing of all and not just the priveleged elite
i support vile rat and the mittani for csm as well as that other guy white tree you will have all my votes
absolutely no question they both can exist and should exist the problem is mostly goals theres no achievable goal in the game that can be accomplished with a small group thats worth doing where a larger group isnt the best counter hratli smirks did a good write up its on kcom if youre interested of a king of the hill style lowsec goal that would be a good achievable idea that would help to fix this issue really when you reach the end theres one goal and in my opinion thats where things fall apart i dont approve of anything that would reintroduce tedium such as making people jump 40 jumps just to get back and forth to empire thats not to say i think you should have a safe run of it two separate issues in play here and they arent necessarily two sides of the same coin you can have quick logistics without it being safe logistics i did it blew up because i was a dumbass i like the concept of the ship but its just a mini titan without the fun part at this point and not very fun to fly we get a lot of use out of them inserting bombing squads and theres a great deal of utility in that but theyre just support ships i would love for dreads to be worth flying again im a bit bitter about what supercapitals have done to the usefulness of regular cap fleets that whole implementation is just so broken right nowthat fell apart when bloc warfare became the norm now you have people huddled into hubs and its become boring as heck can you imagine something like iss happening again the blue pill small groups owning little outposts holding small areas independently no of course not they would be crushed the day they dropped the outpost egg my first day in game i was in a punisher in syndicate and ive never known anything but youre likely going to die if you arent really careful and smart and the game is a lesser place for that being rare these days our directors sneak off from time to time to querious in our alts and mittani yammers on about his sabre and khefron goes on about his billion isk drake and i usually jam hella dudes in my falcon its not much but what youre asking for is damn hard to find without having another 40 ships float in mid fight every fight these days is a gank or a trap and the lack of achievable small scale goal contributes to this in a big way
what is your position on jump bridge removalnerf
dont let the name fool you as long as you dont spam in his intel channels vile rat is a very nice and very smart man who would be an excellent choice as a csm candidatea vote for vr is a vote for a better eve
i actually thought that the rumours that nc and goonswarm gad planned a massive campaign to claim all seats on the csm were a joke until i read thispitiful depressing and shameless bad enough that nc  goons have killed 00 alliance warfare through lazy defence pacts even worse that theyre now manipulating the playerbase into voting them in to positions where they can control ccp policy to suit their own selfpreservationshame on you vile ratthe sooner this game is reclaimed by genuine players the better
i like this guy how do you make thumbs up and thumbs down stuff hope you support this
what topics are you willing to concede to your peers so that you and your peers can present a unified voice to ccp
two shots your repetitive including the fact you didnt address his post about you and mittani
just in case youre not trollin some of the other campaign websites here are gorgeous thats true i must concede that i am more at ease with code and pretty much suck when it comes to designing interfaces and fancy pagessadly with both rl taking its toll and me trying to spend time talking with the players when im on eve i am left with little time to work on a website if youre willing to design me an awesome website so i can publish my ideas in a more fashionable manner please do  this would be very appreciatedon to the deeper questions  sry content  presentationit strongly depends of what were talking about it seems critical to bring a unified voice to ccp in terms of what topics should be debated what is a priority and so on if only for efficiency purposes but in that case there are multiple simple ways to make everyone agree on it and we can even call the players for an estimation of how much a feature is needed  would be appreciated remember the prioritization crowdsourcing when it comes to the details of a particular problem thus i dont think it would be a good idea to come to ccp with a smoothed united point of view in fact im certain of the opposite eve being what it is its home to a lot of different players with different playstyles instead of making sure we all come to an agreement and convincing each other csm representatives would probably waste less time and archive better results if bringing all those points of view to ccp showing the multiple sides of a problem of course part of the job is to organize those to present them in an orderly manner preferably with some figures people like figures this doesnt mean we should fight in the middle of meetings although some dueling rules could make it enjoyable but clearly conceding a point as a csm member is only a good idea if you see youre mistaken if i strongly believe that my opinion although different is carrying the voices of a sufficient number of players i will insist for it to be added to the report template  so ccp on the topic of x it seems that y but also some players may experience z and we need to take that into accountthank you for your kind support profiteering  concerning the issue you just raised i must admit im not completely sure of what youre suggesting exactly your post is quite short and the second post of this topic although more complete may not reflect your opinion and lacks a bit of claritywhat i can say so far  there is already plenty of modding available for ships in the way of tech variants modules rigs and in the case of t3 subsystems its undoubtedly a great feature of eve to be able to custom our shipseven if its not the purpose of the csm to steer the whole ccp game design department i have good hope that additional features in terms of customization will be added to the game anyway for sure other t3 hulls are coming two other possibilities that have been mentioned but are less certain are custom ship paint jobs microtransactions  and ship crews that could possibly be appealing to ccp with the upcoming incarna content i dont think this issue really needs to be raised as ccp has probably something in the pipes already however ill be happy to help them refine it so it suits the players needs to the fullest
hi eve communityhello gehenas a leader of our small comunity in game you helped us discover eve world and many involvment we may have in it as a friend we discovered altogether wormhole life crafting experience of t3s so i must say you have a fairly great knowledge of the game in itselfyour knowledge of french comunity is important  but you re mostly an open minded guy and your contacts with french comunity represent a small part of the people you deal with ingameif i write here as a member of sos a wormhole french corporation well established and a 00 discoverer it s to ask you some questions1 wormhole it seems a great way to amplify the pleasure of the game  risk and danger there makes it a tought challenge usualy and pvp delivers a lot of adrenaline what will you do to make ccp advance in wormhole game design game threat and interaction2 t3 you re one of the most prepared guy to the future t3 builds like the possible frigate t3 project the game got an interesting new interest when the t3 cruisers appeared what do you think of this project and the way this frigate would enter actual gameplay 3 games event  you were one of the first when planetary interaction was released to try it and explore it your leaded most of us in the sanshas incursions series of game events do you think the csm should impulse be involved in the makinghelping of such events do you think its what players are looking for  does it helps long time players to stay in eve continue their roamming4 pvp actualy pvp can be done quite easily in different standards massive region pvp  select luxuary style pvp for larger corpos  nation wars  easy to get involved in not as dangerous as can be massive pvp though rat pirating wormhole solar system controls etc etc  are there any new form of players interactions pvp or not anyway you would like to discuss with ccp while in csm anyway as a friend of gehen in game and in real i would like to thank him for what he does to the community as a long time eve traveler 2004 i wished more csm candidate would be less weel known by the community but more involved in the everyday improvment of the gamei ask my friendsthe people i work with and play and enjoytime with to ask gehen questions to avoid judging him on how well known he is but to discover the man the player  and how he cares for people around him you ll discover that usualy the best person are those that do the job not those that spend time talking about itask gehen listen his answerzs and vote for him 
hello jazz  long time no see  still in sos then thats an awful lot of questions youve asked there  as nothing is perfect wspace could also receive some love from ccp however with the focus being on lowsec balancing 00 logistics and other related topics i fear that wspace is not under the spotlights at the moment for ccp and we may not see another iteration on this in the close futurehowever wspace will most definitely be impacted by some of these changes a perfect example is 00 logistics if force projection is nerfed which is the way the csm was headed so far w tactical value as a shortcut in kspace is bound to increase ill make sure noone overlooks thatin short  unless ccp has plans i dont know about i dont think there will be a lot done for w directly sorry i just wont lie to you but ill definitely make sure wspace residents are not forgotten when it comes to indirect changes t3 frigates is indeed something im expecting eagerly on a personal level i dont think the topic has been raised with the csm so far at least not from what they disclosed but obviously introducing a new type of ships in a game with such a delicate balance is no easy taskwith the extensive use of faction and t2 frigates in low  00 small and medium gang warfare and the various gates that only allow frigs in various contexts fw ded plexes it will be tough to produce something balanced lets wait and seeyour question is a bit confusing pi  events  about events  in the end blowing up or mining stuff is always the same  pixels but the social interactions found through corp buddies alliance diplomacy 00 warfare and roleplaying are the endgame of eve what makes you stay when you tried everythinglive events created some good narration stories of heroes and traitors unfolding of a tale of epic proportions theyre definitely the kind of things that people enjoy makes vets stay and they should evolve to become more than a way to introduce new gameplay contentthey already have a lot planned i think we all know ccp is pushing incarna and dust 514 forward i will be happy to discuss those with ccp and make sure they serve a proper function and are not elaborated pr stunts or eye candyin a more general way there is some room for additional cooperative playertoplayer interaction other than teaming up to defeat a stronger force perhaps in the field of industry as a conclusion thanks for your vote and your confidence in my ability to represent the players i especially liked the part about me doing the job not talking yep thats what i do
your plan as i understand it from this response is to completely avoid taking a hard stance on the issue of uniformity in one sentence you state that you understand the importance of the csm presenting an unified voice to ccp and in another you state that you will exempt yourself from this if you personally feel that the need arises from this i can see that you want to do a good job as a potential csm delegate and that you want to give voice to what the players want if this were an ideal world then that would be a great attitude to have and you would make the best possible kind of politician but this is not an ideal world while in principle your stance is a good one in practice it will lead to nothing but disagreement and friction on every single issue were you to be the only delegate who decides to take a tangential stance on some issue then it would not be a big deal but you wont be if we are to assume that its a good idea to elect you a person who has openly stated that he will definitely go against the consensus of the csm should his personal desire warrant it then we must also assume that we would elect other delegates with the same intention and opinion in other words by electing one csm delegate who is willing to allow a fractured message we give every other delegate carte blanch to do the same while the result of a single csm delegate voicing a different or even opposing view may not have much impact the potentiality of every csm delegate expressing a slightly different perspective or suggestion is exactly what will make the csm useless in your above template example you say these words exactly so ccp on the topic of x it seems that y but also some players may experience z and we need to take that into account this is exactly the kind of response that allows ccp to present a bad idea to the csm and then walk away from the discussion and honestly say that game mechanic idea c7xf41 has met with some approval from the csmby providing an outlying opinion you enable a quadmire please dont do it
hes not opposition to other candidates his bloc makes him a shoein
good way to selfterminate a campaign i guess
i asked my own alliance ushrakhan to explain it to me we spoke about logistical advantages for fleet activity how easy jbn make it to trap an enemy fleet or escape from one low upkeep costs they dont appear on the overview etc etc there are a lot of reasons why nullsec alliances love jump bridges thats for surei also spoke with three other alliances i received pretty much the same information leading me to believe that the information my own alliance provided was relatively unbiased thats the key for me really there are always two sides to a story and in the middle is the truth i want to work with the csm to provide a solution that is best for everyonecsm delegates should be expected to understand the mechanics theyre offering feedback on yes

i remember you the guy who twice flew minmitar faction war fleets around aimlessly avoiding combat then spent the rest of his time claiming to be a minmitar fleet commander next time i heard of you was this capsuleer thing now im guessing that you see the csm as a vehicle to advocate your app with the intention of earning money for your self
hey so whatre you going to do about jump bridge units not appearing on the overview that s really annoying man i often get lost when trying to use jumpbridges because they dont appear on the overviewgranted im making a big stink over a very small part of your campaign but when youre that clueless about a very key issue im not sure i can vote for you  sorry
you can trust me with your vote just not your isk is there anything about my campaign you particularly dislike
wait i thought the issue that you burned out but was it that your dbank project just fell apart and you stopped posting
they would be quite the same thing burned out so instead of attempting to recover dbank just took the isk and didnt play for a while
aside from the major topics such as the adjustment of jumpbridges and several others the issues that you consider to be my pet projects are extremely limited in scopetheyre extremely easy to implement and yet they can make the life of the players a whole lot easierone thing about the commit to excellence resolution is to truly finish every project that ccp works on and making a whole bunch of small changes to increase user friendliness fits perfectly into that line of thinking in fact ccp has already started with solving a whole truckload of smaller issues theyve dedicated an entire team to it as such its quite reasonable to assume that if the csm proposes a small easy to implement change ccp will actually do so
now that youve said that could you answer the question i askedexactly and methodically can you walk me through what you as an individual person will do to help get these things done
less sycophancy please why dont you try interrogating your dear leaders rather flawed analyses before dropping in to every thread to foist his rhetoric on everyone else
i assure you that my rhetoric is my own i love calling people out when they are hypocrites or when they allege promise or threaten something they cannot possibly deliver it gives my little goon mind an euphoric rush of the warmandhappy with a chaser of smug
what makes you think that adjustment of jumpbridges is topic at all are you implying that you will be in favor of changing jumpbridge mechanics what kinds of changes you are looking forhow many jumpbridges is your alliance operating and how many systems are you holding sov inhow often do you do alliance logisticsthanks
could you flesh this out further
does he know if jump bridges appear on overviews
hi what will you be doing with regards to the massive impediment to new people moving to 00 unless it is as part of or under the protection of an existing blocalliance and the lack of incentive to do so id love to move my corp to a backend system  but it is simply an impossible proposition as things stand
ill be ignoring the goons seeing that they are here simply to troll the csm candidatesthat said i do operate together with pl on another character and they dont exactly use jump bridgesthere are just too many variables at work to really give a definitive answer about the issue however exactly how they have to be modified is still up for discussion so that the best solution can be worked outthe main idea is to hopefully make logistics into nullsec quite a bit harder this has the potential of breaking up the massive powerblocs that we have now into smaller entities making it overall easier for other groups to come in and claim their own piece of the territorytheres always the possibility that the changes dont quite work out as anticipated though eve players have a knack for doing that
if you were the leader of an alliance in the northern coalition such as mostly harmless or wildly inappropriate then how would you go about seeing to the affairs of your pilots during the transition from presentday superblocs to smaller entities how would you propose to set up supply chains to get needed goods to and from empire space and how would you propose the newlyneutral mostly harmless or wildly inappropriate deal with the fact that it has a supercapital juggernaut right next door
lets pretend for a second that one of the people asking you to talk about your jump bridge idea is running against you
why should he with the amount of goon shposting going on in this forum he and every other nongoon candidate can safely dismiss you as just another goon trollspoiler without looking bad to any nongoons who come by this thread even if you yourself are perfectly sincere and reasonable by your corpmates actions shall you be known
nongoon here and i think its childish to ignore a key point just because the person who raised it is in a bad crowd
i think if anything my candidacy should show that im a bit more serious about my questions than the average goon shpostersteps on soapboxalso ive worked within the larger community specifically that of the market discussions forum for years now my candidacy is not for the goons but to highlight the market and economic interests that ccp has been ignoring i feel that our ingame economy is one of the best and most important facets of what we have here and something that should be defended expanded and corrected in the future
stopped reading
armor is fine im sorry that your blasterboat is too slow to get in range maybe you should crosstrain minmatar
why you talkin in the 3rd person bro
maybe you should worry more about hybrid hull bonuses and slot layouts then a nonexistent problem with armor tanking
do you actually know what i want to change about armor or did you literally stop reading at armor improvements
another random goon candidate to bleed votes away from non nullsec alliance candidates
im running independently of any organized null sec effortsprimarily im running as the voice of the md forum not as part of goonswarm
lol this reminds me of the fourteen point peace plan after world war i although i like some of your ideas some of them i have thought of to 3
the best part is i have no article x to trip the whole thing up
wasnt it article 10 i hope this doesnt ruin your amount of votes because i said that xd
x  10 i thought this was taught in primary school good ol roman numerals
i give your trolling a 4 perhaps ill rank it higher when im soberedit spelling sobriety i give it a 2
as a regular md poster i support kalrands candidacy wholeheartedly i wouldnt trust him with my isk but i would fully trust him to pursue a sensible and cleareyed approach that would take full account of the role of the economy in this game to all the issues that might arise during the tenure of the next csm
i trusted kalrand with isk once and now im posting on the eve online forums
quit lying two shotsoh i forgot about roman numerals
now the answer to the first demands an answer to the secondfix xxxxxxxx has been a rallying cry for some folks and a lot of players xxxxxxxx has in its time represented lowsec nullsec the ui faction wars lag blobbing and the fact that someone else is having more fun than me or making more iskanybody who claims they will if elected fix any of the mega issues    is lyingyou mynxeee and csm 5 did the right start to crowd sourcing for suggestions away from the forums you also did not try to make one fix but focused on smaller items that would improve things a little bit at a time sweeping changes sound all nice in the board room until they are misquoted or misunderstood but they often are exchanging one problem for another with the added benefit of alienating the customer even more we players being the customersanybody who claims they will if elected work on fixing the mega issues    is more realistichaving someone in the csm who will choose to champion a cause as mynxee did with lowsec is a good thing as long as they keep in mind that there are other issues on the table as well which mynxee did this would be along the lines of cabinet posts do not elect people to a specific seat but once the csm is elected ask if there are any special projects that people want to take on they would become the lightning rods for complaints in that area and might try to get more direct access to the ccp devs already assigned to work on them but this is all grand theory and you did ask for a specific answerso far i have liked the predator prey model that was floated in your making lowsec matter what i dont want to do is make piracy harder or illegal it is a valid method of play and as such should not be damaged just because the pirates have overhunted their territory i also dont think adding more goodies to lowsec is going to bring in hoards of new targets for the pirates to kill that is like taking food to the deserti think the answer is going to lie somewhere in another mechanic be it bounty hunting smuggling or faction warfare becoming a militiablock watch next questionm
hello to all i will be seeking reelection to the sixth csm and heres why you should vote for methere are many candidates who are running on a single issue these are bad candidates regardless of how much you might agree with that issue they fundamentally misunderstand how the csm actually works the csm does not for the most part suggest ideas to ccp rather we highlught problems and then provide feedback on ccps proposed solutions from time to time ccp also come up with new ideas and they bounce those off us first all of this is about ten billion times more important and more useful than voting yes or no on somebodys 55 page pos proposal which ccp will then go on to ignore anyway seriously look at the platforms of any of the single issue candidates for the last few csms and see how much of that they even got to push forwards let alone achieve in gameideas are largely useless nobody is really interested in ideas because generally the playerbase including the csm dont have enough information to suggest usable changes beyond the most superficial balance tweaks we dont have the ability to look into code and see how things are done we dont have the overview of ccp resources and how they would need to be allocated to implement any given change and we dont have the strategic vision that drives ccps release schedule what is useful however is the ability to look at other peoples ideas and to point out all the reasons as to why they are wrong and bad as it happens i am very good at this  its actually my day jobat the meetings in the internal csm forum and at the december summit i have been very active and vocal in providing quality feedback and constructive criticism on a multitude of topics raised by ccp as well as working with the other delegates to ensure that the playerbase as a whole is properly represented in those discussions i have had long discussions with members of ccps community management department about messaging and issues raised by the playerbase as someone who has worked for many years as a community manager in aaa mmos previously i am uniquely positioned in this regardif you would like to see more professionalism in the csm a candidate with professional experience in modern mmo games design and community a candidate who is committed to holding ccp to their promises and a candidate who will tirelessly fight to shut down the plethora of terrible ideas that pop up from all sides then you should vote for meyou can read a little more about my platform on my personal site and i look forwards to taking your questions in this thread
even as someone who is technically running against helen id like to say that over the last year the technical ability of helen to raise expose and explain points within the working in the csm has been top notch if i wasnt running personally and wasnt under orders to vote for the mittani id be voting for helen
i have withdrawn from the electionhello again i am pleased to announce my candidacy for csm6 you may remember me from csm3 in which i represented the interests of a broad array of eve online players with your support i hope to succeed by being reelected and bringing more players into the voting process for csm candidateswhy should you reelect me to the csmi feel that i was successful during my first term in listening to the interests of players and bringing them to vote with the council and then on to ccp there were 21 individual issues which were represented by me click this link to view a list of them via my web site and they covered aspects of the game which sorely needed some attention from ccp my attendance for csm meetings were stellar save for one time in which i was absent fortunately the meeting was rescheduled due to others not showing up either i hope these two examples demonstrate the dedication i showed to my role as a member of csm3 and my ambition to continue taking the responsibilities seriously for csm6 by having already served on the csm i have the benefit of my past accomplishments showing i can get results rather than making promises for what i could do if you voted for medo you care about pve missions exploration and miningi do too ccp needs to do more to add new content for missions and especially mining let me be your advocate in telling the developers that the empire community wants more options the worst thing that could happen for the economy is people get sick mining and stimulating market growth with the isk earned from running missions are you sick of unfinished faction warfare lowsec contentenough is enough there needs to be real attention giving to faction warfare and especially lowsec ccp has shifted high level missions towards lowsec but not giving that area any true development in helping either side of the carebearpirate coin i will continue to press forward on the successful community feedback members of csm5 gathered we need this to be at the top of development queue once ccp finishes with incarnaare you worried your voice wont be heard concerning incarna expansionyou should be look at ccps track record concerning past expansions they like to generate pr buzz then move on to their next great idea incarna needs to mean something to the players i personally hope that it will evolve into something outstanding each station having the potential to be its own community where commerce and socializing thrives this wont happen without a strong voice telling ccp what the players want from this content i can be that individual for you i will focus solely on the concerns of empire dwellers as a member of csmthrough my seven years of playing eve online i have sampled every play style imaginable most recently i was heavily involved in nullsec life but that is no longer i have since returned to empire where mission running and other activities have taken up my time if you elect me you will have my full attention in making sure ccp hears your voice most of all i will work with my fellow csm delegatesthis past csm showed that a unified front among the delegates in how they approach is essential ccp will have a hard time ignoring players when their representation stands together and works well with each other vote for me and i shall do my best to bring your concerns to ccp

i fully support sir general of the windy pops
just 500mtrebor has a price pool of 12 billion isk scroll down to the yellow section
sorry mr lollipops but i cant vote for you because im voting the sansha kuvakei for csmyou are not good enough go learn politics from vuk lau p
well thats fantastic and i am glad that an established csm member has got that much isk to share the good news is that whilst he is paying out money to buy votes i am paying out to do pretty pictures so you do a picture for me and vote for him if you think having lots of isk makes him a good candidatethats the beauty of democracy
my vote is for sale for as little as 100m iskits a nice vote that has gotten plenty of exercise and is in good conditionplease transfer me the isk in advance of the electionin case of multiple payments the highest one will get the voteif theres a tie a vote will be chosen randomly amongst the highest payers
dammit i was going to write that oh well my vote can be bought for as low as 9999999998 isk
moved to jita park from eve general
i have two campaign promises 1 somehow i will stop hep from posting2 i will get a point on a dev much like i did to dbrbvote for change death to supercaps death to the mittani
this man is a poster amongst postersa man who both lives to post and posts to live
yes my second campaign promise is to post a lot
see im already ing doing it and i havent even been elected yet
also i barely play this game but 15 bucks a month is nothing so i keep this account active im not even a lawyer its just not a lot of money jesus
im just posting because im imagining my avatar just told your avatar that he has a big tool ready for him and your avatar is now all nervous
thats a really good question and im happy to answer iti feel like the new avatars are a really good change but my first action as president will be for full body shots because honestly who is looking at faces i bet you have a tight body
speaking of fitness what is your stance on exercise equipment in stations as soon as the much anticipated walking in stations is completed my favorite part of grand theft auto san andreas was having carl hit the weights i love to feel the burn even though im not actually moving
i am a huge fan of exercise in videogames honestly when you have been playing for six or seven hours you need to take a break from the game pop in the station and play an exercise minigame so you dont get diabetesthis is my second campaign promise
well im sold death to supercaps death to mittani
in fact if you dont exercise in game your avatar will grow fat you will need to exercise in station for at least an hour a day or you will get a fat avatar
what happens if my avatar lets itself go for several months because i am not actively subscribed ohdear
congestive heart failure
or his hangar goes kaboom and the janitors have to clean it up
will you use your position on the csm to improve the quality of the eve online forums
group market orders
i dont see the issue you are describing one of the very basic mechanism that makes eve work and which  among other things  enables it to actually have a feasible and more or less working botting derivative influx being an issue economy as a derivative of player interaction everything moves in cycles what goes up also comes down due to interdependancies and simple human behaviouror is this some sort of fear argument maybe if you thinking getting ganked is bad and not part of eve then i will fix that for you  something along those lines i honestly dont get it
im sorry but you seem to be completely clueless in regard to not only the csm process but some fairly fundamental ideas and mechanics of eve online i cannot support this bid but i wish you the best of luck
so as you all know i am schalac i am throwing my hat into the ring for csm because i feel the little guy has been forgotten in all this need for numbers race that is eve today i also feel that fw could be a lot better and i know how to fix it first off we need bubbles in lowsec bubbles you say yes there are many ships that can deploy and make great use of bubbles they should not be 00 only if concord doesnt want to police lowsec for whatever reason we should be given the ability to do so ourselves second is fw plexes they mean nothing right now so lets work together to make a fw plex system that would get pilots interested into doing them which brings me to 3 make state ships obtainable only to generals in the fw loyalty point store but to make sure they are not widely used make them bind to character when they receive them which brings me to 4 remove npc corps from fw militia should be exactly what a militia is the term militia pronounced mlU026A1 is commonly used today to refer to a military force composed of ordinary citizens2 to provide defense emergency law enforcement or paramilitary service i feel that npc corps are state run and should not be apart of fw if you want the goodies then join a player corp involved with fw and go for it this would also serve as a natural deterrent to spys as all people inside of the militia would now be open for wardecs if they are thought of as such so vote schalac csm and i will push to have those main issues brought up at all costs and i am also open to listen to others complaints about eve and lets make this the best mmo out there for the next 50 years
so um what are you planning on doing about all this breaking in at night and fixing it yourself ignoring your constituents concerns and pushing your own agenda regardless following incredibly simple instructions and posting in the forums where things belon oh wait
what is this structure you speak of
no bubbles in low sec plz
congratulations are in order
please elaborate
well you managed to show your complete incompetence in this thread that definitely deserves a congratulation or two
i am also running for president of the united states of america in 2016 that will be the first election that i am eligible to run in and i have my original pa state seal pressed birth certificate in my possession for all to see if such a question arises
i hope you have alot more smarter ideas then what you posted or else your not going to do well1 bubbles in low sec would cause the already low population to decrease even more lowsec is under populated as it is because of choke points which allow people primarily pirates to camp adding bubbles will only make this easier and restrict even more potential traffic2 this is true the fw plex system is horrible however its not the plex system per say that needs to be changed its the whole fw system focusing solely on fixing fw plexes wont fix fw3 bop and boebind on pickup bind on equip this is eve not wow its not like ranking in fw is even a special thing or hard its all about plexing and whoring lp in a sb see point 2 this doesnt do anything to fix fw4 iam guessing you are wanting this done because of spies even so eliminating npc corps greatly reduces the chance of people actually getting into fw it may surprise you but a lot of player corps suck and because of this there are alot of people who refuse to join them so forcing the issue isnt the answer and will only cause less numbers in fw then what there already isafter doing those rebuttals im really starting to hope that you are a troll if not you need to sit back and really think about what would be best for eve in general and not what would be best for you
youd fit right in go for it
moved to jita park from eve general
then people need to buck up and bring a fleet worth a damn to low sec fixing the plex mechanism will do loads for fw more people would do them and more fights would happen over contested systems sure it does if you make plexing the way to get those lp and standings instead of easily soloable by sb level 4 missions as it stands t3 ships make you lose sp when you die in them why not make the best of the best ships in a faction bind to the person that purchases them from the lp store you already need a nexus chip to buy faction ships just expand on that idea and make up a cerebral link chip that is linked to the character that buys the state ship and only they can fly it becausethe state only trusts those with outstanding credentials to possess a ship with such power those numbers will be there to fight though not run missions all day to fund their alt fw should not be the easy isk faucet for 00 drones that it currently is no you need to quit thinking about what is best for you and wake up eve is supposed to be a cold harsh place for us pod pilots if you want to get into fw it should be the same not the isk faucet that it currently is where there is 300 people in mil chat and only a dozen or so are actually there to be in fw and the rest are certifiable opposition isk making mission runners most of which are in npc corps and the player controlled corps are held hostage by a person reporting fleet movements because if we shoot the known spy we risk huge faction standings and the possibility of being thrown out of militia because of it
there are some fairly good ideas in here but theyre incredibly vague also the faction warfare aspect while indeed in dire need of a rethink is a minuscule part of the game arguably because its in dire need of a rethink and without fleshing out your views on more wideranging issues which i fear you omitted because you dont know what youd attempt to do yourself i cant support this bid i do however wish you the best of luck in your campaign

id rather have something like the new one but more akin to the one they have in battlestar galactica where its a bright flash of light that goes from the fore to aft part of the ship
obviously
100 to recharge time means the recharge time will go to 0 and cap will recharge instantly or crash the node with a div0 errorbut its a good start for fixing cloaks something which should include more then just this change which focuses on supercaps
i can support the cap reduction if its on capitals only shield regen is just stupidhere is why its a bad idea for subcapsexample i jump into system with my vaga with cloak gots are camping both gates but i managed to run the first one now they got more people i cloak up in scan range of both and wait for my chance 10 min later i have no shield or capacitor when the camps have shrunk and so1 i cant warp to gate because i wont have cap for the whole warp2 i cant burn once i get on other side3 i have no shields even if they all leave i will be so angry while i sit twiddling my thumbs for 10 minutes waiting for my shields to come back i cant cloak and wait for it either so i ahve to pay attention this is also a soloer nerf so no i dont support it unless you change a few things
hes not proposing to make cloaking drain capshields just that it stop them recharging while the cloak is active  if you cloaked up with say half cap and 60 shields youd still be at half cap and 60 shields when you decloaked thats all
id want even more radical changes to cloaks but this is a good enough step
ah ok sorry if i misunderstood then i dont mind
i support it just hope the spacetime continuum stuff is ok with it too
seems like a practical and sensible approach to minimising lag and making the game playable in large fleet fights supported
firstly minmatar boats have plenty ehp the only reason they have less ehp and rely on speed to stay alive is because everyone shield tanks their canes these days and its obvious that theyre not meant to be shield tanked 4 mids  if you armor tank a cane youll get a lot more ehp youre still reasonably fast and youll either out dps a harbinger or you can use your utility slots to fit neuts and ruin his daysecondly kiting needs to be nerfed its become the end all and be all tactic of everyone in low sec everyone uses it cynabals canes drakes hell even harbingers are shield tanked these days it seems though not as often the only way someone can compete with short range guns these days is to make sure they can hit inside point range and even then with faction points or loki boosts thats impossible because of increased point range buffing gall ships so that they can actually fit an armor tank and still catch things would actually bring some of this back into line because you couldnt keep your ships out of scram range continually i believe it should be a challenge to scram people too but not the impossibility it is nowadays
nanofits abound because faction warfare idiots routinely bring 5 bcs and a couple of falcons to fight soloists the problem is youalso ive never had issues catching or disengaging from kiters in my armor ships try not sucking
while i agree that you can blame the blob mentality of most people to some amount for it it isnt actually a fw only problem it is a increasing trend over all lowsec since the beginning of 2009 basically qr backfired by requiring nanoing even more as before since dumped close range efficiency for solosmall gang pvpersoutside of frig pvp and since they are hard to catch this way the predator adeptsimilar situation as before qralso i hardly got away against 5 nano drakes and a cane yesterday doing 1270 ms with my pest1800 after overload ended up around 120km off the last guy that warped in in any armor fitted cruiser bc bs you would have been mostly toastyou can ofc state that armor fits stand a chance but if most serious fits are build around catching and fighting nanoed targetsthat are everything but paper thin different to pre qr hacs this days you rapidly running into situations where you fail to catch targets but become a easy one for most others at the same time
this is what the problem currently ispreqr nanos were balanced they were surely fast but to gain their speed they had to sacrifice their dps and hp heavily this principle no longer works to get a nano ship these days you fly faction ship or minmatar boat but they have same hp and dps as your slow boatthe game is broken in this regards and needs to be fixed nano ships are definitely good thing but needs to come with drawbacks
the entire gallente subcap line of ships is broken hybrids are broken the ships are too damn slow blasters and rails require far too much fitting to make any setups viable i flew gallente for a year but as of today ive completed my crosstrain to minmatar and havent flown a gallente nonfrig noncapital ship for a year
i think the solution lies in lowering the relative pgcpu cost on hybrids either increasing the max grid of the ships or reducing fitting on these weapons would be a good place to start the other porblem lies in teh speed of these ships i propose a small speed increase across the board to gallente blaster shipsanother problem i see has to do with the trade off for a substantial drone bay if you take a look at the brutix or the thorax compared to their matari counterparts you will see 1 slot and hardly any more drone bandwidth i believe the solution would be to increase the drone bay on many of these gallente ships i do not think that a drone bandwidth increase would be a good idea as dps potential may become skewed matari ships operate outside of web range and have superior speed lending itself to kiting amarrian ships have long range high deeps guns that again are very effective outside web range gallente ships do not have any significant advantage when compared to these ships even if they get in web range it is for this reason that gallente blaster ships should have increased versatility that a larger drone bay would provideincrease drone bay on the thorax and brutix by 25m3 not bandwidth and the hyperion and megathron by 50m3 again not bandwidthdecreasing fitting req on all medium and large blastersincrease speed on thorax by 25ms and brutix by 20msgive brutix 1 more low slot
gallente cruiser and battlecruiser blasters boats  very poor range severe tracking issues at range badworse reload ammo time single type damage cap using weapons meh base speed meh agility badworse signature radius of their class very strong fitting issues default tank profile that cripples ability to fieldapply damage worse tank bonus when presentfor what  a mere 10 paper dps advantage youll never really see in practise unless fighting unaware or lesser experimented pilots supported
interesting idea might give more people a reason to go to low sec it should include anomalies in low sec as well since it is basically the same risk
sensible ideaedit and supported to boot
i agree that it makes kind of sense to remove sec gain from 00 rats its lawless space so why would empires care if you kill something there in similar way i dont see why incursions would give concord lp in 00 its infested with sanshas anywayother than that i do think whole criminal mechanics in eve really needs overall oomph in long term because if you do crime in hi sec you get major security hit and you will be blown up by concord now if you cannot get security status up fine but you still need to get to hi sec to pirate stuff srs
logic and reason from a pirate the world must surely be on its last legs need to scale up gain as rats are smaller and system security higherpreferably with an added complimentary system affording chance of achieving same gain as ratting but without the need to sweep a bazillion systemsex concord agents in space 1 per constellation or so giving out beacononov missions to destroy xx pirate lair
i like this idea
no thank you
1nerf it to the ground  take a look at cynabal too they are making plex fights a joke
sounds reasonable
comparatively cynabal is p much fine slightly better than vaga in some areas slightly worse in others imho so little better that balancing by price does work there atm fw being permabroken is a different subject d they should have tweaked the plex entry rules with the faction ship boost no
also put faction ships with their t2 equivalents in fw complexes instead of with t1
the dramiel ruined frigate pvp
i would be really happy to see ccp do something about the dramiels they really are an issue nothing else go podcat
nerf dram boost burst
you forgot to gief support
posting in an ephemeron makes himself look stupidthreadalsoexcellence
speaking of which the whole tier system for frigs and bcbs etc should go and ships rebalanced and we would suddenly get 3 times the number of useful ships to play with instead of adding new ones totally different issue tho and a lot of effort for ccp to pull off
completely agree
so basically op wants to change dramiel into a firetail with fitting issues where you pay 40mill for 2 dronesfor the sake of balance not supporting
still loads faster and for the sake of balance
badger  dramielsupported ofc would be nice if flying something other than a dramiel was an option again
no the speed he describes in the op is exactly what firetail does under web with faction ab a pirate faction frigate should offer something over a navy faction frigate dont you think
like say 20 more dps plus more speed and substantially better agility you mean
obviously not speed if you read the op on the damage output id be sold if it was fully turret based and agility does tend to rapidly diminish in actual value once you reach a certain base tresholdas lined out in the op it wouldnt be worth the pricetag given the alternative is less than half the price for 90 the performanceed i can see the scanres nerf argument tho and probably dropping 5mUFFFD drone bandwidth but thats pretty much it
ohnerf dram boost burst and i gif support
no tick box when poastingand shut up lilith and give support we all know the changes wont go in as is  if you agree the dram needs toning down please do it with any and all disclaimers youd like
op is kind of contradictory on speed the suggested 20 speed nerf would still leave it as the fastest ship in the game it just wouldnt be doing 1 kms while webbed eft warrior time current speed with a heated gistii b ab under a 60 web 1073 ms with a 20 nerf that falls to 858 ms a firetail with the same heated ab under the same web does 768 mstheres plenty of room to cut its speed down to a more reasonable value without knocking it off its perch
yes i know it will not go in like that so why on earth would i support it if you want support line out something reasonable and ill be glad to tick that boxim definitely not supporting something like this and put a comment that nobody reads anyway on page 3 for what its worth what i would support in the proposal is explained in my comment that has to be enough
i dont get why so many people cannot grasp the idea of itemship balance by costsupplythat idea is already fundamental part of this game as we accept existence of t2 and t1 as something normal even tho t2 is superior to t1 in every way we accept the existence of meta 6 modules that are clearly overpowered only because the supply is limited and the cost is highyet when it comes to adjusting game balance by manipulating supplycosts people hit a brick wall in their head its all around you and yet you are unable to see it
dramiel pilot detected ojust admit that you will be rly butthurt if someone touches your dram with dirty hands a faction frigate should not be the best  overpowered in most of the roles it may fit into it should be uniqueoverpowered   uniquesee the differenceedit ephemeron you dont need to fit your ship in a special way when fighting a t2 fitted  t2 ship also who told you that its normal for a frigate to be able to fit dual prop full tank guns and everything just like that enough cap for intensive mwd use pgcpu restrictions anyone lol  try fitting a slicer and see the cpu wall that you will hit there is no best ship in eve and yet dram pilots think that they should screw frigate pvp because they are used to the way the ship is in the moment and btw the dramiel costs like 40 mil or so more than an empirefaction frigate for that little difference in price the performance boost looks a bit too much compared to the t1t2 difference that is like 35 most of the time
i read over this post and i have to agree this would certainly help balance things out quite a bitgood job and i hope this goes somewhere
well that sounds pretty much exactly like the values i wanted the firetail is also worse on all other stats and it sounds more like it gets close to the firetail when you compare webbed speeds its still 6290 ms vs 5400 using mwds which is a hefty difference basic cy1 zor implants and no speed mods on the ships before nerfing speed that dram did 7860msby knocking the dram below 1ks ab it means other abweb only ships can control range on a dram without a web of its own like it is now one of the reasons this change is needed you shouldnt have to use dual webs and ab to range control another ships standard fit of the same classalso the dram has drones and will have more dps as well so it will still be the best general frig pretty much just not untouchable
remove plx
ah the two week old main with combat experience no kills no losses no character named loirethe char in game name loire has been in an npc corp for the entirety of its time in game all three of the chars whose names even start with loire have been in npc corps for their entire time in evebelieve it or not pointing out that other people are trolling is not in fact trollingi know whod a thunk itas for your logical fallacy i dont have to show why any feature is totally okay or whatever youd like to challenge those who are arguing for changes have to show why they require changes thats the beauty of the burden of proof and of course why youre trying to shift the burden of proof and youll pardon me for not believing how honestly you want to debate the issue your very first comments were trolling me with the lie that ive called everybody who simply disagrees with me a troll youve continued trolling me in the very post im responding to now doesnt exactly build confidence is all
pretty much thispeople asking for jump bridge removal but no one is capable to formulate why and provide reasonable analysis of what is wrong and how jump bridge removal is a solution to presented issueforce projection  is nonissue higher mobility of forces is definitely good asset as it provides dynamics in 00 warfareability to control large areas  is not depending on jump bridge network it is purely depending on fleet strength you controlso again can anyone put some coherent reasoning why jump bridges should be removed
i believe there is a fundamental misunderstanding of the situation in your post the burden of showing that bridges should stay with tweaks or indeed at all is on people that want them staying for arguments as to why they should go you need but to read this thread it helps if you skip finnys posts the tldr version of them comes down to my opinion is facts and those that disagree are trolls the csm minutes
fleet strength odd way of referring to blob size but whatever floats your pod is greatly diminished when the individual has to exert effort to join itbridges allow spurofthemoment fleets of several hundred people which completely negates any sort of surprise fail spies do exist resulting is excessive blobbing 99 of the timethe intended geographical restrictions upkeep costs is made void when one can cherrypick systems regardless of distance and connect them with bridgesforce projection through bridges is only good for established entities the larger the better numbers and size they provide not only defensive but offensive ability as well  the wider the network the more areas can be reachedonce set up bridges afford security that surpasses that of highsec every node is a heavily armed fortress and very rarely does one need to leave the network especially when they are spammedbridges allow for easy access to highsec hubs making any sort of investments in the motherlands infrastructure beyond isk generation redundantneed morein short bridges have allowed nullsec the frontier the badlands the outback to become highsec ver 20 better security faster travel and less work required to make a living 
if you want to remove jump bridges it is you who is invoking the changes thus it is you who have to come up with reasoning without reasoning there is nothing to argue about as the purpose of the changes is not presentedtwo wrongs do not make one right and again argumentum ad populum is fallacious reasoning i might be old fashioned but i do not think it is fine to base changes on flawed reasoning
must be late your reading comprehension is going i gave you the reasoning twice already relevant quote and url but what the hell there you can have it one more time now with friendly boldingthank you for ascribing me the glory and status that come with a job at ccp but i assure you that i am not ccp greyscales alt
post with your main just like you dont understand what an analogy is you have no idea what the burden of proof is hint youre performing the logical fallacy known as shifting the burden or proof currently there are bridges you want there to be no bridges your whim is not proven and people who oppose you dont have to support why things shouldnt change they just have to refute your claims this is shockingly basic trolling by lying isnt a particularly smart way to troll trolling by lying and then complaining that youll be called out for trolling even less soanybody who wants to can read over the thread and see the actual arguments and logic ive used which you continually lie about and try to handwave away yet never actually answer as for the troll about zomg bridges the fact that the maps are only scare tactics for those who have no facts has been shown the actual effect of bridges have already been shown and you lied and trolled on that point and called the facts opinions because you have no other option having no real argument both are lies you claimed that 40 accounts out of 200000 is a consensus youre also claiming that 1 dev spitballing and not even stating an definite course of action let alone ccps official position is where ccp wants to go this is at least a tiny bit better than your lie that ccp claimed that jbs were not working as intended andor were an exploitmore lying and trolling from you quick claim its not because youre lying to troll but because you simply disagreeyouve been lying about that single point for about a dozen posts now letting children crayon draw ships was an analogy for why something could be a bad idea even if it didnt impact gameplay and was in response the troll that i should support removing jbs since the lie went i said they do nothing at all to effect gameplay at the time you pretended not to know what an analogy was and lied saying that i was changing the subject you know this and the fact that you keep lying about it in order to troll shows what your argument and your protests that youre only identified as a troll due to disagreeing are worth post with your main alt trolland stop lying there are no half an hour of jump bridges you are lying again even the very eastern tip of nc space all the way to the heart of fountain saw something like a 1520 minute decrease due to jbs not to mention that all your ignorant babbling about jbs has already been refuted those are the arguments youre ignoring andor lying about in order to avoid in case youre confused but since youve never actually been in a 00 fleet you have no idea how they work you are lying in order to troll again on a point that has been debunked a dozen times again the actual fact was that altering game mechanics to break playercreated politics breaks the sandbox not simply changing thingsbut you cant rebut it so of course youre lying people can count the number of times youve lied in order to troll in one post alone and make up their own minds as to whether or not youre being honest
join date 2006 part of a 3 member corp since you began playing sec status 51and apparently zero kills zero losses yeah you know a lot about nullsec wars as it happens even before jbs were invented there were coalitions and blobs ah yes bridges that work regardless of distance you sure are knowledgeable about bridges and 00 war what other sage advice do you have indeed people are ganked by dictors working in concert with bomber wings all the time in highsec yep in addition to the bridges that have no range limits and your five years never leaving a carebear corp what other insights do you have about nullsec war cant disagree with someone without trolling them eh as it happens that bit of bull has already been addressed and debunked a subjective belief that life is too easy is not proof for all your trolling about facts and opinions youd think youd have the basic understanding that a subjection opinion about what is too easy is not a fact one thinks you might also note the inherent contradiction in trying to make eve fun again by making a large part of it as unfun as you can manage to say nothing about the fact that even if we were to pull back from allowing everybody in the game to conduct logistics without spending all night playing the game like its their job that doesnt mean that bridgesjfsetc have to totally be eliminated your argument is simply a mass of logical fallacies that one by the way is called bifurcation or excluded middle no but you are a blatantly obvious alt troll what are you afraid of the fact that you wont even use your real character you lie constantly and youre trolling people who disagree with you shows how confident you are in your actual argument post with your main
i do not see how making the game to become a work is beneficial in any way howeverlack of surprise attack upkeep costs and cherrypicking fortress systems  those are flaws and attributes of failed sovereignty revamp you cannot surprise anyone if there is no selection of objectives to fight for and cherrypicking and fortress systems is the result of utilizing space  you only claim the space you use that was the driving albeit flawed idea behind sov changesjump bridges are beneficial only to those who operate themwell that isnt really surprising is it it has no impact on ability of new entities venturing 00 i think that is quite obvious  in case you were implying soyour raised concerns arent related to jump bridges at all and their removal isnt addressing anything of what you would like to see changed the issue is how sovereignty and territory management workssome of the concerns raised in this thread or even cms minutes might be addressed by changing certain game mechanics  ie jump bridge network disruption but most importantly nothing said so far implies that jump bridges should be removed that would be unjustified and reasoning lacking stupid game change
that isnt a reasoning that is a statement and opinion
i dont think you know the meaning of the word lie either finny i am wondering whether you are truly this obtuse you do massive amounts of acid or whatall of your points were debunked repeatedly line by line quite a few pages ago by several peoplethe problem is that you are completely unable to accept reality over your little castle where you are right and everyone else is wrong liars and trolls which is why the consensus has largely moved to ignoring youdo you have anything to contribute other than the same debunked points double standards weasel analogies fallacies minigin was lol and tired memes post with your main troll really is the best you gotby the way the consensus of this thread is that they go of the similar thread on scrapheap is that they go the lack of outcry would indicate that nobody cares for them staying and really the post that started this was a rant against csm and a call to arms to let them and ccp know that the bridges should stay id say it didnt go as intendedas for shifting the burden of proof i am not the one making the changes although i must admit i support them and i would think that the people wanting ccp to change their mind should be the ones trying to do the convincing but maybe i am wrong who knowsi must say i find your reality shaping hilarious every time you post ccp grayscale becomes smaller and smaller i am sure that by next week he will have become some random irrelevant janitor at ccp who happened to be scrubbing the floors and chipped in according to youi must also say that i love how you state something and later reference yourself and your opinion as if it was a fact werent you asked for actual numbers a few pages back to back basically anything you said and you have failed completely thats what i thoughtccp doesnt liethe maps dont liethe empirical evidence of the ease and mobility of force projection and unused territory in the hello kitty land of 00 doesnt liei guess that only leaves youby the way any argument or lack thereof is enhanced greatly by gratuituous memes and the word troll dont be shy with it it adds readability and power to your posts
remove bridges for blue status at least they can stay within same alliance perhaps i remember when i started playing eve and we would do big convoys of freighters and defenders through hostile space to move stuff it was very scary and very fun jump bridges arent fun and make disrupting logistics hard eg its a small gang nerf
speed nerf hurt the small gang warfare pretty good example how important force mobility is and how force projection works
yes you are trolling with an obvious alt and you should post with your main not sure whats difficult about that for you more trolling again people can look over the last post of your in which i pointed out what a half dozen lies and judge for themselves a lie is of course something youre saying which isnt true and you know it isnt true this is also a lie not only were many of the facts not addressed by people but those who tried to debunk them used spurious objections this is why youre lying and claiming they were rebutted rather than actually citing them again people should look to the last post where i pointed out many many of your lies and realize that you are not a source who can be believed especially without a link readers will note that shes gone from the consenus to the consensus of the players to well okay 40 not necessarily individual accounts in this thread fallacy of appeal to ignorance that we dont know what people actually think herebeyond 40 notnecessarily individual and several obvious alt trolls is used to pretend that we really know what nobody thinks also predictably you are using blatant hypocrisy the whole 40 notnecessarilyindividual accounts who oppose jbs are hardly an outcry either but youre trolling so you dont have to remain logically consistent yet another basic logic fail let me put it really really simply dont worry im sure that youll pretend that you dont understand and troll on this point later the null hypothesis is the status quo the null hypothesis must be falsified in order for a change to be accepted as valid the burden of proof lies on those who are trying to falsify the null hypothesis the null hypothesis has not been falsified so the reasoning behind those pushing changes has not been supported this is why youre trying to shift the burden of proof lying and trolling because you have got nuthin more trolling you were caught lying and first claimed that ccp said that bridges were not working as intendedwere an exploit caught in that lie you claimed that greyscale was speaking for all ccp when in fact he was just spitballing not speaking on behalf of all ccp and not even making an official pronouncementyou cannot address these facts so youre lying about what was actually said no thats just you lying again seriously anybody curious should check out her last post where she lied something like a half dozen times with some really obvious whoppers and still hasnt retraced a single lieyes theyre correct and they show youre wrong which is why you refuse to show what you actually knowcan prove about nullsec war and why youre posting on an alttroll account post with your main again readers should look over rafias posts and see how frequently she lies in order to troll and then wonder not only at her credibility but why shes trolling so often and then using the fact that shes being called out as a vindication of her position and why she post with an alt troll not her main
so in short youll use whatever nonsensical reason like lolkb stats you chose in order completely ignore common sense and logic  troll you are not because a troll has purpose  you just dont know any betterps if you must know try exchanging first name with veshta  also lol at 18k kills with less than 100 losses blob much  see any fool can pull nonsense out of his ass quite right but bridges serve to exasperate the problems inherent in that flawed system upkeep was obviously meant to keep sizes down but the ability to bypass unwanted systems entirely subverts that intentblobs have almost always existed but their ability to move in complete safety across the entire map is a much more recent development  one that coincided nicely with the introduction of bridgesnull empires were smallish coherent things comprised of an equal measure of carebears and combat pilots forming a blob was an exercise in planning and administrative prowess  enter bridges  security through the ability to move unhindered planted the seed of static empires and the boom in capital numbers which further increased the security  ad nauseumbridges and the highsec access they provide combined with titans in low completely removed the need to build anything on site and made basic mining largely obsoleteblobs are now formed by a single fleet advert with rally in a bridge system no planning and intelligence behind it  press a button and off you goso keep telling yourself that bridges have not had any impact and their removalchange has no merit
ah more trolling and oddly enough trolling where people just have to scroll up a few posts to see what the truth is your errors were pointed out and debunked on factual and logical grounds the fact that you also have no clue wtf youre talking about was also mentioned the fact that a carebear with absolutely no experience with combat or nullsec let alone nullsec combat wants to hold forth on it is just amusing your claims are wrong on the facts and logic however and youre trolling with an alt becausepost with your main assuming it is yours also good trolling about blobbing the word has literally no meaning other than a snarl why am i not surprised exacerbate and no they dont and now we again reach the fictional poi nt of the discussion blobs which means nothing at all other than grrrr can move in complete safety in fiction town in the actual game there are many ways to gank fleets especially if theyre moving by jb in a large group ah yes the well known bob carebear empire of course because before you had to say hey pilots click the fleet invite and get to the rally point but now they need to click fleet finder and get to the rally point its totally different
if you were to remove the jump bridges that will not remove blob warfare the fact is now instead of just lagging out a few systems with our 400 man fleet we lag every system from point a to point b lowsec pirate bodys will be overran by large alliances securing routes to highsec instead of having a 10 man pirate gang holding a lowsec gate you now have 70 man highly organized alliance fleets holding that same gate larger alliances will not recoil into their space but reach out for more to secure that route to highsec as for the risk free travel of jbs how many have used a jb and watched 3050 bombers decloak when you jump in and throw bombs at you raises hand
your 400 man fleet willing to take jump bridges will be a hell of a lot less willing to take gates due to effortoh and that bomber  camping bridges yeah once they are reported no one takes the bridge anymore and just has it rerouted or takes one of the many other bridges to just get around themyour argument on it making things worse is a joke also finnagain you need to shut the  up already you just keep making the argument to not mess with the jump bridges dumber and dumber in short your not helping the side to keep them ffs man you have spewed nonsense in this thread 84 times
yes bridges are quicker luckily that was never in doubt of course as coalitions waged war before jbs and coalitions can wage war now by deploying to a forward hq without any jbs as its in enemy territorylowsecnpc 00 your objection is spurious whats that a bomber gang can provide complete area denial and shut off entire arms of a jb network why sounds like a pretty effective counter i know i know its no fair your targets arent herded into your guns by ccp and they can take another route if you didnt camp that too ive also heard that if you have a camp on a gate your enemies can go through different systems too ccp should probably fix that ehgood trolling though on the number of posts ive made thats sure novel and intelligent now put on your big boy pants and actually refute the facts and logic involved
seeing as roth pulled the info from my post in another topic allow me to reiterate alliances will not stop fighting at distances just because it becomes less convenient also lets remember were wanting to change the jb structure or remove them in entirety rather than fix things that actually need to be fixed we had an alliance discussion over all of this several hours ago and between a group of people playing eve for varied amounts of time we have came to a conclusion that most of the people who want the bridges removed are either small pirate corps or highsec carebears what the pirate corps dont realize is they will not have room to operate once the jbs are removed as the large alliances will secure routes to highsec for supplies also highsec carebears will lose business if they are removed because the nullsec alliances will begin to manufacture their own equipment
why is anyone giving finn the pleasure he so apparently receives from playing the glenn beck of this thread and to you finn since when did you become like this ive read plenty of your posts that included great ideas fleshed out entirely coherently without once telling your detractors that they are lieing trolls i asked you for your opinion in a respectable fashion and still you refused is that because you have nothing left to say on the issue why are you so attached to jump bridges are you unable to play without them since you are so dependant on viewing my mains killboard wloire it doesnt seem to include all of my deaths because there were many or all of my kills but certainly i havent broken 1000 such as yourself i dont believe i need to match your combat record to have an opinion on the matter so how about it are you going to switch back to intelligent finn with good ideas because im still willing to hear you out
no and nor should they but there is a big difference between being able to cross the map attack and still have time to rat back home and then needing to first bring peopleships into position for an attackvery few the clinically insane  has said that removing bridges is all that needs to be done the industrial sector in null needs a hefty boost to create the potential for selfsufficiency and the ehp based sovereignty crap has to be changed into an objective based system or something else not blob requiredthe manufacturers in highsec are only there because that is where the market is why move when the whole cluster comes to jita on a daily basisthe miners and producers will move to null the second that changes but their has to be a reason for that moveps have fun trying to secure routes on any sort of permanent basis  lowsec is eve on hardmode and the nullsofties are in for a rude awakening if they think its going to be easy once the traffic increases so will the pirate population  it has dwindled substantially over the years but will spike like crazy if convoys come into play again i suspect it is the effort involved that makes null fear any bridge changes
yes despite you admit that the bridges are not a root cause of the issue yet you keep pushing the removal agenda i do not understand your desire to apply some pseudo bandaid instead of focusing on mechanics that needs improvementdo you even know what you are talking about here this is the least desired thing eve online needs as it would mean instant death of the gameremoving jump bridges would only cause more harm than good because it does not address any specific issue

bolded the relevant part but perhaps you are right perhaps it will be easier to die that is not the same as it will be easier to kill you maybe mechanics will be emplaced such that only the most dedicated focused individuals will ever even get the chance to gank you in hisec stations that sounds like a reasonable compromise to me breaking news empire scientists have invented an infotrope transmission system no larger than a credit card capsuleers rejoicein other words lore is a poor argument for or against any kind of mechanics in a game because the lore can be altered for that matter given that no plans have been released there is nothing to say that you would be killed in stations for all anybody actually knows there may be a mechanic in hisec particularly where emergency services personnel get to your clone before you die saving your precious implants and expensive cloneand again with the assumptions there are mechanics solutions to all of these issues but you dont seem to be able to see past omg risk not in my hisecif people want ccps efforts of the last 4 or so years toward incarna to be nothing more than a pretty chat interface then so be it i for one would like there to be some actual substance to itambulate safe o7
its not poker till your very presence can change the flow of the game
the not supported has been used here in assembly hall since day one when ccp added it to the forums because they forgot to add the thumbs down option honestly your just arguing just to argue just like in the jump bridge thread which isnt even a proposal just some guy who copy pasted something from the minutes you do realize that you argue nonstop with anyone who does not share your exact same view on thingsyour like a little child who is mad if someone doesnt agree with you you look for something else about them to try and insult grow up finnagain
i meant i had no clue as to what his point was his posts were full of sarcasm and general nonsense i have no problem with lore getting in the way and there will obviously need to be some wireless pod tech for dust 514as for the second part if your implants are saved then what is the point to combat in stationssame thing here if death out of the pod means you keep your clone somehow then theres no point to combat in the first place i am fine with risk in high sec it currently would take a lot of dedication for someone to suicide pod you and again this is all speculation but i fail to see how pulling a gun on someone in high sec would be anything but easy
hehe finn is obviously getting frustrated with people saying nuhuh no podpermadeath nuhuh people will elevator camp and the world will be ruled by spoongangs over and over againregardless what is the point of pvp anywhere the chance of losing your implants and clone is astronomically small in empire but people still suicide gank there i was not illuminating an actual mechanic merely pointing out that assuming any mechanics at this point is premature at bestspoon gangs scooping out implants is one end of the spectrum emts saving them is the other im trying to say there is no reason it has to be binary i am sure that a balance can be achievedyet keeping ones pod in empire space is by your own admission virtually guaranteed unless you stuff up or the other party shows an extreme amount of dedication by your own argument that makes empire pvp pointless yet it still occurs perhaps one loses a clone in station but your attache saves your implants that satisfies the infliction of loss on somebody while restricting said loss to an amount that risk averse people may be able to stomachpulling a gun on someone in empire space may well be easy who is to say that getting a gun into hisec stations will be we are the rockstar demiurges of space why wouldnt we have access to bodyguards or decoy clones yes we are fragile out of our ships why could that not be balanced by making the opportunities to shoot us take just as much dedication as suicidepoddingthere is a lot of potential for mechanics that would address the concerns of the riskaverse whilst still maintaining the possibility
if by that you mean i dont particularly enjoy trolling or rebuttals that have already been shown to be utterly hollow yah i dont accept those thats the whole point here the fact that nobody yet has offered something that hasnt already been shown to be false or trolling means that there arent any solid objections so far at least thats encouraging i know facts are hard to argue with thats part of why you can only get upset and cant find a way to show that a pvp game should have an entire sphere thats space second life or of course space barbie if people are only using it to play dressup naturally youre calling that fact trolling because again you cant actually rebut it but can only get angry at it i really wish that people who post about logical failings would actually know what they mean theres no circular reasoning inherent in the very clear set of facts and logical postulates ive laid out but if you dont have any valid arguments other than nuhn uhn i suppose that making up logical fallacies that dont actually exist in an argument is as good as any other tactic please tell me you realize the problem hereits already been addressed and debunked specifically in this thread several times iirc yes if you actually have a ship worth someone ganking its almost always more expensive to lose the ship and judging from the number of people who autopilot pods all over empire your claim on that point is wrong too to say nothing of the fact that again youre rationalizing objections based on assumptions if the concern was the cost of losing clones you could advocate stationonly insurance contracts on a clones implants or what have you instead of saying it shouldnt exist at all by people copying wow emotes guess what not supported works equally well its just funny that you cant even admit that basic fact is all my just his just their just youre arguing on the other hand because you cant actually rebut the facts or the logic involved so youre reduced to this ad hominem nonsense im arguing because ive laid out the logic involved to support positions i believe in yes how very unfair if someone doesnt agree with me i look at their arguments and their logic and deal with those how utterly unfairi suggest you write your government im sure thats banned under the geneva conventions
while its a bit annoying certainly frustrating to see the same trolling and the same debunked arguments used over and over again but it really is encouraging im looking at it like stress testing if the people whore getting so annoyed over the proposal could show how i was wrong they would that they cant is a good indicator
well the point of hi sec suicide ganking is either to grief miners or for loot drops from mission runners and haulers now you dont hear about many hi sec suicide poddings and probably because theres no isk to be made and because of the consequences so maybe that means not many people would actually do this in stations if they could who knows i feel like im going in circles here so my main point is this if there is any possibility that i would lose my clone in a station from a gank i would never leave my captains quarters unless i was in an implantfree stationwalking jump clone this is the same reason why i never fly around in a pod anywhere or fly around in a shuttle in low sec thats the only precaution that would actually work 100 of the time and jumpclones are not available to everyone doesnt that seem a little over the top players shouldnt have to grind standings just to be able to purchase a jump clone so that they can enjoy the content of incarna and if everyone is walking around in empty jump clones then whats the point of ganking them anywayin the end i doubt well be seeing this anytime soon if at all people arent going to put their clone on the line just to walk around to participate in a currently optional social interaction if clones are insured then why kill anyone you are hit with a security loss and your target loses nothing as for the pod comment is it not a safe assumption that a squishy human body would be easier to kill than a human body inside an armored pod
you can already lose your clone in all of nullsec easily in all of lowsec reasonably easily even in highsec if someone wanted to turn on a smartbomb after their mates suicided your ship so you already have a nonzero chance to lose your pod when you undock and yet that doesnt stop you your objection is spurious again we have insurance for ships why couldnt wis include instationonly insurance for implants besides which unless you have a head full of vs chances are losing a ship is nearly as expensive if not more so than losing a pod a pair of smartbombing battleships on a gate can easily pop and pod you in a shuttle a single smartbombing battleship can do it if he staggers his smarties are you going to stop traveling in a shuttle now you put your clone on the line each and every single time you undockyour objection is spurious if ships are insured why kill anyone i already mentioned in the mechanics thread that it might be possible to extract resources from corpses just like salvaging a wreck even if you couldnt you can still take isk away from a rival eve has insurance at 100 efficiency including the deductible ccp makes up the rules rather obviously if combat is balanced based on players being able to equip shields and suits of armor and weapons having certain characteristics theres nothing at all to say that station ganking wouldnt be very similar to taking down a tanked ship in space stop assuming things not proven by facts and then using those assumptions as if they were accurate and factual
this proposal is just bad and not just due to the ops attitude although the gbtwow bs towards people that disagree with him is amusingsimply put this proposal doesnt actually propose anything or address anything and it uses that lack of detail as a weapon to say well i didnt propose anything so how you think it might work is not how it will work i cant however tell you how it would work because i dunno lolwhile i would love for this to be implemented be functional and be awesome the reality is that games with divided focuses between ground and space combat tend not to end up very good sto not only that but it takes the focus away from where it should be spaceshipsis it really necessary to adapt the wod engine to have station combat that doesnt come out completely idiotic to the detriment of the actual focus of the game i dont think so what would it add if the reason is circular logic about how eve is a pvp game well eve is a game about spaceships if the argument is that the nature of eve should forever remain constant then it should be so in every aspect not only the convenient onesbut you cant even really say that its a pvp game and purely that because it has been moving away from that towards more pve and other content since it came out missions and incursions for instance are more pve than pvpin the end when thinking that ccps research development and programming time may go towards a half baked or possibly entirely awesome like pi on foot combat simulator instead of focusing on more t3 ships the missing subsystems more balance and more content in general for the game i actually pay to play today then i have to say i want them focusing on the laterif you want to gank on foot go play stonot supported
really pathetic trolling the op links to an entire thread where mechanics can be discussed several people have whined about that fact this thread was started on the advice of the csm chair in order to have an elevator proposal thread that didnt focus on mechanics which youd know if youd bothered to read the thread or its op for that matter so instead of having focus split on pvp in stations and space we should have pvp in space and second space life in stations and designing content for second space life wont shift focus away from spaceship combat unlike how ccp has already done and broken down with hard numbers showing that incarnawithoutcombat already occupies the lions share of devs compared to eves core content because um hey look over thereseriously i know you heard a term and dont understand it and think its cool but please for the love of basic reasoning find out what a term means before you use it in fact circular reasoning does not mean a fact thats used to support further arguments which are logically connected to it  which is about to have space barbie in it and should maintain its inherent dynamic in it rather than having centuries of manhours wasted on second space life no the argument is that eve core dynamic should exist in the massive major freakin huge new expansion thats coming down the pipeline but i support a strawman works for you if you cant address the actual argument yes you can because it is pvp is the engine that drives the entire game and even while youre pveing you can be ganked there is no safe space there are no pve servers there is one server and one server only and its a pvp server fallacy of the excluded middle ccp can focus on iterating on incarna and fix things that are wrong with the game right now theyre devoting almost all of their resources to incarna anyways we might as well make sure that they iterate on it rather than letting it rot on the vine
oh wowi guess not supporting your terrible proposal and clearly stating the reasons why is really pathetic trolling i think you need a dictionary or a visit to the friendly search box on the upper right corner of the page and to start looking up wordsor to spend more time on your terrible proposal and less time posting
yet more trolling lets ignore your lie about what constituted trolling shall we lets look at what was actually said and not your clearly stating reasons we can ignore your bit about how pvp in a pvp game is terrible here ill underline the relevant parts so yah i see that rather than retracting your trolling youve just decided to compound it trolling on my eveo forumsim shocked shocked
given this thread is about whether pvp should be included in incarna or notseems kind of contradictory
the chance of someone ganking your ship in high sec is more or less zero as long as you dont autopilot around in a hauler with 1 billion in cargo the chance of losing your pod there is even less as for low sec if you know what youre doing then your pod is safe i recently spent about 23 weeks doing solo pvp in frigates and against frigates and i never lost my pod once obviously the risk is higher so i used a less expensive clone the same goes for nullsec  preparation and common sense goes a long way i ratted solo in null sec in hostile territory for about a week or so and never lost my pod or even my shipnow its been a while since ive read through the earlier parts of this thread but i just did again i was going to post a sarcastic comment about all of us walking around in iron man suits with a shield generator slapped onto our backs but apparently you already thought of that seriously how does that make any sense instead of everyone needing to walk around in their own personal tanks wouldnt it be easier for station security to ban weapons airport security is extremely tight as it is now it makes no sense that stations would even allow weapons even if we had wireless pod tech again i havent read the beginning of this thread in a while so i forgot you mentioned this insurance on implants and extracting implants seems to work at first glance but im not convinced for one thing it injects more isk into the economy like ship insurance already does plus theres a chance that the insured item isnt even lost more importantly im still having problems seeing the logic in this whole situation but whatever
no its nonzero even through simple random chance from someone looking for lulz your objection that you wouldnt participate in something that had any chance of clone loss is a rationalization just like how you use a shuttle in lowsec when a single battleship firing staggered smarties on a gate can pop and pod you a notuncommon occurrence in lowsec to say nothing of the fact that its simply not true that youre guaranteed safety for your pod in lowsec a lag spike bad session change timer whatever and youre podded again you claimed you wouldnt engage in a behavior if there was any chance that youd lose your pod you are again making the worst possible assumptions and then using your fabrications to argue as if they were facts for all we know shield generators could be the size of a credit card and armor can be fibreweave into normal clothing the fiction argument has already been raised and rebutted in the very first post of this thread in fact more to the point ccp has said that people can smuggle even crude explosives onto stations theres no gameplay mechanic that demands that combat on stations be impossible because it doesnt make sense if its fun and if it adds to the core content of eve thats all the sense that has to be made again worst possible assumption that you treat as fact maybe possession of weapons is totally banned on certain decks and you have to try to conceal them much as you do boosters in highsec insurance does not inject isk into the economy insurance minimizes isk lost to sinks like pvp someone had to pay for the ship youre insuring and you simply lose less of that investment when it pops and is insured
ok i thought this over and have decided that i do support this after allgame impacting content as opposed to just another shopping mallmaybe the ability to run an operation to shut down the stations defenses for a brief time something that should require a large team to infiltrate multiple securitysectors and hack the gibson to accomplish giving their corpmates waiting outside in their ships just enough time to do one heinous crime to somebody near the stationor allowing them to disrupt the npcconvoy schedule until concordsupport arrives and no instawarping here maybe other npcs in the system could then try to hire other players to fend off the culprits until the cavalry arrivesmeanwhile in the station npcs would hire anyone to storm the defensecenters call on the militia hand out weapons etcjust brainstorming here there are plenty of carebears out there that would be willing to partake in such a limited pvp especially if systemwide trading is affected
oh and think of how this could affect mission runningUFFFD fly out to the deadspace complexUFFFD kill all the rats in the areaUFFFD actually board kruuls pleasure hub tmUFFFD run through a maze of corridorsUFFFD fight your way past the body guardsUFFFD spend minutes trying to convince the damsel to flee with youUFFFD eventually just knock her out  carry her back to the shipUFFFD free some amarr prostitutes on the wayUFFFD undock  fight the reinforcementsUFFFD warp back home  drop off that useless trampUFFFD party with the hookersedit come to think of it this could also be played more along infiltrating the hub bondstyle fighting kruul inside with an awesome getaway scene at the endand then theres the furriermission something nightmarish along avplines but way cuter
heh see a whole lot of potential content is opened up once we leave space barbie behind and decide that incarna should be more than second space life
 update with the new dev blog by ccp zulu  shader model 20 support discontinued april 5th  we are finally given the info that we needed regarding this matter apparently shader model 30 is needed for the cc and is apparently the reason why many of us cant access the cc the grace period has been extended for another couple of months which should give us plenty of time to upgrade our systems there are still other issues with the cc but this is a start i originally withdrew this proposal without giving it any thought a new post below got me rethinking that decision subsequently i am not withdrawing this proposalsince the expiration of the grace period for creating a new portrait is drawing near i figured it was time to bring this issue to the assembly hall the issuethere are still many many players who cannot access the character creator and when the grace period expires they myself included will be locked out of the game there have been many suggestions posted here in the forums in numerous threads and more given by ccp support in answer to petitions but most only work for a very few lucky players i know ive tried them all over and over again in various combinations as has most everyone else at this point and ive even tried some of my own experiments but nothing works even though i can play eve with most graphic settings on highthere are also many who can access the cc but with limited capabilities once they have it loaded and finally there are those who just refuse to use the cc because they dont like the results the lack of options etcccp is aware of the issue but has been more or less silent on it and has given no indication that they are even investigating the matter let alone working on a fixthe proposalmy proposal is to add an option on the character creation popup window in the character selection screen which asks if you want to enter the cc to create a new portrait the option would be to use a randomly generated portrait relevant to your characters race bloodline and gender without entering the character creator this option would come with the following caveatwarninguse of this portrait will expire when incarna is launched you will have one redo available to create your own portrait at any time before that launch at the launch of incarna you will be required to create your own fullbodied character or you will be unable to log into eve until such time as you doare able to create your new avatar through the character creatorprosno one gets locked out of eve due to this glitcheveryone has at least a few months until the incarna launch to either upgrade their current hardware or buy a new systemccp doesnt lose any customers besides those affected by the sse issueconsthis will almost guarantee that ccp will not look for a fixwe may end up having some really crappy portraits for a few monthsthe problem will still be there until systems are upgraded or replaced and some will undoubtedly procrastinate and get lockedout at the incarna launchif you do agree with this please dont forget to tick the support checkbox along with your reply

the best option is for ccp to fix the cc performance problems but i suspect the issue is that the demands it makes are simply an order of magnitude to great and unfixable by straight forward code optimisationfwiw i feel your pain i can run the two instances of the game with high quality setting for textures and shading but i can only run one instance of the cc and have to use the lowest quality settings other wise it become unresponsiveunless ccp have something in the pipeline they are not talking about that improves cc performance they need to follow this proposal
i can see this is going to take some doing to get the ball rolling here most players affected by this have more or less given up checking the forums because there has been no response from any devs on this matter even though the announcement has not come out yet it is bound to be near even if you arent affected by this your support would be greatly appreciated locking players out of the game for a feature that currently does not affect gameplay is not fair to anyone especially since those same systems can run the game with no issuesive written a post under my other accounts main character  spyke blackice in my blog  mortal immortals which goes into more detail on this issue
these small factions in general are residents to easy access npc 00 while bigger factions live in harder to access npc 00 compare mordus and guristas for example in that way it makes sense that their lp stores are also less usefulfor those easy access npc factions in 00 everyone gets standing by making missions to related empire faction ie you do missions for caldari you get access to mordus agents tooso there is clearly some thought behind this except that npc 00 is less free area than probably originally intended because there is no sentry guns unlike low sec and you can use warp disrupt bubbles and smaller ships it takes more effort to move around which means you can make living in these npc 00 pockets pretty painful for anyone trying with relatively few peoplenot supporting cos lp stores are relatively fine
the problem with that is unless these lp items are worth it the items themselves not the lpmission or whatever nobody will live there outer ring has been historically empty because its just not worth living there every place in eve should have advantages and disadvantages missions have disadvantages and orand syndicate and npc pureblind all have terrible security status belt distribution and excepting pb terrible moons there should be some redeeming featuresplus theres no point having useless items in eve much less ones that are the only option in the store in the oresyndi store there are literally no useful items in mordusthukker its questionable regarding venaletc npc fountain is just as easy to get to as outer ring but has awesome rats and missioning for any corp with more than a capital or 2 logistics to anywhere in eve isnt really a problem
i agree with op and this
1 to this and op
1 i agree completely that it makes no sense if you refit armor plates in space your meter shows no difference if you refit shield extenders suddenly youre down 102 if its impossible to fix the shield issue due to underlying math how about making some slow trickle pos rr mods not enough to make it overpowering during a fleet battle or something but a module you approach activate and it shoop shoops your shields up make them cpu heavy so they go offline during a siegejust a thought 
so much this
i like thatbut as said before need more big billboards andor more of themcause if not people will continue using secure can as its free and more visible 
supported
i support some form of openspaceit should be possible to travel between systems without using gates just by flying at warp speed in direction of destination
learn to fly a capital jump shipissue resolved
nearest solar system to earth  alpha centauri  42 light years away1 light year  63241 au  alpha centauri  265612 au awaycovops frig warp speed  135 aus  54 hours of constant warpt1 frig warp speed  60 aus  122 hours warpingfreighter warp speed  075 aus  984 hours warpingeve is already a big enough time sink imo
it should also be noted that this is like 7000 times the speed of light
10 minutes slower than using gates between systems40 jumps 10 minutes per jump 400 minutes go  yourself
i guess that is impossible to create new warp drives in game capable to reach enough speed to make interestal warpsoh wait
im trying to find a way to do it without flying capital shipsjust any shipand not only one what im talking about is to create lower security areas sorrounding the highways of stargatesis like leaving the road to fly cross country
first  i dont like it but thats just me psecond you dont create lower security space you create null sechisec space is defined by concord and sentries only those in low sec without those its just null secunless you put concord in there to monitor you killing someone else no one will give you sec status penalty third 10 minutes per jumphhmmmm no
perfect all opinios are welcome the security status if it is null sec or just a level lower than the systems is not the critilical point for me i think that it must be lower just to make this kinf of travel a little exiting but not as dangerous as passing thourgh some gates full of pirates its a detourtravelling thorugh gates are one warp and one jump opensace i think should be one warp a cap recharge and another warp its not 10 minutes rigth maybe one or two
optional
sorry i was being very vague srsi really only tried referring to their promise of incarna not impacting station performance negatively in any way so it should be fine either way
yeah this is another question on the census do you read dev blogs p
compulsoryall the station features should be quickly accessible from the captains quarters or balcony view its time for the current station interface to diecaptains quarters is single player mode theres no reason why accessing anything from it should be any slower thats what the dev blog actually says if you learn to read nothing will be harder to access not nothing will ever change
instead of making the blasters and railguns bleedthrough armor and shield themselves perhaps there should be special ammo types for this you could use regular ammunition that does full damage and then bleedthrough ammo which does slightly less damage but can penetrate shieldsarmor by the 5 you described in fact we could have ammunition of varying degrees of penetrationjust to throw an example out there100 base damage 0 penetration regular ammo90 base damage 5 penetration80 base damage 10 penetrationbasically a tradeoff between sheer damage output and bleedthrough maybe other penalties to balance ammunition with more bleedthrough but you get the pointthumbs up for concept
i too like nerfing active tanks i hear they really need itliang
theres no difference between ignoring an active tank and ignoring a buffer
there obviously isliang
and if you cant see the difference you obviously shouldt be making sweeping design decisions like this 1
1i like this idea
market bots are a mythwell maybe not and a few people developed them but its unlikely they would ever shareso for the most part youre whining about active traders who shouldnt be punished for being active or having no life if you will  thats already a punishment
incorrect market bots are very real and widely distributed why one of the sources of mining bots is selling one for a monthly cost akin to the one ccp chargesthey are certainly very very realas a trader i think the system needs to change but this is no solutioni can just put up smaller batches and instead of moving orders in price just list more stock as we price war so in effect this makes the person with the largest item stack the winner every time as he will be able to set more orders and win the market while the opponent will have to relist and eat the whole profit of his items upby the way most items have profit margins that are under 5 1 is ridiculousnot supported
about 3 minutes of efficient research tell me that what i say is true i doubt you can back up what you say
probably not on the forum as it is forbidden to talk about these things and certainly to give out where they are foundi can however send a evemail for informative purposes should you be uncapable of efficient researching google or you can simply put the name of the game followed by what you are looking for in google and see for yourself whether or not such a program exists or is sold the thing in question was the first result for me ymmv
im fairly capable odds are you fell for that scammer loudmouth not sure what to call itits the first result i get with all viable queriesbetter luck next time
protip use the word trader in your query so much for every possible one huh also not talking about the fail blog you refer toi guess your fairly capable falls far below the average fairly capable
so much fail in this thread its hard to decide where to start1 opposed2 the idea takes no account of how the eve sales tax system actually works hint tax is paid on the actual transaction and broker fees are paid when an order is modified charging tax as well on each bid is absolutely asinine its like charging tax every time you change ammo damage type3 a skilled trader can make billions of isk without resorting to the 001 isk game or using a bot trading is market pvp and somebody has to lose4 trade bots do exist and if it wasnt against the rules i could link several separate trading scripts on two separate multiplatform cheating systems5 market bots are actually easy to beat once youve worked out how they work do not play their game of 001 changes and when you find one raid its wallet with targeted market manipulation6 the vast majority of items in eve are price inelastic
are you suggesting the average person can use google fairly capable just means not utterly edanyways good read not sure how i missed it pretty sure i used that search term im suspecting it was autocorrected to trade i spent all of 3 minutes on the searchi wouldnt consider that bot to be a big problem in regards to the market thoits apparently just a macro no injection and slower than a human which might be allowedtheres very interesting other stuff on there tho
csm is a player voted council not a ccp voted council from what i am reading people from ccp are proposing things to csm when in reality it should be csm going to ccp saying players want this instead of of certain ccp people greyscale going to csm saying hey what do you think of changing this it puts ccp pressure on csm into voting the way ccp wants because a ccp brought out the proposal
this is highly true personally i as a player do not agree with alot of the ideas that ccp is coming up with for instance if you were to remove the jump bridges that will not remove blob warfare the fact is now instead of just lagging out a few systems with our 400 man fleet we lag every system from point a to point b lowsec pirate bodys will be overran by large alliances securing routes to highsec instead of having a 10 man pirate gang holding a lowsec gate you now have 70 man highly organized alliance fleets holding that same gate larger alliances will not recoil into their space but reach out for more to secure that route to highsec
just because the players voted for the csm doesnt mean the csm represents the entire player basetry asking the people whove lived in deep 00 for a long time that live in these large collations that live in small alliances in 00 if any of these changes will help make sure the guys who give you opinions have experience in multiple small and large alliance so they can tell you what they would do if you made a change the high sec carebears know nothing about 00
id like to propose something like this for incarna station contentsstation missionsmessage delivery deliver message to someone on stationreceive message at administration office find person message has to be delivered tofinding person could be asking key personel at shops bars and so onescort services not what you are thinking aboutvisit station concorde office and get your ordersprissoner escort escort person from cellblock to your ship fly to other station deliver person to cellblockthere could be combat on route depending on prissoner status
i always wondered why we have officer modified large gunslaunchers but not medium or small onesfrom game balance perspective theres no good reason not to have it the high cost and rarity of the items would preserve overall game balancethe new officer modified medium weapons could be used as a tool to boost low sec  by introducing cruiser sized officer spawn that only happens in low sec regions it would encourage people to go hunt there in hopes of scoring rare loot perhaps add some other officer modified items that currently have no high end variant such as burst ecms racial jammers nanos and overdrives these better give more speed
yes pleasethis is how it should besupportedthis fits well with my suggestion that customs office when containing stuff should be visible in assets window
let me start off by saying that i am in fact in favor of ninja looting eve is a pvp game in hisec in lowsec and in nullsec this is an important part of eve and should be preservedhowever eve is also a game of consequences participating in pvp activities should carry a risk and that risk is sorely absent in incursion pvevp content there are two problems that need to be addressedmothership cans are not owned by the winning fleet they can be stolen from without drawing an aggression timerwe cannot pod ninjas without getting concordokend hell im okay with a security status loss  but when all that ninja loses is a 50k isk frig there is no risk make him a war target for 15 minutes
what would you achieve by being able to pod the ninja looterchances are youd destroy whatever they looted in the meantimefind ways to be the first person to get to the can
guy has the possibility to steal a revenant bpc you get to pod him for 15 whole minutesdo you think you have skewed risk  reward back to parity with your idea or is it still a bit off
1 fleet matecovops doesnt matter whichcovert ops cloak ii1mn mwdits going down get readykaboomgo go goship zooms to can snatch and grabseems to me their tactics could just as easily be used by your own fleet mates as well
use the mwdwebscram on the ninja and blow him eventually pod him all youll loose is a cheap ship while hell loose a lot more between spimplants feel his tears

i would be interested in hearing what your ideas are with pos
there have been a number of good suggestions in threads like this 
prom4csm all my votes are going for him
so far the best candidate understands eve and knows what is wrong and rightvote for prom
so if you get elected can i keep my rook
i vote prometheus exenthalsolo pvp is exceedingly fun and there should be incentives for more players to try it out
wow you must think the eve playerbase is thick as pigst not to notice that the nc have launched a massive campaign to take control of the csm to influence gm decisions to meet your alliances prioritiesjust a coincidence that mittens happens to run at the same time as goonswarm join the nc how exactly are the majority of eve players helped by having one single alliance controlling all of the csmdepressing to see metagaming get this obvious im sure youll take the more gullible players along with you as you have a significant player following and you deserve some of that following sad to see mittens cashing in on his role as a genuinely neutral commentator outside the establishment just to promote his allianceshame on you mittani
boogaloo more like bloobloobloo
ok i guess its just a coincidence that about 15 members of the nc have all gunned for csm roles at the same time it would be great if we vote all of them in
youre dumbthe nc has no unique political interests on the csm that would distinguish it from any sovholding alliance in nullsec with the possible exception of technetium which anyone with a brain acknowledges should be nerfed if you want to be yammering about idiotic conspiracy theories heres one ill spell out for youput me krutoj vile rat seleene and elise randolph or prom depending on who the pl bloc votes for holy crap you have a bunch of old vets who know a thing or two about both eve and the completely idiotic things ccp has done over the past 5 years as were all ancient grizzled bittervets you might actually see a united csm try to get some  donein the csm fight you can only vote for a candidate not against one since its not a runoff its a fair assessment that krutoj will take the drfrus vote seleene will get awagon  nonaligned nullsec vile rat and myself will get clustergsf votes and elise or prom will get pl  trincdotev0kegeneric nonsov elite pvp killer2 is the official nc candidate meissa or trebor will get the hisec bears possibly roc if his campaign takes off
the current csm seemed pretty damn united about the removalnerf of jump bridges which shortly after was when you went into a rage and decided that it was time for all the seats to be taken over by sov holding power block members i posted the quote above you sent out do you no longer stand by what you said
 you said wow lmao anyways to prove your idea flawed here wow was build around pve eve isnt the whole idea of pve is to run around in your epic officer gear study encounters and execute them with precision yet we all know that an officer fit nightmare is 75 billion isk i mean ye sure grind a dungeon with your corp for 6 months you might actually get it but would a normal person who has invested 6 months gearing his nightmare even undock it from the station you need a safe environment for the pveers theyre even worse then carebearsis this your vision of eve pve loldont get me wrong i too agree that pve in eve needs a boost incursions and all is a good step forward but i would like to see encounters that require all sorts of combat tactics not just tanks and logisticsedit one more thing do you think you can manage the goons while being off in iceland doing csm business weve seen empires fall coz their leaders where busy with stuff outside eve it and atlast being the most recent ones yes atlas here i said it
you get my vote sir
remember guys nc want to control all csm seats so they can prevent all forms of pvp from 00i know the flying monkeys will blindly follow him but do you really want 00 to have less pvp do you want supercaps to be buffed do you want naps to get bonuses do you want bots to be allowed freelyif you dont want these features as mittani calls it to happen in 00 then dont vote for mittani or any other nc insecure clown they are on a mission to make 00 worse than it already isa vote for nc is a vote for combat free 00
will you not not give me isk for my vote
removing jump bridges would be ing edhisec douchebags particularly those who hate 00 dwellers are ing edpeople who believe disgruntled flying monkey are ing edyour puppy is not as cute as my puppies but you still have my votes
i also heard that throughout mans history all military commanders have complained about the unfair advantage offered by defensive installations i do hope that at least ccp will think this trough and offer the attacker an equal chance in this awesome internet spaceship game
thats a clever way of trying to establish a perception of a range of candidate names as being evil block vote dudes so everybody dont vote for them pick a wannabee independant while mittens is safe with his effective block already in place theres a fair few candidates with their own established groups but not blocks its a bit silly to just throw in a few big names for the sake of the agenda of standing on a guaranteed goon block with only the risk of possible competitors  for effective leadership within the csm following the elections  present because of a variety of candidates who have a quite professional grasp of how to work with ccp in more ways than one other than the angle of hurf blurf fist on table there are no conspiracies the nc has a tradition of block voting and it is part of all the choices people have in all of this sure it is a mindset topic but that is normal this is eve krutoj getting a block vote remains to be seen theres a fair few possible candidates starting to have their coming out it seems sokrates is gunning for the triadd votes once again and little seleene who could very well be an impressively professional csm member given his insights beyond the party line doesnt have a block down in the south they dont really have a tradition of block votes beyond some experimentation with itless posing man and stop worrying you already have the chair in the pocket theres no need even for posing other niche goon candidates to overshadow independant candidates on a per topic or catch the mindset basis even honest question though its been clear how ccp react badly to the hurf blurf fist on the table approach in previous csms your entire presentation seems to come down to that i could be wrong obviously it could just be the lolelections part o it i hope so unless youd be banking on social engineering lines it just never gives any results for eve as a whole only for own interests and you dont strike me as just going out there to preserve your state of the union so how exactly are you going to approach ccp when it is time to sit down at the table where there is a very good part of ccp who is willing to listen if the work is done  but also a very bad part of ccp which just wants to do new shiny stuff and gets butthurt when a csm does not agree with something being awesome to the point of literally turning their backs on the csm isolating them slapping nda on things while at the same time taking everything to the media i am sure you understand the challenge but do you have the methods for it im not asking for some overview of background but for how you are really going to approach matters
i support not only the removal of jump bridges but i will go you one farther and ask that poss have their reinforce timer shorted to 2 hour maximum because this crap with infinite isk streaming out of a dead weight brainless structures is killing any hope of warfare by attrition botting is a no brainer kill it i refuse to believe that none of the technology used by other mmos to track and prevent alterations to game client cannot be used in eve mittani is not interested in changing a thing even though a causal observer can look at the server killing supercap fights and the real world problems associated with alarm clock ops people told to skip work and school to be present to shoot pixels is obscene and run screaming voting for carebears and by that i mean people casual minded is absolutely a better choice because hardcores read mittani want the bar of entry to match their current play schedule and have all else treading water this simply put is why no sov holding allaince can hold anything without forming a multi alliance power bloc look out at the map how much has actually changed hands in a years time and how did it really change was it by actual war or did most of the sov change hands because the sitting defender splintered has eve gotten more interesting or has null cooled to the most stable state it has ever been
this thread and mittanis emotional instability has made me change my view on ccp i for one am glad they dont listen to the csm and hope they never decide to00 is flooded with naps and bots however rather than focusing on these issues what do we see nc team up to make 00 safer and worse than it isi think ccp should just put 00 on a total different server and have the bipolarity no longer affect the people who actually want to play a game and not run a business
look bag some of us arent allowed to talk about our csm candidacy on our own alliance forums because dear leader decided he wanted to meta game a bit higher up the ladder than he had been able to beforehelen and avalloc have both been on the csm before im a genuine candidate but i really dont see how i can prove that to you unless you look at my quite extensive usually constructive posting history over in market discussions twig andberries is probably trolling youthe reason youre seeing so many goon candidates this year and never before is that it was customary that there was an internal primary mittani canceled that and so anyone who was seriously thinking about running went well  that guy and is going at it alone
prove it
mittani knows even though this is common sense that people will vote for the leader anyway so no one really cares who is running as long as they have alot of sheeps to followmost people see the corp  alliance ticker and vote for them if you even knew what csm past or present suggested maybe you would not votelike vuk lau who wanted to end number warfare end power napping allow smaller alliances to defend for themselves without having a  load of bluesno one even reads what nc csm candidates even propose its oh that guy is nc lets vote for himbut like i said im glad ccp dont even listen to csm otherwise 00 would be worse than it is afterall it was ccp who suggested getting rid of jump bridges not csm  so if you think you can change it by controlling all the seats then you truly are kalmad
i think you missed my point if you think im part of any effort to control anything
obviously i wasnt talking about you
youre really bad at this stop while youre behind
yeah thats why rzrs candidate last election cycle was easily elected and wait
mittani is mad very mad this thread needs more lolgoonsmittani just wants a free trip to iceland i just summed up mittanis whole election manifestoremoved a trolling comment  adida
im going to call this campaign smoke being blown up the ass despite you saying its not and heres whyccp created the csm the csm serves ccp not the other way around if you think you are going to go in there and start swinging proverbial fists and bring ccp to the table to listen to us and what we want then youre crazy ccp brought the csm in to this world it can take it out and your attitude because youre some big powerful guy in a big alliance doesnt mean  and could possibly cause ccp to just simply get rid of the csm i kind of get the feeling youre about to walk in to the mentally handicap room at a school and start swinging that aint gonna last too long ya know no offense ccp just making a pointsure theres things that suck but at the end of the day its a game we play and ccp owns its their game i also believe that you realize that the csm v has done some hard work and got a foot in the door to where ccp is more inclined to listen to the csm bringing forth player concerns and issues and take more of what they say to heart and because of the work by the csm v you see an opportunity to go in their and ravage the little bit of soft underbelly that they csm v got ccp to show finally finally id like to state that it is quite hypocritical to call anyone a hypocrite and liar when you are head of an alliance that allows lying and scamming by your very existence as head of goonswarm you too are a hypocrite and a liar because you allow it to be done by your members recruitment scam by goons its all over the forums as leader it goes to your character as well so dont call others hypocrites and liars the buck stops at the top buddy
the nc dont want an nc hegemony of the csm you inbred gots they want a csm that actually listens to the opinions of the roughly 75k players that live in sov holding nullsec alliances if you dont think its full  for about a third of the games population and thats not taking into account the guys in lownpc null to not have a voice or to have a weakened voicethen you clearly need to diaf in game sure more people live in hisec but to quote my own post on kcomfix lagfree kartoonif you ask any nc goodpoaster if theyd be happy to have seleenekrutojelise or any other nullsec person in the csm theyd probably tell you yes of course keep the bleating this sandbox game does not look well enough on my style of play crowd outthe csm is a sounding board any deluded enough to think they can make sweeping reforms is just that deluded but we can at least have a sounding board that will call ccp if they drop a ed idea once in a whileremember the dominion sov system technetium hegemony lets keep them from happening again
if only those people who decide its a good idea to go to the forums and whine about being recruitment scammed had thought to go to the forums before being scammed then perhaps they might have been better prepared if only those people who decide its a good idea to go to the forums and whine about being recruitment scammed had thought to go to evesearch or google before being scammed then perhaps they might have been better prepared if only those people who decide its a good idea to go to the forums and whine about being recruitment scammed had thought to do any kind of research about their prospective new alliancecorporation then perhaps they might have been better prepared if only those people who decide its a good idea to go to the forums and whine about being recruitment scammed had thought to read our alliance diplomats ingame description then perhaps they might have been better prepared if only those people who decide its a good idea to go to the forums and whine about being recruitment scammed had thought to visit to our website then perhaps they might have been better preparedeve search  goonswarm recruitmenteve search  goonwaffe recruitmenteve online  goonswarm federationeve online  vile ratgoogle  goonswarm recruitmentgoogle  goonwaffe recruitmentgoonfleet wiki  joining goonswarmall of the above links are publicly viewable by anyone who looks
oh god if you fall for the goon recruitment scam you really need to do diaf in gamewhat is it 2006also the vile rat link doesnt show anything two shots but heres what his bio says for those of you who still dont get it
correct my point was not that the scams arent easily findable and quite frankly i dont have a problem with it people who get scammed deserve it my point is your leader is calling csm candidates liars and hypocrites which is hypocritical on his part because he heads an alliance that lies despite whether or not it is allowed or ones view on it favorable on my part its a game if someone is going to lie and scam and its within the game eula which it is it is still lying and to head an organization that allows it lying to scam is hypocritical therefore there is no ground to stand on calling others liars and hypocrites therefore for me  it null and voids any legitimacy to this campaign thats what im saying two
hes caught onto us
the alliance itself is actually very open about not tolerating scamming by its directors recruiters or ceos you cant say the entire alliance are scammers because a few members decide to take some idiots for a ride to get carrier killmails and a few mil isk thats like saying im a murderer because someone was murdered by someone from my town
your town killed my family and raped my dog
or we could back up even further to the point where people cant differentiate between ingame and real lifeperhaps i should clarify that recruitment scamming  such constitute ingame asshattery and the csm is unrelated all the posts about the nc taking over the csm to bend the game to their interests or equivalent drivel are some of the dumbest things i have ever read in fact the game is already skewed greatly in our favor and yet we are still advocating a fix see previous discussion of tech moonsevery 00 bloc perceives the stagnation and barriers to entry in 00 just as clearly as everyone in this thread coming up with laughable conspiracy theories and we dont enjoy the end results too much either the difference is we actually understand why it is happening something that mittani does much more than me which is why i will be voting for him despite his horrible posting style
im going to collect intelligence make some calls and probably wing it from there how hostile ccp will be may depend on the composition of the csm the best approach may be a subtle one outside the formal process rather than one that involves meeting minutes it might be best done within a formal process but i doubt it most legislation is theatre irl with the real drama done in the back rooms before a vote one of the easiest fixes and one that seems extremely obvious to me is just to get the whole csm on skypeconference call during their biweekly meetings they apparently do not do this at all and i suspect thats part of the reason why they had rings run around them ive been talking to mynxee to get a braindump from her about her views on the problemsthe biggest issue that i can see  and this is a theory were at the spitball stage here  is that the issues we see in terms of unbalanced halffinished game combined with schizophrenic shiny featurechasing is not the disease itself but the symptom of an archaic corporate culture and organization problem within ccp itself where best practices dont existarent communicated if this is the case past csms have been playing whackamole at the symptoms which new idiocies are spawned every day by the structural problems dunno if this is real though just a hunch my hunches are p good
this is an awesome post because this dude completely lost his 1 im conniving im not going to bang my fist on the table like i said in the previous post ill do what it takes to forge an effective advocacy group that probably involves a lot of work on the down low you blurt out a bunch of dumb  about how the straw mitten who lives in your brain will behave but its obvious that you know nothing about me or how i work anyone whos played this game for more than a year knows that i never choose the direct or obvious route 2 youre mad about scamming in eve online you should probably play a different game
in other mittani is a liar news i used a zizek quote in our alliance description even though i cant stand zizek or lacan booyah
do you guys even realise that the main issues csm6 will be called to give feedback on are going to be a possible incursion iteration followed by captains quarters and incarna iterations thereafter anything major sovrelated is probably at least a year away if thenas far as i can tell your only expertise in those areas is pretending they dont existyour posturing about what youre going to do about sovereignty to your own voting block is no different then the people who say theyre going to fix faction warfare or blasters or whatever i know its pointless to try to reason with you people on this particular subject but sov warfare is not the core gameplay of eve its all expansion content and mostly expansion content that is old and in the past and not really a priority right now as far as ccp is concernedalso chasing shiny things is what took ccp out of the disaster that was eves launch and gave them the constant slow growth no other mmo on the market has ever managed theyre not going to go into maintenance mode and lose that edge so that their population can slowly start to die off just because of a few bitter vets
i dont really see anyone posturing about doing something about it so much as knowing a single goddamn thing about ithey if sovereignty doesnt come up for a while oh well but at least there will be some people on the csm who can provide intelligent feedback about how ccps terrible ideas will affect it see technetium jump bridges
that guy thinks that ccp follows a structured development process and doesnt just randomly brainstorm ideas many of which are bad outside of their scheduled releasesheh
i for one think that ccp should remove jump bridges and remove local or even delay itthis will make 00 a completely tedious place to live and everyone and their brother will have a bot out there because  actually living there
i did actually particularly in the last para you just either didnt read it or didnt understand itcsm5 showed us that if you listen to eve online players capture their concerns and suggestions and then present this as real factual data and metrics ccp will listen you start every sentence with the phrase the players have told us that rather than i think that trebors efforts on crowdsourcing was an excellent example of this in actionmy particular means of gathering player suggestions and concerns is going to be through roundtables ill be holding three before the election on three topics empire wardecs jump mechanics and pvp blobs if im elected ill have followon roundtables throughout my term ill also be following player discussion on the assembly hall very closely and reminding ccp of past agreements they have made with past csms
unimaginative character name awesome csm delegate
my first version wasnt nearly as good but my wife is an artist and she helped me tweak itbetter that than the other way around
perhaps im missing something but there is nothing about how the winner is actually chosen
my current thinking is to generate a randomized list of the entries then pick a winning random number using crowd interaction at fanfest  generate a random digit string rolling a dice or calling out digits and modulo it with the number of entriesat that time we wont know the size of the prizes but that can be announced laterif anyone has a better idea im open to it
vote trebor daehdoowcos he is awesomeedit for content now if you could push for changes to the science and industry ui it might be you this time getting the livestock you pretty much have backed what i would have backed so as my representative you have done a stellar jobawesomeness
well there have been broad hints dropped that the change to the 64bit inventory system will finally make it possible to do things like properly badging bpos and bpcs and that might lead to some improvements in sias someone who ran a complete tripleorca research  production pipeline in a hisec pos for a year its certainly something id personally like to seeps with regards to the livestock appreciate the thought but my tastes lie in other directions
i am just gonna get more people to vote for youwithout entering that isk thingy of yours i will point them out to it so if they wanna participate then fine
out of curiosity how will you deal with the possibility of  should you get elected  select other csm members confusing the concept of accountability with hurf blurf emo or fists on a table you know what i mean accountability is one thing the other stuff has made ccp run away consistantly as well a caused much kneejerking over the years it usually only ends up in social engineering which at best gives no results look at mazziliu and elvenlord and at worst makes ccp throw their company values even harder out of the windowand as a second question how would you deal with repeat occurances of ccp running for the hills the moment csm does not agree with them like they did with incarna and isolates the csm while still feeding it all to the media the only instruments you have there are those that hilmar emphasised transparancy communication but that means keeping all occurances within the public view which is not liked by some parts of ccp its a tough thing to approach
agreed hence my proposal to iterate on wis so that pvp is in it if you check my initial post with a link in this thread and ignore the trolls in the linked thread it goes to an elevator proposal thread that mynxee suggested i started and the op of that thread links to a mechanics thread
ccp abathur i mean seleene you have my axe
about mei have been an active eve player for well over 3 years with near daily activity in game and with extensive understanding of most areas of game playi have run both high sec carebearindustrial corp and corpalliance that lived out in 00 i was highlighted as a key leader of the alliance when eon published an article on usi understand what it means to live in both empire and in 00 i have done both with various toons for years i have experienced market trade work research invention t1t2 manufacturing mining pos management small and large scale pvp my main point is i have been around and i know what this game is aboutin the real world im a senior it architect a person whos used to identifying and resolving complex challenges on a daily basis and leading people driving progress and holding people accountable i do feel i can translate my years of professional experience into real progress for our communitywhy am i runningover the years there i have seen so many change to eve some great some not so great some are great starts but are never evolved i really enjoy this game and really look forward to ccps long term goal of a fully immersive scifi simulator i want to be a part of that progress and ensure its done in a way that aligns with the communitys desiresthe csm and meanyone that has paid attention for more than 5 seconds knows that the csm members cant go in and demand certain feature or things be addedremoved csm is to serve as a sounding board to ensure that ccps directions are on track with what we as a community want so please dont sit here and post i will vote for you if you promise xyz the csm is used to help mold and align ccps plans not set ultimate direction while in some cases the csm does help stress the importance of certain areas chances are only made if ccp agrees csm does not get to do what it wants and a csm member can not promise you anything beyond their abilities so dont believe them if they domy campaign objectivesas i stated above csm cant force results to specific items they can however help ccp understand the impacts and present ideas and brainstorm possible solutions if you feel my stance on a specific issue is relevant to your vote please ask and i will tell you whether i endorse a specific thing or notto that end here are a few important areas i feel need somecontinued attentionhere are my campaign focus points address lag issues through better game mechanics hybridgallente balancing black ops boost capitalsuper capital balancing fix low sec lets make it worth being there for more than just pirates ensuring old features are not left out to die ccp is starting to do this lets make sure it continues fixing poss to many things to list getting rid of macrobots hold ccp accountable to the player community their customerswhy vote for mevoting for me will put your vote towards professional leader and experienced player that wants to work to make eve all that i know it can be as i discussed i want to focus on the large overall game mechanics instead of a few individual topics i want to play my role to help facilitate progress from the csm and ccpnot just for null secyes my main character has spent most of its life in null sec and low sec but my various alts have been involved in research trading manufacturing mining invention pretty much every other part i am not campaigning to just protect the interests of null sec im here to represent the eve player regardless of play style and location i have good ingame friends that very from hardcore pvp types to those that are afraid to to even loose a ship regardless of reason and i feel i can properly address those concerns that are most important to you
added 2282011people have asked about my last bullethold ccp accountable to the player community their customersi would like to give you 2 different but related topics where accountability does not exist1 cyno effect  since the day ccp change the cyno effect people have spoken up overall the community wants it back or better i feel ccp should at the very least be accountable to step up and formal state yes we are willing to discusschange or no we are not changing it for whatever reason instead we have thread after thread of the same thing over and over2 black ops  the issue here is the same im not going to discuss the options after well over 1 year prolly 2 there have been hundreds of threads many active for over a year my problem here is ccp delivers a product eve and a part of that product black ops doesnt work in the way the customer base expects whats worse is you have the community begging to make them usable versus something thats simply not used like t2 plates because theres something better for the job i think at the very least ccp needs to be accountable to address these types reoccurring issues either start some dev blogs to inform the community they are working on it if its complicated like black op or just post a sticky thread where ccp can put formal responses so after that every time a person says we want old cyno effect they can just be pointed to that thread and its ended
hi i have delt with you as a care bear for a long time you helped me when i first whent into t2 production high sec is also broken as far as pierats on gates i as a player think that the csm should brouch the subject with ccp as a persinatent problem shoul you get on the csm i as you to try to get in in the talk topics
i can agree with you that something needs to be done to fix lowsec i cannot see any advantage to living in or playing in lowsec over highsec or nullsec except for the ability to crow about how awesome your 10 security status is some sort of major incentive or bottleneck resource needs to exist lowsec to make it livable and worth inhabiting while at the same time not detracting from highsec or nullsec i do not know what could be done about this nor do i believe you or anyone else running for csm does but heres to hoping
well in all honesty there are generally benefits to being in high sec or 00high sec  you can relatively safely mine or manufacture with minimal risk while you cant moon mine ratting and manufacturing can be done to a point where the volume easily makes it worth it ok maybe not rattingfor example you can easily spend 3 hours mining ore in high sec and while that same 3 hours in low sec might produce more profit the risk doesnt make it worth it loosing 1 hulk will literally counter any potential profit for days if not longer ratting is the same way the profits dont always justify the risk00  if alliance owned you can get a certain level of safety or really a certain level of safety just due to the low population ore and rat values are such that you can recover the loss of a ship in just a few hoursthere are many potential options such as making some items only available in low sec which would increase their value making it worth the risk to go after them or making certain items only available here right now anything available in low sec can be gotten in 00 with much less risk so there is no drive to use low sec there are also some very radical paradigm changing options that might reduce the risk to low sec carebears instead of only increasing the reward any of which are probably not very relevant at this pointcrunchytwit i will touch base with you in game to ensure i understand your concern before addressing it here
draco can fight a bear with his bare hands and once killed an elephant just by peeing on it vote for him
good campaign best of luck
so i suppose im not getting your vote huh
historic precedent suggests there are few grounds for concern about the csms ability to control ccp policy even if every seat was occupied by equally obnoxious clones of the mittani its apparently hard enough just to get a few tweaks to game mechanics let alone affect policy
nah they wont control ccp policy even they are not naive enough to think ccp are blind to their manipulation and would listen to a onesided csmthey panicked because csm5 managed to get ccp to pay attention and they just want to undo that work and sink csm back into the irrelevancy of previous years so it can be ignored again
vile rat once banned me from the deklein intel channel and im still going to vote for him
vile rat your hypocrisy is amazing it is up to players if they wish to end bloc warfare ccp doesnt force you to nap so explain wtf you are talking about herewhen goons  nc have made it their mission to control all of 00 nothing is forcing you to reset instead you encourage more naps it has been leaked already what your csm mission is to control all seats so it is easier to make isk and rmt in 00 and prevent pvpsaying that no doubt your blind monkey will vote for you just because you snap your fingers lucky for players ccp doesnt listen to csm and accept that you will get your jump bridges removed
vile rat best rat please fix my eve
youre so full of  that its coming out of your ears
in the interest of balance within the csm and to ensure that all views are fairly represented on the csm i think its good that youre running and wish you the best for your campaigni will certainly not agree with all of your ideas but then for me thats the point of having a mixed csm and not just one powerblock of say hisec or 00 people
just so you know the average goon hates that were blue with everyone thats anywhere near us from what i hear spoken of from people who understand the game a lot better than i do the presence of the existing number of supercapital ships in certain alliances makes it pretty much suicidal for the alliances that are already blue to them to reset them
i dont hate anything but supercapitalsand i love jump bridgeshey vile rat ill vote for you buddy
you are not the average goon you are h ratli smriks bona fide good postercan you confirm that a vote for vile rat is a vote for good posts
hahahahahahahahahahaha if this were the case then goons alone would have reset nc back in 2009 instead kept them blue because bob might come back wtf as long as theres no risk involved in naping half of eden everyone will do itdont get me wrong i know drf and it did it too but i find it funny how vile rat says he will fix it considering every previous csm from nc has said the same thing and only promoted itthe whole purpose of removing jump bridges was so conflicts could arise locally and it would be difficult for a few active directors in a powerbloc to hold so much space thats why your leaders and every other nc leader is angry at the suggested change because in effect it makes naps pointless due to travelling and maintenance of space without easeoh and only because someone will say ityes 00 was dead before jump bridges but its also dying now the population has been going down and down as bots and supercaps goes up jump bridges didnt make 00 even remotely more habitable 00 has been growing at a steady rate until dominion and then started to go downlogistics wont be harder for smaller alliances what will be hard is getting a mega blob from a  b and being able to suck up all that moon goo ccp mentioned this alreadyas a result people will start focusing on fighting people 5  10 jumps away instead of 50 jumps awaythen maybe goons can actually go back to their rootsbut thats besides the point nc want to control all seats either directly or indirectly and considering some of the stuff the nc csm candidates have said it makes you wonder if they even play eve at all
edit because i cannot wait 2 minutes to add more wordsi dont think you understood my posti said that the average goon dislikes that were blue to everyone the average goon does not make alliancelevel decisionsif the average goon made alliancelevel decisions then we would all be flying free dramiels until the alliance wallet ran dry wait a second
i do think it is bad people are being stereotyped based on which alliance they are in but lets face it you are who your friends are or should i say best friends are
my best friend doesnt play mmo games because they are a waste of time
youre aware at the beginning of the fountain campaign we would regularly fly 2030 jumps to the titan system and then bridge the last few jumps usually on top of the objective or near a posjump bridges are used for the common joe in alliances hardly for force projection youd just be making the day to day in 00 a lot tieralso the reason many hate jump bridges is due to looking at the ncs jump bridge setup which i can agree is hilariously convolutedis this a problem with jump bridges nope its a problem stemming from technetium which everyone can agree needs a nerfseriously  technetium
obviously titan bridges need a nerf too

i understand your concern but there is no need to worry that much i feel like i did not express my position clearly enough in short back to the original question i dont think presenting a unified voice to ccp requires a lot of concessions amongst the csm members this unified voice is important i did not imply that i would take a tangential stance in any issue what i meant was  i will make sure that the stance presented by the csm is as thoroughly and carefully selected as possible its a twostep process when the csm is internally debating i have good hope that the csm representatives being sound and reasonable people wishing to represent all players and not their sole interest a consensus on what stance the csm should adopt can be reached on most issuesin the hopefully rare case that a reasonable consensus cannot be reached what i meant was  it will be crucial to make sure that in the finally selected stance all the sometimes contradictory opinions will be reflected so that noone is forgotten i dont see this a fractured message but as a complete one and possibly suggesting ccp that some consequences of a particular change were overlooked this is the kind of input they are bound to appreciate as they use scrum methodwhen the csm is reporting to ccp there will be only one message possibly containing the word but which will encompass all the representatives and incidentally players point of viewa good example was the recent discussion about the captains quarters we think its a great idea for immersion and showcasing your new tech and it would also improve the npe but this should not make any existing process more tedious  for example no need to walk through all the station to speak to an agentperhaps some csm representatives focused on immersion  enjoying the eye candy or focused on the kind of content this could bring overlooked this particular point but in the end they presented ccp with a yes buttype answer which is exactly what i intend to dothe csm doesnt have the power to make ccp steer completely the game design to other topics or to refuse any new feature but we can make sure every interest of the players is taken into account when we report about thosemicrotransactions  yes but only vanity itemsit was the type of answers provided by the csm 5 which was so far the csm advancing the most in terms of relationship with ccp transparency and efficiencywhat i implied in my answer was  i will just make sure no but is forgotten cause sometimes you know people have huge buts
one of the issues that the csm will have to talk with ccp about will assuming its not already patched into oblivion before theyre elected is the nature of jbscynosjump freightersetc i think it may very well be detrimental to have a csm delegate who doesnt know anything about how those work or worse have a mistaken impression about them put it this way if highsec ganking was an issue you felt was important and one of the csms said that his position was that everything should stay as it is because its impossible to gank anything in empire bigger than a shuttle would you feel confident voting for them
i think that rocs campaign has an interesting perspective hes approaching it from a different angle to many players could the thing to remember here is that this is a council or representatives not a single representativeim essentially a hi sec carebear nb ive been in null sec and will eventually go back i also plan to try wormholes however i would not refuse to vote for a candidate who was a ninja salvager for example even if their gamestyle directly conflicts with mine the csm needs to be balanced by having lots of differing opinions  a council full of the same people will fail worse than a titan pilot hitting jump instead of bridge p
i believe rightly or wrongly that the csm needs to have a good mix of people in as essentially a hi sec carebear ive been in null recently and have experienced jump bridges on my overview but not as a beacon like a cyno which is what i think roc is referring toas a carebear i would not refuse to vote for a ninja salvager as i believe eve is what it is because of the diversity of players and gamestyles i believe that rocs experiences could add a unique benefit to csm6  and remember he will be one voice amongst many not the only voiceif he is voted on im sure he will face much frustration and disappointment as some things he thinks are important are simply voted down or not seriously discussed due to other topics needing to be covered i also think that despite his ic person being an arrogant and mildly sexist guy i also think his passion and enthuasism for the game will make him a good candidateim also open to change and have not yet decided where my votes will go so keep posting your manifesto roc and come vote day best of luck whether i vote for you or not
theres nothing wrong with having a mix of players in generalin specific however if that mix of players has members who are ignorant of key issues that will be very important for the csm to tackle its not good iirc meissa is pretty carebeary he seems like a good person to support if you like that sort of thing
politics is fun lets go with thatso far ive been misquoted had ideas twisted around to be interpreted to suit someone elses point of view been labelled as things and accused of things completely untruei must be doing something rightlet me reiterate again the important parts as some people seem to only digest the parts they want to1 i am not interested in being an amateur game developer i simply show examples of ideas to illustrate that i am a thinking candidate and not a puppet2 i dont know everything about eve having jump bridges show up on overview may not be a solution but as has been noted csm should be comprised of several individuals with differing experiences if other csm can intelligently debate the pros and cons of a proposed solution then i am open to learning more about this game i love3 roc is roc a character i am not roc this refers to a term called roleplay that obviously several people dont understand im sorry for your ignorance4 as i have stated clearly in my eve api blog post i have zero interest in monetizing capsuleer that app is dead and shall not be resurrected so get over it already5 at the end of the day nothing the csm recommends or fights foragainst may be successful so why do it because i can i can stand up and intelligently fight i can eloquently defend my positions with experience and candor i can and if voted in i willwhat i will not engage in is silly arguments with close minded individuals that believe they know me or know about me but honestly have taken neither the time nor interest to read anything beyond what they wish to make of me thats fine and youre entitled to your life and your vote but please dont expect me to engage you directly unless youre genuinely interested in my positions on issues regarding csm and how i hope to serve the community bestfor those of you continuing to be supportive i thank you for taking the time to understand my intentions in this campaign and appreciate the effort you put in to spreading the word to rocthevote
he is also a terrorist
this is a non sequitor players can have differing experiences and still understand core issues that will be of central importance for the next csmthere are many important issues that the csm will have to discuss with ccp not knowing about the most basic facts of the key issues is not okay just because others on the csm will have that experience in point of fact those who have that experience are the ones who should be voted in rather than having to compensate for a csm delegate who cant pull their own weight since youre discussing it youve already got dev cred for creating the app in the first place and making it so successful you could most likely parley that into employment or at least resume experience so ccp wont pay you for it okay why not opensource it so the eve playerbase can benefit from it
capsuleer will not be part of my campaign discussions as i have gone over this repeatedlythe only thing i will mention regarding open source is that it is not simply a matter of going open source i agree basic mechanics of gameplay are important but i also believe that if a csm delegate has never research data cores it shouldnt be something held against their contributions to the csm
well manalapan i have looked over your proposals and am is 100 agreement with your standpoints and proposed revamps of current game mechanicsim voting for ya 
people posted legitimate reasons why the change was a bad idea and he admitted that he hadnt thought of those things at first and that they had changed his mind you would prefer someone who would continue backing a bad idea even after being given many good reasons why it should not be implemented what purpose would that serve how could that possibly be seen as a good quality to have for someone who is going to help shape the future of eve and when did you first realize that you dont actually like eveall of the dishonest methods of earning isk scamming pirating stealing etc are important parts of the game and help separate eve from the lesser mmos i would never support a csm candidate who didnt endorse these aspects of eve as removing any or all of them could seriously hurt if not kill the game
im sorry i asked you how you were going to help new corps get into 00 without help from well equipped and funded alliances your answer is that you want to make the logistics of moving harder i also asked you how you would increase the incentives for being there i can mine mostly afk in perfect safety in empire build at low costs with almost no waiting times and transport minerals and product with absurd ease the draws to nullsec for me are idealogical i think it should be fun and exciting but when i try and figure out the reality it is nigh on impossible to make a case to be there unless you are in an alliance with access to multiple outposts which misses the point of wanting to have fun in a backend system with a small group of mates
having spent most of this afternoon reading the forums here im thinking that this csm election might be really interesting to followim not trolling but am starting to find it difficult to take seriously the constant trolling of other csm candidates by certain peoplei have three accounts and intend to use the votes for a mixed csm not for a csm based entirely on one part of the eve world namely 00the csm will be much richer with people like mike roc and arden involved as it will have multiple perspectives it will no doubt also benefit from some serious 00 representatives like vile rat i only have 3 votes and will decide who to vote for when the election takes places but we all play eve and the chance for the csm to have the experience of trebor the insight of working with ccp out of game with roc the antics and game mechanic knowledge of somebody like arden the more carebear side of hi sec influence of mike and the 00 powerblocks like vile rat could make for a really exciting and powerful csmdominating the csm with all00 people will mean an instant failcongrats on standing arden and best of luck with your campaign
no i dont actually know since all you said waswhich doesnt actually say anything other then armor is too slow in your opinion also armor is fine
yes so basically thats what id change about armor the speed penalties failing that a slight increase to the base speedflexibility of gallente hulls or the ability to reach their top speed faster than anyone else would be fine
i endorse this product andor service
just checking in to look over peoples grammar and spelling
yes they should you havent explain what you would change or do to allow thisbecausebecausewe have incursions already pmarauders are still heavily used in pve situations from missions to whs and although black ops can do with a buff they still fill a rolelol norebalanced how bad choice of words tbhyeah revamp mining and all forms of npcing it has been asked many times ever wonder why there isnt invention bots manufacturing bots pi bots exploring bots cyno bots pvp bots pos gunner botsfw more profitable omg lol you know fw is the best and easiest way to make isk and brings in the more isk than everything except lvl 5s pyes it doesyes it does how would you go about making this happeni like how 00 alliance leaders criticised empire yet fail to even understand how things work just because you have an oversized blob empire on the sov map doesnt mean you know how everything works in this gamesaying that i see goonswarm in your name so i expect you to be voted for despite commenting on stuff so badly
i think youre missing the point of the csm im not going to be able to tell ccp how exactly to implement game changes what i can do on the csm is highlight issues and provide feedback on the things they are doing the value of me pointing out that say marauders are only used in some pve settings and blackops ships in certain 00 logistics settings and that that is quite a niche area compared to the t2 frigates and cruisers is more likely to start a discussion than coming to the table with how maurauders need xyz and blackops need abc youll notice to once again use that particular point as an example in my point i dont use the word maurauders or blackops anywhere but refer simply to the class of t2 battleships any solution to that issue is going to be hampered by focusing on what we have right now and not enough on why we are looking at that particular issue namely the very large chasm in abilities of a t1 battleship and a t1 carrierdread this is an area that a t2 battleship could fit intomy list of eleven points is a list of eleven generalities that are sourced from a general viewpoint im not here to make specific recommendations to ccp and promises to you im here to show you the type of feedback ill be giving ccpif there is one thing that comes out of the csm5 its that the most effective way to work with ccp is to take their ideas and tailor them to fit how the game should be one of the most fitting examples of that was the discussions covering microtransactions ccp has a business need for them the sandbox economy of the game would be devistated by them we had a csm that rather than slamming their fist on the table and saying microtransactions bad came back with well there are a number of vanity things you can give players the ability to buy that wouldnt affect gameplay that would workthis is what the csm needs to do
so basically you want to be a messenger providing feedback no different to what obsidian hawk is doing in assembly hallby all means go back on everything you have said and explain why theres an issue obviously you can ignore the botting issue since it is obvious how that hurts the game but i would like to hear how you feel certain things are so broken that a t2 orca  salvage drone can fix it csm has no place for people who want to sit in the back take notes and smile the problem with this years election is everyone is applying for the sake of applying and judging by awful comments by say you and mittani it is obvious you guys have no clue about eve let alone 00but its fine im sure when it comes to votes your ticker is all that matters
i think ive pretty clearly delineated that there are two things the csm can and should be doing1 highlighting problems with the current state of the game2 providing feedback on the future changes that ccp brings to them in order to help them tweak those changesi have never seen a proposal that started with the csm saying we think x is broken and you need to do y to fix it ever working out highlighting that x is broken gets the problems onto ccps radar if it wasnt already ccps designers have a better handle on what the ancient spaghetti python code is capable of doing when they propose a change thats when the csm comes back into play i dont bot i dont like botting i dont like the mittanis decision to take a laissez faire approach to botting in the goons region of space i dont like what botting does to the economy of the game it was point 8as to those particular examples with the introduction of the noctis salvaging has become a popular side profession for a number of people salvage drones would be something that would fit with that a t2 orca would provide a step up from an orca which by all accounts is wildly popular for the small corporations that use them as a centerpiece ship how is that bad the mittani has dictated that he and vile rat will be the two goons to receive the votes from goonswarmplease dont let his awful comments affect your perception of me
ok so i think that the current csm have done a brilliant job i havent agreed with all their calls but then i shouldnt as not everybody plays this sandbox how i do and if i agreed with everything then be definition i think they be doing a bad jobso if you get elected following on from the excellent work of csm5 can i ask the following questions1 what 3 small things would you want to see fixed as a high priority im talking about things like the recent quick wins such as dragging directly into cans although is it just me insofar that you cant split a stack this way2 what 3 long term things would you like to see not on the broad scale of fix low sec but for example removal of jump bridges im not in favour btw or t3 frigates3 if you were elected to csm6 have you thought of a strategy to avoid the burn out that seems to affect so many of the previous delegates as it saddens me to see some of them affected in this waykeep blogging and best of luck for the elections
turns out this was all true you can already see the slimy nc trying to take over everything perhaps to make up for having no power as a childa vote for nc is a vote for combat free 00vote for promhow can anyone vote for mittani when he blatantly says he wants to make eve worse remove pvp from 00 and punish people in lowsecfont size removed as per the forum rulessteviesg
this game  your game  is under attackas leaked in various websites at the upcoming csm election youre about to see the single biggest powerbloc eves ever known launch a cynical deliberate and manipulative attempt to seize control of the csm the northern coalition and their partners goonswarm are no longer content with managing most of 00 and the hundreds of billions of isk they receive weekly theyre now conniving to take control of your counciltheyll use the information gained under nondisclosure agreement to wheedle every possible ingame advantage exploiting the privileged access to safeguard their own political interestworst of all theyll almost certainly succeed the nc and goonswarm will use massive block voting carefully coordinated between member corporations to ensure this theyll have tens of thousands of votes available at the drop of a hat and squash out strong minded independent candidates like meim going to make some predictions about what well see in this campaign numerous nc  goon alliance leaders standing  leadership types not average joe members  to ensure that their players toe the line while voting slick spin doctors and media manipulators attempting to present their takeover as the mavericks against the establishment nc  goonswarm no are the establishment and to pretend otherwise is now ludicrous wheedling between these candidates meetings behind closed doors to steer the campaign organised forum campaigns to smear opponent candidates it cant possibly be good to have a single group controlling all the assets in game and the mechanism for influencing the devs its therefore with a sense of duty that i stand for csmprimarily my purpose is to disrupt the jobs for the boys mafia taking control of your game however i will also take the opportunity of candidacy to champion zero tolerance stance on botting a major community refocus within eve  enabling app development social media tools and open architecture revitalisation of empire warfareim also committed to representing the voice of the silent majority in eve unlike most candidates i will not be representing any one alliance political view or selfinterest i will be encouraging the whole of the eve community to vote for what they feel is most important find out more on my campaign website

with the same caveat of running against helen i hope he and i are both elected as watching helen over the past csms has done nothing but impress me in both skill and thoughtful naturebut i would still like some votes as well we are electing a council not presidentm
does this make 5 goon candidates 
anybody can sit and just shoot down ideas sorry but there is a plethora of other candidates that have more motivation than vote for me so i can shoot down all ideas nonstop
theres a difference between just flinging  around and spending the time to come up with compelling arguments for or against an idea if you think that protecting eve from bad ideas isnt important then read the first couple of pages of the assembly halls forum and try to imagine what the game would be like if they were all implementedas i said in my post and on my campaign site ideas arent really important anyone who says that they have great ideas on how to fix eve is going to be disappointed when they reach the csm anyone who says that they will make ccp sort out issue du jour 65826 is either not paying attention or is just trolling for populist votes from voters who arent paying attention what is important for a csm delegate is a strong and comprehensive knowledge of the game so that when ideas are floated you can provide clear and useful feedback on them most of the time that clear and useful feedback comes down to this idea is bad for these reasons that isnt the same as shooting down all ideas nonstop rather its pointing out that there are consequences that havent been considered and the idea needs to be refined or reconsidered a delegate who can do this is 100 more useful than a delegate who has a bunch of really neat ideas on how to fix blasters or how to redesign the sovereignty system and this is what i do professionally
im trying to run for csm but i can tell even this early that im not doing wellhonestly im doing badly there is really about 3 or 4 seats up for election this time around depending on who you talk to the great 00 powerblocks are instructing all of their members on who to vote for in order to focus their votes into 5 or 6 candidates ensuring that they get enough to win seats they dont have a majority of voters but they can line up their voters to make their votes counti am not one of those candidates despite being in goonswarmthat being said im honestly running to promote idea that the ingame economy is the most important aspect of eve id like to think i have the same general agenda as the majority of the people here id think that would be something the people here could get behindi dont have an effective gimmick so there wont be any mlmstyle campaign i think my ideas are decent but i also dont feel any kind of name recognition from anyone not on this board i can focus my message but im not quite sure where i should be going to get that message out thereso what im saying is im a candidate whos not going to win unless i get some help either with ideas or with your advocacywhat should i be saying differently now that youve seen my messagewhats important that i missed and finally if anyone can help me with introductions to some of the empire manufacturing and research alliances id love to talk to them
you have my vote if you can bring change
the only change i can really promise you is that someone on the csm will have an understanding on the in game economy and make that their focusand post here a ton
i can let you borrow my oversized banner add pgimmick  vote kalrand 1 isk never sleeps and neither will he2 isk talks and bullsht walks3 hes too big to fail4 vote dollardemocracy doesnt translate to isk well  5 locate other candidates setup alts and make it appear theyve scammed your alts or otherwise been un csmly negative campaign till new eden freezes overme done
already outlined the following in signaturesthe central question is to what degree kalrand or any other md candidate would be able to convince the other csm members to prioritize economyrelated issues over other more mainstream topicsi have no doubt that many of the other csm candidates have no issue with saying sure well add your agenda somewhere near the end of your list of requests if you support us here here and here but for csm to be effective it has to concentrate on very few core messages and i have serious doubts that kalrand will manage to get the points on his agenda in thereanother more personal impression is that kalrand seems to agree in many points with the agenda of the 00backed candidates  this renders the i will support them on their topics if they support me with my economyrelated proposals argument moothis threat to vote against csm proposals he does personally support just because his tit for tat demands have not been met would not be credible in order to trade votes on csm proposals you have to appear to make sacrifices  otherwise you dont have anything to trade within short i dont think mds pet proposals are capable of winning a majority and while it is not necessary to convince the majority of voters in order to get one candidate into csm it is necessary to convince the majority of csm members to support these proposals in order to get anything doneif you want to make your votes count allocate your votes based on mainstream issues which could get a majority of voters and csm members alike  chances are you wont see much tangible results of having a minority candidate in csmeditin case this isnt clear enough from the paragraphs above my suggestion would be that if you want to vote for kalrand you should do so based on his kugu not on his md agenda
that its more about who you are than what youre saying people dont vote for douchey gasbag losersso who would that be surely you jest if you mean yourself
quoted for hypocrisy
i think most of this overestimates the importance of the csm ccp will not make their decisions based on what a majority of the csm think at best the csms opinions will be weighed as one heavily skewed way of gauging the views of the playerbase as a whole as such it doesnt bother me too much that kal would be aligned with a bunch of 00 ideas that i dont particularly support what i would like is an md voice at the table and its important to realise that that is what the csm are  voices not decision makers someone sensible who can make compelling arguments is more likely to have some impact than a majority of csm members who ccp will be wellaware represent only a niche group of players and the idea of having at least one person on the council who might occassionaly examine the issues from a market perspective and present that perspective to ccp is an appealling one
raw my basic premise is that csm can only support a very limited number of proposals effectively and that it needs to speak with one voice in order to be heard by ccpthe csm members vote on their meetings which proposals they carry to ccp they also dec
i support kal in the measure that someone can be supported that being said the problem i see with your platform is that you are a goonthis kills any independence because i dont think you will cross the floor to oppose them on anything and since the focus of csm is seldom market stuff md related stuff may not even come up for discussion and if it did what would you changeyou need to say concisely what you would actually do beyond fuzzy stuff like understand economics what makes a vote for you not just another vote for the 00 powerblocksthats my two cents anywaybut as someone else put it its not as if csm designs the game at most they bring up stuff to ccp with which is can or not agree like railguns working as intended in the recent minutesfinally you need a platform that captures the imagination for the whole game and excel and related issues tends not to be it
i do tend to agree with the bulk of whats coming out of the 00 candidates i also have a better understanding of the 00 economy than any of the other 00 candidates most of them have people in their alliances to manage the books run logistics and otherwise handle the softer side of being in 00im not going to be threatening to withhold my vote for what would otherwise be a good idea simply if they ignore my proposals what i would be able to do is explain why the things they might otherwise ignore because it doesnt affect them actually do have a second order impact on the things they care aboutthey are not mutually exclusive theyre two sides of the same coin written for different audiences the effective objective is still the same
get lost
you mean irony numbnuts
i edited these two points in your comment together since they hit on the same thingim running for csm isnt that enoughthe mittani cant come out and ban be from goonswarm for doing that alone but im not even allowed to mention that im running on our own forums or else bad things will happen to me for violating his orders not to split the vote goons are not even supposed to know im running let alone vote for mecustomarily there was always a primary within goonswarm to decide on who our candidate would be but then suddenly it was announced that primaries would be scrapped for his send mittani and vile rat to iceland planhonestly im kind of ed i wasnt allowed to run internally as id be better suited to run as a goon candidate than as an independent candidate who happens to be in goonswarm while theres an announced plan to take over the csmhad we had an internal primary the mittani is popular enough that he would have won but for the second slot i doubt vile rat would have the average goon doesnt know who he is or what he does thats why when you look back theres always a rather random goon if it was anyone other than darius johnson i mean who the hell is helen highwater ran in a primary lost but made a good case for himself and then won a slot during the next time around i dont see why i couldnt do that id be delusional or an outright liar if i thought any specific proposal had a snowballs chance in hell of actually being implemented im proposing that people vote for me for my way of looking at the things that will be covered by an nda and you cant even know about im sure thats not ccps super secret plan for fixing blasters telling ccp what they need to change doesnt work working with ccp on what they are going to change anyway is the way to be effective
on another note this csm election feels like an election for president of some elementary schools fourth grade class where one kid is promising less homework and more recess and im standing here going how about a bake sale once a month to buy new basketballswho are people going to vote for and whats more likely to actually work
making a topic in md asking questions about csm lets face it who could care less personally it sounds like work but hey we floats your boatall these topics tho makes me doubt your focus  confidence to make a decision thus doubt your leadership qualitiesyou are a goon ppl will see you to have the goon agenda same as your bondsdisregard goonsacquire creditability
thats probably the first thing id do hopefully i could get someone to sticky it up topim a believer that a thread should be on a single topic or sub topic if its large enough or changes enough ive never seen a value in having a 20 page thread that discusses dozens of different things theyre near impossible for people to get up to speed and very difficult to searchthis allows people to focus on whats relevant now and go back if the need to and find a page or two on a single topicare you saying that my candidacy is good for everyone much like my bondsyou may notice that avalloc did exactly that he dropped out of the goonwaffe corp two weeks ago when he filled to runpersonally i thought it was a bit too hypocritical for meedit grammer
id consider voting for kalrand though it depends on who else would be runningid definitely not vote for any of the official 00 lackeysas for campaign strategy ive heard that bugging missionrunners that ccp will nerf their profit if you dont get elected works
wouldnt be easier to get help from people here if you were talking about what your ideas are as candidate youre talking only about general things saying you will put economy before the rest but people will vote more easily for clear ideas than for obscure conceptshere you give me the impression that you want the place and after youll think about what to use it forif you may get md voices like that people outside md will hate this attitude and you know well that youll need also people from outside md block to be elected
take this crap where it belongs ffs  jita parkassembly hall
so this is basically goonfleet trying to steal md votes
the md elite get secret block votes so get a couple of them onside and youre home and dry
i kind of feel bad since youre spinning a convincing enough sob story but youre stuck between a rock and a hard place you have no natural constituency beyond maybe a few hundred you might get from md and even if that was enough to get you in it almost certainly wouldnt be most players are probably going to dismiss you and every other unofficial goon candidate as an attempt to split nongoonnonnullsecbloc votes in line with the mittanis stated aim of ensuring that the nullsec bloc seizes control over the csmsorry youre fedand tbh even if you did have a chance i think it would be profoundly unhealthy for one alliance to have three representatives on the csm
shrugi have no idea what your positions arewhat am i to support if i dont know what you support a summary not too detailed would be very nice of your ideas positions concepts etc doesnt have to be a wall of text but something of a set of bullet points would help
oh i think i have a post like that here
i think the rub for most people here is there is absolutely no way to tell if this is a genuine vote for the market and economy in eve or a back door vote to get another goon in the csmfor that matter how could anyone be certain that your intentions and vote on the csm wouldnt start out genuine but later under pressure from those above you in goonswarm could be manipulated for their 00 agendaif you can address and win over this argument i see no reason why md shouldnt back you
as the only md candidate theres not really any choice  if you want your vote to go toward pushing an md agenda vote for kalrand if you do not then do not its not like you can vote for anyone else in the hope they randomly push md at least kalrand is promising to do it whether he does in the end or not as for kalrands plea for help tbh you will have to throw some nonmd things in amongst your list and make promises of a delorean for everyone who votes because 99 of the eve population couldnt give a  if we have a more secure investment model or a way to create futures contractsgood luck hope you get to enjoy an icelandic holiday sometime soon
the csm not only raises its own issues but also provides an early sounding board for ccp to get feedback from the players perspective well the csm this does provide the ideal opportunity for a economically minded fellow to provide an early response stake a claim as the only proactive candidate heading off bad  at the pass while all the other candidates are just being reactive andor defeatisteves biggest economic problem is that dr gudmundsson is looking at eve for instances were it is like its rl economics when what hecsmwe should be doing is pointing out where it differs the most obvious flaw in his thinking is regarding the money supply there is little financial leverage in eve so whenever the economy needs to expand to embrace new content the money supply must be increased inflation should be controlled not from reducing the supply but supplying more prestige  to spend that isk on stake a claim as the only candidate with a good grasp of the eve economicsregarding capturing votes i think are in a catch 22 situation on the one hand handicapped by your lack of leadership endorsement to goon block voting and scepticism from nongoons because you are a goonwhen it comes to goons perhaps you need to think and act more like a goon and resort to goon style guerilla campaign tactics get into the other candidates threads and start slinging some faeces preferable the bigger the target the better if you win you will be forgiven they will be the ones coming begging to you if you lose well  man your a goonedita few policies to think about find some stuff players want or few can argue against stuff that is not featuring prominently in other campaigns1 make transports more accessible by reducing the skill requirement from industry v to iv this would improve logistics all round for everybody it would lower the barriers to players getting into lowsec2 reducing the standing requirements for jump clones this makes pvp more accessible it reduces the cost of risk of lowsec accidentsanything that gets new players into lowsec early reduces the risk reduces the fear is good for eve yes it helps carebears but others should be able to see the benefit

ahhh thank you ill read it overperhaps putting the link into your signature for a short time might make its distribution much wider and easier
well i can give what help i maytake a look at mittanis piece of fluff complete with a friendly picture of him and a dog that is how politicians do things if i didnt know of his garbage plan to hand csm to 00 i would probably vote for himyours is a series of impersonal points that are hard to relate to not particularly relevant to the population at large and not particularly alluringid fix that you said you have done political stuff then turn into a politician us vs them populist rethoric ccp is lying etc it workssecond start slinging  mittani supports or doesnt care about botting for instance there is the garbage about making csm for null lack of primaries etc all of those are valid points and if you are serious in that you are not a part of the goon block as you campaign they are points you should pressyou should also lose the we are not supposed to divide the goon vote garbage you got ed vile rat a random scammer got your seat or the one that would have been yours he is getting to go to iceland and goon support without running a primary or having to do anything other than promise to give mittens bjs where is the outrage where is the lovable underdog against the hipocrisy of the forces of evilyou know politics politiclastly mittens take over csm is not gonna do you any favors there is no getting around the fact that you are running as a goon on the year when mittens agenda is make csm a tool of the 00 blocksthere some couch strategizing
abovecertainly if someone wanted to play a game and relax from the sht of rl politics and logs in eve hes for a nasty surprise how a faithful and realistic representation of rl shoddiness that eve isand they keep telling me i should not try find
the thing is that humans are the same creature irl and in the game and there are certain things humans find alluring and convincing and things they do not that is true whether you are here or irlin the end it comes down to pictures of babies puppies fluffy sweaters and how your opponent is the devil himself there is through history little getting around thatby the way i have read your real life finance and eve thread and i like it
you cant have a campaign without a campaign team first thing to do is to convince interns to work for you second thing is to appeal to some vested interests who can back you with finance and influence third thing is to get a legend or backstory about yourself fourth get some more realistic policies that fit in with the platform of other power blocks while having enough difference to stand out and finally get some controversy going  hit a nerve somewhere
i could teach people about how to do this
you know the dog in mittenss picture he kicks that puppyyou wouldnt vote for a puppykicker now would you
most of the other candidates are chasing the 00 voting block none are targeting the highsec industrialist missions voting blocks which took somebody into second place last timethe other candidates plan for the 00 alliances to take over the csm is setting themselves up against pretty much everbody else in eve that will hand a seat to anybody who canwill effectively call them out on that
sadly for every character in 00 space there is a highsec industrialist mission running alt
thatd be very hard for kalrand to do considering his background
there is undoubtedly a large constituency that kalrand could appeal to as his base  not just for votes but for organisation and financing theres little point in kalrand defining his position as contra the zerosec position  he wont get those votes anyway and it will just reduce his tactical influence if he does get into the csmthe important thing is that there is a clear hisec economicallyoriented constituency that needs representing and that can contribute not just votes but also organisation and campaign workthe question is whetherthe candidate and his policies will be sufficient to mobilise what is potentially a quite large vote to develop my point earlier i think that some form of party politics will always be inevitable in a parliamentary system as proved by the triumph of party machinery in all elected houses since the 19th century im willing to help you kalrand in performing some of the duties necessary for you to run for office
my four accounts wont be voting for you
regular communications along with the fact im a pretty chill guy i got along swimmingly with csm3 so i dont see there being any issues with csm6 the success of the csm will depend partly on having a good team of people to work with and confront ccp on issues with the game
what would you do in a hypothetical scenario where the rest of the delegates seem to have a consensus about an issue being a bad idea but you have a different or opposing view would you be that guy who gives ccp the ammunition to say well this idea met with some approval from the csm by voicing your neutral or positive opinion
it really depends on the issue lets say we have 8 csm delegates who are nullsec players and ccp asks if theyre cool with level 3 missions being moved from highsec to lowsec because i am there to represent empire players and i would yell my disagreement despite whether nullsec guys agreed with ccp harmony will be important when were taking issues to ccp that we feel needs immediate attention
1 empire space is a term which refers to all space claimed by one of the nonjovian nonpirate factions moving missions from highsec to lowsec is not moving them out of empire2 nullsec guys would not want highlevel missions moved to lowsec not counting the guys who botrat in nullsec a good chunk of nullsec players earn money with highsec missionrunning alts others run missions in highsec to grind standings for datacores or for their market alts moving highvalue missions to lowsec is not a good idea for anyone because lowsec sucks and has no reason to exist3 so the answer to my question was yes thats why youre not going to get my votes the success of csm5 has been a result of cohesive and unified responses to several key issues fracturing that unity will return csm6 to the irrelevancy it has seen in past terms you are bad candidate
1 you are distorting things the people who run level 3s would not want to venture into lowsec for them heck they would prefer 4s and 5s all in highsec 2 we were talking hypothetical here 3 are you trolling here seems like you are i gave you a hypothetical scenario where my opinion would be different than the group
why did you leave goonwaffe two weeks ago are you running as a spoiler candidate trying to split nongoon bloc votes during your first term as a csm delegate you came across as being affable but like everyone else on that council ineffectual why do you think you will be able to do better this time around you talk about lowsec but your corp history indicates that you have no meaningful experience of living there why do you feel that it is broken given that it is on a persystem and percapita basis both the most denselypopulated and most violent nonhighsec space in the game
i left so that i can distance myself from goonswarm there are enough people pushing the nullsec message and i want to represent empire interests for this csm term not at all my motives for running this time are genuine just as they were in past elections the csm is a learning process previously we had 6 month terms which really werent enough time to get much of anything done you had one meeting with ccp and that was it im recognizable by the developers and have spoken to many of them in the past this is helped by having been to three fanfests and my one term on csm with having a whole year to the term there will be plenty of time to work with ccp and my fellow csm to improve the game for the customers ive been playing the game for over 7 years now while avalloc has never been a lowsec pilot ive got alts who have utilized lowsec plenty for a nullsec player it is where they must pass through to access highsec and highsec players only go there when they must i want to see ccp put some serious development into lowsec and give highsec and nullsec people some to envy the potential play lowsec could give thank you for the questions
500m that lacks dedication if that is all you are putting up my deal from last year still stands 250m a vote if i get successfully voted onto csm
this isnt anything new tamber had the same thing last year a lotto and picture competitioni also have these this year too i had planned the same imagery as you but ive changed it so that there is no conflictp looks fun i will take part p

what is your position on directors particularly as to whether or not they should hangwhat will you do to ensure that i am able to smoke weed in space with the next expansion
yes i will post here more so yes
i feel as if half of goonwaffe is directors now so i dont think we have enough rope but if weed was legal we would have hemp rope so i hope that answers your question
due to rl work and family wise time constraints im forced to drop this candidacy i had big projects and ideas for eve that would had required alot of my rl time and i refuse to run just to be an average candidatei wont be supporting any other candidacy but i feel that your vote matters so i plea everyone to vote in someone the more votes a candidate has behind him the greatest moral empowerment he has behind him when he discusses things with ccpbest luck to all other candidates running for csm6
thanks best of luck to you too in your rl projects

when i watch clear skies it makes me want to buy a widow then i wake up edit supported for some kind of improvement not really sure what since i dont fly them yet even though i have a character that can
after all carebears are gone how you goin to do your hard core pvp in your pod some of you ppl are realy dumb this game will die if there will be no carebears who build and buy your complex krap you bring from nullsecwell nvrm its just like talking to the wall some ppl simply never will understand
wow carebears must suffer is a little intense carebears do not need to suffer but they should not be completely safe and the same goes for suicide ganking it should be difficult which it is the system is balanced and the increase in suicide ganking is a result of high sec residents not taking adequate precautions to protect themselves insurance payouts on ships are lower now for many ships than they were in the past so that argument is not entirely convincing
supported
very good proposal yeah hybrids need to deal more damage boost damage at long range at the expense of poor long range performanceie quake 3 arena  rail gun does 100 damage enough to kill someone in one shot yet it rearms slow and is very difficult to control at short range especially when somebody is jumping around yourails are high velocity slugs that are propelled at the target
i support this ranged ammo for blasters is so pointless considering theyre a closerange weapon void is now proof of concept for low tracking  more damage so you can only use it if your target is fully tackled and youre not zipping aboutthe range variant for rails i actually do use in missions however the ammo is the same between both guns so perhaps some further thinking therehybrids  gallente need somethingedit checked support
fix these and ill resubscribe
hear the cries of the masses ccp
i wrote a petition regarding this issue they replied i should quit eve if i didnt like their new portrait system i wonder if ccp is aware that some people liked amarr portraits and now they dont like em anymore because of their new system anyway you got my vote
i support a change yes
heavily neededsupported
i have my doubts as to whether or not anything will change as a result of this thread but ill be damned if im going to give up fix gally ships and hybrids for both gallys and calds sakes
yes please
both gallente and hybrids work perfectlyltp
lol its not a vote if the only answer is yesbut i do support that hybrids or hybrid platforms not just gallente need some work in most cases to be on equal footing with the better weapon types
just incredible how long it took for someone to point that outamazing to see how many people give a 1 to such an obviously wrong approach to achieve a desired effectyou might want to adjust your proposal to something like 100 capacitor recharge
nice catch there i would change it to 100 capacitor recharge but sadly marlona sky account is currently serving a forum ban for a while so it wont let me edit it i hope people are able to read enough to know it was supposed to say capacitor rechargethat being said can i get a thumbs up on this now
strange idea but yessupported
like it
i agree sound like a plan
if you really want to support this idea you ought to check support this topic check here if you want to give your support to the ideadiscussion going on checkbox  its in the reply to topicedit post screenby the way i will keep bumping this topic until i die or until the idea is implemented into the game wichever comes first
i would like to be able to trade sec statusexample a character with some excess above 00 sec status could trade another player for isk sec status for isk
interesting idea how about going a step further  allow the player to determine how she is rewardedsomething like this remove rat bounties and instead make the rats drop tokens maybe the existing dogtags maybe some new item which can be traded in either for a sec status increase or an isk reward depending on who you hand them over tohow would that change things
the idea is to remove sec gain from 00 and highsec to make lowsec different make it feel at least a bit like a punishment when you are hunted all over lowsec trying to regain access to highsecwe dont need a simple shortcut like isk to undo criminal deeds
so this proposal is essentially an attempt to kick griefers out of high sec for a while so they can endure low sec instead of picking on highsec carebears
nope it is to give us more targets in lowsec
well with this same logic why does concord pay you to kill rats in 00 no we should not remove the security status gain from 00 rats because while it is lawless space concord is happy with you killing hostile npcs instead change the amount of security status gained as suchempire rats  100 security status gainnull rats 50 security status gainbasically the justification for this would be the empire rats are more of a direct threat to the empires and as such it should be encouraged to focus on taking on those rats the numbers are just off the top of my head you might want to separate out high sec and low sec and maybe not make the difference so much but removing security status gain in 00 entirely should not happen
not supported at allwhat a ridiculous case of selfinterest ccp bring me more targets to play with pleaseit is bad enough that the 00 alliance leaders main interest is forcing more people into their arena now the lowsec pirates are at it toooh waitdid i just fall for a troll oh well
what people advocating for myopic boosts to thier play style or nerfs to others play styles in mah assembly hallshockingthe cool part is that the trolls many times dont start out as trolls so you can bet there is a substantial amount of crying behind the poasters screens this makes assembly hall 100000x better than other forums
you dont need dual webs to hold a webless dramiel down in afterburner frigates rifter merlin tristan comet firetail and hookbill are a few examples that can do it right now without any special fittingsgiven 2 of the other 4 ships in the pirate faction frigate class have at least equal or even superior range control i dont really see what you are going at here
its funny that the pirate faction ship rebalancing and the rise of the dramiel came so soon on the heels of the nanonerf its no coincidence there always has to be an instant iwin option available for those players who see themselves as leet and are willing to pay to be so the dramiel keeps a lot of spoiled crybabies from packing in their eve accounts and going elsewhere you know the guys who always train for whatever is the most overpowered thing in the game and think that somehow makes them more uber in real life when the truth is they just arent good enough to win any other way if the dramiel gets nerfed its just a matter of time until ccp comes up with something else to replace it unfortunately

nerf dram boost burst and breacher
good man
so evidently its too difficult for pl to fit hyenas rapiers and huginns into their fleet dynamicsor is this prompted by our reimbursement program and its cutting into your kd ratios
strongly supportedim not too sure about the speed nerf yeah it does makes sense that a faction frig should be slower than nanoed ceptor but then you can get a mach to outperform a vaga in terms of speedagility  angelcartelother than that perfectly reasonable changes to make frigsize less about dramiel vs how do i trapfit otherfrig to pwn dramiels
no brainer reallyalso check the proposal in my sig  it caters to the same who like this idea imo
yes please
1dramiels are imbaand give afs a fourth bonus
bad troll wrong forum
 goons
its not a trollthere is a counter to the speed of the dramiel its called a stasis webifier followed by warp scramblers perhaps youve heard of them
many people have been doing that in this thread since its inception you just keep running around with your hands over your ears screaming lalalalalalal you are trolling you are lyingjust remember jump bridges are one of the contributing factors there will need to be several things that need to be adjusted some nerfed others buffed also just because you say that my argument is spurious does not mean it is a nerf is coming the question is will finnagain zero and everyone else who makes all aspects of their 00 life revolve around jump bridges be able to adapt to the change
hmmm  perhaps the removal of jbs is the boost to lowsec that many have called forjust wondering
explain to me exactly how boosting nullsec industrial is the least desired thing in game how would allowing alliances to conduct their business without a reliance on empire space be a bad thing for anyone but bots and empire miners if anything it will entice more empire dwellers the non missions runners to move out to 00 space and join an alliancemanufacturing in 00 isnt entirely safe as it is in empire so why should it not only be harder but more expensive to the point where the best option is to procure most material in jita
folks dont really seem to want to nerf bridges not because it makes any sense at all but because it will support their personal playstyles folks who cant incapcamp bridges want them taken out people who cant fight coalitions think that they can without bridges and so on
no it wont people live in high sec because they do not want to lose their assets thus only time they move into 00 will be when you can guarantee them safety for the same reasons trade wont growth in unsafe areas simply put production in 00 makes very limited sense which is good and finewhat makes eve online so unique and complex is that pretty much no one can be selfsufficient in a reasonable degree thus any motion towards self sufficiency is undesired
yeah i guess it is the same people whining for bridge removal now are the same who were crying for nano nerf they could not beat the nanos by numbers back in the day and now they are getting blobbed themselves so something needs to be nerf jump bridges and nanos are such i win buttons arent they i believe the big part is the ignorance they simply have no clue
pretty sure i have not once said that bridges should be flat out removed but they do represent a major part of the problem so some change to them has to be made how does making people commit in order to carve themselves a niche kill the game instantgratification is the domain of fps and craptastics like wow but eve has always been about sacrifice and that dreaded effort  part of it certainly but merely adds traffic not actual liveins low needs purpose for it to be all it can belet me guess you have zero sp in industry and get all your isk from the great null mint static sources sanctums and selling plexthe crap about safety is just that crap we have been debating that in the buff low threads and the consensus is that people dont bother because there is nothing to be gained  exact same thing for industry in null why bother when everyone comes to jitait is dead easy to achieve selfsufficiency all it requires is planning and hard work so anyone can do it  problem is that it is not something that can be done in a few hours which is why lazy bums balk at the mere mention of iton a corp level it is easier still so i can only assume that alliances could pull it off with nary a missed step  it is the basis of worm life for goddess sake and they do it without bridges and only intermittent access to the world at large
dont it is fine that all come to jita that is how it is supposed to beoh dear
what do jump bridges allow atm1 fleets can go from a  b instantly evading combat2 allows moon goo to be transported with ease which is produced passively anyway3 allows alot of space to be maintained however most of the claimed systems are emptywhy nc are complaining1 because maintaining alot of space will be hard as they will have todo 1 jump at a time2 they will have to pvp for a change3 because no one will want to fight 50 jumps away they will attack local people4 because it wont be easy getting from one silo to another meaning effort for a changethis is a game if you say it long enough you might actually believe it is i know you treat it like rl but in the end eve is a game00 is a major part of the game and just because broken mechanics allowed you to get where you are shouldnt mean all players should be affectedin the end pve  pvp go hand in hand if you want risk free pve move to hi sec there is absolutely no reason why anyone should not want jump bridges to be changed  nerfed
what do jump bridges allow atmfleets can go from 1  b instantly making the fights happen faster without spending hours of roamingallows moon goo to be transported with ease which is helping goods flow and economy passive mining is great as people can focus on fighting over moon goo rather than staring at rockswhat jump bridge removal wont changemaintaining empty spacehuh people will do fight 50 jumps away if there are no targets nearby the only difference will be it will be time consumingand once again 00 wont be harder just more time consuming and tedious those are 2 different things
onoeslarge alliances will have to make some effort to control the space they currently claim because of the forcemultiplying projection of power that jump bridges createkill the jump bridges nowas for the csm alliance based voting blocks got what they voted for deal
this is going to sound hypocritical but i do wish people would post with their mains the issue deserves better discourse then alts flaming the nc followed by finn calling every liars and telling them to post with thier main i dont expect my little white knight routine to change much though
it wouldnt change anything if you read back on the thread quite a few people have posted with their mains minigin for instance look for the green text and despite having far more experience in 00 and better killboards than finny he still ran the you are a lier and a troll act even when offered a conversation on voicechat to better understand himthe problem is that finny doesnt want any kind of constructive discussion i attempted that at some point myself complete with quoteblocks and ceaseless back and forth and have hence given upon it nothing comes of it his opinion is facts and real facts maps and logic are all lies he just wants you to agree with him else you are a troll a lier or whatever his meme of the day is this does not apply solely to this thread if you look on the forum you will notice that most anyone not agreeing with him is magically a trolli see a pattern there is finny the only good poster in an ocean of trolls or is he a troll with the mentality of a 6 year old who cant take no for an answer and thinks his opinion is facts solely for being hisi am convinced of the later at this pointhow did your civil discourse with him go btw i missed the post where he apologized for calling you an alt and had any sort of constructive discussion i might have blinked or somethingand did you notice that the last few pages have consisted of finny throwing ad hominem and appeal to authority at whoever be a main or an alt because now it seems that nobody is qualified to disagree with him as he is now officially the biggest authority on 00 in eveand if they are factually more qualified based on easily proven metrics they are deemed trolls regardless see miniginsome people just are impervious to logic arguments or facts finny is one of themyou will also notice the generous amount of weasel and loaded language he uses and his plain misrepresentation of facts and lies for instance as predicted grayscale is smaller and smaller now he is some random guy who happened to be at a csm meeting for no particular reason and spittled something of no consequence instead of a ccp developer and head of a ccp design department sharing ccps views at a csm and ccp meeting but thats but one example of manyi think the best of this thread came in the first few pages so you may want to hit those but due to finnys 86 quality posts a lot of people have plainly stopped checking the thread and moved the discussion to other venues like scrapheap
the problem i have with letting finn do his thing is people tend to believe spin jump bridges along with jump freighters and null sec industrial as a whole needs a look according to finnagain though everything is fine just because the feature is already ingame those who support it do not need to provide any proof that everythings fine yarrr look at your killboard you have no opinion on the matter rabble rabble everything is fine maybe those who havent lived in 00 will listen to finn and really think everything is fine i mean glenn beck has a load of rabid viewers does he not
i think the first preliminary nerf that ccp should do to jump bridges is to put 10 million isk cost to using jump bridgeany person using jump bridge should have 10 million deducted from their wallet if they dont have 10 million in wallet they would not be able to jumpwhile that rule is in effect ccp can spend more time redesigning jump and cyno mechanics for later patch this price tag on jb usage will help encourage people use traditional ways of travel without taking away the supersafe and fast option people wouldnt use it for trivial purposes
there are 2 bonuses conferred upon freighters based upon the racial freighter skills the first is a 5 per level increase in cargo capacity and the second is a 5 increase in max velocity the first bonus is currently the only truly useful one a 5 bonus in maximum velocity on even the fastest of freighters is laughable and pretty much useless considering that freighters spend the majority of flight time either aligning for warp or in warptherefore i propose that instead of a 5 maximum velocity bonus the racial freighter skill should confer a 5 agility bonus instead making freighter piloting for active flyers less tedious
supported  the speed bonus is useless
would make more sense than velocity bonus for suremake it 3 even if its considered too powerful with 5 still would take it over a velocity bonus any day
cannot support this hard enough
agility would make it a useful bonus
i never considered it but might that up to 25 speed increase cause a freighter to take longer to alignedit eft shows no difference between a skill of 2 and 5
this is a completely unnecessary waa waa make my life easier proposal
supportedand how about a few slots and some rig slotsallso the ability to pick up cargo i space
something i forgot even existed in the game as they were removed back in 2004 are mines they were removed for certain reasonslag issues for one and the fact that they could be spammed all over a gate to blow up ships as they come in is anotherthe mines are something i personally would love to see back in game with a few limitations howeverif mines were to come back1 no more than 5 deployed at a time so gates cannot be easily spammed with them and to reduce lag2 when placed they are placed randomly up to 2km from the placing ship and self destruct after a time period such as 5 minutes or when the pilot who placed them logs off or leaves system this will prevent concordokken on players that lay mines and go into high sec they also cannot be placed within a certain distance of gates and stations 15km seems reasonable for this 3 mines have the same 500m trigger range but a larger explosion radius mines will not decloak a  unless it makes direct contact or is bumped by the ship the explosion if detonated by another ship would declaok another ship however 4 mines once deployed are stationary and nonretrievable friendly ships can detonate them and they also do harm to all ships friend or foe alike 5 mines like bombs are restricted in high sec and are only deployable in nullsec6 mines are deployed by a mine layer device mines also show up on overview and in space as objects that can be targeted and destroyed if so desired 7 make mines only deployable by destroyer class ships give them some use8 one mine cannot be placed within the blast radius of another this will give space for some ships to pass without getting hit and prevent one mine from destroying another an idea proposed to me was to use the smartbomb mechanics that are already in place but as a stationary one time detonation item

yeah i know thats what i did and they edited it after it had been that way for over a week they also changed the tilt of my head which is what made it obvious that someone edited my character i know three people that have all had their characters edited to have their eyes opened when all three of us intentionally took photos of our characters blinking to get them closed as you pointed out it takes a bit of work and thats what has me a little hacked off about the whole thingsorry done with an alt instead of red
why nonsuppressible dont punish the rest of us because of your short attention span
ok you are misunderstanding me although its probably because i wasnt clear enough as i said i spend time in low sec and in null sec and i am fully aware that i can lose my pod there however my point which i forgot to mention is that i do these things because of the possible rewards of going into lownull sec im not going to leave my captains quarters and risk being podded for optional content sure id probably take a quick peek outside but after that the risk would not be worth it also i never said i use a shuttle in low sec i take many precautions whenever i can lag spikes are the only real risk to consider when going into low sec and its something ive managed to avoid so faras for the risk in high sec i said its more or less zero by which i meant nonzero but very close to zero im well aware of the risks as my first kill was a suicide pod for the lulz as you mentioned this is why i never fly around in a pod fair enough im just going off of the feel i get from eve concord is there to punish any criminals in a moments notice in space so why not in stations now i think its pretty obvious there will be a concord presence in stations but what doesnt make sense not even talking about lore is why they wouldnt just prevent any attacks from happening in the first place i dont know how the market is supposed to work lorewise so i cant comment on the boosters but i suppose its a good counterexample for things working logicallythe payout is higher than the cost of the insurance the difference of the two is isk being injected into the economy
i apologise if somone else mentioned it in 3 pages of text but it should be pointed out  fan fest when ccp was discussing walking in stations they said up front that walking in stations would lead to ganking in stations i personally would prefer a year or 2 of secondlife in space that gradually expands and removes bugs as they are come up ensuring that when ganking in stations comes out it runs smooth and flawless
i support this however i think a good implementation of this is beyond ccps current capabilities then again what seems not to be
supported
supportedtheres no reason not to do this and the benefits to the player base would be huge
how exactly does an absent portrait lock someone outand do you think that they will magically stop allowing you to create an incarna character if you dont have one yeticeland might not be krypton but its not bedlam eitherodds are if your computer cant handle the cc due to performance reason it wont have an easier time with incarna contentits your computer locking you out in that casetheyll certainly try to get the cc to run for everyone and they should work on that instead of creating random characters for people
it isnt the absence of the portrait shoopa when ccp announces the date for the end of the grace period all of us players who cannot access the cc will be lockedout of the game it has already been established that at that time if you have not created a new portrait you will not be able to log into the game  new character creator updateif you read the full op you would see that i completely agree that when incarna is launched we will have to either have our systems upgraded or just buy a new system see the warning that would be displayed when using the option but hopefully by that time ccp will have announced what the minimum requirements are exactly since that seems to be the big mystery at this pointas far as trying to get the cc running for everyone they have not indicated that they are even investigating the issue so how can we be expected to wait for a fix that probably isnt coming yeah they should work on that but they arent creating random characters for people is not a big problem there is already an option within the cc to use random settings if im not mistaken so the code is already in place all that needs to be done is to add that option button outside of the cc problem solved until incarna
i see your pointi still hope theyll rather fix the cc tho
idea is simple cooldown timer should be dependent on distance in ly beetween clonesfor example  you swap clone at the same station  you wait just few hoursyou swap clone to the distant part of the glaxy you wait dayspros  nerfs power projection  and makes eve relatively bigger promotes getting into pvp ships instead of sitting at station becuase clone has mining impalants gives player flexibilitycons   i dont see any  i still think people will die in expensive implants in their headtoo add to the proposal pod killmails could now include implants destroyedupdatei though about it know it could exploited by podding yourself on purpose  podding would have to bring the timer just like jump cloning  kinda sucks 
i approve this product better than current system at least i loathe whole jump clone system id rather have implant sets i could just change but probably never gonna happen
i would like the local switching to have an even shorter timer but otherwise supported the reason for the shorter local cooldown is that i would like to take eve more in the direction where i can just log on for 30 minutes do some the stuff i feel like doing at the time with the assosiated implant set and log out without suffering game implemented penalties because of it with a few hours cooldown i still have to stay logged on for hours if i want to avoid the penalties of the clone switch or alternatively not bother switching on most days i can only play at the evening and i cant afford to play for hours so hours long cooldown wouldnt be much of an improvement still an improvement though since i could do something else the next evening which is impossible with a 24h cooldown
approving the distance based recharge time 
few hours was just example  just to point out the diffrence i am fine with even shorter cooldown period in local area
im not sure if you can bump these but since its a small issue unlikely to maintain itself im going to do it to keep it in peoples minds
good idea here thoughts on something like a shield logistics array  only activates on a given ship once per long time costs pos resources to use maybe pulls from stront bay maybe depletes the towers own shield strength charges ship shields to full short range  have to belly up to the array to get the boost so it cant be used to supertank something thats currently in combatwould help defend a pos against superior odds if a ship could return to the forcefield for a rejuv otherwise sort of silly that you cant use logistics on a badly mauled friendly defender who is sidelined in the forcefield because you cant lock him in the forcefield
this is a needless gripe and impossible to implement all i can say is find a ship that isnt at such an obvious disadvantage for what you want to do no one is forcing you to use a buffershield tank if the shields were to recover instantly upon entering a ship in space there would be mass exploits of the mechanic shieldtank pilots would simply eject and swap ships with each other whenever their buffer was low and continue the fight as if theyd never been shot
it is not impossible to implement it already exists in npc stations and read the replies multiple ways to ensure it is not abused have already been suggested including ones that would not allow simply swapping ships with another corp member to give you full shields
not sure if it have been proposed before but i would  and i hope many others too  to see in game some factionpirate battlecruisers hulls hell even meaby destroyers as wellofc tumb up for my proposecyb
not sure if want the bcs we have are already pretty powerfuli would love pirate faction destroyers thodestroyers really need some love so theyre not used exclusively to run lvl1 missions and gank
players should also be able to build these things in nullsec andor wormspace

really neat idea but as said early on ccp may be afraid of ragequiters goons etc posting nasty stuff on the billboards1 there would need to be a 0tolerance policy on the rulesor1a the ads likely ought to be submitted through a gm or isd before being posted to ensure this couldnt happen takes more resources though this is the best but most difficult to implement option ads shouldnt take too long to review though after initial deployment wait for dt maybe use petition system2 billboards need to be a lot bigger to make this worthwhile hard to read text on them as isthis would be very cool though as many smaller corps and even some larger ones could benefit from being able to solicitadvertise their business without having to spam a chat channel or search for potential customers a billboard could potentially have three ads to cycle through in addition to the ingame ads of bounties quafe etc i think it would help the eve economy in general and as op said would provide an isk sink im certain people would take advantage of
the oh my god that isnt a wormhole problem could be circumvented quite easily by limiting the ads to text and a library of stock images similar to the way corp logos are created
since i started playing in 2006 this has been asked for the general consensus ive never actually seen a dev quote on the matter is that the developers who programmed the billboards left long long ago and nobody else knows how to work it maybe its worth diving into the archaic depths of the billboard code to make this feature work
i like the concept of this idea which why im supporting it im not sure on the balancing issues but like the way it fits in with eve lore gallente developing weapons to penetrate shields while the caldari focus on penetrating armour the gallente ships tending to have more structure fits nicely with that back story
and it is what nothing thats what you said
the effect on passive and active tanks is subtle but important and not necessarily bad im not sure if the op intended the bleed through damage to be in addition to the base damage or instead ofid be interested to hear the details from people suggesting that this would nerf active tanks the effect on active shield tanks is very different to active armour tanks i imagine this type of change would have a greater impact the use of resists active or passive
you keep arguing there is a differencename itif theres 5 dps bleedthrough through your tank against 500 hitpoints below your tank your type actpas of tank has relevance how
in a fight active tanks shoot for the long run effectively taking a lot more damage but repairing it againif damage bleeds trough youll get to an untanked part of the ship thus diminishing the gain that an active tank would have in a longer fight
good point i suppose that makes an impact in 1vs1 sometimes and pvm but in most situations should be negligiblein fact it might be considered an advantage to separate hybrids from the rest of the crowd a bit more
i think the difference is most obvious if you compare an active shield tank with active hardners with a passive buffer tankslets say you have a buffer tank of 1000 effective hit points ehp and no resists then lets say for simplicity you have an active shield tank with 1000ehp but 50 of that ehp is due to active hardners of the incoming damage 95 is normal damage and 5 is bleed through the buffer tank takes 100 damage but the active tank takes effectively more because 5 of the damage is applied without resiststhere are obviously far more factors but i hope that simple example helps
im glad people are discussing this topic  ive seen bleedthrough working on structures before so i know its totally possible in eve right nowthis could be considered a change in hybrid charges and not the hybrid guns at allbut theres different scenarios to consider solo and fleet activepassive and buffer and ive been toying with the idea of t2 ammo having having an increase to 10 bleedthroughi completely understand the difference between passive and active tanks as well as buffer tanks bleedthrough negates all of these because the fundamental change from current hybrid charges is the 5 of total damage that gets through to the next level of resistances regardless of the hp level that gets the other 95 bleedthrough is a consequence of penetration and penetration isnt something thats been regularly seen in eve apart from pve structures railguns dont have considerable alpha compared to projectiles and lasers and i dont think they should be otherwise they just become clones so trying to find a different flavour requires some obscure thinkingthe lore angle makes a lot of sense and as gallente and caldari have a considerably turbulent past it makes sense theyd devote huge resources to try and get the better of one another
the issue with this is that factors are the things that make or break a concept so understanding and including all factors needs to be the waybuffer tanks are never buffer hp only theyre normally omni bufferresist actives are part reppart resistim hoping that these encourage cooperative pvp as this is the area that eve excels at lol can imagine some will contest that especially large scale pvp theres also a large mostly unused area in repping that frankly doesnt get seen practically at all compared to shield and armor and thats hull reppingit would also make hybrids a new contender in fleet alpha and spur the integration of mixed shield and armor logi gangs in fleets
 what he said no im not his alt
sounds like someone owns a t2 dcu bpo and wants everyone to fit them on all their shipspretty sure this has been suggested before i guess the bleed through idea was part of the original design idea for hybrid weapons so said some old player in the original thread but wasnt implemented because it was overpowered andor made kittens cryhonestly i think bleed through would either do very little or cause so many people to complain about it on the forums that it would get nerfed to having no real impact i would have been a reasonable thing to have in the game if it had been in the game since the beginning as it is there would be too much crying about it if it was made in a reasonable way
there is a lot of crying about the current state of hybrids alsoi agree with a lot of what the op said lasers and projectile weapons have good alpha but railguns are left behind in the dust they need to be better long fighting capabilities if you are prepared to slug it out for several minutes then hybrid weapons should be the best choicewhile i can understand soem fo the concerns about active tanks is it really the end of the world if your ship is blown up after 6 or 7 minutes of constant shooting your tank would probrably be broken long before that ever happened the bleedthrough is really just an extra bonus for those extremely long battlescombat in eve is primarily decided in the fitting room if you want to coutner a blaster boat it may be a good diea to bring a single small armor repairer if you feel that the battle will be drawn out for a very long timejust my 2 cents
tbh on some shield ships u can still fit a 500 passive tank and have 1 low slot to fit a small armor repper that would protect you against any bleedthrough so no dcu involvedin that sense i think bleedthrough should be balanced so that t1 does 5 of damage done and t2 ammo should do 10 t2 hybrid charge use should just about have the edge over an equally sized ship thats dual tanked like the example given above also consider t2 gun training timestraining t2 guns takes considerably more than t2 missiles you can have t2 heavy missile skills bt cant use t2 standard missiles cant do that with t2 gunsand no im not an owner of any t2 bpos wish i had bt am not that old a character to have been a part of the bpo lottery of olde sadfacefacepalm
so now we just need to make armor tanks fit a shield booster to prevent hull damage liang

that wouldnt help at all or well it would help your aggressor
i couldnt find an unlocked dedicated hush thread about the local channel but its being discussed as a sideline in a number of threads and has been discussed in detail long ago in a galaxy far far awayand our local still sucksnow my copypastaed proposal i have picked up elements from a few suggestions no plagiarism intended also fee free to share your own ideas and opinions and if you have the mental capacity give reasons for disagreeing or point out the flaws with this suggestion actual content starts herei think peoples appearance in local should be delayed its a very easy fixthe duration of the delay should inversely correlate to the systems secas an example and i will say upper limit  i will use a base of 10 minutes10minutes  sec x 1010  0 minutes06  4 minutes02  8 minutes00  10 minutesbefore you show up in local automaticallyof course the exact base delay is subject to debate but there should be time to do something in a system and leave before you show up  depending on secthere should be additional means to get people to show up immediately but it should take a bit of effortyou only see in locala people you actually see or saw in system you have their transponder code visible till they leave systemb people who talk in local they send their transponder codec allies corp mates  fleet members should obviously also be always visibled people you scanned down you have their transponder code visible till they leave systemthis is the point requiring most of the work and careful balancing in combination with the base timernew or improved methods of gathering intelligence would be appreciateddepending on the amount of work ccp is willing to put into this there are various levels of complexity possiblein general this could involve new or upgraded modules skills andor changesadditions to the scanners both probes and directionaladditionally people discovered should be shared by allies  fleet matesthe time delay alongside this is easy to explain after tha many minutes your passive scanner should either have picked up their signal or the infrastructure like stations and gates did but they take some time to spread this information in lower sec systemsthis hopefully willirritate bottershelp pirates and carebears alike do their thingrevitalize lowsec by not having your presence revealed instantlylimit easy intelligence and add more efficient covered modes of operation to 00 warfare actual content ends herenothing in this post is supposed to be set in stoneplease note that im not a specialist on the matterso i dont address questions regarding cloaks and such hereim certain that will be a point of contention anyways
10 minutes base delay is way way way too much for your idea imomake it one minute that still leaves you with 30sec or more in 5 and below which is plenty enough to foil deaggro games or instasafespot isk botfarming
10 minutes is waaaayyyyy to long it basically makes local a tool for the attacker only then 10m is too short to do any real pve activity and most pvp gangs spend much less than 10m in a system what happens if you leave local within the 10 minute time frame a reasonable time would be about 10 seconds with such a time a quality tackler can use dscanprobes to scan down beltsanomalies and be in warp if not on grid by the time they appear in local everyone would appear in local as a 30s session change timer makes it impossible to leave system before appearing in local also this would also allow a shipgang a few extra key seconds of flee time between entering a system and being reported in system while this would make it harder on ratters they could still take many steps to help insure their safety aligning to a celestial after landing at a beltanomaly warping into the beltsanomalies at range intel channels providing reports from nearby systems etc note a 10 sec delay would be a significant boost to hunters a 10 min delay would constitute unlubed anal rapage with a chainsaw
not support even a little bitthe solution to local has nothing to do with changing current local mechanics the solution instead lies in the addition of a new scanning feature that would passively scan a sphere around your location and alert you when ships have entered or left this sphere the range of this passive scanning sphere would be based on a combination of things skill level ship type and additional modules the range that you would be detected by another players passive scanning sphere would also be based on these factorsi also believe that gate alerts indicating ship class not tech level would also be needed these gate alerts would be restricted to those that have sov of system
thanks for the replies first regarding the 10 minutes probably too long way too long maybe but it shouldnt be less than a minute i think which is 30 seconds in 05please try to distance yourself a bit from the idea of local providing usableobscure intelligence by itself within secondsits what the changes are supposed to rid us of making scouts and scanning much more importantthis makes me think ofpeople discovered should be shared by alliesfleet matesill add this to the opof course i dont want to see local ruineddeleted completely like some people advocateby there should be time to do something in a system and leave before you show up in local im not referring to mission running or anything but a gankflythrough shouldcould be possiblethis isnt a long shot from my idea is itif you added in modulesskills to what has been mentioned in the op this will amount to pretty much the same sans the scan range sphere around your shipthe point of changing local isnt to give people with 150m sp even more of an advantage  its supposed to address the abuse of the local channelreally currently it abuses itself mostly since its passivein that regard its your suggestion that blows but of course it could be 2x skills or so dont think we need more of those thothe whole point is to make it more difficult to judge the current situationdanger immediately without playerinput simply by looking at a damn channeltry to figure out whats good for the game and gameplay not what you wantalso a big focus lies in making lowsec more appealing to carebears so they can be reaped
bull if you want local delayed or removed make it the same everywhere and make wardecs interesting highsec isnt safe space and it should never be same restrictions everywhere
its not intended to make highsec more safe it makes highsec less safeand highsec is supposed to be more safe than lowsec and 00  i just try to continue along those linesi also figured that the whole sensorium in high sec would be more sophisticated something thats probably truehowever the tiered delay isnt necessary  a constant one would work just as well so dont get all worked up i just figured it would make more sense this way with concord and navy ships everywhere not to mention capsuleersinformation is bound to flow more quickly in empire
it wouldnt even necessarily mean it is more safe with a shorter delay highsec systems are lot more populated that means going through the local channel to spot hostiles usually involves a lot more effort than in a nullsec or lowsec system
i think really need local nerf but as ccp dev said before somewhere they wont be making changes without providing proper intel toolsi would like see something like1 reduce all solar system size so all celestial is within dscan range of sun or increase dscan range2 change dscan so it shows ship type pilot name and corpalliance ticker not redblue so people actually have to thinkcheck and as antibot measure so they cant just check for red pixel in dscan ui3 delayed local like wormholesov upgrades to introduce a timer that can make people appear 1min after entering solar system 4 npc sov has local based on faction standings so with a high faction standing you either will have a delay before appearing in local andor you will see others in local after delay
what he saidthis is along the right track of thinking
supported simply for the gist of the idea 10 minutes for 00 is too long but you should have the proper amount of time for a trained scanner to locate a target warp in and make an attempt at scramming the target unfortunately even though they could use other methods of gathering intel or at least maintain alignment with a warp off point there would be a lot of upset carebears if local were to be nerfed so the idea will probably fall on deaf earshow ever some sort of local nerf with the addition of manual intel gathering tools is a great idea
what happened to the old days of mining profit increasing steadily as sec status drops you know the days when lowsec ores were worth more than highsec ores by volumeif ccp could sort this out itd improve a lot of things in eve hell more people would have a reason to brave lowsec again its just not that tempting for new players at the moment and nullsec miningit used to be good enough to be a lure that had highsec noobs looking for a way to get to 00 that was one thing the original devs had right but its been screwed up miserably since
i have been playing eve for over two years now and having gone through patch after patch i get the sneaking suspicion that ccp doesnt give a damn about what we thinksince i started blasters black ops poss gallente etc have all needed massive overhaul and there are numerous threads on these forums about it and yet ccp hasnt done  about it instead they continue to release buggy content and refuse to fix current content and balance shipscsm came around and it sounded all good but i have yet to hear one of their proposals be inacted once again we speak out and ask for fixes but ccp just keeps on their path of broken new features and ignoring the bugspersonally i could care less about walking in stations and doing pi if they would just fix the bugs and balance shipsso the question is does ccp even listen or are they to busy rolling in piles of money to hear us
ccp do listen to the csm and have implemented many things that the csm have proposed there is a list somewhere but thats all the csm is really empowered to do offer suggestions  feedbackccp does seem to listen to what the csm has to say and takes that input into consideration when it comes to their development plans ie microtransactions but in the end ccp chooses what they will do and when they will do it even if that means implementing features the csm is openly opposed to while deferring things that the csm sees as critical
ahaha burn i really like the titlenow regarding the csm uh ccp probably listens but that doesnt mean they do as he says or change their prioritiesso impotent yes figurehead probably not
given that the orca is considered a capital industrial ship
i dont think i would agree to this1 the orca skill is way too easy to achievethus nobody would ever skill up to the big freighter 10 orca jumps vs 1 big one2 it would make everyone do tiny jump runs and the posibility of getting jumped and isk vs reward would fall thus giving a 00 corp more power over logistics coming to high seci liked the initial idea but i think if something like this were to happen then1 the skill for putting no a jump drive to an orca would have to be very long and the restrictions on cargo when this happens would have to decrease or notnot supported for those reasons
i do not support this i believe what you are looking for already exists its called a rorqual def more expensive but not close to the cost of a jf but will hold almost as much actually more if you are dealing with compressed ore
not supported
youre entirely incorrect ccp does not put any proposal through and even if they did we wouldnt vote the way they want us to just because theyre ccpthe example you describe shows that ccp is using the csm which is exactly what we need they come to us with an idea that they like a players perspective of do we like it dont we like it do we see any problems ccp didnt think of the csm gives ccp a place to get the players perspective on ideas while still being able to keep those ideas private because of the non disclosure agreement the csm is underdevelopers seeking player feedback through the csm is something that should always be encouraged
spacemonkeys alliance afraid of jump bridge change nonshocker do not be afraid of effort children
the issue is not that ccp isnt seeking feedback from players its that they think just a few people can represent the vast majority of players regardless of the fact that players voted for the csm
why is it an issue and are you sure ccp thinks that csm represent a large chunk of players who care and want an active say in how eve is developed the final decision is ccps anyway and they have other ways of getting info and feedback is almost always requested on upcoming changes so it isnt like the csm can dictate anything on its own or that others cant voice their opinion
7 of all the active accounts is hardly a large chunk of players and from what i recall that was the percentage of voters in the last round of elections if you add that most of the voters have more than one account it get even worse add that the person with the second higher number of votes was banned from the csm for a nda violation and you see how the csm represent a minority of the eve players that said it is working at is should it is a consultation organ they can suggest changes and can give an opinion about the effect of changes on the game from the prospective of the players
i would argue that csm isnt really needed at all why not implement direct voting for paid accounts instead youll get a much more accurate representation of what players wanteven the issues for voting can be voted for just pile all playersuggested issues into a separate questionnaire and present it every quarter year or so itll be a long one but since youd only have to do 4 of these a year i think most of us would go through the trouble and once again ccp would get a fairly accurate assessment of what players really want on individual basis take top 25 of that put it into the next implementation voting form and presto you now have a game where the direction of the development is largely influenced by actual players
the issue is not voting on concepts csm provides ccp with unique discussion with players that would not otherwise occur the players should vote into csm the players they feel have the ability to discuss adequately and reliably the pros and cons of ideas with ccp the fact that ccp wants this is a step above all other mmosdo not even begin to try to argue that the forums are a good way to get discussion out of players as it is an even smaller number of players that reliably reply on forums than vote on csm you also have a large amount of useless extremely biased contribution to most any threadcsm is the best way ccp can get outside discussion in a representative and fluid mannercsm is also fantastic publicity for ccp
nobrainer heredoubtful anything will come of it though look how long things have trundled along in their current waygrowing a community requires a place for new people to get informationask a question in these forums just about anywhere and it is a dice roll on whether the first to respond will help or flame you for ignorancethe unmoderated flamers and noninformative posts pile up generating a negative feedback that makes it worse as time goes bythe random lockdowns posted above are also a problemi stopped reccomending these forumsother than specific thread links to new people a long time ago i point them to eve uni or other sites where they have a chance at being answered in an intelligent and respectful manner
sometimes they do let a bit too much trolling go about but i like the eve forums the way they are ive been in other games where the devs instalock anything that puts their game in a critical light or any comment that they deem trolling and usually they dont enforce the rules even close to equally for all playersso in short no the forums are ok as they are
while i agree with this overall i think there are some forum areas that should be held to a higher standard  new player help and the assembly hall for example
bumping a great idea before my sub is up see you when the walking in stations is up and running on sisi
like artillery with short range that expends cap and mechanically acts like a missile with no flight timei like it low rof would go well with the idea that you hold fire until you are at facemelt range in such a shipedit  im also liking the idea of railguns as defensebypassing piercing weapons if the ability to pierce shields is too anticaldari make some  of the damage hit structure instead  this would have the potential to play havoc with pos siege mechanics however if not properly tweaked
seems rather dull and unimaginative so a perfect fit for a mission in evei almost simply assume theyll have some form of missions or tasks that would be a part of incarna already
please nopve in stations should be imaginative and if its going to be something like this id rather they toss it in the bin and think harder next time not this standardised drivel that was dull and stupid since point and click adventuresno more mailman missions

fypit is amusing to see you pull the this will cause more bots card if local and jump bridges are removededit you also just proved the point of how lazy people would move out of 00 if logistic power projection and the instant intel from local were nerfed it would be too hard for you and you are unwilling to adaptbut this all does come down to opinion on what 00 should be everyone thinks their version is the right one the more we debate the more everyone becomes entrenched into their opinion and the sounds of the opposing become more and more quiet in your mind
i wasnt being sarcasticplease nerf jump bridgeslocal too why itll give me a reason to finally quit this game as i laugh at those who want to live in the wasteland of 00
can i have your stuff
i missed the last csm election forum debates  was this what it was like last yearon a serious note this all seems to be reflecting real life politics very well sort of like the independent candidates trying to be positive the larger party candidates sometimes engaging in more aggressive heckling of other candidates etcbasically from what i can see i think the poster above is right in that ccp will be heavily focussed on ensuring incursions and incarna work as well as possiblethe really tought job for the csm whoever is elected will be to help ccp shape that future from the position that they are which i agree with mittani is not from a group of work experience devs they meet every so often also it will be to help ccp refine how they communicate with their playersalthough i have some reservations about the style of campaign that youre running whether it is you directly or friendsassociates on your behalf or at your request or neither you are quite true that improved communication between the csm itself and also csm to ccp is vitalhave you any plans for involving the rank and file player base more in things  crowd sourcing more frequently etcthe british government has a website where anybody can raise a petition and others can vote on it  i know that theres already mechanisms to do similar but dowould you support this  would you expand this idea or have you other ideas
voting for the mittani is the only assured way to get a sound effect which befits it totally
youre efficient you have my vote
i find the polarization here pretty funny in the time ive been in goonswarm mittani has unironically been an extremely effective and charismatic leader
my campaign style essentially has to be brutal and honest because im not exactly known for hugs flowers and kisses ive been pleased to see that the csm6 platforms are adjusting to react to my arguments and that there is less of a culture of ill fix blasters no really than before at this point you could probably replace theyre lying to you with most of them are lying or just shamefully ignorant the csm process already has a fairly serious mechanic for involving the playerbase with the assembly hall proposal system each meeting every csm can bring to the table a number of proposals from the playerbase for a vote however this presents a mechanical problem the csm has now upvoted almost every popular proposal from the playerbase which have all promptly disappeared into the backlogthe issue the csm faces isnt so much passing and upvoting proposals but finding leverage and power to attempt to cajole ccp into actually implementing all the good csmapproved ideas that have come up over the years that are languishing in development hell this is a subtle point well its not really but its election time and people are dumb that is missed by a lot of the singleissue voters pretty much every reasonable proposal out there has already been taken up by the csms and moved on to ccp this presents a difficult situation where csm6 may wish to pick four or five alreadyapproved player initiatives and use them as a fulcrum or at least try to so that ccp isnt inundated with 100 new proposals all of which can be dismissed if the csm rallies behind 35 issues and makes their intentions known to the playerbase it might make for more effective negotiations with ccp well see though the exact methods will probably depend on the personalities of the ccp interlocutors how you approach someone as rationalistic as torfi is very different from how youd discuss something with ccp sreegs
calling a game designer from ccp an idiot is pretty stupidccp can listen to you or not as they want if you think that you will be able to force them to do what you think youre just stupid ccp will just silence you because they can there is no battle to fight against ccp and if there were one you cant win it putting it in another way csm5 achieved so much because they worked a lot to get trusted by ccp and cooperate with them you are just promising to screw it up what a genius
i like your style very much but im yet to be convinced about your substance can you offer any promises that you are going to be a genuine voice for the players in general as opposed to just goonswarmnc00 delete as appropriate specifically
i searched for the quote an idiot and failed to find any did you just make that up by yourself
here and the linked article is full of venom and madness you cant really think ccp is going to work with one that does so much against them csm will never have control over ccp period mittani wants to go to iceland to fight ccp thats just a silly thing to do you hate too much dude
venom and madness want to fight ccp please youre projecting
how can you accuse mittens of being hateful have you not seen his puppy
as i mentioned when you inquired privately about the csm proposal process the other day all proposals which pass the csm vote are submitted to ccp for review and then they respond to csm with yes or no yes means an item goes into the backlog for future consideration no means it doesnt occasionally there is some clarification discussion with csm before they decideeither at a summit in a session devoted to discussion of backlogged items or else in the internal csm forums once in the backlog csm items can then be included on the csms prioritized development list which is submitted to ccp in time for its release planning meetings that are scheduled twice a year during csm5 summit dates were adjusted so that timing of the summit coincided with the release planning schedule backlogged csm items were the focus of trebors crowdsourcing activities in assembly hall that aided in prioritizing csm items for release planning meetingsfunny little story about the csm backlog we learned at the june summit that no csm items in the backlog were tagged as such there was no way to tell what was a csm item and what wasnt according to our advocates so we requested ccp commit to identifying a methodology for tagging csm items then tag them and get us a list of all backlogged csm items they committed to do this by a date just shy of the december summit no one  including technically savvy players from the evedev channel on irc could understand why it was going to take six months to complete that task there were only  200 backlogged csm items after all neither private communications with ccp folks nor interaction on the csm internal forums impacted progress the message was repeated that the task was being worked and wed have the list by the promised date finally a player from the evedev channel took it upon himself to download a trial version of hansoft the tool ccp uses for backlog mgmt set up a databse and enter all the items dug up from evelopedia and teadazes database it took him approximately 812 hours total we presented the results of this experiment to ccp and asked how come its going to take you guys months to do this we got our list quite soon after thatpoint of that story is certain kinds of pressure management work better than others transparency is always required communication is a two way street
no please link a pic of dbrb
the mittani thinks hes good at managing peoplebut lets face it running goons isnt about leadership but more about being a kindergarden nannythrowing a hissyfit and tantrum wont work with devs and reading his garbage i see thats the only tactic he will be using voting for a goon any goon is something only the mentally challenged will doergo other goons
you do realize that someone who throws hissy fits would be irreverently mocked by goons and that as a result that cant possibly describe the mittani right or do you have no idea who goons are outside of some mean guys who scam people in eve online the popular internet space ship game
nicely said although mittani never did lead goons until he got fired from his job which was only recently all the work put into making goons something was done years ago when mittani had little input ofc after years of brown nosing and previous directors getting sick of him he decided to take charge become a renter in the north and now believes he achieved something from becoming a renterinb4 someone says unironic hohoho 
ive met chronotis he did a ed thing with the tech bottleneck it is the case hes a nice enough guy but the implementation of the dysprom tweak was shortsighted unless youre part of the tribal liberation force csming isnt a job for a sycophant sorry kiddo
i run one of the meanest and most politically effective powerblocs in the game but you wouldnt know that because you probably have no clue what its like to be outside of the roleplaying forumsthe hilarious bit is that for all your words about how smart and cunning and dangerous you are youre not on a single killmail anywhere anyway as far as management goes the entire cluster is well aware of my capabilities as is everyone who used to be in it
holy god pause the thread everyone go look at this at first i was just who is this toolshed and it opened up a yawning gulf of everincreasing idiocytheres poetry in there
i hardly think a drake army fleet qualifies for powerbloc considering all it had to prove itself was an already failing alliance which was blobed out every single time
110 you didnt even get the fleet doctrine right
umm maybe not and i rly cba to go through the kbs right now however the second part is true and you can pretty much ask any it member the alliance was long dead before your coalition even invaded and some1 even told me that the only reason they fought you for the 3 odd months was to get their supers in delve build after that happend x13 and finfleet and dice packed their bags and left im sure a spy master like yourself would know that
it was all over the news and forums that maelstroms were the flavor of the month how did you miss that
sounds like you and your jerrymandering cronies have got this whole thing stitched up
sadly enough you actually think goons matter and even worse if you think goons are known for being mean and political effectivethe only thing goons excelled at is being utter s whos only pleasure was and still is ruining the game for others and getting alts into other alliances to then expose their forums etc isnt political its just another proof how pathetic people are who need to metagame to the extreme cause else they might actually have to play the game sadly enough i am not allowed to post my personal opinions with my main due to some higher echelons are afraid you might throw one of your hissyfitsalso thinking killmails is the only part of playing eve just proves once again your narrowmindedness and yes we are well aware of your capabilities and thats the main reason why people outside goons should avoid even thinking of voting for yougoons will vote for you no worries we all know goons cant think out of the box proof enough with the flood of unimaginary copy paste job scams in jita
hey there mittinsthank you for reminding people of what the csm really is and just as importantly what it isnt the people who promise to fix everything and turn eve into a paradise overnight are full of it and have no idea what theyre really doinghow exactly do you plan to do this the csm has zero power ccp can abolish it on a whim ccp doesnt answer to the csm its the other way aroundbeing manipulative is a wonderful skill to have and i have zero doubt that you are highly skilled considering what you have accomplished in game but i dont see any leverage here your presence on the csm with this kind of agenda  the promise to be a bastard  could do more harm than good and cause ccp to take the csm even less seriouslyunfortunately you sound a lot like the new york union lawyers i have worked with whose style is extremely confrontational in the end both sides lose and the only person who wins is the lawyer when he walks away with a gob of cashhaving someone so iconic to eve on the csm is appealing youre obviously very intelligent and capable with an excellent knowledge of the game of eve and the metagame of eve but with this kind of attitude im afraid of what the end result will beitt people who cannot distinguish between an uncompromising selfadmitted bastard which i respect in many ways and an insane psycho axe murderer who wears black and writes poetry about the deep dark abyss of his soul monkey please stop posting forever
perhaps unexpectedly i actually think that mittens would be a very valuable asset to the csm he will undoubtedly be voted in because of the sheer power of the block voting sytem hes employingmy concern is more that whilst mittens would be a valuable asset to a balanced and diverse csm goonswarm and the nc have instead cooked up their little plot to fill the csm with carbon copy clones of themselves for in game advantage hence why i felt duty bound to standmittens yep hed be good the whole cynical csm takeover thing not chilldemocracy in action  open vote to decide my csm priorities
youre missing the pointit took a combined goonswarm and nc blob to take down bob 2 years ago despite the alliance being disbanded the war still lasted for almost a year now mittens mighty powerbloc took somewhat 4 months to beat the same guys i mean it didnt even fight for delve now this is just my opinion but it seems more like that mittens coalition was kicking a dead dog calling that a victory is just well pathetic he spoke of i quote one of the meanest and most politically effective powerblocs i ask on what bases is he making that claim do we need a reminder of what happened to the original goonswarm alliance admitted the mittani didnt run that one but he is a goon after all cut from the same wood as all the other goons
are you suggesting he can walk on water got my vote
an excellent question so good that ill drop my nocaps tildeposting gimmick for a moment to answer it i dont think that tablepounding accomplishes anything when i promise to be a bastard that doesnt mean that i will abandon the subtlety and cunning with which ive murdered my way across eve for so long with im a student of influence ive studied pretty much anything involving the topic from the cialdini books to behavioral economics i do intend to be a zealous advocate and attempt to grow the power of the csm but that doesnt mean throwing tantrums or behaving in an unsubtle or counterproductive way all the same ive made my intentions and ultimate goals clear  to be a hardline player advocate and quash idiocy  but as ive mentioned in several posts in this thread the methods involved will be circumstantial it might help assuage your concerns if you know that my political idols are sir humphrey appleby and the master of the senateera lbj incidentally anyone with an interest in power and manipulation should read the robert caro biographies of johnson immediately beyond that ive downed a tremendous amount of alcohol with ccp staffers over the years im not going to suddenly start behaving like nikita krushchev banging my shoe on a podium
from the outset ive said that id be perfectly happy to see representatives from hostile alliances on the csm the issue isnt who is shooting who in the game but competence what you dont seem to understand is that the issues confronting nullsec  friendly or hostile  are the same a competent nullsec rep from awagon such as seleene or from the drf such as krutoj or death isnt going to have a wildly different perspective than your pet conspiracy theory but the csm is less about upvoting proposals which is presumably what youre worried about in conspiracy land a voting bloc in this day and age because csm1csm5 have upvoted pretty much any issue the playerbase can think of by now the real issue is the goddamned backlog where all those playerapproved proposals have gone to die
i find myself doing the same thing realize you have ended a sentence with a preposition then go back and fix it only to find that a preposition is still what you have ended the sentence with
lets forget for a moment the content of your toughts if that implementation was good or terribly wrong your sayingi am the strong man you want for the csm ill kick their ass vote for mesounds really like a populist try to ride the discontent we dont need charismatic leaders on the csm we need analytic and reasonable people to do a long and tiring work like trebor did if you are elected and you act as you tell us we are going to miss csm5 and all what they did
bump
not really keen on the new portrait  but your ideas are good and you were one of the few decent csm last termhopefully you will get in
what do you think of small entities in 00why i ask i am not sure about the fact that a nerf in logistics will actually split coalitions i would like a set of nerfbuffs to encourage local production tough but if we want small scale pvp to happen more often in conquerable 00 we need small entities there and by small entities i mean corporationsif independent medium sized corporations are allowed to live in conquerable space it will be far more interesting wont iti think that there are a lot of ways to allow independent corporations to live in 00 without having them competing with obviously stronger entities about sov outposts poses here are some possibilities and many other could be thought of so in conclusion what do you think of this vision independent corporations in 00 conquerable will bring a lot of small scale pvp there00 farming landscape will be more rich and deep large entities will control outposts moons supercap production small entities will ninjamine ninjafarm do piracy small scale industry strong entities will battle against eachother about big things or try to hunt small entities and succeeed sometimes while small entities will fight against eachother or do piracy or harassment on the space owner same space 2 radically different ways of living in it 2 levels both possible for a lot more small action in 00
if by 95 of game time you mean work in team play with other people then hell i say twice yes00 is far too much safe than it should ever be that must be changed and then youll get more pew pew than you have right now but i would like that the actual abilitys of large fleets to move from here to there change a little bit more than just some clicks and i blob you here and i blob you there
the body is nice though dthe more entities you have in zero zero not blued up to  the better because it means conflict if people can make isk reliably and find pvp close by the need to blue up thousands of people disappears if at the same time the ability to move huge fleets across the galaxy in mere hours is reduced it means a lot more local conflict without half the galaxy involved so yeah what you just said there id consider that an awesome future for 00
i will be participating in the lost in eve csm6 debate this weekend if you have questions for myself and the other csm candidates participating you can submit them via their website
thanksi am currently spending my time in eve running around between major hubs shaking hands and kissing babies everyone should feel free to convo or join channel treborcsm
hey trebor great job on csm 5 hope you make it onto csm 6 you have my vote
i cant predict how ill deal with that possibility because each situation is going to require a response based on the facts of the moment its very important that the people elected to csm 6 understand that the bull grandstanding and me me me politics and attention whoring that have been demonstrated by some previous delegates isnt going to work anymore ive seen this process from both sides of the fence and i have a good idea of what ccp thinks of certain types of csm members that dont seem to care about the fact that they are on a council and not there to promote just their one favored version of game play in evefor months i have been speaking with both past and present csm members and soliciting their feedback as much as possible i believe that many of the the csm 6 candidates know how important it is now to be informed and are doing the same kind of homework they are looking very hard at the past csms and will base their approach on what seems to have worked and what has obviously failed if i am elected i am going to work with other likeminded csm members to ensure that we take our predecessors hard earned lessons about dealing with ccp to heartheh when i look at the list of candidates running this time around i think there is a good chance that csm 6 is going to comport itself much differently than past councils in terms of establishing communications amongst ourselves when you get people who are longtime alliance leaders or real life professional managers or both on a council like this were going to play csm much the same as we play eve there will be organized skype  ts meetings analysis of enemy fortifications plans of attack and then execution if it sounds much like the csm is going to war well perhaps its an apt analogy if you look at some of the other campaign threads in this forum youll see at least one common theme among several  that of forming a proper united frontso when ccp moves to isolate the csm it becomes the responsibility of the elected members of the csm to do everything in their power and use all of their experience to bring the concerns of the people we represent to light my former status as a dev and the working relationships i had with people who are still there will count for something when there is a situation like that if ccp chooses to run for the hills as a member of the csm i will call them out on it keep the community informed about it and track it so that those trends can be demonstrated in no uncertain terms i will work with the other csm members together to be relentless in pushing for communication with the players on key issues even if there is no responseat the end of the day no one can force anyone in ccp to communicate with csm but i will certainly make sure there is a record of our attempts to try preferably ccp will choose productive engagement with csm 6 theres no reason to make this process unnecessarily difficult
what are your thoughts on jump bridges 00 logistics and power projection
while you probably will be my choice for this election that emphasis about an united front worry me a bit sadly it sound too much like we will unite and support what the majority of the csm want all other issues be dammed no manpower to lose on secondary issuessecondary issues have an habit to be abandoned in a ditch for years and even it they are minor things from ccp and the csm point of view they tend to fester and make a section of the player base unhappyexamples are the hybrids issue afs the sorry state of missions and soloable pve and so on
one of the most serious candidateswishing you gl and see youat that csm6 with rip i think you guys can do a great job together
seleene seems to be a good choice  approval from some known guys no one trolling like others threads nor zombies agreeing was able to convinced me than being an exdev was good for us here hes pretty good for writting big wall of text and explaining things i mostly agree with his vision of what need to be done he seems trustworthy and enough neutral iggot my vote
if there are various different activities to gain sec status in lowsec it would be great i just dont want to see anything sec gain related outside of lowsec just to give it a bit special flavour
i blogged about my thoughts on what incarna looks like shortly after the most recent dev blog was published would i like to see some form of pvp in incarna absolutely however while i dont think were ever going to see anything in eve that resembles a shooter game inside of stations there is certainly room for incarna to expand its horizons to include things like espionage smuggling or sabotage kill clones  station services etc if we are going to be forced to use incarna which looks to be the case unless something changes then i dont want it to be all smoke and mirrors i will certainly push for some element of danger and usefulness to come out of the feature otherwise it wouldnt be eve
hes in a corp named thundercats based on that alone he probably deserves an ambassadorship to a small european nation at least
thanks guys and if you were wondering it was a very angry male african bull elephant but meh nothing that cant be handled
second post updated
i do have a strong opinion about supercapitals i think they should all die supercaps cause so many balance issues for this game and i feel they make people feel they have to botrmt in order to even compete this isnt to say that people wouldnt do this otherwise but i do feel that people are more likely to seek illgal isk generation mechanisms because they feel they have no other realistic avenue to compete in the eve endgame which has taken an unfortunate shift towards supercap heavy fleets in the past year and a half dfm if you read my platform youd see i largely am pointed in the same direction as you you seem to think that were happy with the state of 00 and want to somehow sneak in and cause it to continue the way it is were not id actually welcome your ideas on the subject if youd like to have a serious talk about it however if youre just here to throw stones let me know and i wont bother 
while they clearly dont if you wanted to make fleet combat less common and make high end logistics harder this would be the way to do itjump bridge nerfs will only impact member level activity inside alliances and make 00 activity less practical without a blobif only we had a some kind of council that could make this startlingly obvious point to ccp oh wait
to the idiots saying were trying to have deklein and nc control the csm are idiots were trying to get all 00 alliances in on this even pl and it were contacted to get csm reps

do you think drakes should be nerfed
internet lawyer said do you think drakes should be nerfedno the drake and other bc for that matter provide a versatile and strong platform that is relatively easy to get into and has a lasting potential to it players still rely on the bc even after they have trained higher skills and go on to fly bigger ships with the proper skills and loadout the drake can be a pain to take down but as i lost one yesterday they can be taken down same thing could be said about the other factions bcthanks for the questionand thanks to legal assistant for catching the typo sorry you didnt like it but at least you watched it
there i updated the video with a patch and people say i know nothing about how eve works
you may not want to include relevant facts in your discussions but why you disabled a very popular app when it was clear you couldnt make money off of it rather than opensourcing it is something that folks will wonder about especially since it indicates something of a mercenary attitude after all if you wont opensource a product that youve already earned dev cred for since you cant personally benefit from it anymore and refuse to opensource it to help the community whats to say that youre not looking for time on the csm as resume building experience as long as it can help you personally and not really interested in donating your time to help the community to say nothing of the fact that its more than a bit odd for you to claim it isnt a part of your campaign discussions you ve spent a bunch of text talking about how youve interfaced with ccp surely youre not saying that you did all that for something other projectwithout actually addressing your reasons for doing what youve done it sets up a dangerous precedent as for datacores if datacore production was a major issue that the csm was expected to advise ccp on then yes it would be a big deal if some candidates had no idea what a datacore was how you got it or why it was necessary its also somewhat off putting that youre comparing the total reworking of nullsec logistics and capital combat maneuvering mechanics to datacore harvesting
personal attacks removed
i asked my own alliance ushrakhan to explain it to me we spoke about logistical advantages for fleet activity how easy jbn make it to trap an enemy fleet or escape from one low upkeep costs they dont appear on the overview etc etc there are a lot of reasons why nullsec alliances love jump bridges thats for surei also spoke with three other alliances i received pretty much the same information leading me to believe that the information my own alliance provided was relatively unbiased thats the key for me really there are always two sides to a story and in the middle is the truth i want to work with the csm to provide a solution that is best for everyonecsm delegates should be expected to understand the mechanics theyre offering feedback on yesisnt there a major difference between grid and system overviews almost everything interactable in the game is available on grid overview its obvious that wasnt what he was referring to is there some xml trick already to get jb on system voerview
i could elaborate this point and talk about how every alliance knows the location of every other alliance jbn and more than likely the passwords for using them it would reinforce the point about how broken that system isthanks for the support
i endorse manalapan
to all of the goons i do not have any experience running alliance logistics myself nor do i have the incentive to do sohowever if a supply chain is well established new goods can find their way into nullsec with disturbing easeas to how interalliance politics will propagate should the massive powerblocs splinter i have no idea and thats the point if massive wars break all out all over nullsec i think that can only be a good thing blowing up stuff is fun rightas for your point mariathe income margin in nullsec is several times that of highsec true highsec mission running is a very safe and constant income especially when compared to null but theres still a differencethat said nowadays when an alliance wants to settle itself in null it either need to have decent relationships with established alliances or otherwise it would get crushed in an instantwith changes to jump bridges and comparable means of transportation its true that the logistics needed for moving would become more difficult but this goes for both of the parties you can only transport tcus in freighters anyway on the other hand the invading alliance does have a bit more of an advantage in the initial stages since theres no possibility for the extremely fast force projection from the other side of the region that you have now
very nice read dont mind goons they have been ordered by nc todo 2 things1 degrade anyone nonnc with cliche memes2 vote blindly for anyone in ncthe funny thing is you know more about 00 than any nc csm candidate despite not knowing much
ive done some research in this whilst mission running is not my thing level 4s appear to make equal or more than ratting in belts in 00 will it may be that anomalies change that slightly though asking around people disagree l4s are considered to be as good as anything 00 offers but how exactly do you expect anyone without a titan to move tcu  ihub  upgrades through hostile as i said it would have to be a barely used backwater system for us space and you wish to make it harder there needs to be a rebalance focused on boosting nullsec and making it easier to get there sure make some logisitcs harder if you believe that will break up the powerblocs though i am not sure i would turn on people i had fought along side in battle many times just for the edification of ccp  but everything you do needs to be considered from the point of view of barrier to entry we have a carrier at our disposable and jump freighters are not an option lower the barriers increase the traffic flow make the risks balanced by rewards
the only difference that youll have with seminerfing cynos would be that youd need more jumps to cross the same amount of distance compared to todayif you were to prepare well you should be able to use a quick succession of jumps through potentially hostile spacewhile doing this any agressors will have a harder time getting a bead on you seeing that they too are faced with an increased number of jumpsof course with them being the defenders they have the advantage of having established poses but this is the case in any combat defenders usually have the advantage over attackers
willing to throw my bad posting vote in for kalrand

this is wrong because of your clear lack of eve online knowledge im voting for twigand berries
my signature is green my characters background is green and most of the things in my refrigerator are turning greenwhy would i say anything otherwise
in reverse order    because normal sequential thought is for orderly people good question and i think it is hard to see the causes of burnout from the outside i think some of it is along the lines of mr smith goes to washington where they come in having very high hopes of making a big difference and then slowly see those hopes erased for others it is the border between this being a game and a hobby when it begins to look like a full time job and all you get is grief from folks you cannot even tell the important things to because of an nda    well that would wear you down i teach high school i am used to doing a lot of work and hardly seeing anything come of it i have dealt with bureaucracies and rules confidential information and the frustrations of knowing what should be done but being unable to do it maybe that will protect me    but i think my real defense is that i am a stubborn old guy who has won and lost enough in his time to be able to take the good and the bad in stridelong term things now understand these are not things i promise to do that was not what you asked me these are things i would like to see worked on i review destroyers function and balance ii add more specialist ships not oneoff hanger queens but actual new ship classes iii csm5 did a bloody excellent job of opening communications ccp is beginning to come out of its shell but there is still a long way to go to make the lines of communication what they should be i understand that business plans need some measure of security but there also needs to be a bit more info flowing out about future plansshort term again it is not a csm members job to push through their own agenda at least not as far as i am concerned but things i would like to see fixed i rokh hanger ii aggro mechanics cleaned up and a lot clearer in explanation iii mailable bookmarks for swifter corp and wh usenext questionm
hello everyoneyou are probably reading this because you enjoy playing this awesome gameif you are playing for a while you most likely have used tools like evemon eft killboards forums integrated with eve production or invention calculators jump range planners and maybe a variety of other 3rd party toolsid assume that alot of people will agree that eve without those tools would be a different game and that those tools add alot to your funnow while ccp has been giving a bit of support to us the third party developers i still feel that we need a more direct line to ccp and to the people at ccp who can actually make decisions  so they can be convinced to work clother with people like us so our free work improves your game even moreso if you use some of those tools regulary please give it a thought and vote for peter powers learn more about me on my campaign website
evsco supports peter powers fullyhes an invaluable person both as a friend but also as a developer on both private and evsco related projectsso if you value your 3rd party tools like evekill vote peter in to the csm  and he will fight tooth and nail to get even more goodies to the 3rd party developers  and ultimately you the pilots of eve
remember people nc want to control all of 00 and all of csm to speed up the process do you truly want 00 to be solely controlled by one coalitionif not then dont vote for any nc csm candidates
id try and explain just how silly this is but merely considering that someone actually believes this mess makes my brain hurt so im just going to have to conclude that you are in fact trolling
dont write the zerosec hegemony a blank chequeimage changed to url zymurgist
your suffering and frustration unironically give me pleasureyoure lying about my intentions though vov
okay ill bite how is he blatantly says he wants to make eve worse do you have an example of this no incoherent ramblings i want examples plural heck his tentonhammer articles all 57 of them

screw it hi kalle how are you doing is your paranoia finally contaminating your brain
its funny how you flying monkeys claim he is sincere when he has openly announced his intentions contradicted himself randomly flamed other csm candidates for no reason and started a campaign making him and vile rat both look like hypocritesor maybe i am paranoid and mittani never said he wants to harm lowsec make it harder for non sov holders to pvp and try to have nc take full control over csm so they wont have any issues with moon goo transportationthere is also a thread on kugu about this issue and leaked logs showing nc bitter about pl so much that they have to do something to preserve their holy land from receiving any pvp actionbut you cant blame mittani from trying to be like darius  suas lucky for players ccp wont listen to hypocrites like him
im not sure youre actually reading that post you are linking can you tell me where explicitly the mittani said that he wants to harm lowsec make it harder for non sov holders to pvp or that he wants to do this so the nc wont have any issues with moon goo transportationbecause honestly i cant read anything remotely like that at all
thank you for proving me right kalle how are you doing
pity reply
well folks as promised you the plebs of eve can now vote on my top 5 priorities already looking forward to the witty and inspired suggestions from goonies that my priorities should be to end myself anyway over to you the first csm campaign thats truly and openly democraticwhat could possibly go wrong
i will vote for you if you manage to make one good post
well my posts have been good enough for you to dedicate 50 of your lifetime posting energy into replyingholy crap i can see into the future
thanks for the words of support for those who posted here are some of my comments for the questions raiseditems in the backlogthe highest priority should be the war on lag ccp created a sandbox and encouraged us to play in it because there were no rules dictating how we must play we the players decided who to shoot and when to shoot them with more and more players joining the sandbox that is 00 the hardware is unable to keep up with unpredictable nature of 00 warfare ccp forces us to plan our battles and inform them of the location ahead of schedule so they can take appropriate actions behind the scenes this isnt how we like to play the game it limits the opportunity for supercapital fights because of the risk of lag when we become the victims of lag caused by the lack of hardware required to support the fastpaced game play in 00 we are met with denial from ccp as they accept no responsibility for any ship lost in a fleetwe dont want to wait several minutes for modules to activate it should be instantaneous the demands of this sandbox force the issue we need a lagfree environment and i intend to press ccp hard on this issuejump bridgesi have never met a pod pilot that enjoys travelling 50 jumps to get from point a to point b the majority of players are impatient as theyre given limited time to do the things they enjoy the most in the game each day and would much rather get to their destination the quickest way possible jump bridges provide a logistical advantage if they are setup correctly both for military and industrial pilots theres no denying that the nc jump bridge network is extremely efficient and allows us to project our forces quite easily but i also have to state that this required a great deal of coordination and it can be quite expensive to maintainthere was once a time in eve when there was no warp to 0km option and the default was 15km pod pilots either made or purchased instajump bookmarks from gate to gate when this was first implemented there were nothing but smiles from the majority of pod pilots even though it slightly reduced the ability for easy ganks jump bridges provided players with a new mechanism of moving quickly and efficiently around new eden just like the warp to 0km option i cannot deny that it slightly reduces the potential for easy ganks by removing or reducing the need to use normal stargates however ganks are still possible at jump bridges it just requires a bit more thought into how it can be accomplishedthat being said i do believe that some changes can be made to the jump bridge network and how they operate i do not believe they should be removed entirely nor do i believe they should be the victim of a major nerf one possibility is to increase the amount of liquid ozone required to utilise the jump bridge but this would also require an overhaul of how the jump bridges are configured particularly around their access and a more granular level of permissionssmall gangs in 00nothing would please me more than to see smaller gangs roaming in 00 but lets be honest here anything that ccp implements that encourage smaller gang warfare will just be multiplied 100 times and used as tactics by large alliances i dont believe this is a problem that only ccp can fix i believe it requires a level of commitment from all of the major alliances that being said i am always open to reasonable suggestions and i encourage anyone to contact me if theyd like to discuss this in more detail
having worked with killer for a few years now i can think of very few people better suited to drive the interests of the 00 community as a whole and ensuring that the players voice is heard via the csm and more importantly the promises and improvments are driven through to make eve the enviroment it should and can bejackalmostly harmless
i am happy to see you here killer there are many hot topics right now jbs im sure at the top of most of our lists jump drives not far behind it would be great to have a rep with true null sec experience at heart helping to make some of the changes that need to be made this is a serious issue that needs to be dealt with removing jump bridges in the hopes of smaller fleet fights is not the answer
the perfect man for the job
ccp wont stand a chance
in fact i just noticed that mittens quoted me in his campaign post so in a particularly meta display of recursiveness im going to quote him quoting me on this topic
my only vote goes to helengoodluck
why highlight such juvenile namecalling so publically when your knowledge and experience seem capable of carrying the day without themcan you give some examples of this and describe what you find objectionable
deception never quite what it appearsvote against the nullsec plan to take over the csm
a lot of candidates in the current election cycle are doing exactly this again they and the people who voted for them are going to have a big surprise if they get a seat and discover that their personal agendas and bundles of ideas are essentially worthlessi dont want to pick on her because i think shes done a great job as chairman but mynxee provides a great example to use here she was elected largely on a platform of fixing lowsec what lowsec changes have been made hinted at or mentioned in minutes since she took office a year ago hint if you answered none at all youd be correct thats not because she lied during her election campaign but rather because she came in with unrealistic expectations and crashed into realityto be fair this tends to get better over the course of a csm term as the delegates get a better understanding of what their role is what im mostly talking about here is the csm as games designer stuff it smacks of the classic tighten up the graphics on level three advert as each csm gets settled in they largely lose the idea that they are going to be overseeing sweeping fixes to their pet projects and get used to the idea that they are mostly a focus groupas ive said repeatedly nobody cares about your ideas for the most part ccp least of all the truly important stuff happens on the internal csm forums at the summits and in email chains with ccp personnel its there that the csm has the largest opportunity to influence the way that eve progresses and all of that is covered by nda the public stuff mostly comes down to us coming to agreement on what we believe are areas that ccp could or should fix given our limited insight into their schedules  not to suggest fixes but to flag up problem areas most of that work could easily be done by an internal cm department and i say that as someone who has created and managed cm departments for aaa mmos
lets talk about this and expose it as the nonsense that it isfirstly even if the csm were able to push through the agendas of any or all delegates you are assuming that ccp has no other metrics to determine what is good or bad in their own game reallyas has been pointed out and as a cursory glance through the csm section of the evewiki will reveal this simply doesnt happen not just because ccp isnt dumb enough to rely on only one source but also because the csm doesnt get to decide what ccp doesthe most important work that the csm does is providing feedback on ccps ideas that requires a strong understanding of the game and how the various parts interrelate the best csm delegates are the ones who can point out the unforeseen consequences of someone elses ideas not the ones who are the most passionate about their particular area of the game a 00centric csm will not mean that hisec mission runners will be herded into cattlecars and transported to gulags or that concord will suddenly start giving suicide gankers a cheery wave and a pat on the back it means that players who understand the 00 game as well as the hisec and economic game will be giving feedback
hindsight is 2020 as the old saying goes that said i promised during my campaign to pursue low sec changes and that i did almost immediately upon being elected by requesting a twohour low sec session at the june summit that session resulted in good discussion with devs but it was made quite clear that ccp dev resources were allocated for the next 1824 months and there was no chance of low sec getting any dev love in that timeframe failure to get any low sec changes are not my fault nor anything to do with naivete or dribbling ation on my partthe lack of low sec changes is just a reality based on ccp focus and allocation of resources given the situation i feel my low sec voters got as much value for their votes as could feasibly be gotten this particular csm term if by some crazy coincidence ccp had had low sec in the near term dev queue perceptions about the effectiveness of my campaign message might be very different now wouldnt theymy point is it doesnt matter what candidates do or dont promise no csm term will ever go the way its freshfaced delegates expect there are too many factors that drive csm focus and activities and they come from a lot of different directions campaign platforms however do provide one method for voters to get a sense of how a candidate could be expected to respond to some issues if those issues come up for discussion during their term therefore i suggest that its not necessarily invalid for candidates to post their views on the issues that matter most to them
i wasnt picking on you honestly and i wouldnt even have used you as an example if you were running for reelection im just pointing out that the agendas of any csm delegate almost never survive contact with the ccp schedule  a point that youve actually reinforced with your post above you ran on lowsec changes realised early in the term that this wasnt going to happen and had to ditch your preconceptions of what being on the csm was going to be about the exact same thing happened to delegates in every previous csm session too and yet here we are after five terms with prospective candidates who arent paying attention promising the sky to voters who also arent paying attention
oh i agree totally but a lot of people dont do their homework i wonder how many of the current candidates have read the csm white paper even or gone back and looked at candidates campaign threads from last year or read the minutes from csm5 and previous summits to get a sense of what goes on in icelandand become informed about how the process has evolved not many it appears
many people misunderstand what csm is about i guess in before all kinds of horrible punsbut on the subject of helen i can attest that he is a cool guy who does the job well
if you bother to look at any of the csm5 output youll spot fairly quickly that this is the only guy on the current panel able to string together a coherent thoughti have no idea how he puts up with the cretins he has to coexist with on the current csm or with the galactic scale stupidity that passes for game design at ccp and since the eve player base is probably the least well informed electorate in the history of democratic endeavour i see no reason to think you wits will pick a better panel this time around in fact subjecting highwater to another term will likely lead to his brain dribbling out of his ears through overexposure to head melting stupidity vote for this masochist tia
there is probably not more than 100200 votes to gather from the readers of this forum to get elected id say your best bet is to present yourself as the guy who is going to help random joe that is the biggest pool of potential voters you just have to get them to actually vote look at the programme of the take care party its tried and tested some random ideas talk about how suicide ganking is too easy and has no risk at all and how youre going to change it complain how scamming is rampant and needs to be penalized stress how lowsec needs more sentry guns npc patrols to protect the innocents and how people with negative security standing shouldnt be allowed to dock at npc stations insinuate at all times that not participating in ship combat makes you a better human promise that lvl4 missions arent going to be moved to lowsec as long as you are on the csm  ask for mothership bpcs to drop in hisec incursions make strong use of words like griefing gankers gankbears and most importantly player killing incorporate some incarna stuff too people dig that talk about how miners make and break eve and how the gankers would be boned without themits also vital that you promise a lot it doesnt matter that you dont really get to decide anything people prefer to vote for people with strong agendas possibly that would be in conflict with your actual opinions but that is politics im pretty damn sure this is the ticket to the csm it has worked in the past just like that you would have to drop your alliance though as the type of player youre going for has an inexplicable yet deeply rooted hate for anything goonas for getting voted in purely based on a reasonable lowkey programme and a passion for the game good luck with that
all you have to do is promise everything then deliver nothing thats how politics work
i think its actually quite easy to explain come to think of it
you can go to iceland with the help of my ax
the conclusion ive come to is that i have no chance of winning while im in goonswarm
give it a chance put some of the tips given into practice dont forget its not just about winning votes in your favour its also about whether the other asshats can get votes too some of them may say something stupid killing their chances have some scam found out about them might get hit by a bus before election there might be ten thousand votes from mr random doesnt read forums just reads the csm page with the brief summaries on it etc  last time i voted in the csm election i simply voted with all my accounts on the guy that had the highest letter count in his proposal regardless of what it said d
so this would be a good time to askis kalrand the only md person to be running for csmif so then it does stand to reason that he is the only person in md that actually wants to do something proactive about all the groaning and moaning going on around here for example akita t et al have been complaining for a year about moon mineral balancing and restructuring this is a clear 00 agenda item that they dont want mentioned why because they love itkalrand has said in his points that he will try to get that addressed he makes a solid point that it is not up to the csm to decide the solution it is up to the csm to spark the fire and then help direct the resulting blaze sometimes they even have to help fan the flamesunless anyone else around here is stepping up then kalrand is by default the only choice for md now you may not like that fact you may decide that md doesnt need a dedicated voice and thus vote for someone else but the logic standskalrand you have my vote and my pledge to try and get the rest of my alliance however small we may be in the grand scheme of things on board with your candidacy if i pull it off thats about 100 votes good luck sirside note if anyone else here is actually standing up for the economy of eve i will do the same thing for them because i do believe it is an area which needs serious attention
even if you dont make it this time around you could at least get your name out there so that next time around youve got a leg up that said dont play for second place in it to win it or not at alledit ps  ill be very cross with you if i dont see your name on the list of people to vote for this is the first time ive taken the time to care about who to vote for on csm sorry you dont have a choice in the matter anymore
i dont think that is the case quite frankly id vote for someone in goonswarm over someone in some noname corp ive never heard of because i know at least that you have played the game and have some exposure to a broad range of experiences id rather have you than a random mouthbreather who has only ever seen the game in highsec through the window ports of his drakeraven the fact that you are active on md will also net you votes as many people who lurk the md forums will be given the opportunity to vote and only recognize your name from the list that is presentedyouve got 13 votes from me depending on what accounts are up at the time also probably a few from my more easily influenced friends who could generally give a crap less about the csm
that wasnt a defeatist statement at this point ive been doing the math and it would appear that i have a decent shot at being a highlevel alternate and knowing how long the term is makes it likely that ill end up on the csm eventually anywayi really think theres only about three seats up for grabs to the general public and i think ill be polling well just not top threenot that im not doing everything in my ability to change that i am dropping goonswarm is an idea so are some other things that im doing
how many people not seriously entrenched in 00 pay attention to csm politics i cant imagine the majority of highsec nonforum readers caring one way or another certainly not enough to notice that you dropped your goonswarm tag to them its probably just a list of unrecognizable names i will vote for you for whatever its worth you might be able to get in on the 50 or so md votes although mittani def has you beat with a larger and more dedicated base edit and to outdo the picture of mittani and his dog strike back hard have your photo takenphotoshop yourself into pictures with a 1 fireman 2 policeman 3 gaggle of kids  orphanage and 4 the american flag w optiional bookshelves in the background preferably do a thumbs up in all of them
i am not sure how much dropping gs would help that much unless there is no doubt that its not just a ploy to hand mittens even more control over the csm and hand more seats to gsthis would be my primary objection to you i think you are a swell dude but its hard to trust what anyone with the goon tag does due to precedent what stops you from simply rejoining after the election and voting whatever way mittens wants you to anyway if there is coercion and if there is no coercion and you agree with the 00 csm control bs then what is the difference between voting for you or themfrom where i stand it would seem that the 00 block is pushing a very different view of the game than what i would like to support for instance most of the game does not take place on 00 and the positions against shinies non pvppve content and change in general give me quite a bit of pause those positions are either stated or implied here or in say kugutsu or scrapheap
a preview of my official campaign statementvote kalrand for csm the reason you dont know who i am is that ive had much better things to spend my time on than making funny websites or gimmicky new characters just to try to convince the average eve player that i can grasp the second and third order effects of changes made in a complex system i can and thats actually what i do for a living when im not playing evei came up with a list of  that the average player would like here either because theyre something that should actually happen example moon goo rebalancing or because the average player would ing love it a t2 orca doing these things would be good for the game either to fix broken  or give people what they wantbut ccp really doesnt give two flying s about ideas the csm comes to the table with they really only care about their own ideas im sure theyve got all kinds of stupid  they want to put in incarna dust 514 sparkle vampires in space that really needs to be shot down with a better reason than  you thats stupidim that guy vote for me fly kalrand to iceland
1 me leaving would be entirely window dressing for my campaign i would be rejoining with the kalrand character once its over i just dont want to turn off the casual empire person who doesnt know me anymore more than my normal likable personality would2 i dont take coercion very well i mean without you knowing how bullheaded and stubborn i am in the real word theres really no way to explain that here its something i dismiss as an issue out of hand and havent come up with an effective way to express it in game i guess youd just have to trust me
kalrand you are doing it wrongrequoting myselfhave your photo takenphotoshop yourself into pictures with a 1 fireman 2 policeman 3 gaggle of kids  orphanage and 4 the american flag w optiional bookshelves in the background preferably do a thumbs up in all of them
a lot of the eve playerbase is european and the us may not be the most popular country to flag with at this time or maybe at any who knows i recommend petskittens or hot women
hot women  american flag bikini w a kitten in the background brillant
what if people get confused and vote for the kitten the sort of people this would appeal to may be less than of clear and present mind that said i would add a bazooka and rambo costume with cgi muscles
moved from market discussion
the only solution i can see to the hep posting problem is homeopathicesque dilution with good postsbut do you believe that we actually deserve those good posts
no we no longer deserve anythingalso i am quite good at world of tanks a vote for me is a vote for wot
screw incarna driving tanks in stations is something the whole player base can get behind
