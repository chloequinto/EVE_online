this would be a great help though i am in the camp that thinks the arrows should be proportional to the distance traveled in some period of time rather than scaled with zoom primary reason for this is that scaling it with zoom makes the length arbitrary as zoom is arbitrary and thus arrow size becomes almost meaningless the best compromise would be to allow the player to choose how many seconds of travel aka scaling factor that the arrows will represent for the person that keeps the overview fairly zoomed out choose a large scaling factor so they are still visible
i like the general idea but think it needs a bit more development for example velocity vector isnt the only thing you would be interested in it might also help to know the envelope the approximate surface that represents the places the target could reach in a certain period of time based on what you knowfurthermore some thought has to be given to unintended consequences this kind of vector would for example make it easier to figure out where a target is trying to warp to
the envelope concept seems to be strictly zoom dependent because if you zoom out the envelope would become littler this seems to be the opposite of what i proposed what i wrote also is quite simple and the devs could build without a lot of effortabout warping to if you look at a ship you can already understand that or even if you keep it centered while its warping so yes it is an easier way to get information but info that you already haveabout arrows  the vector imo shouldnt have arrows as you can see where it starts and ends thanks to the ship brackets in space
good idea

i agree with this recommendation to put more emphasis on getting things put right on existing aspects before moving on to implementation of new things

if i recall correctly ccp recently two expansions back or so decided to step up the expansion schedule to one expansion very 4 months in accordance with last years produce or something similar theme although i agree with the op in most respects i dont ccp are going to let the players dictate the release schedule regardless of how sensible we are that said the gist of the whole proposal is that ccp should not just abandon stuff and call it done when it clearly isnt or in other cases shelve it and hope noone notices which is a more realistic plea from my point of view

excellently stated dierdra unless ccp commit to a changeor many changesin the way they approach the management of releases i fear eve will simply become too fractured to maintain in any significant way over time besides the release of halfbaked features im also concerned about wasted resources when nearlydone features are scrapped because they werent 100 finished by some artificial deadline if the time effort and expense to get a feature to 85 or 90 is invested then its worth staying on track and taking the time needed to finish it i suspect players will happily support missed deadlines look at the positive response when tyrannis got delayed what happened when it did get released is another storyespecially if it means they get a better product in my view part of a commitment to excellence must include a commitment to extending release dates realistically when doing so will result in a more robust feature set related to that the investment in nearlydone features should be leveraged by allowing work to continue past deadlines so that the feature can be finished it can then be deployed in a patch or next release scrapping features that already have significant investment should be a rare exception not the rule any development model that demands slavish devotion to the latter is fiscally insane not to mention dangerously demoralizing to development teams and ultimately hugely disappointing to customers

while i do agree totally on this thread it must be taken into account that rehashing doesnt bring more new players thus revenue than new contenti do agree however that ccp usually follows the implement now develop later meme i would try to search for a middleground for it with expansions having half time dedicated for new content and half time dedicated on developing new content sacrificing for that the 6month expansion release cycles if needed i would much prefer ccp to release 1 expansion every year and do try to improve such expansion in a years timein sum i support this thread but people must take into consideration that this is business

sorry i disagree with the assumption that slower releases would bring better release qualityits just not truei also believe that two major releases a year keep more players interested and attract more newreturning players than revisions and fixes wouldccp is doing the math and their reasoning for keeping this schedule is sound its making eve more successful than it otherwise would be and so they should keep at itasking for excellence better testing more resources to old projects minor improvements thats just common sense but doing that at the expense of expansions it is detrimental and possibly suicidal hopefully ccp wont listen to this one advicemy own 002 isk which i wont be giving to anyone anywaybut i did vote for you dierdra

so you rather have halffinished products  features in eve that have tons of bugs just to get more players intrested and to get more players into eve fasteri think its better to use more time to get the things totally done and release it with almost no bugs so the new players that comes to eve can rather enjoy eve instead of leaving in anger because things in eve doesnt work like it should and because it contains with tons of bugsno ccp should use more time to make sure that the new features they release is 99 finished and have minimum with bugs when they release new things so there can be alot more happy playersbecause you know having a working game is 39845763982 times more important than getting some few more players intrested fasterif eve had been wow then i could agree that getting more players really fast would be an idea but this is eve we are talking about here

supported in so many ways as a former empire bear i left partially to pursue 00 goals but partially because there was nothing left to do in empirethe vaunted ideas of epic arcs have all but seemed to disappear after the sisters and what 2 pirate arcs i havent seen any new lvl 4 scenarios appear in lord only knows how longas for more recent expansions weve seen an overhaul to sov with a great deal of mixed responsereception 6 months of interminable lag and hideous fleet issues and now with tyrannis though kudos the fleet stuff is running better weve seen the arrival of pi that started out as a nifty sounding idea but seems to have arrived as something of a limp squidand yes evegate or spacebook or whatever particular thing you want to call it im not sure that anyone seems to be warming to it at allbut as eve is a sandbox and a largely player vs player one i think ccp need to reconsider their design targets for the next say 2 years and rather than giving us what they think we would like to play with  they should instead give us what we need which is in some cases some serious overhauls including but not limited to destroyers assault frigates rockets basic ui including context menus for shipsitems drone ui personal wallet corporationalliance role assignments npc agent interactioni for one would be quite happy if ccp turned around tomorrow and said sorry folks were not giving you another expansion till 2012 but instead well be fixing this that and the other thingwholeheartedly supported even though i dont believe anything will come of it id love to see a ccp response in here thoughemrys
1i understand that they want pi to be something thats developed and ready and try to make it one of the major things you do with industry however i would very much rather see lag and interface fixes yes the calendar is nice and the eve gate is in t

yes yes yes a million times yes i cannot support the op enough

1please add bounty hunting rules to the list of features that do require an upgrade to excellence they are currently not even good or okbut just terrible and poorly thought out
10
ccp is risking making the same mistakes that mythic did with warhammer online the constant addition of new features while the bugs and issues with the old features remain while new content will add users you will eventually lose both the newer players and older mainstay customers there needs to be more improvement on the issues that exist now and less timeeffortmoney spent on adding even more features that will require even more work to correcti think of eve as a house the foundation is solid but has cracks in it lets fix that foundation befor we add more improvements that we really dont need but will raise the value of the house
very definite 1 from me it is getting increasingly hard to defend the attitude to this problem shown by ccpsome recent posts on this forum by certain devs have been frankly rude and insulting to fans who are only trying to help them make a better game something they claim to believe in wholeheartedly
you wouldnt believe how much i loved ccp if they fixed the issues at hand i mean eve is already my favorite mmo but with more excellence i would basically never stop playing ityes please
supported please ccp dont half ass planetary interaction like you did some of the other older features i want to see the simcity style content that was advertised years ago

fantastic idea dierdra their goal is excellence they need to be held to that standard i love eve but it can be better time to focus on the things that need to be addressed rather than racing expansions out to get the game to a certain place if it takes longer to arrive but arrives in supreme shape instead of full of bugs it will be better for your player base as well as your companys reputation

supporting this lately it has become more and more of a chore to even enjoy this awesome game this game has the potential to be amazing but has always stopped short by ignoring simple gameplay issues in favor of pushing more bullet point featuresi know its the beaten horse around here but eve deserves some more attention aimed at improving its existing code and features over implementing some shiny new addition
supporting this

supportedccp have proved themselves to mainly develop short term fixes and shiny new toys while always ignoring midterm effects of the fixes made and new toy introduced claiming to have a long term agenda is fine but the constant promise of better toys in the next patch is by now getting close to insulting once a feature is introduced it is mainly forgotten for six to twelve months and mishandled in a haphazard way somewhere down the line for balancing purposes everything doesnt have to be cheap available or exactly the same it removes challanges and opportunitiesthe fact that most fixes mainly focuses on cheaperbalanced pvp stuff usually means that industry and trade aspects are all but completely ignoredsome examples of poor balancing is t2 lottery and later om invention t3 and its balancing the current handling of the introduction of pi the boosting of meta item drops the handling of bugged complexes the handling of the minmax bugged npc orders moongate etcboosting drops considerably while simoultanousily reducing the building requirements for interfaces is not a good way of balancing invention boosting t3 drops while changing the end bpcs runs but not removing random outcome nor introducing reprocessesable t3 is not fixing t3 new bottle neck silly amounts of unused t3 bpcs and no problems solved is the end result it is getting tiring and i have somewhat lost faith in ccps abilties when it comes to handling market and industry market and industry is also pvp but ccp are slowly removing most challenges and opportunities by sheer ignorance

100 behind thisquantity over quality and shoddy design and implementation has been ccps hallmark with only a few exceptions expansions are little more than glorified patches that break more than they fixif it wasnt for the uniqueness of the game it would be driven into the ground as a example of terrible design and management frankly that is how i see it unique but greatly flawed genius and what is more is that the evolution of the game is making it less unique and more flawedthe game should be refined not bloated with useless and unwanted features that do nothing other than detract from the core game

drake yeah the lack of a sixth mid really kills the nighthawk if any of them need boosting itd be the one tempest a naked tempest with a mwd active gets an 18 second align sleipnir is 12 just how many agility mods are you fitting the only way i get 102 seconds is with four nanos and a gang boostwhich i havent been using to keep the numbers standardized also in order to fit two heavy neuts a mwd cap booster lse and a full set of 1600s you need a rcu where the hell are your damage mods by the time you fit the dcu youve shield tanked a ship with six lows and have exactly zero damage mods equipped and no we do not agree that these ships really need a boost thats the whole point of this argument the nighthawk could use a mid in place of a low and some extra pg the astarte could use a utility high and the fitting for a gang linkthough the medium neut that would inevitably be put there instead might make it a bit op for solo work but thats just on the principle that every command ship should fit a link as a solo ship its fine the absolution is fine and the sleipnir is fine maybe a bit of dabbling around the edges can be justified but nothing serious and adding a full slot and a lot of fitting to use it certainly qualifies as serious have you ever looked at what a sniper hac is capable of comparing a sniper zealotthe best of the lot and a sniper megathrondecidedly mediocre the mega has 76k ehp to 21k 312 dps to 290 and 183km optimal to 114km costs about 50 mil less to lose one too and when the fighting gets closer its even got a pretty nice set of drones to throw in where the zealots got nothing the mega would undoubtedly kick the crap out of a zealot under any conceivable circumstancesuntil you remember that the zealot can move and the mega cant field command ships when viewed solo are in much the same category as hacs  theyre not ships with a battleships raw stats but they make up for it with mobility tracking and all that other stuff the gang links also make them dualrole gang boosters which a battleship isnt im not sure exactly what standards youre trying to judge these ships by but by any sane standard i can think of the class is generally fine needs a few tweaks sure  what doesnt but youre talking about a wholesale renovation which is frankly silly
the stats are with mwd off as any sane person does not run a mwd more than needed secondly the tempest fits no armor mods why do you even fit some the difference with both mwd on is 27 seconds tempest shield nano neut kiting 2damage control iigyrostabilizer iigyrostabilizer iigyrostabilizer iitracking enhancer iinanofiber internal structure iiquad lif fueled i booster rocketsheavy capacitor booster ii cap booster 800warp disruptor iilarge shield extender iilarge shield extender iiheavy unstable power fluctuator iheavy unstable power fluctuator i800mm repeating artillery ii republic fleet phased plasma l800mm repeating artillery ii republic fleet phased plasma l800mm repeating artillery ii republic fleet phased plasma l800mm repeating artillery ii republic fleet phased plasma l800mm repeating artillery ii republic fleet phased plasma l800mm repeating artillery ii republic fleet phased plasma llarge antiem screen reinforcer ilarge antiem screen reinforcer ilarge antithermal screen reinforcer ivespa ec600 x5hornet ii x5sleipnir shield buffergyrostabilizer iigyrostabilizer iigyrostabilizer iidamage control iitracking enhancer ii10mn microwarpdrive iiwarp disruptor iilarge shield extender iilarge shield extender iiinvulnerability field ii425mm autocannon ii barrage m425mm autocannon ii barrage m425mm autocannon ii barrage m425mm autocannon ii barrage m425mm autocannon ii barrage m425mm autocannon ii barrage m425mm autocannon ii barrage mskirmish warfare link  interdiction maneuversmedium core defence field extender imedium core defence field extender ihammerhead ii x3hobgoblin ii x2how you can say these ships are fine baffles me to be honest do you have any experience to back that claim up with because id love to hear about it do you really think these ships would overpowered by it i definitely do not think so a tier 1 bs will still be better and cheaper field commands are a widely agreed obsolete class for soon 2 years and particularly since t3 introduction i did my best from my own experience cs 5 pilot flly all except astarte of what i think they need these ships first of all lacks agility and better sensor strength less easy to be jammed and needs some more ehp secondly all except the sleipnir needs more fitting assuming slots stay the same those are the very important parts then there is the issue of slots the problem is you cant just give the nighthawk an extra mid or an astarte an extra highlow without giving the others anything all ship classestiers have the exact same amount of slots total thats exactly one of the problems these ships are marginally more agile than tier 1 bss they simply dont have mobility no staying power all but 1 have no gang boosting fitting abilities i am judging them as a standard between tier 2 bcs and tier 1 bss which is where they should be considering t3 became the old field command ships back in the days and they now hold the spot of tier 2 bc dps tier 3 bs ehp or better and gang boosting and recon sensors and better boosting abilities all for 450 mill isk which is only 150m more than field commands and really they can drop the slot boost if they do the ehp increase sensor strength increase fitting increase and agility increase it wont make them good but at least perhaps make them useful on occasions
yes please even the playfield a little by making cs worth their buck
sounds good to me
i would like to explore this issue from a newcomers perspective seeing as im a newcomer im not sure how long ill be playing shoot i might not be playing in a month even i havent explored the game fully and i have no clue if i want to play now when i started a friend told me about the learning skills and being a mathematically minded person i saw how incredibly important they are so i trained 13 in all the skills without a second thought at this point ive finished the tutorials and trained the requisite skills the tutorials required and i still havent seen what eve is about at all i want to go into say industry but i quickly realize that without taking the learning skills further i will fall behind everyone else rapidly meaning i would be less competitive within a month if i do take the learning skills further i wont be able to try industry or whathaveyou out in the first place leaving me with the question why play the game in the first place and thus train these skills at allso i did what i was advised to do i set the learning skills and tier 2 learning skills to my desired levels and all but ignored the game for a few days i was away from town anyway but its not hard to imagine at all that another person in my same situation would have simply quit the game because heshe didnt feel like spending rl money to run a game that heshe couldnt begin to play i play games to explore plan and have fun i dont play games to suffer boredom so that i might suffer less boredom laterquote from me to a friend to recruit her yeah if youre going to play sign up a couple days before you are able to really sit down and play otherwise youll be stuck doing nothing while you train learning skillssigned a fresh outofthebox newbie
not wanting to be an asshat here but this game requires patience to be trained to at least lvl 4 the trial argument aside which i can fully understand after learnig skills you still have a long way to go if you wanna get the full eve experience heres hoping you do pull through tho in eve patience usualy gets rewarded
good idea
remove the learning skill and double the training speedsp is only useful up till a certain point 80m sp pilot wont benefit much at 120m sp whereas a new 50k sp pilot would be immensely better at 40m spallows new pilot to quickly get in on the action and existing pilot to roll alts and open new accountalso attributes a bit redundant to me since again they only effect the training speed perhaps make them more piloting related perceptionagility willpowertank etc too similar to other mmo
i had a simple idea and im surprised no one else had brought it up alreadyleave the learning skills in and move them all up to level 5 for everyone from the starting character to the oldest recruit then no one loses a thing and everyones equal the main difference between peoples training times could then be implants and remaps also remove the faster training speed up to 16m thing or adjust it to 5m or somethingvoila new characters could get into the action a little faster and old characters who hadnt yet leveled all of them to 5 would skill up a bit faster for those who had them all at l5 already give them some kind of congratulations award or some kind of tangible reward
dont worry when ccp gets around to it im sure theyll manage to find a solution that infuriates everyone equally
i think its a brilliant idea maybe it could be as simple as removing the 2nd tier of learning skills and sticking with the basics but either waysupported
in eve you do unfun things for the longterm benefit thats the learning skills for ya in a nutshellsee the thing is you and malcanis are barking up the wrong tree you realize having to spend much time on the learning skills potentially hampers a newbies enjoyment of the game yet instead of tackling said learning skills you get upset with everyone suggesting to new people that they should do them and thats kinda silly because as long as learning skills exist newbies simply will spend a predominant amount of time of their beginners experience doing those learning skills not because i or others tell them so but simply because the learning skills mechanics themselves dictate that a high gameefficiency is best achievied by doing them i didnt create that game mechanic ccp didwriting very angry posts about how newbies should not be doing so much learning skills and just have a good time is simply fruitless high gameefficiency is geared towards doing the learning skills at an early age and people like efficiency in fact asking people to stop thinking about efficiency and to just to have fun runs very counter to human nature youre free to do so of course but its just not very productiveinstead were it not much better if you saw the merit of the ops proposal and that doing away with the learning skills altogether would serve everyone the newbie no longer able to be motivated to wanting to be more efficient in training than he is now can simply go do as you suggest have fun and the older players provided they wont be training slower than they are now wont mind eitherranka meis law richer older players always have an overwhelming advantage live with it
totally and completely and very loudly supportedi now have 1300 contacts in one very big long useless list ive been around awhilethank you very much notwhich brings me to another issue  anyone got a link for a thread to give support for upping the limit to number of contacts300 you have to be kidding to even make my address book functional again i would have to delete 1000 contacts one by onenot happeninglink anyone
im supporting this to come back but since ccp has said they are going to do so or something similar i mostly support this because they had to remove them first and i want some place to put my dissapointment
agree ccp please bring back a contacts list and its ability to create folders
ccp should either bring back folders or remove the contact list altogether in its current form it is totally useless
i need folders and subfolders ccp please fix it
maybe the new system will help to reduce system wide lagmayb you will choose more wisely on who you add to the list maybe ccp doesnt want it used as intel as much as it is right now just guessing 
wow yeah not only do we need custom folders back we need a way to make it easier to put people in custom folders it could get rough moving people into custom folders when you had a large list of contacts  having a rightclick dropdown menu with an add to folder option there would be superbbut removing custom folders hello 
i need folders and subfolders tooo ccp please fix this
signed to te
this wasnt neccessary
ive got 420 titan pilots in my contacts then add 300 other friends chars and connections that youve assembled during all those yearsnow tell me how i can sort and find all thoseand tell me how i will be able to add some more if the limit sticks to 300
not much else to add to what everyone else has said this was a step backwards
screw folders serverside tags are way to go

agreed bring folders back
this is the third failed submission process ive personally seen so far mind boggling

ccp we your customers are still awaiting an answerthank you for your prompt response
ignoring something that you say you will fix for years is pretty awful then again sort of in line with alot of things ccp does t20 broken grids poss shooting everyonesupport for what its worth
ankh you wouldnt be just throwing these threads to the masses to discuss and then abandon them would you youve brought up some thoroughly valid points but so have some of the posters in your thread will you answerdiscuss or just sit and wait until you have enough support to feel entitled to take the matter to the csm
 loving thatits true though this is supposed to be a discussion area after allwhat id like to see in missions has already been covered ccp have had crusades against the lag beast before now and the ridiculous swarming in missions has always struck me as being a huge source of processing time that could be easily whittled down whilst still maintaining the same end resulttake a well known lvl 4 angel extravaganza it generates 24 frigates 6 destroyers 23 battlecruisers 29 battleshipsplus a bunch of cruisers and turretsall of these have whatever sort of imagined fits npcs actually use and as someone mentioned previously all the empire bears of which i used to be one of get to the point of i can fit xlarge booster2x armour reps and perma run so i win missions yaythe odd token mission thats difficult due to jamming various guristas missions or having lots of tracking disruption serps room wc4 doesnt actually add risk to the mission they just slow it downanother ongoing comment from ccp is theyre stance of encouraging people out of empire and into lownull sec the thing is and i know this from personal experience the difference between pve and pvp setups is a very hard mindset to break which essentially slows peoples personal development into the pvp side of things and this is supposed to be a pvp sandbox isnt itso what do i think eve needswhats already been mentioned but taking it to a logical endpointsonpc ships fitted with a more pvp flavour neuts nos jammers disruptors dampeners remote reps smart bombs especially on the bss to deal with player dronesinstance budgets to reduce the number of physical ships and keeping it variednpcs that when damaged sufficiently will have a percentile chance of warping out to rep then warp back in to continue the fightthis if done correctly would not only improve the quality of experience in pve would also help reduce lagsystem load and ease people into a proper ship fitting mindsetof course pertaining to another thread thats running along side this one about ccp and their commitment to excellence id love to see a ccp response to this discussionbut i worry that that might be hoping for too muchemrys
supported the pve in this game is a joke and completely unrelated to anything youd possibly use for pvp id also add that npcs should play by the same rules as players no shooting torpedoes 50km energy vampires that can take you to 0 cap ecm unrelated to sensor strength or immunity to all ewar because of interferancei seem to remember when the ai for sleepers was introduced there was a lot of enthusiasm about how it would be trickled down to existing npcs to make them more interesting than suicidal bags of hitpoints that cant use a warp drive an unfinished idea from ccp surely not
1 who said this was supposed to be a pvp sandbox u then security status and concord would not exist and there wouldnt be nonpvp activities at all especially mining2 most of the ewar u mentioned already exists on rats the rest goes against sandboxing3 there is no proper ship fittingthats what makes it a sandbox what u want to do is take the sandbox away and turn it into a wow clone wow is that way 4 and why change only missions why not mining as well u want pvp go pvpthats what pvp is for umyeahthats probably why they call it pve not pvp refer to 4 but plz continue i wanna see what other excuses ppl have to offer when theyre somehow being griefed by someone playing the way he wants to
id love the monotony of my main source of income to be relieved
too literal on the pvp bit there i wasnt necessarily meaning combat its supposed to be a player ranfuelled environment with as little input from npcs as possible and sure i dont expect to see pure pvp fits for missions though a 20 rrbs gang would maul through a lvl 4 loltastically fastas for the ewar on rats yes some exists though npc nos is like oldschool player nos and you cant eccm npcs also you cant jam them which with budget allocations for missions would become a more viable prospect like having an ewar fit scorpion actually running a mission more effectively than your usual cookiecutter golemwhich also answers point 3 it would offerforce more varied fits into missions rather than the same old pithgist boosting golem or what have youand yes i dont see why it cant influence the mining actually encouraging more strategically organised mining gangs with combat support even in empire rather than the same old tired hulkindy combo hell if miners have some support with them it might cut down on the number of whines about hulks not tanking hardermore em
i recommend simply revamping ratsmissions entirely make them more diverse and make the rats harder but im not against the rest of the suggestion i would still like to see these special events focused in lowsec primarily for two reasons 1 it would make more sense for a pirate faction to gain a foothold in a part of space where concord has no power and 2 because it would give the mission runners an opportunity to be cutthroat about the whole thing mission runners blowing each other up for loot hells yes

this is an idea a corp member and i came up with to keep highsec pirates from being such a nuisance what i suggest is that anyone who gets themselves concorded will not be paid insurancethis way its not just targeting highsec pirates but all people who do illegal things in highsec the problem comes from the smart bombers taking out small haulers runing between jita and hek there is a string of systems where bombers just random attack people smart bombing them to death then have a friend come in a scoop up the remains they then use the insurance to buy a new battlehsip and more insurance to go back out and do it again my corp mates and i came up with 2 ideas to deal with this ban smart bombs from highsec or make it so no one couldnt collect insurance if they get condorded we felt the insurance idea was better cause it also delt with the hulkagedeon guys as well as punished any and all who break the law in highsec we felt this made sense since in real life if you were to burn your house down to get the insurance and were caught they wouldnt pay you we also believe this would not completely eliminate highsec piracy it would just make it so the pirates would have to be more creativeif you agree with this please join in and help us get this changed
i concur if it took skill and more than a couple of weeks to train throw away alts to do this it would be one thing but as is to easy for noobs to fly around bombing anything in sightsigned
i agree with the proposal 1i dont think it will do much in terms of stopping suicide ganking though but immergence wise its a good thing to stop payout on being concorded
supported
i would have to say the same thing it would make the most sence to help stop some of the high sec killing just to loot the cargo
i also support this
im a highsec suicide bomber and even i agree that this is a good idea hell ill find a better way to annoy you all
highsec space should be safe space i agree with this
after reading thru previous posts on this my first visit to these suggestion forums i think my suggestion is now kind of like going to a city council meeting in new york city and asking for a pot hole to be filled but here goesplease make the keep at range options useful for instance make one option 2400m to keep ships just far enough away from an orca to still stuff ore in it also make one option 5900m so i can keep my log ship in range to rr and without trying to stir up a lot of dust about exploits how about making one option a players designated default range option to replace or augment the difficult to be exact option of current ive only been playing since 04 but ive never encountered a good tactical reason to keep my range at any of the three permanent options available i use 500m because it is better than nothing unless i happen to hit a desirable distance and manage to select current while busy doing everything else needed to survive or thrivethank you
agreedthe level 5 agents sending people to hisec was a problem before load balancing by inclusion of the no more safe level 5s statement ankhesentapemkah has inadvertently turned this into a hisec level 5s thread instead of a missions send us too far away from home base thread ive contributed to that too so guilty as charged your honourmy own opinion is that hisec agents should be allowed to send you tothrough lowsec while level 5 agents should not send you hisec why is this my opinion i see no problem with lowsec level 14 agents sending you to hisec since plenty of other people are getting the same privilege by running hisec missions from hisec agents there are no level 5 agents in hisec so they should not be able to send you to hisecif people want those 5 implants they can organise a fleet to go run the missions to get them this ties in with ankhesentapemkahs suggestion about telling level 14 missions to htfuim a carebear mission runner  miner for what its worth
the load balancing is odd i like the idea in theory and think its stupid in lowsec but like the guy said he was getting sent several jumps in lowsec with 14 peoplesame thing is happening in hisec in some systems is 20 too many in a hisec system this would be a good function in hubs but in random systems that have traffic of 2050 people i find it unnecessarymaybe have it scale with a higher chance hisec obviously the more people in system but have no effect on traffic of under says 50 people in system
agreed ive removed the l5 part and will raise it as seperate issue if necessary
the problem is that without enough support the majority of the csm that is pvp oriented and pve averse will dismiss ankh suggestions without ever really discussing them so while i didnt agree totally with ankh original suggestion it is worth to support the discussion with the removal of the part about level 5 it is now way better to add some suggestioni would like a way to get harder missions in high sec but i agree that there should be a set of missions reserved to low secprobably the better system would be to make low sec specific missions that can be done with smaller ships but are challenging enough and have a mission completion reward high enough to make them interestingmaybe the use of smaller ship could be enforced by limitations on the warpgatesnaturally this will require better npc ai and less shipsat the same time the high sec missions would have more ships than low sec not more than today but still with a better ai and a lower completion payout making them more appropriate for the use of large sized ships andor groups of players that should give more challenging missions in high sec and feasible missions in low sec
as someone who runs missions regularly in high sec low sec and 00 id just like to say you made some pretty big assumptions that are incorrecti just did 30 lowsec missions not counting 2 faction missions 4 sent me out of system only the faction mission sent me into high sec that isnt very disproportionatestep back for a second here this is an rpg so really i think the backstory and environment is critical in all game design choices is it the agent or the invading pirates that choose the location of the attacks they make that the agent needs your help in its the pirates those people as you said once that can rot in lowsec where murderous vermin belongs how can you keep a straight face and tell pirates to rot in low sec then turn around and complain that your agents go tell you to fight said pirates in low secif there is a better example of someone being a hypocrite please let me know
not supported the risk is what makes the game fun and provides carebears for pirates to kill
qftthe thread itself is surely not supported
tbh im ok with people not being sent to lowsec as a rule by border agents but  no l5s in highsec no sending people to highsec from lowsec agents no point in sending people who run missions in lowsec 3 jumps away since 15 people really does not overload the serverso tentatively supported

um  thats how it currently works no change is neededyou dont have control while in a plex if you are in the plex first you can set up at your optimal range from the warp in which is static for all but unrestricted plexes giving you a significant advantage the only thing you lose some control on is running away after the fight has started if the fleet is too big you can always see that on directional scanner before engaging and still warp away if you want in fact if youre running the button you get directional scanner notice while the target lands and activates the gate time for the target to burn to you on the buttonbut once the fight starts in point range youre largely committed give people incentive to be in plexes it lessens stationgate humping and thats a good thinghave you seen any dev communication on the matter since this
heres hoping ccp finally pays attention to the many many many times weve all brought this stuff up
for the ship size i thought you meant a plex which only cruisers could enterthats it nothing more nothing less you were not clear enough thats why i said it would be weird but its not a bad ideathe second thing is the control let says its a caldari plex the guy is waiting at the button he has more advantage because of the npcs with him thats what i mean by saying no control or less sorry if i wasnt clear enoughfor the timezone and plex spawn a dev told me in a petition rules forbid me to copy paste but i dont have it anyway its deleted that a plex will respawn in a region where youve done the questno more details he didnt mention it was stuck i seriously dont have proof and no one does if theres a proof please tell it and show it to me im very hard headed in these issues im not a fan of you say he say so believe meps im not a uber epic fan of plexing but i know how it works well
1 chatgris was explaining advantages of current state of plexing and therefore didnt need to specify cruiser sized plexing  cruiser and below2 what advantage do you have at gate that you dont have in plex gtfo option is greater in plex since there might be a camp on the other side of the gate to nail you in plex you can gtfo anywhere you want3 read chatgris link that explicitely describes after dt plexing issueanyways fw plex mechanics are botched but they still provide some of the best shiplimited combat in the game like almost all combat in eve however both sides need to want to engage npcs limit enjoyment of pvp as the number of spawns increases  but this just means you need to bring more than your opponent into the plex wrt large gang combat so you get a bunch of your buddies together to rush the plex takes a bit of time and the opponent in a t1 frig warps away your buddies curse you for bringing them all the way out to maintenault or some other far off system to kill npc rats or orbit a button with no fightwrt 1v1 1v1 in fully spawned plex is nearly impossible 1v1 in lightly spawned caldari plex is nearly impossible too because you me get jammed the majority of the time to get decent 1v1 you have to rush an unspawned plex if the plex is one where the spawns dont trigger until you get within range of the button then you get a good fight otherwise you have to get in kill as quickly as possible and then gtfo and the main problem is theres no way to tell if the plex is spawned or not unless you warp in and risk getting tackled in any case defender who doesnt want a fight just bails and waits for respawn then he comes back with a bunch of npc assistance bottom line if defender is more interested in closing plex than fighting then plexing warfare is really really boring if defender wants fight plexing warfare is a blast
copied from my post above it is the 14th post in this threadccp greyscales post on the matterit is an official dev post on the matter
i support this thread i like the idea of a pirate faction as to the dt plex spawn system why cant there be a script to run it it at 468 or 12 hour intervals that way all tzs get a chance
current situation theres a whole lot of nifty things you can colour stars by in the f10 map ranging from number of times youve been there to who controls them new in tyrannis is the ability to colour by planet scan range which is just a given number of lightyears based on your skills we also have thewellhidden capital navigation window which tells you what system you can jump to and how many isotopes it will cost proposed change merge these two and give us the option to colour stars by whether theyre in range of our jump drives perhaps include a scan probestyle soap bubble effect around them to indicate your range visually theres other cool things you might be able to do herethe tooltip when you hover over the system telling you how many topes you need a ruler to measure distances colour by number of jumps required to reach a system etc but that level of function would make me happy benefits better visualization of your capitals jump range easier planning of capital operations also icscs servers might appreciate the reduction in workload drawbacks slight increase to clutter of the colour stars by list but thats already so long that this wont matter much
this is so well hidden i didnt even know it existed o where can i find italso supported
supported  sensible proposal
go into the esc menu shortcuts tab create a shortcut for open capital ship navigation then use that shortcut while in a cap ship shows you cynogen arrays in rangei assume my alliance doesnt own any to test with and shows you jump fuel costs for every system within range
makes sense pretty please do this before i can fly capital ships
this already exists unflatten your map while in a capital shipconfirming all cynogens owned by your alliance show up in capital navigation as well as whether or not they are in range
first the eve skill training model is not too rigid you are not limited to one character  you can get other accounts and train skills twice as fast for as long as both accounts are subscribed two 10m sp characters are more powerful than one 20m sp character simply because you can bring more modules into action in any fight or have twice as many productionresearch slots or control twice as many pos guns or have your own covert ops scout etcsecond the easy way to catch up with a veteran player is to buy their character veterans are now at the point where theyre flying a titan and are now training up to fly every other races titan be marketing moguls anything to keep that sp counter running youll catch up with them because theyre standing stillthird too slow is subjective your measure of too slow is based on other peoples opinions about other games so youre taking other peoples opinions about other games and interpreting that to somehow reflect on eve online  how is that not subjectivenow if you were to raise the suggestion that the 100 learning boost should be increased by another 2m sp every year id support that most characters will build around 10m sp a year between three characters on one account that gives you free sp slightly less than a single character will have trained in the meantime you can keep cycling your training to the boosted character and still not disadvantage those people who are focussed on training one character

aw yeah the rich get richer
crappy idea
anybody would think that the sp gain rate was deciding upon by a carefully considered consensus of bitter old veteransto determine if an idea is bad or not look at the whinersif the whiners are generally unknown its probably a bad ideaif the whiners are known regular bitter old veterans the chances are its a great idea that definetly cuts off their comfortable isk or advantage supplysince i dont care for character trading this system would be all good newsyou see people say eve expansions are freetheyre notthey are paid for expansionsyou pay with look at skill requirements for anything super capitals perhapsthose requirements are the cost of that expansion in eve instead of sp being the requirement you can easily substitute  instead therefore you can easily subsitute isk insteadanything that the bitter old veterans come out and take the time to whine about is almost certainly a very good idea otherwise theyd be ignoring you by nowthe sp gain rate was chosen to reflect how much ccp charge for expanded game content ccp want  people want content theyll find a way to come together ccp didnt make the sp gain rate variable for no reasonsupporting anything bitter old veterans cry about because it can only be good for the rest of usthis is csm thread anyway anything that occurs here has no value or consequence pointless in all senses
read the devblog on isk buying and it will explain why this is a bad idea eve is a universe where your real life income doesnt matter anyone of any financial background can enjoy a fair playing field as long as they pay the substhoroughly not supported no microtransactions in eve plex selling is already enough
you can buy sps for rl moneybuy plexs sell for isk then buy a characterjust saying even though im a very bitter vet
no this is stupid skillpoints should not be decided by who has the biggest wallet one is perfectly viable in combat after 2 weeks and capable of killing tens of thousands of other players my third account made 17 solo kills on day one of the account yeah new players are not viable at all until many months later
no no no no no no no and noif you dont like the way skill training is in eve go play 
nah bad idea not supported skillspeed itself beyond training and implants should not be on the marketbesides as has been said if you want to buy sp just get a whole character at the char bazaar
ccp please make dust for pc it will create so much more dept for eve and especially be cool in combination with sov claiming wich you made easyer your dicission so far is a total backstab to me and the entire eve community
and consoles already have modern warfare 2 n things like that if they cant link the game direcly with the same machine theyll never chose dust over all the competition as the the intrest of a console player is not in pc games and the communication between pc and console gamers is a poor one in effect also between eve and dust 514 as you need to communicate in 2 different consoles and games that contect will then barely be made
i dont supportdeveloping for console and developing for pc are two different animals so to focus on both will likely be to the detriment of bothfurthermore i doubt having some people on consoles and some on pcs would make for a balanced match so the two populations would have to be kept separate too much hassle if the dust population crashes for consoles i imagine they will port to pc but for the time being this is a waste of csm time
supported console exclusivity is silly the only reason some companies do so is because a pc games get copied illegally and b pc games get hacked the former doesnt apply at all and as for the latter granted a consoleexclusive dust 514 wouldnt see much macromining but overall eve is still considered one of the least hackable games aroundalso way to alienate your current loyal pc fanbase ccp
the thing that worries me about dust being a console only game is the definite possibility that the game will simply be unpopular with console gamers and will leave ccp and the rest of us that either dont own consoles or simply are not interested in having to switch platforms to play a new part of the game with a useless extension that will torpedo part of the whole pi hypeconsole gamers are hard to please and games with bugs which ccp seems to have a particular love for very seldom get anywhere and usually end up gathering dust yay pun on the shelves in addition to that dust is being built using the ut3 engine in addition to the fact that ut3 is no longer all that popular there are very many fps games for consoles and the odds of dust being more popular than say halo or a new version of half life are slim indeedi think the only people who would put up with ccps release first debug later development pattern are the people who play eve nowtldr bring dust to the pc so at least someone will actually play it

sadly not supportedyes of course id like all bugs fixed first who wouldnt but you got to look at the bigger picture ccp simply has to bring out new expansions ever so often if they dont the game dies why because of the very simple economic principle that to stand still is to fall behind i know people  myself included lol  kinda tend to think of people working at the marketing department as moneygrubbing singleminded folks but the reality of any company is that unless you can come up with new and refreshing ideas ever so often and make progress you will slowly wither and diedoesnt mean i think ccp shouldnt be spending more time on fixing outstanding issues diverting some personnel from dust 514 back to eve for one would be a good start i think
agreed this should apply accross the board scarcity is the mother of trade and all that jazz not to mention that it ruins the rp flavour of the game when everyone sells everything
oh yeh supported
its not about separating the factions it is more about the role playing part where archenemies should not sell stuff from each otherthat would be like microsoft selling ipods or ccp selling jumpgate ridiculous
i fully agree empires should only be selling their stuff be it towers bpos ships or what evercrazy ops i would like it too if the 4 empires would be divided by low sec would provide so much more game for me

just give anchored bubbles a few weeks lifetime and be done with it either that or reduce the 200k hp on large bubbles so it might actually be faster to kill them instead of just burning through unattended sling bubbles and then warping off

classy but this kind of sums up the spirit of most of the attacks leveled at ank thus far namecalling and poopflinging so this must be what they meant when they told me eve was a sandbox gamefor arguments sake lets pretend i dont know which horrible ideas youre referring to what suggestions has ank made that would imbalance the playing field in terms of pvp

why u mad
what is a csm cool story bro
damn the plot has foiled as they are on to us  limps away cursing on his wooden peg
good job we didnt get a pirate in as chair or anything then we could have done some real damage
oh look who isnt chair
hmm there was a election
ankh isnt chair so  off
false hope that ank will save carebears is the best hope cd
ehm a few things for you to consider1  weve got mynxee as chair an reputable expirate  merc who will be standing up for lowsec 2  ahnk did not make it as chair so if you theorize we had a whole smear campaign against her i can ensure you we were successfull 3  im pretty sure mynxee will keep any ideas from ahnk that will damage the current state of affairs of outlaws  lowsec dwellers from actually being implemented in the gameso basically we got what we wanted why are you still here
you sir are a legend and to op i shall now kill twice as many carebears for that insolent post
hmm most people who object to ankh dont do so because she is antipirate its because she comes up with such horrendously bad ideas that it offends people there should be a better system of punishment for crimes is fair enoughpeople should be put into prison so they cant play till their sentence is up is notthe poverty of ideas is hers and whilst personally attacking her might not serve much purpose it makes people feel a lot better given that theres no other available course of action its also quite funny

oh yeah well youre a childish threat
you have my thrasher
frankly thats a matter of opinion most of the trashposting ive seen directed to her is full of antipvp accusations the rest are full of misinformation which brings me to my next pointyoure right that is a ty idea its a good thing that ank has never suggested such a thing people keep coming back to a single quote taken out of context wherein she describes a setup she had on her pvp ultima server which is obviously irrelevent to eve rightjail is not one of the potential solutions she has ever suggested within the context of eve online to my knowledge feel free to prove me wrongfair enough i suppose but if people have an agenda that is counter to anks id say it would be much more productive to attack her suggestions as a member of the csm in a logical intelligent way instead of making unfounded personal attacks this would serve a purpose the ankhaters arent going to get her removed from the csm they need to deal with it and if her ideas are flawed then let the other csm members know which ideas are bad and why so far ive seen no such postsnow this is something that we can both agree on

whilst most mmorpgs work on a system of making the release of new content a priority i think most eve players are generally more interested in the fixing of existing content it makes more sense for a primarily pvp focused game

i wont add to the complaints i work in dev and i know how hard it can be when schedules are often dictated by marketing or other external factors rather than the amount of time it will actually take to do properly but i agree with the op and i would agree that ccp should assign two or more strike units for bug fixing and refactoring existing code and if they do this already to step up visibility and communication of the current su backlogs to the playerbase i doubt the player base will moan too much if the next expansion doesnt contain any new features but addresses some of the more pressing concerns they have and if they do just tell them to htfuthank you please with sugar

tbh i only read UFFFD the text of wall dierdra vaal sit down now how many expansions comes each year from ccp 2  i lost count long ago well lets say 2 that gives ccp 6 months to make it and for you to play take blizzard just for one they make 1 for each 2 years or so and its still full with ed problems point being that it dosnt matter who or what that makes the games they cant make it 100 bugissue free sry came to think there is bubble bobble its near perfekt however stop blaming ccp they are doing what they can for you to enjoy your time in the game and if you dont then perhabs you should try something elsei find this game near exelent

yes
i first and foremost would never go as far to say that ccp are doing it wrong or anything along those linesagile methodologies relate to gaining constant user feedback upon developments and making constant improvements towards a final product whilst ccp have been very good at listening to the end user in recent years i do feel there is just a little too much being developed at once now this in turn is really coming a great cost to the performance of the gamethere are a lot of features in game that have been so called left to one side in space for extra content eve does not need to be diluted in quality ccp are years ahead of the nearest contender in terms of development and production in the mmo world but are in danger of making a quality product become a quantity one very rapidly1
all for itagile methodology means that the company listens to the user feeback  true but this has stopped being the case with ccpfw is not looked at and they fidle fingers when they are asked rockets are still borken when many simple fixes have been suggested blasters needs a bit of rebalancing the window resizing bug is still alive  after 2yrs they did not listen to pi suggestions from users who identified the problems they did not listen to past suggestions on sisi thread they dont have a database of often found bugs that the gms can access they have senior gms which lack game mechanics knowledge and i could really go on

a total support with the opin fact i will go further than him features are a thing but balancing must be done too rsd rockets af etcexemple we wait since 18 months that ccp repair rockets but they failed to find few minutes to do it new players even after some months of playing sometimes have no idea what a remote sensor dampener is as they have been overnerfed so much that they are now useless etcccp always use new expansions to sometimes correct balancing this is a bad politicso ccp should begin to release frequent small patchs who would only do balancing to avoid bugs that would permit to correctrecorrect all ships and modules faster than before until they reach excellence

supportedccp claim to follow the scrum agile process they have made good progress in finally recognising their customers represented by the csm as a stakeholder and involving them in the development processhowever their adherence to fixed release dates is much more indicative of olde worlde waterfall development not agile practices agile and scrum in particular advocate selecting the highest priority feature as chosen by the customer and implementing that to a releaseready state before moving on to the next highest priority feature it takes as long as it takes as estimated by the pigs not by the chickens in marketing and financeit seems almost unique to the game industry that software is permitted to be released without proper user acceptance testing and quality gating if ccp truly observed the best practice that they claim they would listen to their customers cries for quality and take a good hard look at their release management short release cycles are not necessarily an indication of agility when they are driven by arbitrary dates instead of production readiness in tyranniss case there are clear indications of quality being sacrificed to meet a date call it last minute unforeseen issues if you like call it two weeks for players to settle in if you like i call it shenanigans every software professional playing eve knows what really happened  you ed up the release because you were chasing a date it happens its only unforgivable if you do it again and againfull disclosure i am a certified scrum master with twelve years of enterprise software development and software project management experience
this is so 1
tbh i think the smartest thing they could do from a marketing standpoint is take 3 or hell 6 months and just go back and fix existing bugs and issues and release a minimum amount of new content its what players have been practically screaming at them to do for at least a year now but ccp seem to have their fingers stuck in their ears marketing could come up for some sort of a cool name for it if they want to feel useful as it stands i think a lot of eve frustration stems from new releases introducing a lot of new features designed to look pretty in advertisements planetary interaction strikes me as a replacement for walking in stations as imo ambulation will probably never get introduced due to the crusade players have made against it for the exact reasons i was just saying meanwhile the game experience for veterans still feels like one based in buggy badly written 2001 era code ie one node per system and a whole bunch of bugs and design flaws introduced by development teams stuck in the mentality of release and forget about it in a number of examples with factional warfare as a glaring one end result is that existing subscribers feel that ccp couldnt give a  about them compared to grabbing up as many new trial accounts and prospective members as possible with flashy new content now matter how badly implemented its sort of a disenchanting feeling when you look back on it as ccp seems to be forgetting its roots as a small down to earth company that was built on being in touch with its playerbase and grown up into just another faceless international corporation that like many others seems to base most decisions on the bottom line profit im not going to jump on the subs cancelled take that bandwagon since they have heard it so many times insincerely it means nothing and i probably wont but i can really say ive been noticing a lot less general interest in the game then i did a year agoalso bring back nanos they were counterable with heavy neuts  carebears tldr whiny bitter vet
eurrrgh the fix list is long but all the fixes are minimal changes that will make an enormous differenceplease ccp listen to your player base we want things that work not things that kind of work and a load of new stuff to distract us from the stuff that doesnt work i think everyone accepts that pi was a must and should of been around from the start but wasnt because its such a huge element of the game i think we all understand how difficult it was to implement and we appreciate the hard work you have done but please throw some resources towards fixing everything that doesnt work is mediocre or requires a complete overhaul supported

excellence is nice but i think the best way to demonstrate is with something concrete ccp should commit the next dev cycle entirely to improvements and fixes maybe call it rebirth or some such make a few more of the really hideously ugly ships look nicemerlin and rupture plox and other than that buckle down and pick a few problem areas and fix them improve the ui make faction warfare less exploitable something let ccp show that they can stop chasing shiny new stuff and really focus on making everything in the game excellent as for lag how about some more of those who complain about it show up for the testing on sisi prolly been said before but its worth saying again

i dont agreebecause i dont agree with your personal definition of what excellence isbecause excellence is more than the bare minimum by definition that is rubbish some of the best designed things in the world attain that status that excellence by being the bare minimumestablish at the start of develpment at which point that feature is excellent and how do you measure such a thing even though parts of it got inevitably cut due to time constraints this means they have not yet reached excellence parts also get cut because they are not necessary overly complicate provide no benefit etc etc but for a company claiming to be dedicated to excellence their evedevelopment does not reflect this compared to that other company developing eve or that eve cloneunfortunately the world is not an ideal scenario kind of place and i am of the opinion that eve is already an outstanding product mainly because there is nothing i can compare it to if you watch the video you linked ccp defined what their excellence is so maybe base your argument on that and not your own definition of the word

1havent been playing long but ccps lack of talking up to a player base which is full of smart people is very disappointing i pay monthly i dont feel its too much to ask for updates on the issues the community brings up on at least as frequent a
very good post

id say this is a threadnaught so how about a response ccp
agreedccp need to read this and start rethinking of their definition of excellence
id be happy with less frequent expansions if it also meant getting features more complete at release and supportimprovements to them after deployment
yep
i would like to see fixes and polish prioritized the game is already amazing it would benefit from better fleshed out features improved ui and bug fixeswith that being said it would be nice to see incarna before the world ends in 2012

dear ccpnoone i spoke with wants planetary interaction not carebears not pvpers not industrialists not wormhole dwellers not anyoneeveryone i talk to hates the lag and bugs in eveyou put resources into developing an optional minigame instead of fixing bugs and brokenness in your core featuresat this point most pi is a sunk cost please stop digging delay the introduction of command centers for a few months and fix some bugs instead of introducing features that will inevitably have more bugs to fix black screens arent ok if they see me i should see them period this isnt about whether its ok to sit at a black screen for five minutes or five seconds no amount of time is acceptable broken overview is not cool stuff not updating colors bleeding over with bloodred friendlies ewar icons not appearing tabs not loading sorting taking tens of seconds etc etc allocate more resources to the need for speed if you still even have that login became faster in tyrannis thank you thats the only tyrannis change i really noticed and liked please make it still faster make undocks faster make jumps faster my client eats characters i type in chat no my keyboard is fine as is my typing in every other app my client switches into a mode it thinks a modifier key is pressed ctrl or shift or whatnot routinely i dont know what triggers it but switching out of the app and back in makes it go away for a while so if i close our chat window for no obvious reasons or my drones start flying towards you chances are i dont hate you speaking of drones my drones ignore my orders for tens of seconds at a time not coolif you feel the urge to add shiny stuff if you believe that you need to be adding things to keep all players happy heres an easy solutionadd new ship models clone the guy that made the new scorpion and make him redo the raven the drake the ferox the blackbird and the moa then do the dominixbetter models are always loved by players even those that dont fly the ship and they cant introduce significant bugsthank you for listening

i have an additional point that may motivate ccp into shoring up the foundation before they add another floor to the trailer housefor every new expansion they are introducing new bugs those compiled with bugs from previous releases drive players bat crazy at some point every player will eventually reach a point at which they will no longer be willing to shell out hard earned cash to playas the number of bugs increases the number of players declines i would be interested to see how many new accounts are started with the release of every new expansion and how many are allowed to go inactive within a couple weeksfix the crap ccp or sooner or later youll have no one left to develop new features for its not like there arent a gajillion other mmos out there that wouldnt be more than happy to take our money

because of its competetive single shard nature eve must be built on quality while their love of new content could make eve last longer than other mmorpgs the quality gap between eve and other mmorpgs continues to widen after every expansion maybe they are assuming correctly that players are adhdsigned

ive never been one to get too caught up in the scaling of things in eve but i support the concept and really like this command carrier suggestion as with many i definitely dont like the term supercarrier it seems even less appropriate than the term mothershipin star fleet battles there are space control ships scs which are akin to eves supercarriers but thats probably a bit of a mouthful unless you just call them scs all the time like you do in sfb

okay first off your tempest fit doesnt actually fit  youre about 1700 pg short second you get an extra 2k ehp and better performance with rr from an invuln in place of the second lse third what idiot uses resist rigs those things blow fourth with zero ambit rigs and faction ammo you only get 31km falloff which means that at disruptor range youre doing less than 60 of your nominal damage as for fitting armor mods that was a typo i said a full set of 1600s i meant a full set of 800s ie 800mm autocannons i should really stop making dumb mistakes if i want to win this argument and yes i fly command ships i have both an astarte and a sleipnir i dont have a huge amount of tq experience with them because im a cheap bastard at heart but ive used them a bunch in sisi duels and ive done enough pvp to read a stats block and have an idea of how a ship will perform command ships are for people who want capability more than costefficiency and who prefer the mobilitytrackingetc to the raw numbers of a battleship its not a big niche and it never will be the same way that pirate cruisers arent taking over for battleships either but its one that should exist and its one that they generally perform well and despite your comparison of a nanofit tempest with a nonnanofit sleipnir the agility difference is very noticeable a pest takes half again as long as a sleip to align a tripleplate mega takes a third longer than a singleplate astarte to align theres also generally a 1525 speed difference and about a 500 difference in trackingnot a typo as for individual stat tweaks if you want to throw them three or four points of sensor strength im fine with that ehp is not an issue on most of them the abso is north of 100k and the astarte is north of 70k both of which are acceptable the sleip is lower but the sleip also doesnt fit as buffery a setup and the nighthawk can do better than the absolution if youre willing to give it a fourslot tank and is at about astarte levels with three ive also come up with an astarte change that lets it have the gang link without giving it more slots than anyone else or gimping it  change the damage bonuses to rofor alternately make one of them 10level which is slightly more powerful knock off a turret hardpoint and add about 8 pg and 20 cpu to compensate for the difference between a neutron blaster and a gang link its a 25 dps loss at max skills but i dont think anyone will mind and when i said the nighthawk should get an extra mid you apparently missed the part where i said it should have one less low slot to compensate also how do you figure that the astarte and absolution need more fitting the astarte fits a 1600 mwd and full rack of neutrons with a single acr  it takes awu 5 and fits by 015 pg but it fits the absolution is tight if you want to fit the gang link and a medium cap booster but it still only needs one rcu and two pieces of namedfaction gear or a 1 hardwire to workwith t2 heavies and a 1600 which isnt crazy i wouldnt be opposed to the abso getting a touch more fitting but itd be less of a boost than an upgrade to medium drones one last thing when you say that a field command costs 300 mil you might want to try saying it in a post where you dont list off a fit that costs almost exactly 200
one point that comes up a lot if you give them enough fitting for the gang link people will abuse it to fit a neut instead for solo workwhat about giving css a bigger bonus to ganglink fitting such that they can easily fit a ganglink but only a ganglink at the end of the day these are command ships they are meant to be running with 1 link they shouldnt have to gimp their fitting in order to do it
ive just come up with another idea which might help nighthawk a lot replace kinetic damage bonus with rainbow one i dont see it making nh any more overpowered than the current raven hulls which in fact have exactly the rainbow damage bonuses rof actually but thats still dps

just add the freaking slot actaullysleipnir 8 highs 5 meds 5 lowsastarte 7 highs 4 meds 6 lows oh it gets 10m3 more dronebay zomgadd the utility high on both the brutix and the astarte and youve gone a long way towards fixing both ships
the fit most certainly fits without even needing implants  are you sure you got an up to date eft and sorry youre right extenders rigs  invul is what it should be i posted my cheap fit apparently  hehe seems we both make them  sisi duels really have nothing to compare with tq pvp really its ok for testing if a fit is viable but it really does not represent how pvp is on tq in any way not to mention most opponents one fights on sisi have ed fits i fly every class of ships of every single race pretty maxed sub capital and the agility difference is rather minimal actually its generally better to just stick a inertia mod on a untrimarked geddon than flying an absolution a drake almost gets the same stats as youre absolution statsif you drop a low slot from the nighthawk it either looses the rcu needed to fit stuff or a dmg mod which means its dps sucks even more or do we agree nighthawk needs a fitting increasing i think we do the astarte needs more tank or more dps a shield gank myrmidon with tackle and mwd gets 686k ehp vs the 70k quoted of youre fit while doing just shy of 800 unheated so we have established that the sleips buffer isnt that viable well here comes the surprise neither is its active tank unless you buy a crystal set or faction booster however were balancing around t2 setups with a mwd scramdisrupt and a cap booster its cap lasts 1 min and it only have 2 slots for tanking and despite its price like all the other css it does not tank youre average battlecruiser even with standard blue pill in fact you need the claymore 1 med for that which by the way is actually a better sleipnir guns  hams and it gets a gang link did i also mention those ships that directly compete with field css cost merely a fraction take less skills and give 90 of the effectivness this is one of the reasons i want to see these ships boosted i dont really care how they do it as long as they get the advantage they deserve and i do not mean overpowered advantage like pi figure they both need fitting considering they both need fitting mods andor faction mods to fit what should be a decent setup if they can fit them without fitting mods a lot of the problems suddenly goes away whops typo there meant 250m difference as for youre vision of a field commands niche vision you may wish to check out t3 cruisers they do everything for 25 times the price but 510 times better ehp wise gang boosting wise damage is pretty similar take less skills no fitting issues recon sensors and so on as i said the field commands are out of date they need something to bring them back up to date i hope i covered all im very tired vehlin  i agree that would also be a very good thing and would solve half of the fitting issues
loved this discussion so many good ideas for improvements ccp you have no excuse to delay these fixes past the next expansion the only thing id add is that warp speed should be increased to 45 ausec and that the coercer definitely needs a second midslot  if all the other destroyers get more than one midslot they can be used for solo pvp propulsion  point if coercer is left at 1 itll only be useful as an escort or a pve ship regardless of other changes

no the changes will make destroyers overpowered and make assault frigates obsolete i cant believe anyone is supporting this

how about giving some kind of congratulations award or some kind of tangible reward for those who dont have any learning skill trained insted  or pick any set of your skills and change their bonus for mentioned rewards imho learning skills were a mistake and i think i have read ccp considers them a mistake however this mistake is of that kind which gets worse when tried to fixit is like a bear trap you can try to get out by taking of your leg or you may just sit in it because the chain the trap is attached appears to be long enough and surroundings are nice
i see why learning skills are concidered a flaw in design by some and especially annoying for newbies but on the other hadn i agree that it adds another level of specialisation to this game which is what makes eve so specialhowever if they remove learnings and i dont get that 10 attributes 10 and that 5376000 sp back that i have in learnings im out i dont spend isk or rl money for a game where the only thing that really matters rl time is like in training your skillsi dont see why i would spend 15 a month so i can keep playing but with a lot slower progressit already takes a crapton of time to train some skills to 5 like up to two month when youre into capitals and i refuse to pay the same amount each month when my skill learning speed is effectively halfedso there are two optionsthey add 10 attributes  10 to each chacater or they reduce the amount of of money that you pay each monthand additionaly reimburse your training time that you have spend on getting your learnings to whatever level you have it at else ccp would effectively screw you over almost 2 month worth of game timebtw i like the idea of compensating this by increasing your learning speedso if the removal of learnings is not to be discussed and its only a matter of how to implement it i support this topic cake
i agree with the removal of learning skills they are not a fun mechanic they are an obligation and can really deter new people from getting into the gamemy main character has the tier 1 learning skills trained to 5 back when it was required for tier 2while i support this in spirit the original proposal might cause some imbalances perhaps something were players are rewarded attribute points over time would cause less issuesmaybe something like players at their 1 month mark get 1 to all attributes and so on would work better
this sounds like a pretty decent way to compensate people for their training time invested in learning while keeping the max rate of sp gain the same and getting rid of a poor mechanic its not really fun or fair to newbies to have to invest in a timesink so early in the game this game is brutal enough on new playersone thing i would like to add to it though is an isk compensation for the skillbooks while the base learning skills are cheap as rocks the advanced ones are rather pricey for new players i remember having to make sacrifices in what ships i could afford just to buy the learning skillbooks and i feel it would be a kick in the teeth for the newb who just spend their savings to train up these skills just to lose them immediately without getting the isk back

so in other words u want to force pvp fleets just for missions so that even more ppl can solo afk macro mineand what if they ecm spam your scorpion u cant run since ure guaranteed to be warp jammed and u cant fire back since ure ecmd and since ure ewar fit u have almost no tank to even survive hell even tracking disruptors will achieve the same result so no your illthought out idea is as ridiculous as the whole proposal and no forcing a warp jammer into every pve fit is not offering more varied fits although it is forcing pvp and fleeting into pve but again if u wanted thatjust pvp despite such a detailed proposal against missions u sure didnt put many details against miningwhat a surprisecare to elaborate
try rereading the sentence out loud paying attention to where the commas and full stops arei dont mine so didnt particular care shot a few mind youalso grammar fail on my part had meant the scorpion being used as part of a gang the idea being that ewar at the moment is strictly a pvp tool and it would be nice to offer it up to pve types as an additional valid tooland why not have a scramdis or two fitted throughout a small gang at the risking of being rp i am in uk after all its always struck me as odd that npcs wouldnt warp off occasionally from a strictly ic sense of courseem
i dont have to reread that sentence because this quote confirms itu do want to force pvp fleets into missions cause now ure saying the scorpion would be in a fleet when u already have the option to do so as is not to mention u constantly mention nothing but fleeting throughout the whole post seriously is more ewar the only sorry excuse u got left when ppl already use target painters and webs in missions thats what it all boils down tou want to force ppl to help u cause ure incapable of defending yourself
i honestly dont think this is going to make pve any better i remember when l3s were the cream of the crop and then these new exciting l4s came out oh em gee they were cool for about two weeks and then they became a boring grind again then cosmos missions which werent even cool for two weeks once everyone realized they were  and then l5 which again were exciting for a week or so oh i forgot about the epic arcslike everyone elseso what are you going to do make missions dynamic guess what my crystal golem is still going to tank it and its still going to be boring if you change mission rats to adapt to golems ill just take a passive rattlesnake no matter what new mission element you introduce its going to be either a forgotten or b adapted to in a week im not being cynical here its just what has happened in eve since well foreverbut its not all doom and gloom you know whats still exciting wormholes between wormholes and escalating complexes pretty much every dynamic that youre trying to force into missions exists instead of trying to modify missions to become fun just work with the existing things that are fun to make them more appealing or gasp add new fun pve content

this would be ideal
edit updated to reflect some posts belowthe problems 1 there is little incentive to use agents in lowsec or agents who occasionally send mission runners into lowsec 2 hisec mission running is very easy and lowrisk and at the same time earns more per hour than any other hisec professionthe solutionagents have dynamic quality the more people use an agent the lower the quality on the same token agents which are used less will rise in qualitycreate a larger disparity between the lowest and highest quality agents not a large as the difference between l3 and l4 but large enough to instantly notice the loss of lp etctie bounties to system security status so that rats in lowec give more bounty than rats in hisec and rats in 05 give more bounty than 10good effects of thismission hubs like dodixie and motsu having q19 agents since missioning here is virtually zerorisk the quality of the agent reflects that this combined with the low bounty means running missions in these areas is significantly less profitable players will move to lower security systems to get higher bountiesagents in deep lowsec and 00 will have very high quality and higher bounty than hisec increasing the payoutsagents for obscure corporations that nobody currently finds it worth running missions for will also have very high quality agentsagents on the border of lowsec will have higher quality because fewer people run them as well as having higher bounty than than 09 space so some but not all players will consider it worth it to mission thereplayers being more spread out will mean that places that are not currently market or mission hubs will have more markettrading opportunities especially in regions like everyshore where there are l4 agents but no market hubsmore people in lowsec because of greatly increased benefits of running l4s and ratting therethe players that move to 05 which is nowhere near lowsec will still have to contend with the fact that suicide ganking is much more viable in 05 space so mission running stops being zeroriskagents in divisions that primarily give out courier missions such as archives will have naturally high quality because everyone hates courier missions increasing the payouts of those missions something that is sorely neededdisadvantagesplayers whining that their zerorisk isk faucets are drying upsome market hubs came about because they were initially mission hubs so what will happen to them is uncertainninja salvaging will be harder as there will be fewer people in a given mission hubits difficult to predict how much players will actually be spread out by this so it may be hard to figure out the exact numbersheavy flux in lp markets for a month or two until things calm downi mentioned lp flux its important to remember that while lp and missions payouts are small theyre still significant what happens when half the mission runners in eve suddenly start getting half the lp from their now lower quality agents the value of lp will go up even if the price only goes up by a half a mission that netted you 2 mil through lp item sales will now net you 3 mil seeing as bounties will be dropping increased profits from lp sales will help make up some of that gap while giving another bonus to lowsec mission running on top of the increased bounties
i like also makes the game more immersive as you have to wonder why isinokka still has a problem with all those gurista fleets with all the genocide going on every day now it might not really do anything for lowsec but highsec would be more interesting as people might have to move to different regions periodically changing market hubs and the like
you realise that the way insurance works has changed and that its no longer free to lose t1 ships anywayedit and also that ccp recently reaffirmed to the csm that suicide ganking was intended and supported gameplay why therefore should it be punished
no support
agree with what you say except i have allways felt no insurance should be paid and this should be a factor that gankers should base their costs on maybe the changes in insurance will be enough
if someone uses their car for a hit and run and the car gets totaled two things happen they end up with more expensive insurance or become uninsurable and they pick up the police aggro in game they pick up the police aggro and get a nice hefty reward for using their car as a bullet shield  tank to rob the other people  armored car  expensive thing with
anyone who thinks any comparison at all can be made between rl insurance and ingame insurance has absolutely no concept of how one or the other of the two works
id have to say i dont agree with this im afraid the thing that immediately comes to mind is when i was being neuted and shot at by ninja salvagers one of the ninjas corpmates came in while i still had timer started firing at me and just between him activating no you will die warning since i still had aggro and the guns actually firing the corp aggro ran out i had taken from one of the ninjas cans to initiate a fight because i was being y hence the aggro and he got concorded i dont believe that was his fault even though i was the target i did feel a little sorry for him thanks to thisanother thing that came to mind is new players yea i know theres a warning but when you feel like youve got your chance to kill someone and youre a new player no longworded message is going to get in the way of you killing your target omg get out of my way kill them already yes then the new player loses their ship has no insurance payout and is back to mining veldspar in a noob ship with one mining laser how many people are going to keep playing after such a lossalso no matter what you do with insurance the highsec gankers will not be deterred by the lack of an insurance payout especially considering that theyre shooting at a hauler for its cargo its going to be worth getting concorded for whether they get an insurance payout or notedit corrected typos thanks to the magic iphone autocorrect
hey its not me that complains that the game shows drastic lacks of realistic immersion i live in 00 never have been ganked just had my research corp decked once took the tower down and spent five days of invention profits to make an allianceand the point still stands in rl you pay insurance to protect you and the other person you hit but it can be voided on your end if you do something bad like a hit and run in game here its a way to protect your assets from death and be able to recoup some of that the help the guy you hurt aspect is not in in game insurance to begin with but you would think the you doing something illegal would void it part would be sure your station insurance adjustor knows that space is dangerous and thats why it cost so much but hes a fool to insure someone who goes out and breaks the law for a game that is supposed to be mega corporations some gallente that goes out and ganks a gallente and gets paid by a gallente insurance agent makes the gallente look dumb and french
this makes no senseinsurance isnt expensive most ships are guaranteed to be destroyed during the insurance term for the insurance company to make a profit on insuring ships theyd have to charge over the payout instead we only pay a fraction of itlaws otoh have nothing to do with anything when it comes to capsuleers
i support no insurance payouts for pilots who lose their ships due to concord actions i do not support banning smartbombs from high sec ahs
for those of you using real life insurance analogies i remind you that if you took your car into a gun battle in lawless territory insurance would be void as wellso we should cancel all insurance including fleet fights and mission losses sound good
not if its concord sanctioned
im in nullsec running missions for sanshas nation a notorious pirate organization that regularly makes incursions into high sec to abduct citizensin this particular mission im taking on ded ships but they destroy mei still get insurance is this fair
you should never be awarded insurance due to concord or self destruction of your shipsupporteddont give a crap what people think of suicide ganking as this has nothing to do with it suffer anyway
u do realize that even low sec piracy isnt concord sanctioned since u take sec hits for it right im pretty sure a flood of pirate tears would commence if they could never get insurance for their actions which means it aint gonna happeni love the tons of threads crying about this how ppl want to turn this into wow not realizing that high security  complete security
good point on that but removing insurance from suicide ganks where according to the rules made by ccp you have to suffer a ship loss that is the same as blowing up your own ship which i also think you shouldnt get insurance for if i wanted it to be like wow id be in favour of 100 insurance with no module loss and you could wake up in a cloning station without having any skillpoint loss if you didnt set a clone when poddedas for 00 there is no laws out there to break so the post before yours that quoted me is a moot point afaic also if you are running missions in 00 from the pirate factions just for the sake of roleplay you could say it was an insurance scheme from the faction you are working from you probably even set up the insurance from the npc station you run the mission from anyway
not supportedt1 ships stopped being free alreadyfypsafer yes but not safeheh heh reminds me when i was a noob and dueling some other guy i knew first to 30 armor kind of thing and anyway i had to dock and refit and do something else came out aggro still ok no warning fire concordokkenkilled by module lag
sportinin my view insurance changes did not go far enough and the change was only negligable for bs at best thats certainly not to say i think suicide ganking should be removed with this change it would not be gankers would just need to be smarter in their riskreward equationtheres no real reason why insurance is paid out for suicide ganks get rid of it
signed
seriously though why not wait a few weeks and see what difference the insurance changes make
agreed
ive always thought the ui in eve looks from game from 1995 it needs to be redone to improve clarity functionality and overall coolness
now that the bit about l5s in hs has been removed i support this proposal while i would like to see l5 agents in highsec its not gonna happenas the above poster stated no hs missions to ls no ls missions to hs no l5 agents or missions in hs lowsec missions should be revised to allow for small fast ships andor pvptype ships in them or other missionappealing options keyed gates in missions missions outside of the normal scan range etcfor now supported
so even though its most definitely ccps stated desire to move the general populace out of high sec and into low and null sec you want to make it easier for people to cling missions taking you into high sec are there intentionally to encourage you to leave high sec and see that low sec is not the big bad dangerous place people seem to imagine heres a solution move all level 4 agents above quality 0 to 00 outposts via a renting or sov upgrade systemthen again youre also the csm candidate that wants to charge players real life cash for each player they kill in the game as a form of punishment so i would imagine listening to reason wont really be your thing
you dont get more people into low sec by doing this those who want to go to low sec use a low sec agent way saver and those that dont want just go to motsudodixieetc so much for load balancingmissions that take you to low sec from high sec are especially the things that lead people to believe that low sec is a big bad dangerous place you really dont want to go you will be at border systems that are way more dangerous than deeper low sec systems you got a pretty decent chance you get killed as soon as you jump into low sec yes most low sec entrances wont be camped but still the chance it is camped is a quite realistic possibility and how often do you think someone will return to low sec when he got killed on his first jump into low sec and otherwise probably probed down and killeduntil it is changed that as soon as someone has a point on a pve ship it dies especially when in a mission people wont go missioning in low sec deal with it
no support mission runners are irrelevant
yes but ccp wont be changing things to make less avenues into lowsec you still havent passed that point
gettting sent 5 jumps for a lvl1 combat mission or lvl2 mining mission when there are only 16 people in the current system doesnt look like load balancing it looks more like waste the paying customers time
the simplist answer to these problems is that these nerfs should have never happenedi and alot of others were quite happy with the way things wereif ccp want to cure server pressure then maybe they should fork out on upgrading thempersonally ive never in 2 years experienced game lag unless it was my own connection playing upan expansion should expand the game with cool new stuff for everyone maybe new mission storys not deflate itand tbh i was really looking forward to tyrannis and i to was totally deflated
a good idea to talk about tentatively supported ps bellums post is indicative of many pirates inability to think beyond their own narrow perspective i appreciate anks effort in the op to think about the needs of both high and low sec citizens
if people are going to move to low sec and null they are going to do it anyways there is no good reason for high sec agents to issue missions to low sec or low sec agents to issue missions to high sec your standard high sec mission runner is going to decline the mission anyways so if ccp was trying to nerf the living crap out of mission running then mission accomplished
roll back the lvl 5 like they where beffore
support remove them or please share the love with all factionsim in the freaking militia and i still dont want to take a pve ship to a buzzkill like mission in camped region and neut towers whats that insult to injury to people why try to take a af in that particular onewhen i enter omstama pipe in my pvp ship i want to pvp when im grinding corp standings to make money 20 jumps away i already have to worry about enthusiast ammar and caldari players probing down militia members running missions in high sec i most certainly dont want such wonderful storyline missions even dedicated fw missions that are always in low sec and create a freaking beacon are much more friendly and far more better on riskreward than theseto say it again if you love your experiment too much then add this kind of storyline missions to all sides its only fair
supported
supportedpirate fw is a nice idea also adding some meaning to the system occupancy would be nice oms was caldari lol
fw pvp1 ooooooohhh a plex just opened upwarps to plex2 lands on plex warps in two targets 1 mwd frigate taking all fire1 bomber cloaking up 150km from entrance3 2 mins later plex vanishes mission finnished cause boss was killed4 profitnot
mission vanishes in two minutes because you didnt stay however i would also love for there to be a way to grief all fw missions currently there is only one cutting the net in this one you can grab the documents to keep him from completing his objective
proposal personal bookmarks visible while on gridtldradd a visible selectable icon thumbtack that shows your own personal bookmarks on grid and no one elsespilots are being clever and are using the bookmark system as a method of warping to different points around an object in space this is great but setting up and executing these maneuvers is a pain in the ass as there are no visible indicators to use as a reference points pilots are instead forced to use celestial objects and improvised coordinates as reference points while this is impressive for those who do it right this is also silly setting up these bookmarks correctly takes ingenuity requiring pilots to give them extensive and annoying names such as new caldari x150 y20 z5 new caldari x150 y20 z5 etc and then organizing them further in order to avoid seeing 200 bookmarks all at the same time this process consumes extensive amounts of time and patiencemaking the bookmarks visible in space would make this process much easier especially for those of us with ocd this would also give combat pilots a much faster method of maneuvering around a gate instead of navigating complicated drop down menus to locate the correct bookmarkthe change is small and relatively painless and involves the following  your bookmarks will appear on grid with their icons be selectable and appear on your overview provided you are using the correct settings bookmark icons will function like beacons in that they can appear on your overview except that they do not appear while off grid for sanitys sake they will likely need a separate entry in the overview filter settings  it is of course also apparent that some people may have a rather large amount of bookmarks set up around a gate or in an area in future iterations you might consider including the ability to select which bookmarks appear on grid from the bookmarks menurough impact analysisrelatively easy to implementexpansion on already commonly used practice bookmarks and their use do not change they simply have their thumbtack icon displayed in spacewill require a small amount of development time and thus costthis proposal is hereby submitted for your consideration if anyone wishes to support this proposal please sign belowsignedmarcus ried
disagree i tested this with multiple jumpcapable ships and no such effect appears is there some special settings mix you need to make that work
there might be as there is a bubble around at least for me showing jump range
this would cause the richer and older players to get further ahead or at the very least remain aheada 10 mil sp player with 300 mil to his name gets double learning but is left broke and has to do it all againa 50 mil sp player with 3 bil to his name gets double learning and is left with 27 bil and can do so again next month without worryive only got 30 mil sp and i say not supported
great respect to anyone still politely trying to explain to the next horrible idea authori think i want pwn the game in 3 months and feel cool but they dont let me people will never change some things just cant be cured
derpa bitter old vet needs month to gain 5 to something a newbie needs day to gain 5 to somethingkeep trying if you like look up who was whining everytime anybody proposed neural remapping and see if its the exact same people with the exact same arguments who were wrong before and wrong nowbetter still let the wookie win
wati argued for remapping to be changed from 6 months to 12 months because its very easy for a veteran like me to remap to eg intmem then train those skills exclusively for 6 months  giving veterans an advantage over newbies who cant afford to put 12 months into only one type of skill hell even with 12 months im doing it its just a bit awkwardif i could pay for faster training id abuse it to hell and use just a tiny fraction of my cubic hyperlitre of isk to permanently train at 2x speed it would be great for me but terrible for the game
stupid idea if you want to farm to progress faster gtfb2wownot supported
yeah exactly neural remapping also obeys malcanis law ive been training at 2574 sphr almost since it was introduced further increasing the sp gap between myself and new players who cant spend 12 months training skills on a single stat combo and therefore must train at lower rates
get out
well wed better not change anything then bitter old veteran wants to maintain the status quo as is and will selectively understand and selectively rebut anything to achieve thisnobody cares if your sp rises faster you still need to train for a year for your next peen boat a peen boat that no newbie could care a carrot whether you fly it or not however giving a newbie the opportunity to enjoy eve content sooner apparently must be done only through the character trade forumwhy is thatwhat possible reason could bitter old veterans have for insisting on thishmmmm i wonder what it could be hmmmmmdont mind them having sp just not allowed to pay ccp directly for it hmmmm dont mind them having sp as long as they buy a character for itas long as bitter old vets get to benefit from character trading as well as everything else hmmmm not allowed to just pay ccp for game content directly hmmmmhmmmmm it feels a little bit like being subjected to bull am i being subjected to bull because it feels like itcould it be pure mental jealousy that you dont want anybody having something you didnt havewhat is itcome oncome clean nowno need for anymore bull get it off your chest simple time why are vets happy for newbies to buy sp from vets but not from ccpcome on you know the answer is so on the tip of your tongue it hurts to hold back
basicly thisthink about it whos going to benefit from this more a player who has a constant 2574 sphr boosting it to over 5k an hour or a player who gets 1k sphr boosting it to only 2k like has been said this will boost older players more than youngeredit  so what do you want you keep whining about catching up to older players but you think that older players getting further ahead is a good thingso this is all a i want that shiny thing now well too bad older players spent the time getting it you can too
derpy derp derp derp derp durpy durpmaybe you just need to read it more slowlypreeeeety seeeeeemplewhy can i have my shiny now as long as i buy character from bitter old veteran instead of ccp could it be pure mental jealousy that you dont want anybody having something you didnt havewhy the constant unending failure to communicate actual true feelings why the constant barrage that anybody who wants something different must be wrong when nobody is prepared to say why they are wrongagain maybe if i type it again maybe you can read it again itll only be the third timeno newbie will care if bitter old veteran maxs his endgame ship in only 6 months instead of 18 months but newbie does care that hes simply not allowed that ship in a month instead of three monthsand in actual genuine reality bitter old veteran doesnt care if newbie pointlessly flies a zealot in dodixie in one month instead of three but for the purposes of threads like these bitter old veteran is prepared to swear blue is pink rather than allow something he wasnt allowed unless that newbie buys his character from a bitter old veteran in which case its okbut sure go ahead misread misinterpret answer the question you wish you just got asked and if that still fails shout troll or hater and declare victory then run to the next thread where you might have better genuine success
if youd included bitter old veteran just one more time in your post i would have relented of my error and changed to supportbut alas you gave up just short of the mark what a shame
have an age cut off your chars all have a birthday have it just drop off or have the thing be on a logrithmic scale price wise so what cost a noobie 1 plex in his first 5 million sp or whatever cost an old one like me 10 plex when hes at 50 million i dont think its as much of a lets catch up to the crotchty old vets as it is just be able to do stuff this beats the hell out of the char bazarr with double training speed it gets people to be like that char in the bazarr faster without hearing all the ing about how so and so bought that char and has no idea how to use it and whoops there goes that mothership onto the killboard saying microtransactions are not to be in the game is bs and we all know it the second you could sell plex  gtc for isk you introduced direct to ccp microtransactions sure the isk goes to player x instead of a sink but all the precious  just made ccps pocket 35 dollars fatter for that widow that you just had to have here is where you will make your argument that if one person uses a plex to buy something someone else gets 1 month of not paying that would work if you got 12 plexes for 132 like you do for a 1 year subscription but you get 6 plex for 112 iirc so for someone who does that route like i did to get my carrier ccp just mega profited as i paid for about 10 or 11 months but only caused six worth of lost transactionsthis one especially is going to get me a bunch of go play wow and hello kitty online links i dont see why doing things in game shouldnt reward you with sp sure you learned things by injecting that skillbook in your head we decided to go matrix style with the skilling but in the matrix they pretty much went from 0 to 5 instantly with the exception of neo who was the monkeyshpere of the matrix and went to lol 6 i love the whole you learn while not playing thing because that is feasible my carriers million page insruction manual isnt going to be read in a night but you would think you would gain some knowledge of how a blaster works by going out and shooting things especially when said blaster has pretty much became part of my body i dont need level four thermodynamics to tell me not to touch the hot heat sink as its hot
because the character transfer moves sp from one account to another without adding sp whereas this terrible terrible terrible idea is an sp faucet which just like in the market which you probably also dont understand causes inflation and devalues the currency for everyoneif you want instant gratification go elsewherethere is no skills raceoff the top of my head macros ccp dont want a grind ccp dont want to advantage basement dwellers in skilling
hi bitter vet heretbh im against being able to buy isk through plexs and character trading so im not happy that you can buy sps from players and not from ccpand putting it bluntly what i dont want is someone to be able to do what i can do without spending the time and having the patience that i haveyou have remaps every 12 months you can use you have readily available cheap attribute implants we never had when we started you have had the skills made easier so you can train the advanced learning skills which isnt mandatory btw and you have had a load of core skills with reduced prereqs we never had and yet you still moan and whineit isnt us who are bitter really is it
if they are in their basement grinding they arent really macroing are they and if ccp doesnt want a grind wouldnt it be logical to remove all missions from the game and rats and complex really the only thing that is not grinding is when i do all my inventions and trading because that actively changes to suit what you guys are buying and when i do that all that happens is i get rich and the pvp guys that do a ton of pve for money call me the carebear when im more the arms dealer then anything maybe we should introduce just farting money type beans into local 1000 times and get a billion iskies eve sometimes feels like a game that doesnt want to be played at allthere is one part of this that is provably wrong old character creation has a perma buff to learning with a new character the max you can get in any one skill is 30 points even with my guy from 25 years ago my perception is currently pushing 308 in perception and could still go up from his plus four to a plus five and could train the rank 3 skill from 4 to five to give him an effective 328 its not much but it is a buff over what the maximum possibility is for a new person because i started playing when bloodlines mattered that much
old character creation has a buff to learningive been making characters for the corp im in every 6 months since i started this one sure you could make the attributes higher a few years back but its quicker to get the new characters with the skills i need to the levels because of the way you pick the attributes and you also have double the learning speed for the first one and a half or so million skillpointsswings and roundaboutsi would like to pay for sps though because im loaded iskwise and dont really use it for much other than trying to collect stuff for my own personal museum
they were meant as separate problemsyes and supportbut in isk earning there will always be a grind somewhere whereas the skill system has no and needs no grind
nopeif you cant sell your character the amount of sp available to play with doesnt rise if you dont want that character any longerand even if the amount of sp in eve did rise where is the problem if its all been paid foroh noes fair fights instead of good fights is that the problemstill waiting on this answer getting lots of anger and bull but an actual answer is pretty much all that is requiredeven if the answer is blind jealousybut i suspect the answer might relate to something slightly like ummm the amount of rl cash you put into a character over time then the amount you can sell it for on the bazaar because rl for plex for isk just isnt enough for bitter old vets they want rl for sp for isk at a much much higher rl  isk conversion rate than is available for newbies with rlplexiskthe bitter old vet has already spent the time training his many characters and farmed characters the newbie has not if ccp start selling sp directly bitter old vet has to reach for the lubebitter old vets dont like lubeoh wait you have a more plausible answerthat would be very interesting sadly whatever that weird thought is bubbling up isnt an answer its just weirdsp devaluing wait what i need more sp to fly the same ship as somebody else i need more isk to fly the same ship as somebody elsewhat the blazing blueberry muffin are you going on about inflation for its not even relevant to the point as well you already know come on come clean get that answer out or duck and swerve its real popular with the bitter vets when theyre completely and utterly stuck
i have 33 intelligence and started after they introduced remapping are you doing something wrong also try to reach my perma 2772 sph without remapping and loosing your bonus
omg more sp not  more options what game are you playing dude in any game ever invented more xp  more options
i wasnt sure how to answer this because to be fair i couldnt understand what he was on about lol
bad idea really badahs
basically i was just saying that the older characters can get their skills higher then new characters can with remaps if you were to go build a character today and train his learning skills up to level five and then throw in plus 5 implants your character will hit 30 sp as the cutoff older characters such as mine from 25 years ago before they implemented the new way to create your character creation can top out at 33 or so and my character has been remapped by the way and i still hit the 328
hello im surprised to see this proposal still on the first page i expected it to have died i thank to all of you on both side of the coins who kept it floating there are too many replies i cannot comment on them all so id like to rephrase a key factor of this suggestion that many seem to have missedthe average sp of eve players are about 2m but that doesnt mean 50 of eve players have more then 2m sp because of the huge amount of alt and quitted players with 6k800k sp still sitting in the database my personal estimation is that probably 90 of eve players will have less then 5060m sp assuming thats indeed the case most of the vets here probably wont benefit from this proposal
they only difference between bitter old vets and newer players is that the older players can do more things thats it there only a finite amount of skills that make you better at something in eve once youve trained them all to 5 youll be just as good as the vets in that particular area more sp does not mean you are better here is and idea why not use those plex to buy an alt omg double sp training right there two specialized characters at 15mills sp can be better than any 50 mills character
im old and feeble and im tired of missing the tiny green bar at the top of the module if i miss it is generally not a good thing because it may take another cycle or two before i notice or i may activedeactivate a mod by accident its not always so easy in the heat of battle when making a lot of clicks to hit iteven if the button covered the same screen area but was a box or circle at the top of the mod or something it would be better for instance the rack overloading buttons are small but easy to hit
use a keyboard shortcut imolianged but supported im in favor of all ui improvements
a key and click combo would be nice too ex holding shift and clicking on the module toggles overheat
i really dont want to know how many modules i killed because of missing the button
shortcuts would be awesome bigger buttons toosupported
absolutely
old and feeble supporting this
completely support  the ui shouldnt be your enemy
i have real issues with this the amount of times ive failed to toggle heat at a crucial moment due to a misclick that has often just deactivated the module insteadsupporting
i didnt agree at first saw the choice as a smart way to save costs however i must agree now that ive seen the sorry state of console fps gamingit seems to me that being a console fps game its likely that within 4 weeks the game will be relatively dead especially when p2p mp game hosting there is a clear difference between fps on console vrs pc on console fps games come and go they are generic ports and made for cheap hit the market sell well then die off ready for the next fps whereas on pc communities form dedicated servers are tweaked to perfection and players loyally play the same fps for years on endconsole fps is a nobrainer usually its a quick cash injection that really does workhowever if the aim is to create a strong franchise that maintains popularity over years then console is the worst place to be
 man jesus
there are a number of definable flaws with releasing dust on console onlythe lifetime of any console game is restricted to a maximum of the lifetime of the console with many other limiting factors coming into play competition in the console games market is incredibly fierce games released on consoles tend to have absolutely huge marketing budgets and console gamers have short attention spans dust may well be the best console shooter when it is released but how long can it feasibly hold onto that top spot only until the next big thing comes out be it another halo god of war final fantasy or call of duty to have any longevity dust will have to keep pace with developments in other console shooters and continually do better than any new releases which come along and try to tempt the playerbase away to newer and shinier toysone thing that is essential if dust is to integrate with eve successfully is a stable playerbase and the work needed to maintain that on a console is orders of magnitude greater than that required on the pcif dust is released exclusively on consoles it will more than likely be a phenomenal success for a couple of months until it is surpassed by the next big thing this is great if it is a standalone title with no connection to eve apart from the ip and im sure that ccp will rejoice in the amount of money it makes them however as part of the eve experience it is likely to be little more than an footnotethe entire concept of dust deserves more than this a marrying of eve and an fps on pc can achieve that if anyone has played planetside the potential for deepening and expanding the eve universe into ground based combat is something that should not be done in half measuresdust for pc and fully integrated with eve or on console but a standalone title those are the only two options which make sense
supported also i do believe ccp need to add more content from time to time but the bugs in game are overwhelming atm
i agree and support this 167 we need a fix the sht patch  patent pending examples  probably being repeated but hear are a fewlag monster  not going theretheres no lag on sisi can we play there  cyno effect  seriously is this that hard give us our eye candyship balancing  we have to many ships that need tweaking bad cough cruiserslow sec  this is a useless waist of space and l5 mission need to be mixed into empire againalliance logos  i think were past this ccp lets get the logos in gamefaction warfare  erm  yea  are you playing the game too ccp not just making itworm holes  we got issuessov  seems the same with more space mods to blobaddress book folders  really really did we have to mess with that this is just a taste let the next patch be about the players needs real needsreal request that have been drowning in endless pools of trolled forums petitionsps and ambulation would be cool next i would forget about the whole complaint aboveno no what am i saying lets get this fix it patch for the playersthank yee
id rather have an expansion even 2 for that matter with no new content but a lot of old content completed and fixed 
supporting this expand on the existing features before adding more new ones
instead of starting another thread that will only get a handfull of supporters and then fall by the wayside why dont you all go to
i support this idea wholeheartedly
hell no
agreed
as a gallente only spec character im in favour of this particularly on the gunneryblaster aspects of this thread
as many have noticed items on the market can be sold for any amount i personally have problems with font and window sizes so i have resorted to having friends by things for me on the market just to avoid any more buying mistakes in the past ive paid 800 mil for a mammoth and 400 mill for a shield recharger ii i ran the game in 800x600 until i was forced to increase the resolution now the csms tell me i can go to low resolutions but that may affect what i see on screen why is this such a hasslepeople should not be able to sell an item for 10000 of its regional average since ccp prides eve for its reality i counter with the fact that if someone scammed me in real life as is allowed on this market the authorities would come in and provide a hefty penalty to the offender post your support for this thread and experiences with market scams i would like to see who else finds this a reoccurring problem
have fun with your carbon
i dont think offering something on an open market at way above its actual value would be seen as a scam irl just kinda dumb
its not their fault if you cant count your zeroes nobody would ever fall for a scam if they paid attention
i dont think you get the sandbox ideasince when did it become ccps responsibility to protect us from our mistakes
there are filters on the market screenstowards the right hand side look for a little white triangle this will allow you to filter out certain market valuespersonally i find the filtering options page a little bit too ccp friendly to be actually useful but if you keep trying for a month or so i reckon youll get it working well enoughthe filtering options are in the settings tab of the market screenedit oh wait was i just supposed to troll you like everybody elseooops my bad
thanks for actually replying and i will look at the settings for the others who didnt get the point not all of us have 30 monitors or good eyes ive literally used a magnifying glass so i could count the zeros as far as selling for ridiculous amounts i guess you folks dont live somewhere with a government by your logic we shouldnt have concord at all just let new players die until theres so few coming in that the game turns into nothing but vets thats a path to widespread failure of the game itself i much rather live in a place where price gouging is illegal but im sure there will just be more trolling because screwing other people is fun to somerant off
sort by pricescroll down until you see one in station or systempurchase itrepeat as necessary
that is not a scam you merely overpaid for a item i fail to see how its ccps responisbility to solve or prevent lapses in competence or common sense
how is bad eyesight a lapse in competence or common sense
my ethics professor used to tell me if you ask the wrong question you will never get the right answeryoure asking the wrong question  or rather trying to fix the wrong problem the problem isnt that people can sell things at a 10000 markup  the problem is that the font used in eve is extraordinarily unfriendly for people with poor eyesight making it hard sometimes exceptionally so to make informed decisionsthe problem that needs to be fixed is the game needs to easily scalable up to resolutions like 800 x 600 so that people with poor eyesight can still play the game on an even footingso i cant support the op but i do support as have many others adding additional accessibility to the eve ui for those folks who dont see as well as the rest of us
im impressed by your approach since a couple staff had told me that lowering resolution would cause functionality problems i didnt consider what you proposed to be an option im happy others are in support of accessibility changes and hope an answer will be provided soon thank you for your reply
youre quite welcome one thing they could add is a screen magnifyer like some graphics applications have that let you display certain parts of the screen in much larger sizes i would consider that an interim step to a better ui it wont solve all of the font issues with the ui but it would at least make counting those 0s easier
drone regions need some love all the content is lowquality give the nonmacro guys there something to do besides mining
ever heard of this skill probably not heres the ded connections skill desriptionskill at dealing with concord department and negotiating bountiesbonus fee of 1500 isk per pirate head per level of the skillthats right this skill you get 1500 addition isk per npc kill per levelthis is completely useless it shouldnt take too much programming to make it so that ded connections gives say a 5 or 10 bonus to lowsec and nullsec bounties per level this would make these regions a tad more attractive and make missions accepted in highsec that occur in lowsec more lucrative
this should be simple to implement just do the following before bounty rewards are given so it would be checked around every 1520 minutes per systemcheck ded connections skill levelif ded connections skill level  1 award bountiesif ded connections  1 check systems security levelif systems security level  5 award bountiesif systems security level  5 add ded connections skill levelbounties05 to bounties and award bountiesactually 45 because of truesec
the simplist answer to the problems missioners are experiencing is that these nerfs should be reversedi and alot of others were quite happy with the way things wereif ccp want to cure server pressure then maybe they should fork out on upgrading itpersonally ive never in 2 years experienced game lag unless it was my own connection playing up even during peak times doin lvl4s in motsuan expansion should expand the game with cool new stuff for everyone maybe new mission storys not deflate itand tbh i was really looking forward to tyrannis and i too was totally deflated
mission fixesnot nerfs
you sir are an idiot
fyp
btw can you stop putting links to dodgy virus type websites in all the forums please thankyou
what nerfs you mean the reduction in t1 drops for named that were wrecking the most accessible part of the manufacturing industry while also playing havoc in the mining industry the overall loss of iskhour from the profession that involves the least risk and is the single biggest contributor to inflationsounds like a readjustment to me
no he is talking about the load leveling change that was introduced that sends mission runners to low sec constantly as it automatically sends people to the least busy system within a certain radiuswhich is 4 jumps i believe as it was i never ran into mission related lag either so why there was a load balancing system put in place no one really understandsi havent messed with it yet so i have no opinion but from what people are saying its a joke how often you get sent to low sec even worse is that farmers will simply pull a ton of missions and run them without finishing them over and over while holding up all the available missions in a system driving regular mission runners further and further away
no im talking about the adjustment made to where agents send you for missions including lvl5s i am limited to time i can spend on eve i spent alot of time skilling and grinding isk to fly a solo lvl5 ship they are hard enough without the delight of ganking lowsec pirates i trained for it why cant i reap the profits if anything why not reduce the rewards of hisec lvl5s or make harder lvl4s with better rewards not make it impossible for those that relied on themso no hisec lvl5s  no income  no plex  no playfine to those that can spend all day grindingbut hey nvm
i can understand your frustration but eve isnt a grind game its a sandbox game i admit i did run lvl4s for 6 months solid believing that this is the best way to make is but the high numbers in highsec and the emptyness of lowsec 10 systems jumping hours ratting 3 people showing up once i realized that lowsec and nullsec werent as scary as i had led myself to believe i had much more fun hanging out with my friends and defending my own little section of the galaxyeve is a social game and missions can reap great rewards but the nerf as you say only makes other professions more appealing spread your horizons a bit your skills could be greatly utilized in a lowsec pvp corp or a nullsec alliance make friends and take risks you might actually end up in a place you like better than where you are nowi fully support nullsec operations and tbh ive lost less ships in lownullsec than i have to gankers in highsec htfu and do something differentjust my 2 isk not that its worth muchmidnight pheonix
i have played the game by running missions casually for 6 years now and you are telling me i have been doing it wrong all this time
since a sandbox game by definition is a game where you do what you want if he wants to grind thats sandbox
ouUFFFD 1 mais jaime bien quand meme la nouvelle
i dont have much of an issue with other areas but in gallente space every region is piled on top of every other region the only places in sinq laison that i can really remember in my head are the eastern and southern areas where there arent 3 regions making it impossible to tell whats happening minmatar has kind of the same problem with 2 regions sitting on top of each other but other than that nowhere else in space is like this
i dont know why people are disagreeing that the map is  the map is 
last two times they changed the map they made it worse each time darker and more incomprehensible while a new map would be pretty sweet ive no faith in ccp to actually do it properly and instead theyll probably make it even worse and more unreadable so tbh i would prefer they just left it alone at this stage
qftboth the 3d and flattened map have their issues and both need a rework
definitively yes
tldr t1 industrials are boring lets differentiate themlong versiont1 industrial ships can be made much more interesting if we create a few classes for them each with a different role since there are 5 levels of the racial industrial skills lets make five classes each race should assign a different skill level requirement to each class but the basic class and huge class should always be skill level 1 and 5 respectivelyall ships get 5 cargo per level of racial industrial in addition to the classspecific bonus listed belowbasic class low agility low defense medium cargo 25k m3 max 5 velocityleveltank class low agility high defense battlecruiser level medium cargo 20k m3 max 5 shieldarmor resistlevelfast class high agility frigate level low defense low cargo 10k m3 max enough pg for mwd 5 agilitylevelhuge class low agility low defense huge cargo 50k m3 max 5 cargolevel so a total of 10levelwildcard class specific to each raceminmatar wildcard 20 tractor beam rangelevel with 8 high slotscaldari wildcard 5 scan strengthlevelamarr wildcard designed for combat with tank and gank equivalent to t1 cruisergallente wildcard 25mb drone bandwidthlevel 25m3 done bayleveleven if you dont like every one of these ideas i think that t1 industrials could be made a lot more interesting than they are now
i can see that industrials need to be looked at the fact that amarr have only two t1 industrials and both have the skill requirement at 1 is interesting as is the caldari ones that dont have much cargo capacityhowever the wildcard suggestions are completely improbable the minmatar one would be a destroyer on steroids and everybody would want one amarr and gallente would be too easy to abuse check this for evidence and for caldari why in the world would an industrial need scan strengthindustrials need to become more balanced but your idea is rediculous not supported
i think the fact that the wildcards would all have terrible tank and agility would prevent them from becoming unbalanced but they would be interesting but anyway does an idea have to be perfect to get support the main point is that industrials need to be more interesting
im going to call it now this idea is terrible
a change to industrials would be good but your changes need work as wellsupporting the thought not the solution
signedif these are indeed minor changes they seem to be then they should at least lie in the todopile
supported  and yes to anti aliasingwe should also have ships explode in hullcrunching detail too
do you think ccp actually has a todo list like do they have a pool of issues that they can choose to work on or do they just do whatever
oh im sure they have a to do list its probably just burried under the piles of massive expansions like dust and incarna
i have a topic up on the ideas and suggestions forums concerning destroyers it has become evident why balancing destroyers is a such a pain
edit spelling8 small guns with no penalties this will do more dps than some cruisersyou realize that that would be effectively 7 drones plus the lets say 8 guns on it thats not op or anythingyou seem to not pay attention the trasher is the one that isnt brokenand this will do what400mm plate  30pg800mm plate  200pgthat 800mm is not going to fit one way or the otherwhyalso that would make tech 1 small smart bombs have the same range as t2 large ones and a really fast ship not op at allyeah totally not trying to get afs with 8 guns slap this on with two eanms and whoops there it goesbecause it is too overpowered as it stands but a good discussion should modify it enough to make it viablehow what could possibly change and have this be the same suggestion 5 warp disrupt strength and a 100 bonus to warp scrambler range isnt like better than a t2 arazu or anythingwell then its a good job what you are willing to do means nothing or wed be in trouble
so your telling me that the csm has had this lengthy list of issues that needed fixing and that theyve already found a solution for but yet it has not been plugged in and yet with the last 2 expansions they havent put anything else in terms of fixes that really make a differenceum maybe the  youve already found the solution for should be implemented seriously
tyrannis has been deployed and there are a lot of issues that are coming up the forums are abuzz of problems that need to be checked and must be fixed before you even consider working on the next expansion1 new node crash  desync issues2 memory problems with eve and sever communication problems3 pi balancing and phasing out of npc products4 long standing balancing issues t3 drone bays 5th subsystem and af5 cyno effects1111one6 eve gate issuesthere are a lot of problems so forget about the expansion until these are hammered out instead of breaking ccp into teams put everyone together and work on these problems 1 at a time yes i know a lot of people are out of the loop but you can bring them up to speed really fasttldr postpone work on new expansion until 14 have been addressed and deployed and focus all dev resources on fixing the current issuesok standard rules apply in my threads no flaming please offer good constructive feed back and use proper grammar if you have noticed ccp responds more to good constructive feedback rather than whine if i missed a key issue please add it and i will modify the op
theres alrdy a huge as post about this
having read the patch notes very carefully for tyrannis i notice a fair number of missing changestwo simple examples overview distance right justified instead of left justified loss of t2 markings from ships in hangars and items in cargocontainerswhateversince these are not in the patch notes there can be only two reasonsone they were deemed too low detail to bother withtwo someone made changes to code without logging nor clearing itnow given some of the other low level trivial changes in the patch notes i really doubt number one so imho not so humble i am a software designer with 25 years experience ccp has a programmerprogrammer management issue both in making sure people record the changes they make and that these changes are reviewedif changes are made but not tracked then they cannot be tested because no one knows to test themif changes are made but not tracked then no one can review the implications of said changes and possible ramifications and side effectsquality does not come easily or quickly and if you do not put the effort in up front you end up putting in much more effort later attempting to recover the damagei end up putting this in a forum post with a small hope that some of the people who need to change will see this

snip
localhorsekasigi spent quite a bit of time puttering around decon with delilah wild a number of months ago i cant confirm they are all alts but definitely sleeping with one another
im noticing a trend here as well
scandalincest  or your average political scene
gratz to ankhand gratz to her so called opponents for the pathetic smear campaign that could make one wonder about their intellectual capabilities in fact being so pathetic that one can only start to think that the opponents in fact are supporters running a clever contrasupport campaigni any case a vote for ankh seems to have been a kick in the nuts for some of the egomaniacs around here and that can only be seen as a good thing
you started a new thread so you could get the old one locked because people werent being sycophantic enough okay well here goes againankh lied to her electorate and resorted to evemail and trade hub local spam in order to panic highsec voters into electing her the views she holds of this game are biased to the extreme both against particular playstyles and the individuals that practice them whom she considers to have mental deficiencies in real lifehere are some choice quotes exposing here views on eve and the people that play it taken verboten
this i dont think most of the so called carebears would subscribe to these view points tbh
every ankh thread is an antiankh threadbut any publicity is good publicityand all the antiankh statements are just quotes of ankhi feel a division by zero coming on
first of all thank you for posting something more concrete than the usual ank is the end of eve as we know it fare again quotes taken out of context from what i can tell all from this thread for those who would like to follow along ill only address the first quote you listed for now since that is the only one that i can believe anyone would take as an actual literal proposal rather than simply being her opinionso if you read everything she says surrounding that one quote it doesnt seem to me that she was seriously suggesting what you quoted the other quotes you listed are in my opinion not proposals if she wants to rp about how much she hates pirates more power to her its no worse than some of the anticarebear smack aimed at her and others and if people want to  about it more power to them too personally i prefer to look at the policies she actually wants to implement i think its far more constructiveas far as lying to her electorate im not sure to what lies youre referring so youll have to elaborate on thatid also like to point out that this is from 2008 if you read some of her more recent campaigning you may agree with me that shes much better at articulating her ideas now many of the ideas themselves are the same i just feel like shes better at getting her points across now
i believe the lie he was referring to was the spam in jita and elsewhere that all the other csm candidates wanted to move level 4s to lowsec
im pleased to see others voicing their open and welcoming attitude to ank and her views and like localhorse picking apart the pathetic arguments made by pirates during and after their smear and fearmongering campaign it is quite common for vocal groups to garner attention because squeaky wheels get grease and by eyeballing the forums there seems little doubt that the whines of pirates dominated the last campaign that should not be mistaken for broadbased support reasonable people often sit on the sidelines and do not speak what is on their minds a sidedebate about democratic participation more importantly it bespeaks the fear of pirates that their privileged protections in eve may eventually come to an end i think you protest too much to paraphrase the bard now like localhorse i dont necessarily agree with everything ank or the other take care party representatives have proposed but i do see in these proposals an honest attempt to optimize eve for all its players i also see other candidates like diedra vaal a fellow uni who are willing to do the same theirs is a far more reasonable and honest approach than the deflections obfuscations fabrications and overt selfinterest of those representing pirates so a challenge to our pirating curs  let us hear some reasonable proposals from you about improving eve for all its citizens and not just your own group you can make a start by actually reading the proposals made by ank and kin on the csm wiki and responding to those in a constructive manner i and my mates will gladly discuss and support proposals that really do benefit eve as a whole delilahfriendsofevewordpresscomps actually this isnt a new thread started by ank in order to lock the other the congratulations thread was moved from crime and punishment by a gm who didnt understand the context or sardonic nature of the post it was then locked by another gm in jita park for being duplicative of congratulations ank no big deal honest mistakes happen and we shall carry on from here
fearmongering like spreading false horror tales about the views of other csm candidatesill support decent proposals by ankh shes made one or two but i really cant respect someone who refers to an entire subset of players who grasp the point of eve far better than she does as psychopathic virgins merely because she doesnt like what they do
ankh is the sarah palin of eve
with all redeeming features removed
see locked thread below to view the outcome of this one also stop posting the same  over and over again
once again the actual quote in context she was responding to that very same accusation towards herself and it was directed towards a very specific character for a very specific reason if someone said that to me i might respond in a similar manner im sure a lot of us would haveas for the alleged local spam and lies i havent seen any of it i wasnt around for her campaigning in local now i realize theres no real way to prove one way or another what was said but can someone please post some examples of the behavior in questionfrankly i dont know what was said but considering that after doing some research most if not all of the negative characterizations ive read of ank have proved to be unfounded well you can imagine why im skeptical of these claims

man my threads owned
i had two main threads one in cp and one in this area one with 4k views and the other with 6k two eve videos with a combined 1k downloads some cool interviews and other things and i finished 15th so im pretty sure its just a matter of in order of importancea getting block support from an alliancegroupb spamming trade hubsc promising the unrealistic popular threads are just a byproduct
im pretty sure the other csm members will also be doing this not having ahnk as chair was pretty much my only hope not having her in the csm at all would be a bonus but shes a slimy politician so that was a long shot
ugly ones use chairs too you might end up as ankhs chair on the csm
congrats on wasting space with a new topic instead of replying to an existing one
this one was better till you came in
iirc doesnt ccp have the final say in suggestions getting implementedim pretty sure they wouldnt seriously change one of the major aspects that makes eve unique from other games lawless space means lawless space you can make it by lying stealing cheating and conniving other people out of their isk ships ore or other items if you have the charisma cunning intellect muscle and most importantly the balls of steel to do so
yup and congrats to mynxee i honestly almost voted for herexactly marsuga and no one least of all me is suggesting that this be changed thats my whole point everyone claims that ank is antipvp this is patently false some of her suggestions would even encourage more pvp

i think the whole security status thing needs to be looked at basic insurance needs to be taken out entirely if you didnt buy insurance you dont get a payout at all taking away a minimal insurance payment isnt likely going to help anything by itself when the suicide ganker is likely just an alt of an already rich player they dont do it for the profit they do it for the lulz anyway but yes i also think its silly that you get insurance payout even if you paid for the insurance if you are killed as an outlaw at all much less killed by the authoritiesconcord should be changed to simply being an additional police force with multisystemregion jurisdiction mortal so they can be avoided but still powerful and with a longer memory 24hours for anyone aggressing towards another player stronger and more ships in higher sec systems gives pirates more things to do with their dscanner as they will remain hunted as long as they are in concord controlled space of any security statusi would also change this chart fromplayers with 20 or worse will be attacked in 10 systemsplayers with 25 or worse will be attacked in 09 systemsplayers with 30 or worse will be attacked in 08 systemsplayers with 35 or worse will be attacked in 07 systemsplayers with 40 or worse will be attacked in 06 systemsplayers with 45 or worse will be attacked in 05 systemstoplayers with 00 or worse will be attacked in 10 systemsplayers with 10 or worse will be attacked in 09 systemsplayers with 20 or worse will be attacked in 08 systemsplayers with 30 or worse will be attacked in 07 systemsplayers with 40 or worse will be attacked in 06 systemsplayers with 45 or worse will be attacked in 05 systemsi would also alter once your security status reaches 5 you are considered an outlaw and can be attacked by players anywhere without concord intervention so that people with outlaw security status via the prior chart are free game to anyone without concord intevention and without the risk of a security hit that would actually make for antipirate activity to be worthwhile for players in hisecsuicide ganking is only effective because nobody can attack the pirate unless they attack someone first and even then the only person who can attack the pirate is the person who is getting attacked and the pirate has already decided that they are likely to win so that there really is limited risk
problems1 fw occupancy usually has little to do with pvp pvp and occupancy are often very different types of activity or put differently fw occupancy involves too much pve and not enough pvp2 fw pvp too often consists attacking someone and then getting blobbed3 too much time is spent shipping up or down4 too much time is spent looking for a similar sized gang you may want to engage as opposed to run from or that will just run from you solution1 remove npcs from occupancy related plexes npcs in the plexes ruin it who wants to fight with your ability to win gimped by some intangible amount of rat dps and ewar from rats its lame fighting when you are under fire and ewar from npcs really i dont want npcs whoring my killmails anyway 2 inform militias when players enter plexes when someone from fw enters a complex gate all militias should know who entered where ship types and the plex type this is intel that should just be provided via a separate chat channel after all if a system is contested that means both sides likely have npc spies there giving info here i do not mean player spies but npc militia spies that will post in the channel but they do not fly around in ships they are more like bureaucratic spies the only way their presence would be known in game is they would post in the plex intel chat channel this way the players could get a gang out there to fight the enemy pvp gang before the plex runs no npcs in the fight instead information about where you can find pvp 3 have more plexes pop up through out the regions and throughout the day not just down time 4 dont require scanners just have the plexes appearcommentsif ccp made those two changes i think plexing would make fw the absolute best pvp mechanic in the game will it solve everything no but it will i believe substantially cut down on the problems i listed abovei would point out 3 plexes shouldnt mainly spawn at downtime they should be spawning throughout the day and frequently i thought the csm already recommended this to ccp  though i could be wronghow will this make plexing more of a pvp activity by removing the npcs people will fit their ships for pvp there will be no trade offs that need to be made for dealing with the various rats fit your ship for pvp and go capture systems wont this lead to people just flying noob ships in plexs that is where the second change comes in currently if you are going to do plexes the most effective way is to get in a small ship that can tank the npcs and hope the timer runs before the enemy knows your even there the current mechanics make this the smart way to plex however with the proposed changes the other militia will know where you are and likely come to kill you so if you are not prepared to fight chances are you will get chased out before the timer is up the entire enemy will be put on notice as to where you are and what you are flying so your chance of holding the plex depends on your pvp power instead of your pve prowesscomments continuededit added some ideas to deal with ecm problems that this system may create see page 3 post 64
continued from ophow will this reduce blobs well im not sure it will reduce actual blobs but it will reduce their impact on the game in at least 3 ways 1 it will make it easier to avoid getting blobbed currently since most of the pvp occurs in the system you can have a bait ship and then as soon as someone engages the bait you can have a fleet warp right on top of them here you will be in a plex so if people try to warp to you they will not warp directly on top of you they will warp to the gate now you can decide to engage the enemy as far from or close to the gate as you like if you engage say 90km off the gate then you will 1st see local spike the blob will have to warp to the gate jump through the gate and then try to burn out to you this will give you time to either kill a few of the enemy or try to get away if the blob jumps in with sniper fits they may not need to burn out to you they can start shooting right at the gate but they will be quite vulnerable if you have some close range reinforcements coming 2 if the enemy is flying around in one big blob then you can spread out and take plexes far from where the blob is moreover if the enemy just tries to stay in one big gang chasing individual plexers they may get trapped by an enemy blob from an occupancy stand point though it would be better to break up the blob into 5 groups taking plexes though out the fw area than it would to have one big blob lumbering around capturing none of the plexes and trying to chase plexers away and likely getting no kills in the process 3 the plexes are already size limited so if you bring 30 battleships to chase away 3 destroyers and 3 frigates doing a minor plex you wont get in the size of the gang has to be able to get into the plexes hence other than major plexes the blob warfare as we know it wont work how will this reduce the time it takes shipping up or down well the intel channel tells you the size of the fleet you are to deal with so it will greatly speed this uphow will this reduce the time you spend roaming looking for a like sized gang well the intel channel tells you where they are and the type of gang they have so the problem is about as solved as possiblewill there be a fleet in system waiting on the gate even though only a few are in doing the plex sure thats possible you still need to scout but thats not so baddoes this mean the larger and more powerful militia will win occupancy yeah i think it does but thats the way it should work

too often in this game bugs and poor game mechanics are left in place  sacrificed on the altar of shiney new toys eventually this will mean an unplayable game and the users deserting at the moment outside of the eve community eve has a a good reputation that attracts new players it does not take much to change this and shrinking player base and bad reviews from explayers could turn that around quicker than the underlying problems take to fix the side effect of this is that current player perception of ccps lacklustre approach to new releases a good example being the vista bug that crashed the os of some client machines will take even longer to change ccp you need to be very careful that your payerbase does not get fed up no players  no cash directly we pay your wages in return for our own enjoyment when playing eve becomes more frustrating due to lag shoddy releases and badly supported functionality then the amount of enjoyment attained playing then game youve lost take a year out and fix whats there make eve work as planned and intended as opposed to how you rushed it out

definitely support this proposal
i support the subject agree with the points made in the op ccp can do better and should be the csm is a system to give hope to customers in that their voice might be heard and acted upon but seriously does anyone really think that ccp has changed development priorities to address any idea or subject when i read that you have some hope that the csm will change anything i feel bad as it will never happen unless it was something already planned to be done i give ccp credit its a good tricklook at this product from ccps point of view eve as a test bed technology for the world of darkness wod product at this point and has been for the past 3 years they hit the revenue ceiling on eve after the introduction of the gtc system the box product did nothing at retail and steam also gave it a small rise but its a hardcore product for very hardcore people and was designed that way to its core with the knowledge and experience they have gained from running eve if this is applied to wod in design and the systems they might hit the goal of 120k people online on a single server 2 mil subscriptions eve will never hit these numbers in any period of time that is relevant to them so they have to hope to grow the company with new products eves core design prevent the changes to hit these numbers so we are relegated to either to having them change the core gameplay which they will never do as the risk is too high or improving what we have already and living with the limitations of the nature of this gameall this being said they can still improve eve and should the over promise and under deliver method has become their standard practice this repetitive failure cycle will continue unless they get focused on eve again my fear or expectation is that they keep eve on life support tossing us bones using us as paying testers for technology dedicated for wod and then dump eve once wod ships

i agree while i dont think all things are as bad as some people do there is a lot to be desired with improving some older systems that need looked at and the newer stuff that has been coming out has definitely not been without issuesgranted there will always be something wrong with a new development but a lot of it does feel a bit like unpolished steel sure in the sun it sparkles but you look at it from any realistic angle and its pretty not shiny

i can remember the joy i felt when the first rumblings of this game started to pop up on the internet it gave me the hope of finally being able to play an elite style game as a mmo to some extent that has dream has been fulfilled although i am still waiting to be able to fly across the landscape of a planet i have been attached to this game since beta and still love the concept of eve however it seems to me that quality has fallen to the way side in favor of a fast development schedule over the last couple of years dont get me wrong i like having significant updates every 6 months however i have to agree with the majority herethere must be some form of development in the direction of the older content i just dont think that it will be possible without some increase in development personnel specifically allocated to this endeavor between the development of other projects and the upcoming dust release there simply is not time for anything else their plate is full my friendswhat ccp must ask themselves is do we love eve if the answer is yes then they need to gather up the team and really attempt to identify the most nagging issues with their beloved game they should make a true effort to illicit the feedback of the community on those specific topics and then tackle the problems most important to them as the loving creators and us the loving players and call it a release i dont know about anyone else but i would be more than happy with a once a year major release followed a minor release that contains at least a few significant fixes to older content i know that new releases drive new subscriptions and even sometimes pull old players back to the game i know its a money thing everyone wants to make money its an acceptable endeavor however just as the original post suggests is it worth being less than excellent is it worth being less than your potential in the beginning there was this small and obscure game developer named ccp they were mavericks armed with the dream of creating something unique that broke the mold of what a mmo can be i want to believe those mavericks still exist i want to believe that dream is still alive i want to believe that this little game that was considered by many to be far to ambitious to succeed is still loved by its creators we the eve community love this game we the eve community prove our love everyday with our incessant whining if we didnt care so much we would simply move on to another game but we dont we continue to come back day after day to experience something that cant be found anywhere else we do so with the hope that this game out of the many will live up to its potential and that it will continue to be what other games strive to become so please ccp show us what youve got

give me a client update once every couple weeks where two or three of the most currently annoying bugs are fixed make it a regular process then id be happy fixing bugs doesnt have to wait for expansions or other contrived anniversary dates if its a huge architectural change sure waiting for an expansion may be the best course of action but if its just fixing up the ui or patching some serverside logic make it happen dont make us wait
im so glad this proposal is getting that much support by the player base in the past 7 years eve has grown to be a beast with a billion heads and the more it expands the harder and more time consuming it becomes to keep it at baywhen you grow youre inevitably facing issues such as scalability small bugs that really love to hide in dark corners and of course the users cause as a rule no matter how well you build something there will be one user who will do something excruciatingly stupid and break itas such ccp can be proactive into creating excellence up to a certain degree i hope nobody is having illusions that such a massive product will be excellent on day 0 when it is unleashed to the pesticide holding horde of the player base bugs will come out of their nests i think ccps focus should be switched into retroactively pushing things into excellence based hugely on user feedback on a steady and frequent basissince were heavy into latin words for expansions lately how about the next expansion name being restituo pro excellentia as such i fully support this notionps i am very content that during this csm we had a record setting vote turnout it so seems that more and more people feel the need to voice their concerns to ccp i just hope that the csm will grow to be a force to be reckoned

support the general ideasuggest modifying the rather subjective term excelence to more concrete terms of reporting what  of the budget and what  of actual code is dedicated to fixing enhancing existing features versus adding new contentif ccp claims there is a 5050 split on this it should be easy for them to report on if the 5050 split is a reality and i doubt it is they likely roll in maintenance costs into the exisiting content halfthen ccp can get a marketing boost by showing they have some direct accountability to the player base

i support this as a new player less than 4 months old ive had to invest a significant proportion of that time learning how to learnif the statistics are true that the average time people spend in game is 6 months then i can genuinely see why do i expect to be on a level playing field with somebody 1 year old 2 years old etc no of course not would it make me more likely to try lowsec and combat if the month spent training learning skills had been invested in sheilds or armour or guns or missiles absolutelyccp  fix this now please
dont like them dont train them stop being so obsessed with other characters skillpoints for the one millionth time doing any given activity or flying any given ship you are only using a relatively small subset of sp any and all sp not related to that activity is wholly irrelevant why does it grate on you that one player gets there in 30 days when it took you 32 players are measured on their knowledge of game mechanics and their ability to put them to use you do not need n sp in x amount of time to do this there is no trophy for reaching a specific number in the least amount of time a player with faster training times might acquire the ability to perform one mini profession or related group of level v skills in a year in any case high learning skills take progressively longer to pay off since you could have been training a direct game related skill during that time somebody somewhere made a chart covering this which i cant be arsed to find
it has nothing to do with comparing other players it has to do with being able to acheive your own train goals faster you should consider that this is also part of the games mechanics unfortunately as such training well is also important to a lot of peoplethe trophy is that a person can get into what they want that much sooner and fly it well that much sooner not everyone wants to fly frigs for the rest of eve it has nothing at all to do with characters comparing sp sizes
6 paqesi wonder who it was that saw the complaints before the patch and decided they knew better then the users
supported
why did ccp remove it
this gets my vote as well
i will sum up my thoughts on the new improvements with a common catchall wordpathetic
absolute fail now please listen to your playerbase and fix this
stupid move
1but i also like parts of the new systembut bring back folders 
yes please
good suggestions
too obvious
definitely i always wondered why ctrlclick on broadcast was not included
supported
yes please
signed
signedid go a few steps further and allow pilots to split off different broadcast types into different broadcast windows if they so wished and in any combination they wished thus logistic pilots could split off broadcasts for repairscapacitor into a separate window and maybe include warpto broadcaststhe look would be similar to the combat log but as the broadcast types are split a new window is created which could be stacked much like chat windows and would have the blink function available
absolutelyi always find myself ctrlclicking on the broadcasts even though ive learned it doesnt work a thousand timesshould be in the game already and i hope it will be soon
ctrlclick would be very nice
yes please
this stinks of one of those unfinished features of eve that need to be fixed
when i found out about broadcasts i thought targeting from there was the entire idea in the first place

no brainer i have no knowledge about the data flow serverclient but im guessing that the link info is already being shared on the grid to other clients just not being visible on the fleet window so no extra lag would be introduced then again i could be horribly horribly wrong
the jump clone timer is now 24 hours which means that if a player wants to do both his pvp stuff in one part of the galaxy and then some light mining or something later on he effectively destroys the next day in effect this means you cannot clonejump because you will miss the fleets the next day and so you log off instead i dont see any reason why the timer has to be so long 24 hours would be sufficient to cover any pvpabusable aspects of clonejumping even 12 hours would be enough you could do two things every daythank you for your timewenoc
in the massively multiplayer online role playing game known as eve online there are things called spaceships which you can use to fly through space in order to move between two distant points i hope this was informative
i think 24 hours is too much lets people easily escape gatestation camps and bring reinforcement ship from behind 12 hour is what i would like to have
not supported just as the last 100timesif you want to get from a to b before the timer either fly over or pod express
id support 12 hours happily
eve is small enough without making crosscluster travel even easier than it already is
leave it as is or tbh id rather it be extended to 48hrs
this words it better than i could but i did have this in mind from an rp standpoint it only makes sense that if there are hundreds of missions being run for an agent per day the quality and payout of those missions will be lowerfrom a gameplay standpoint the main problem this solves is how easy and riskfree mission running is instead of just going to dodixie or mostu or mission hub theyll actually have to look for the highestquality agent of the dayweek or they might even decide that its worth it to grind for aliastra or some other obscure corp rather than sticking with fed navy lowsec agents getting a boost and some incentive to run missions next to lowsec are just pleasant side effects
the dynamic quality increase would i think make it more attractive for small gangs a mix of pvp and pve ships would have incentive to run a lowsec missionthe pvp pilots it might be assumed could be more experienced and better skilled while the pve pilots are less skilled in pvp but adequate to the task for the missionas a gang the pve pilots can have time to learn how things work in low sec without the expectation real or imagined that they will immediately lose ships and possibly wind up in the clone tankwith higher rewards to the gang the incentive is there for the veterans in a corp to teach practical skills to newer or more cautious pilotsi fly with pilots who have patiently taught me the basics of surviving and profiting from living in a wh as long as the costbenefit of low sec is so awful shrug to hell with low seca good step in the right directionsupported
half supportedalways been a great fan of dynamic agent quality although iirc ccp said they wont do it however with one but no or only limitted dynamic quality in low sec and 00 imo there is no need to lower quality of the few semi mission hubs outside high sec when they are popular the pirates will take care of that already so either fixed quality or only swing in quality between 0 and 20 for example and then also get rid of all the q20 agents in low sec
i agree with you that low quality agents shouldnt exist in lowsec but i think it would be simpler from a game design standpoint to just have all agents behave in the same way regarding qualityi think a better way to achieve what youre looking for is to 1 change the agents quality by 1 or 1 on any given cycle where a cycle can be anywhere from a day to a week thus if it were every day taking a lowsec agent from 20 to 0 would take heavy usage for 3 weeks straight which would no doubt attract a lot of attentioni feel that changes happening slowly is an important part of the system if an agent was 15 one day and 15 the next it would become very frustrating to run missions2 the threshold required to bring an agents quality up or down isnt one single number its based on the current quality so the threshold for a q20 agent might be 15 missions per day but for q15 it might be 60 missions per day for 0 it might be in the 200300 range i really dont know what kind of numbers the main mission hub agents pull in terms of missions per day so ill leave the exact numbers up to the experts but again under my proposed system it would require people running 200 missions a day for 3 weeks straight that just wont happen in lowsec so your fears of a negatve quality lowsec agent will never occur
this change would just cause people to move in high sec a bit more talking about lp is pointless because the popular corps are already in that department the more people run missions for a corp the more abundant the items in their lp store will become and the prices will drop switching from one corp to another isnt a problem because no standings grinding is required thanks to faction standings even if someone didnt have the standings yet they could just do the cosmos missionspeople still wont move to lowsec because the risk simply isnt worth the risk at least not if you want to use the same fit as in high sec youre asking for soft targets to move to lowsec but that simply wont happen if people want isk theyll go to highsec nullsec or wormholes compared to those areas lowsec is just risk without isk if you want people to move to lowsec youll have to give them something unique something they cant get anywhere else in its current this is just a nerf l4 missions thread that has pretty much nothing to do with lowsec
i like the idea of agent quality being market driven but i dont think it would in anyway encourage more players to lowsec systemsl4 profits are driven by ship bounties rather than mission rewards
not sure how often you go to lowsec but only the border systems result in the instant death that you seem to fear will come about the same absence of people that makes 00 mission running relatively safe makes many deep lowsec areas relatively safe so the further out you go the less risk there really isthis may be true but the obvious answer is to make the quality affect bounties as well quality 0 missions will have rats with the current base bounties and each increment updown in quality will addsubreact something like 15 from the bounty a 1m isk battleship would become a 700k isk battleship at q20 and a 13m isk battleship at q20
i dont think this goes far enough but its a step in the right direction perhaps if bounties were reduced and agent rewards were increased this would have more impact
i like it
supported would help spread people out not just agent wise but also empire wise ie no more 34 of playerbase running caldari missions
sounds sensible
i like it i dont think it would do jack  to the population in low sec but its still a good idea
oh u mean these rules the selected item will be insured while in your possession for the duration of the contract repackaging the item will void the contract the contract will be considered void if the item or ship is destroyed while being in the possession of somebody else do you accept the above terms and still want to insure the selected itemin case u havent figured it out yet its basically an incentive to use and lose your ship for whatever purpose u deem fit what part of that do u not understand oh and if u wanted it to be like wow ud be asking for separate blue zones that r 100 safe to operate in just like in wowoh wait ure pretty much doing that cause why else would u completely ignore the clearly written rule that cannot ever be turned off so it pops up every time u insure well other than u wanting to stay safe and sound with wow in space that is
itt people just not getting the basic principle that its not wrong to suicide gank its not an exploit its not cheating its not griefing its legitimate supported play with no particular reason to discourage it any more than piracy missioning fleet fights ratting scouting or any of the other ways of losing a ship that no rl insurance company would ever dream of paying out foras the poster above has correctly stated eve insurance is nothing more than a partial ship replacement mechanism designed to encourage people to go and and fight with them  in ways criminal foolish or just plain mad the only thing eve insurance has in common with real world insurance is the name given that and given that suicide ganking is a supported play there is no reason whatsoever to remove it from suicide gankers any more than there is a reason to remove it from someone who engages versus 101 oddstldr stop getting hung up on the word insurance its an analogy at best for the way that pend work ops proposal is not supported
there is plenty of reason to remove insurance from ships that suicide gankthis may blow some peoples minds but truthfully there is little to no risk for suicide gankingthe loss of sec status can be npcd back within a few hours if you know what you are doingthe small loss of isk can easily be regained after a couple of hours of npcing and thats if you really care since if you are suciding ganking something likely you have made this isk in your kills loot many times overand you know you can do these both at the same timewhat i feel is necessary is for there to be a true balance between riskreward throughout eve there is no reason why you get your insurance isk back after you have just been killed by concord
i disagree i dont think thats going far enoughi think that concord should send you a mail after you get ganked asking how much you want the ganker to pay you you put in a number and it removes isk from their wallet and into yoursif there isnt enough it sells off their assets to the highest sell order available until it reaches that numberif its still not high enough it makes a post in the character bizarre to see if anyone wants to buy the characterif thats still not enough they send the police to round the person up in real life and take him to small claims courtmaybe then this game will finally be safe for idiots like me to afk with 6 bil in my t1 cargo
fully support insurance not paying when you get concorded and i say that as someone whos corpmates suicide gank fairly often it just feels too easy at the moment the other emo whining in here though makes me want to not support it just because i dont want to feel like i have anything in common with these people
supportedenhance this with a standing loss for using cargo or ship scanners in highsec thanx
the riskreward argument is based on the totally fallacious idea that people deserve to be safe while being careless in hisec the only thing that they have a right to expect is that unprovoked aggression will  eventually  cost the aggressor his ship nothing more ccp have reaffirmed this over and over againif people choose to move valuables in poorly tanked afk ships then of course its going to be easy to gank them thats no reason to whine to ccp to punish those who take advantage of their carelessness its not up to ccp to decrease rewards vs those who play poorly
ehhnot supported hesitant to fall into the rl trap concorded folks already take a sec hit and the new insurance model will most likely inflict more pain on the suicidal types if you want safe stay docked
againstfreedom requires responsibilitytoo much control is not freedomif you fly the route frequently make somebookmarks real close to the stationsgatesand warp to zero
dont you just love the pirating curs version of riskreward  your risk and their reward delilah
lol the way it is now there is no high security i guess none of you remember when ccp placed the tax on npc corps they said it was to make eve more like real life and the enticement to join or create a player corp was that it could be tax freewe all live in areas that have a high low and no null securityso to make eve more like real life eve  country state city etchigh security  financial industrial etclow security  commercial residential etcnull security  rural undeveloped etcin high security areamust have positive security status not allowed to carryhave weapons immediate response by authorities for crime committedin low security areamust have either high or low security statuscan carryhave weaponsslow response by authorities for crime committedin null security areacan have either high low or bad security statusencouraged to carryhave weaponsno response by authorities for crime committedhaving said all of that and if ccp is trying to use real life as excuse for making changes well lets go all the way with iti endorse this 100
allthough i dont agree with insurance payouts on ppl who have been concorded i do want it to be viable to suicide gank in hiseci want to see how the way the new insurance works out over the next few months before i give this my support or not
lets face it eve insurance is not a real business model the insurance companies would all go bankrupt whether we count ships blown up by concord or not if you want to play the real life card ask yourself this what are the chances you will get insurance if you were to tell your agent that you are going to attach guns and missile launchers to your car and drive around with a bunch of other likeminded people as we all shoot at eachother mkay insurance in eve is still a good thing because it supports one of the funnest activities the game offers  pvppersonally i think high sec is already too safe traders need some risk
in after the me me me brigade sounding off seriously do you guys realise how ridiculous you sound im not making as many isks now as i was and i might have to go into mean nasty horribad lowsecs therefore this change should be rolled backhas it occurred to you selfish whiners that your mission running has effects on the wider game beyond your own wallet that while it may have nerfed your highsec level 5s and your cynical use of high quality l4 agents in 05 systems on lowsec borders the broader impact on the riskreward calculus is obviously more in line with how ccp see missions should be balancedeither move further into highsec and take a quality hit or deal with the fact that youve been struck by a nerf bat the selfrighteous forum whining is pathetic
thanks ankhummpmkahsomething 1
not supported in its current form ank predominion the ratio was about right between highsec agents sending players to lowsec allowing them to decline missions if they felt like it or taking the mission and the risk since dominion the ratios have been broken in dominion a really low amount of missions where in lowsec now in taranis ccp over compensated
im not really sure there was such a great need to introducechange loadbalancing to send people to the neighboring system with only 5 people in instead of the current system with 10 peoplealthough i must admit i havent run a mission in one of the big hubs for quite some timeoverall i find this proposal lacking of a specific solution or the presented solution is just not detailed enoughwill highsec agents still prefer the system 4 jumps away just because there is 1 pilot less in itlowsec agents sending you to their system most of the time will create minihubs in lowsec very predictable

supported tho im having a dejavu with the proposal
this issue has already been proposed to csm
assembly hall  proposal make ongrid bookmarks visible in space
remove all low sec offers from high sec agentsare ccp crazy do they expect high sec mission runners to accept a courier mission to low sec for 185k isk yeah right do they expect me to lose my ship and cargo which cant be bought from the market and my pod which could cost hundreds of millions for 185k iskno chancethere is no reason to expect a high sec mission runner to travel to low security space at all there is no way i am going to do thati understand the mission loot table changes which are tolerated even though they are not welcome but seriously low sec missions for 185k isk this isnt rightthey must go
decline the mission
decline it for crying out loud why do you feel its owed to you to run safe and easy missions nonstop from one agent if you absolutely desire to never go into lowsec get yourself a group of agents close together it might take a little bit of lower level missioning to get the standings you can then decline to your hearts content its likely youll not have to decline a second time within the time window if youve got 3 agents or so besides doing 2 declines doesnt result in that big of a standing loss if youve already got a 7 with the agent you can decline a bunch of missionswhat this is your feeling not reasoning lowsec is still empire and the relevant corp has stations and interests there wouldnt they trust their cando pod pilot whos taken on half of mordus legion by himself to take care of such missionsthen dont problem solvedit does seem a bit off that security isnt factored into the payout including going down in higher security but once againnobody is forcing you to go there
heres a better idea make lowsec agents stop giving out high sec missions really annoying me as when i ask for it in lowsec quite obviously i want it to be in lowsec or add moredistribute better lvl 4 and lvl 5 agentsafterall why should i get high sec missions i have no chance of doing due to concordfaction navy
actually that would be perfectly in keeping with what they did to l5 missions after all you do get the better rewards for accepting a mission from a low sec agent why should you get that extra reward while still enjoying concord protection
declining the mission for me is the only option i am a high sec mission runner and have been for some years now at no point would i ever accept a mission in low sec it wouldnt be so bad if the reward for taking a hauler to low sec was greater but seriously 185k isk no chance in a million years 185 million isk perhaps but yeah as if thats going to happen
well it does make sense high sec missions should be in high sec right no one is going to low sec if there doing missions in high sec especially since there is a lot of added risk and no increased rewards sure you can decline them but whats the point of giving them out in the first place if noone is going to do them
and yet the bitter old veterans still dont want people to have more sp even though now the testimonial is that it makes you no betterits really weird so many people against it and not a single one of them has a credible reason as to why they either dont know why they dont want it or dont want to say why they dont want itand that is good enough reason to want it
there is a massive difference between wanting to keep the n00bs underfoot and not wanting this game to turn to a ty pay for advancement model that so so many other mmos are headed toward at the moment dust514 sadly included last i checkedreal money should never enter into the equation for online gaming with the sole exception of your monthly subscription the fact that plex exists supremely ed me off for the longest time but i can understand how its a necessary evil for the sake of eves economythis suggestion takes eve down a path of mediocrity where the reallife rich will always be advancing faster than the little guy even if you exclude the top 10 of the eve populationnot supported
ill tell you exactly why i dont want it in no uncertain termsready it should be based on your in game decisions such as when to remap what skills to train which implants to fly with what learning skills to train when etcunfortunately however i think weve reached the point where well just have to agree to disagree
so basically despite introducing remapping ccp now have the exact correct rate of sp game to keep every bitter old veteran happy interestingi think it was very clever of them to find the exact correct rate of sp gain to please everybodyplease come up with some more plausible one size fits all pull the other one something fishy going on hereto access more sp more quickly why do i have to buy a character from a player from one of ccps customers instead of ccpyour answer doesnt address the existence of the character bazaar thank you and goodnight 1 to me 0 to youthe foamer above you he too invented a fictious answer that forgets how much the character bazaar does the exact same thingwhen inventing answers at least try to cover all the basesits so strange they just cant answer it cannot will not which is itwhy cant they answer such a simple question if they feel so strongly about it why can my character that i wanted not be better with rl cash or isk why does it have to be that i give isk to a veteran who gave rl cash to a character and why do i have to carry their characters baggage around with mesuch a simple question so simple even a bitter old veteran cant answer it
gavjack you were a terrible can flipper and youre an even worse debater this idea sucks for many reasons most of which have been laid out time and time again this idea goes against the whole spirit of eve and would result in the game being half full of max sp players with the other half being made up of the poor new folk who cant afford to buy the plexs you also make it so the older players just get all skills very quickly and have nothing else to train for way to kill the end game pif getting in a titan or carrier was as simple as having a big credit card balance then eve would have no more interest for many of us why exactly should you ever catch up with someone whos invested 7 years into this gameoh and before you say it no im not a bitter veteran player ive got a whole 205m sp and i still know this idea sucks
im an awesome can flipper youre just speaking on matters you dont know aboutahh just to be clear none of them have been pointed out not even onceas i keep explaining the things people are typing into their keyboards and calling reasons arent reasons against 4sp they are reasons for something not sure what though doesnt matter whatagain look what you have done the same error all those who came before you made you forgot about the character bazaar the character bazaar is where these mythical super rich players you like to pretend exist could buy their characters today if they were going to but yet its not happening is it hmmmm would you like to address that point or foam some morewrong again skills are exponential and into the year long scales the excesses of infiniteisk bitter old veterans farting out titans at a rate of 1 a week are massively removed from the affairs of a month old pottering around hisec in hac so yes your bitter old veteran will be infinite isk skilling his latest titan pilot at a huge rate only 3 months instead of a year but so will all the people hes up against oh look no problemsit already is see character bazaar dear oh dear you cant get your head round the character bazaar can youand therefore you loss of interest point loses credence tooequally why shouldnt i catch up with somebody who has invested 7 years into this game if we use your pro argumentative stance i hereby invent the assertion that not letting people catch up makes us lose interest in eve but we dont want to use your pro argumentative stance because we know its riddled with errorsif its just a simple case of protecting ones status as a senior resident of this street and we like things exactly the way they are thank you very much and making sure it is in fact you that remains at the top of the tree by virtue of being here seven years earlier why can they not just admit its all about the vanity why these continuing charades i guess were never going to knowno you dont youre just agreeing with those who like to appear to weild the authority of age you dont know why youre agreeing as you just amply demonstrated however if you do happen to know a reason why im allowed to use my awesome powers of rl cash to advance to end game status by buying a character off the bazaar from a bitter old veteran instead of buying it from ccp feel free to say so youd be the first
no no you really arentthats because youre presuming that the idea in your head is correct and as such you dont need to listen to the overwhelming majority who think youre completely wrongtwo points here 1 the character bazaar doesnt increase the number of high sp characters in the game it just spreads them around 2 pretty much all mmos have serious issues with people selling off characters in breach of the eula the character bazaar is actually quite an elegant way of accepting the inevitability of character selling but placing it within a game based financial setting if people want to spend real  to buy plex to buy characters that real money is going direct to ccp not to some guy via ebay so what have you actually just achieved you havnt narrowed the gap between old players and new players youve just made a massive amount of the games content available to players much earlier meaning people dont need to work towards anything or learn anything they just get all the shiny toys really quickly because from a game design pov players expect to be rewarded for the time and energy they invest in a game if you take that away then you take away a lot of the draw of the game eve is pretty rare in that players cant just grind and catch up in a month if you hate it so much gb2wow actually as a professional game designer i know very well why i agree with them and disagree with you i have to deal daily with people who think their ideas are omfg awesomez and which actually suck ive laid out several of the reasons above and many others have done the same take a minute and actually think about them and then think about the long term consequences for eve it isnt pretty
evaluation shouldnt be done by the concerned subject but by independent observersdude get it in your headspcharacter supply is finite plexisk supply is finite spcharacterprice is directly corelated to the plexprice thus there are limitsmicrotransaction spboost is by default infinte and inflates the amount of sp in circulation hence devaluating the plexes and isks by a great amountccp can not be interested in that happening especially not since it already happened once and to this day they still call it a failure learning skills
minmaxing isnt what skills are for they are just arbitrary barriers andor goals for their respective activities there is no trophy for efficiency your involvement comes from doing things you dont need zillions of sp to do thingswhy do you think you have to catch up in any given ship or performing any given activity you are only using a relatively small set of sp any other sp you have not related to the shipactivity is irrelevant older players are more versatile and why shouldnt they bethis isnt a korean game or wow you are not intended to max out in a short time once again you dont need to there are a massive amount of activities and ships you can use with low sp and you can reach them quickly if you discipline yourself and not go 10 directions at once youre caught in the catch up trap again this isnt wow where levels are a direct expression of a characters ability you already get boosted training and a free remap as a new player you are supposed to use this time to learn some of the game mechanics make some friends to learn from set a few goals and head that way failing to do so is your faultthis was the time you were supposed to spend learning and making plans if you spent it doing only the base things you learned in the tutorial instead this is your problemexactly you already have boosted training and a free remap nobody had this option before apocrypha once again sp and skill difference are irrelevant in any given activity a relatively small subset of skillssp are being used the 512k sp i have in caldari frigate are completely identical to every other players 512k the 512k i might have in gallente frigate has no effect on my or your ability to fly a caldari frigate stop measuring your abilities and progress by other playershardcore players already understand that what you do and knowledge of game mechanics that make the difference it has little to do if at all with spthis was precisely the complaint that led to the skill queuethe snobs will still be snobs it took them years to go over 100m using plexes to catch up will cost you far more than using plexes to buy a character

as i said weve reached the point where we simply have to agree that we have different views on the subject at hand and leave it to ccp to make the call they feel suits the betterment of the game itself
did you vote in the csm electionsalso you could have used any of the following as valid reasons to not do it2xplex does not equal 2xcharacter sp due to the training of attribute boosting skills its not a big discrepancy but at low sp it is a huge percentage errorallowing people to use isk illegaly generated in game converted into illegally gained skill points becomes problematic when transfered to 3rd parties and can be used to launder iskjealousy that somebody might have something i wasnt allowedthere are many others feel free to use those three next time you need to say something sensible instead of merrrr merrrr merrrr nooooooooooooooo what he said

quoting these people cause it looks very fun doing sodude get in your headif you are paying for sp with plex then spcharacter price is still directly corelated to the plex price at the same rate it does today every plex spent to doubling someones training speed is a plex not spent on extending someone elses play time or in an another word stop training for that month thus spcharacter remains constanttaking character bazaar into accountinstead of buying a character thats plexfed for 2 years and have a 2y character right now i can double training and get one myself one year later the net result is that overall sp growth is slower isnt that what ccp want exactly like how you tried to showi suggest you to read this overmost human players engage in more then one activity why do you think older players have the right to be more versatile isnt that because they have paid more money to ccp then i did sure here is my money let me be versatile as wellis it not ccps intention that i can instantly have a dozen titans a cult work shipping me and the ability to buy regions if im a russian billionairedoes not mean i cannot you opinion is irrelevant to my rightlv1 warrior vs lv70 warlock impairor vs avatar you were saying thanks for the advices stupid mcstupidsondo not selectively quote what i wrote and twist it out of contextits not get a clue ccp wants you to log in and maybe play from time to time to many switching skill is the only reason to do sowhen everyone have 100m sp you dont call them snobs wannabe is the word more importantly it now cost about as much money to buy a character from bazaar as it is to raise it from plex if not more especially for older characters do get your fact straight

ohhh look got a lot of modules munitions ores alloyscompounds etc hmmmmm searched through everything and found a few meta level 4 modules keep those stashed in the cargohold lets see rclick on one of the bulk items select reprocess and there they all are listed in the reprocess screen cool time to go to workclickclickclickclickclickclickyawnclickclickclickzzzzzzzzsnortwha oh yeahclickclickclickclickyawnclickclickclickclickok get quote reprocess and doneuntil next time and that was a small level 4 mission how many times do you sit there left clicking each and every single item listed in the reprocess screen i know i do it a lothow many times do you wish there was an option to select all items listed in the reprocess screen i know i do every timehow many times do you rclick each item to show info just to check the meta level before you even start to reprocess i know i do almost all the timethis has probably been brought up before and after checking back 10 pages i didnt see anything about this maybe i need glasses now due to all the constant clicking and show info and reprocess after quotewhat i propose is to have the option select all items added to the reprocess screen along with that a filter to pick out certain typesgroups of items not to be reprocessed and last but not least a filter to reprocess items up to a certain meta level all filters to be set manually feel free to voice your opinions and lets make this a realitythank you all for not falling asleep on the job
yeah it def needs to be removed quick fix while scanning  when i send the probes below the plane i just flip the camera view so that the bottom of the probes are showing and the shadow is now below them still though seems most signatures are placed above the plane so players do tend to get in the habit of rotating the view to show the top100 endorsed
problem currently there are 2 major factions you have to be part of to hold space in eve the sc or nc if a corp or alliance wants to move into 00 the only way it can possibly do this is to blue nc or sc this effect has a compound effect the more people join the nc or sc the more the stagnate the problem becomes you see now alliances like aaa and atlas with monstrous size of pets in aaa citzens and etc basically all new corps alliance just join there because it is the only route you can take without being crushed by them like look at providencecva they made a play for space to spice up the game and got crushed leaving the only 2 major factions sc and nc believe it or not aaa actually blobbed them with huge odds out of their spaceit used to be hard to move into 00 for a corp from empire now they just take the easy route and join up aaa citizens and its like empire version 20 with blues everywhere and it compounds into mega blobssolutionincentives to make 00 politics to be more fractured1 remove jump bridges2 add much more space in between regions to make unique hubs again not stations everywhere then increase station prices to 500bil or just do this3 make player stations destructable there are too many of these in the game one or just remove stations and make them cost 500 bil to build in 00 where everyone can dock it does not stagnate the game because you cant just be locked out by a superior blob out of the regionmost of these solutions are pretty bad but the game gets pretty boring with just 2 huge factions dominating everything and all of the problems stem from pets you got aaa with aaa citzens atlas with a load of pets it not as much anymore they are more allies i geuss i dont see a problem with allies as they made it on their own the problem is when new people to 00 only have the option of joining the nc or sc and i dont know much about nc but it is probably the same or do they only have allies over petsankh please fix i put my faith into you 333dont let me down

it never occurred to you to try a magnification tool checking your eyesight or getting a bigger screen and running it at a lower res above 800x600 then there is something quite wrong with you with all due respectwhose fooling who here
definitely agreed that the accessibility problems should be fixed however this proposal is not a solutioni sometimes run the game on my 1024x600 netbook its not a supported resolution but it generally works though windows occasionally disappear off the bottom of the screen i think i found a display setting somewhere  turning off grid snapping or something  that helped
i dont know im kinda stuck here in the middle granted its always been buyer beware but stilli do think there probably should be a cap both high and low on the prices of items guess nobody has ever heard of a price freezeit happens quite a bit in real life here in the usa like when gas prices get too high good ole uncle sam government steps in and freezes it he does the same with insurance rates interest fees charged on loans rental rates etc heh if i sit here long enough with help from google im sure i could find a lot more examplesguess that could be on account that uncle sam government doesnt want the countrys infrastructure collapsing or its citizens rioting course he has it taxed and if the price does get too high nobody is going to buy it and then he wont get his taxok guess i kinda went overboard with it a little i actually thought this was going to be about the contract scams you know super high prices billions placed on items advertised as tech 2 when actually its tech 1 not sure about the rest of the world but here in the usa uncle sam government considers that fraud and always goes after the person doing it now the price of real contracts legal can be whatever both partys agree to ok time for me to look at what i wrote and how it pertains to eve and this threada contract is private and can have any agreed set price but shall be legal no fraud or false advertisinga market is public with government regulated price cap both high and low to insure a stable economy for society hmmmm im probably mistakenly crazy but ill have to agree with the original poster and endorse this thread
i tend to agree a game is less fun if you have to constantly be staring at multiple zeros trying to decide if you are paying 10 million 10 thousand or 10 billion its not a very fun part of the game  at least for me i havent gotten burned but its still a hassle perhaps they could have an option to show costs in a milisk or something 1milisk  1000isk they could be listed as 1m or 1i for short

thisits like a  you guys option for idiots who are dying to a small gang or something and on the other hand people who get either hotdroppedblobbed with overwhelming force or are in a real fight dont have any options which is idiotic and encourages people to blob moreat least if it costed the carrier pilot something like no insurance payout then it would make a bit of sense
i broke even with my chimera found another one on sale for 625 on contracts 5 jumps from rens and 1 cyno to our normal staging area had everything refitted in under an hour with the help of my alts carrying mods in their badgers i make great fun of anyone in my alliance that an heros in a capital when they know they are going to lose it they got you fair and square take the beating and live with it instead of pretending it didnt happen and your still a hot hand in your thanatosand maybe make sd not work at all when you are triage or siege i bet more then one person has went not going to make it not going to make it oh yeah triage shields fill enough to give you the boost to live
i say get rid of self destructing all together maybe only usable in a pod in wormholes or make the timer on it much much longer on all ships its stupid who would puts a self destruct feature on a ship anyways the only thing people really use it for is to collect insurance
ccp isnt going to add content because of 3 ppl
maybe there would be more than three if there was better content
split the space between guristas and angels and spread rogue drones through the whole eve cluster should make the drone regions more attractive to everyone and drone alloys mineral sources would be more evenly spread through the eve cluster
this guy has a pretty decent ideaspread drone spawns out everywhere so you never know what you might stumble across in the next belt increase incidence of command level drones esp the drop rate of modified drone bpcs open the drone regions up to a couple of warring pirate factions angels  sansha for example and open up factional warfare with the two factions
currently if you reprocess things you get back maybe a little bit of base minerals trit ect you dont get any of the t2 materials or other components at all i havent a clue about t3this should be corrected to show proper reprocessing you get 80 of the build materials of all components used in the construction of the item youre reprocessingso a fitted rigged t2 ship would return minerals t2 build components and salvage components tho these should return far less than 80 maybe 50 rather than complete destruction for every part that gets reprocessedof course youll get a warning popup that you cannot disable telling you that there are modulesdronesrigsammo present on the ship youre reprocessing and that they will also be reprocessed or more simply it automatically unfits the ship and dumps the items into your hangarbear in mind that supposedly years ago they reduced the available materials during reprocessing of meta0 items to be 80 of their total manufacturing materials as they were being used to compress minerals for transport these returns should be applied to t2 and any other material returns even with 100 reprocessing efficiency
this skill book isnt even seeded in game so why bother changing it

first i never posted a virus that page is old and it is a rick roll look it up moronsecond missions are working fine adapt or leavethird you make more in sanctums and havens before the patch and you make more nowstop whining in all the forums and stop getting your topics locked because you are a moron
if youve been running nothing but missions for 6 years then you really need to seek professional help im completely serious its a sign of addiction not simply enjoying a form of entertainmentignoring that issue you can still grind missions ive been grinding away at low sec lvl5s this week to pay for a plex and some shiny new pvp toys to play with ive been soloing them off and on in low sec for about a year and was doing low sec lvl4s before that its no big deal been at least 2 years since i lost a pve ship to a player
the no l5s in highsec or at least much less frequently is fine and tbh a fix they were introduced as lowsec content something to benefit people who actually dare to live in lowsec you shouldnt be entitled to do them safely not every single damn resource should be available in highsecas for l4 agents sending you to lowsec well id be fine if that didnt happen so much etc provided lowsec agents dont send anyone to highsec in return
not one person has given their support to your threadmaybe its because you dont want to post with your mainmaybe because you cannot run level 5 missions to begin withwho knowspeople wont support someone with 0 experience on the subject they are advocatinglone provider pator tech school from 20090515 1521 to this daycrappy standings too
ok not the best argument that could be used for a case like this but i agree that there are issues with some of what ccp have done to mission runners i dont agree with all of it
so you lost somo of your mission running income how about go to skillshop buy few planetary interaction related skillbooks and train that weektwo weeks tops that it takes time then you have a brandnew even easier free income to cover your losses ofcourse it would have been nice if you got that pi income on top of your former income but that new income has to be taken away from somewhere and npc loot was the only way to go if it wouldnt have been taked away from somewhere it would have made inflation so that the all new income isk you got on top of your former mission income wouldnt mean anything it would make your wallet bigger but also put prices up equallythe lvl4 missions are still too good income riskfree risk free meaning no risk involved in that particular action the lvl5 to lowsec is a good thing maybe i finally can start to do them beacause they used to send me to highsec where i can not go also the lvl5 lp income was greatly too big to be done riskfree risk free in highsecthis ing game is made to risk  reward and it was still is ed up badly you can easily run your missions in lowsec all it needs from you is eyes keep your dscan hot watch local and its riskless yes maybe you get camped now and then but hey the reward is to equal that fact but oh wait you cant afk missionrun anymore if sent to lowsec thats the problem ach true that is crap one really deserves a totally riskfree good highs isk and afk income that is true so lets all petition this fast lets really do it so that we can contigniue riskfree risk free afk high incomeugly eric
oh noes you dont get to play the game for free and still make huge sums of isk that miners and pvpers have no way to match youre definitely being hard done by introducing an element of risk to the most overpowered profession in eve about damn time
actually nevermind i threw a cheaper ship together and what the hey just did 6 lvl5s in a row and no gank im rich
so ccp achieved their goal and we can close the case
no ccp stated from the outset that l5s were not supposed to be a highsec solo iskfest they were intended to be run in gangs in lowsec and were also intended to revitalize lowseclol on the off chance you are butthurt about empire agents sending you to lowsec either do it or move on to another agent theres plenty of them on the offoffchance your other cheek is hurt because the loot nerf no drone compounds and mission loot destroyed the mining industry
lol thats not all i do but its the majority of my income as a casual gamer i want to log on blow some stuff up and log off seeing as though my eitu agent already sent me to low sec fairly often what do you think this change has done to my ability to casually run missionsits sharply declined what do you think i am going to do as a resultmove to further away from low secload balancing doesnt work when you herd people into a smaller space which is exactly what this change did i have no problem with it but i ran missions in eitu to get away from the hubs now there will just be new hubs with much higher populations and the load balancing will be counter productive in the end as a casual player its counter productive to move to low sec or null because bouncing back from losses takes a lot longer when you are only running a couple of missions two times a week the reason why the nerf is so powerful is more than just sending us to low sec that part can be avoided for the most part its added flight time from mission to mission and additional lag due to forcing the mission runner population into a smaller functioning envelope i bet a million isk ccp didnt think the idea through very well or they would have taken steps to reduce the odds of being sent to low sec knowing full well that people would just migrate further inwardi agree that 5s should not be in high sec and that people running missions in low sec should be rewarded better than me but getting the occasional mission in high sec from a low sec agent or low sec from a high sec agent was an occupational nuisance before and now its become a serious nerf for many reasonspeople are not supporting this thread because there is a csm proposed thread dealing with this problem already no need for duplicates
first proposal ever so apologies if it is a repeat as ive looked but cant find an exact copyproposalduring alliancecorp warfare if a neutral eg an alt in another nondecd corp assists during a fight eg remote repping then this person is treated as a collaborator and is automatically aggressable by the other sideexampleyesterday one of my corp mates was in a 6v4 fight had his target into structure a nonred appeared and remote repped the target my friend was popped and podded ok so thats war but he couldnt engage the repper as he wasnt red and was in highsecthere needs to be a solution to this so stop altsneutrals assisting if this were the real world and am very aware this isnt lol then the collaborator would be attacked without a second thoughtcloses eyes and covers ears ready for the flames
to clarify  i would anticipate1 player remote reps an outlaw being attacked by somebody  player gets an aggression timer making him fair game for 15 mins2 player in a neutral corp remote reps another player involved in corpalliance warfare this player has declared himherself for one side and therefore becomes a valid war target until either of a the war dec ends most severe option b a fixed time period eg standard aggression timer or maybe until the next time the war dec is renewed last being my preferred optioni would specifically not anticipate this working for1 any standard situation where you get aggression outside of the above eg you just decide to agress somebody can flipping etc
not new at all
he could have engaged the remote repair ship thoughit just wouldnt have done him any good most likely when you remote repair a neutral fighting a third party you get a 15 minute aggression timer against the third party if the third party is at war with the person you assisted then you have aggression against his corpalliance as well most of the time
then i apologise for putting in a proposal that demonstrates my inexperience with the mechanices of evealthough the possibility of say assisting a war dec resulting in you being aggressable until the war dec is renewed might make the use of alts  fake neutrals a bit more balanced
please use english when posting on the forums
problemthe session change timer is another exceedingly irritating feature in the game you dock up and wait 20 seconds leave your ship wait 20 seconds clone jump wait 20 seconds switch into your ship and then for some reason you can undock without waitingall these actions could go on the same timer undocking overrides the current session change timer and replaces it with a new one solutionhow about allowing all instation actions to be instantaneous but they would all cause a 20s internal timer that prevents you from undocking instead in effect docking up and changing ships would take the same amount of time but doing several actions after one another would just renew the timer
so i love eve wallpapers and i know you do to sadly though google just has the same 30 or so eve main site does have a wall section however it is sadly small think there could be a way that it could be player updated or even have ccp do some updating i know with at8 right around the corner there will be chances for awesome shots whats the community think

it has been a long long time since i last saw frigates being used as combat assets their usefulness has waned ever more with the continuing introduction of larger ships while all but the most advanced frigates have been relegated to shuttle and scout dutiesthis brings up the question why have frigates become this way what problems lie within the very foundation of the ship class itself and what can we do to fix itits not just assault frigates rocketbased frigates or any other subclass that have these issues all frigates are affected and though some may work around the base problems with the class with mwds and cloaks the rest have to suffer from these issues and are left unattended and unusedso what are these issues you may askthe first most glaring problem is short range weapons and closing distance frigates have extremely short range weapons that while excellent for their size force them to come into very close range of larger ships once in range they can perform their roles correctly but getting into that range is a gauntlet in and of itselfyou would think that frigates would need to worry about enemy destroyers or antifrigate platforms would cause the most issue but then you would be wrong while closing the range gap frigates are left completely exposed to the highcaliber weapons of larger vesselsfrigates due to their small size and relatively highspeed have the ability to avoid the fire of these guns but only once they enter their own short attack range while some frigates can utilize microwarpdrives to close the range faster leaving them exposed for far less time and others can use cloaking devices to get them in close most frigates do not have these abilities the problem isnt one with the frigate design however and retrofitting most frigates to use these countermeasures usually leaves them unable to perform thier intended roleseven if frigates do manage to pass the barrage of highcaliber weapons fire and get within attack range they will learn that their problems have just begun enemy ships have a vast array of weapons systems and devices that can leave the frigate harmless at best or leave the frigate a heap of scrap with the pilot scurrying to safety in their escape capsuleenergy neutralizers can easily and absolutely shut down a frigate leaving the ship without power this means that the frigate may not be able to tank or have the use of thier weapons systems leaving them useless without damage or offensive systems and vulnerable with thier small base hp and no tankenergy neutralizers are not the only close in countermeasure larger ships have to use against frigates frigates can also encounter stasis webifiers which will slow the ship to a crawl giving largecaliber guns ample time to aim fire and in most cases instapop the aggressing frigatea smartbomb may also be employed to dispatch frigates the smartbomb usually covers the closein area a frigate needs to perform his role correctly avoiding the smartbomb in many cases will force the frigate out farther from his potential target again exposing him to the fire of the targets largecaliber gunsanother common countermeasure against frigates is the use of light drones these drones can usually outmaneuver frigates and even avoid fire or tank a frigates weapons frigates can try to counter these and shoot them down but they will find that the drones can leave just as fast as they came coming and going from the safety of the parent vessel and even if a frigate can manage to get ahold of one long enough to shoot and kill it few can withstand the damage from the drones and are forced to flee or die nonetheless

the problem with frigates is that when piloting one i am unable to change any of the font sizes of any of my ui elements
this statement is completely wrong so its not worth to keep reading this i dont know which game youre playing but its not eve you dont know what youre talking about
im not seeing any supporting evidence from you as to how he is wrong perhaps you can offer some actual counter arguments instead of just saying youre doing it wrong
i think you are looking at the wrong bits of the gameyes if you come flying to a pos bashing cta in a frigate you will be told to gtfo and get a real shipbut in small gangs frigates are still alive and kicking this varies between two opposites the regular rifterwithscramandmwd who are charging in holding tackle for a second and then exploding in a ball of fire this is fine as they are quite cheap enough for nobody minding the fact that they die fast on the other end you have ships like ishkur and wolf they do insane dps for a smallgun based vessel at least and have enough staying power to hold out agains that barrage of high calliber fireso i think its not that something is wrong with frigates i just thing you really need to atch how you use them if they are used correctly they are great if they are not you die in a very expensive ball of flames
frigates have more than enough uses and then i dont mean the t2 varietiesi will list a few just to give a rough idea pvp trainingship be it in corp or just head out to low sec expendable scoutship in whs expendable scoutship in low  null sec in a descent group they can form quit a challenging pack for any cruiser or even a bswhy do i put expendable in 2 instances simple you dont have to have mad skills to be able to assist just be ready to do your role even if it means dying
imo the only thing wrong with frigates is that it is time to remove the tiers and boost all frigates to the level of the tier 3 versions rifter etcaddressing your specific issues if you charge directly at a battleship then yes you will have no traversal and die horribly to their guns this is why good frigate pilots use their speed advantage to spiral into rangeyes heavy neuts can cap out a frigate in one cycle but their cycle time is 24 seconds whilst a small nos has a 3 second cycle time a good tackler will be watching for neuts and will time their warp scram ab etc carefullysmartbombs will kill frigates very quickly which is why in a fleet you ship scan the targets before getting closer than 6kmdrones hurt which is why rather than shoot the battleship you first pop their light dronesa well fitted rifter for example can kill t2 frigs and cruisers fairly reliably or tackle battleships for long enough for something heavier to take over the tackle and still get out alive in most cases the fun thing is that whilst frigates are the least skill intensive to get into initially it is also one of the classes that really rewards good piloting
frigates allow several advantages over other ship classes not least of which is the ability to roam hostile null sec solo or in small gangs they are fast not just kms fast but they allow quick travel for skirmish warfare they are invaluable for tackling while a lachesis can be used very well in organised instalocking camps they arent nearly as expendable and lack the sig tanking for locking down larger classesa key advantage is they are often underestimated and can be used to lull a target into a false sense of security this can be seen in your post where your experience suggests they are uselessim hardly good at pvp but have been soloing in frigs for some time now and have had plenty of successes in frigates you can look at tactics of many players in some of the best pvp corps out there and you will see plenty of frigates used a lot of the more dedicated and successful pvpers out there also solo in frigates its not just a cost consideration they can be truly rewarding to fly one mistake made early and you are unlikely to recover you could argue this to be a disadvantage but for people that actually enjoy a challenge its rewardingi do agree with teadaze that they could look at updating the tier system as really there are some ships crying out for a redesign
nothing is wrong with frigates except afs are a bit suckt1 frigates are fine at what they do stealth bombers absolutely rock and are awesome eafs are soso well hyenakeres are bad interceptors are fine and perform as advertised mwdtackle covert ops are awesomethe swiss knife of eve the vast majority of frigates work just finewhat you are referring specifically to is my closerange af with ab is cannon fodder and cannot close range which is interesting because you dont fit it with the module designed for enabling you to close range mwd and youre having unrealistic expectations from it it being a solopwnmobile and handily ignoring the fact all shortrange ships are at a disadvantage vs longrange ships if fight starts sufficiently far awayafter qr changes and sb changes frigate hulls are really quite good afs are lacking theyre ridden with interclass issues and with a lack of overall role they need ship specific fixing andor rethinking their rolealso the tier system and bad design of many frigates makes the rifter the only one which is good and that bit does need a fix as it does when it comes to cruisers where the tier system shows it ugly head againa cursory roam with spamming dscan reveals that theres no lack of frigates being flown

suicide ganking is fine stop crying and stop putting 500m of stuff in untanked badgers and doing other idiocy of the sortthe insurance changes mean t1 ships are no longer free this fixes most of the issues with ityou can suicide gank themthe target can be remote repped as well some people did this tanked ganglinked bait hauler  rr logistics to farm kb stats and harvest suicider tearsin fact bc has readjusted their ranking so people dont get crazy points for killing suicide gank bs with bait haulerslogisticsconcord assistance because people actually did do that of course people with a clue not carebears with victim mentality those are never capable of dealing with any problem to farm battleclinic points and for the lulzfinally you can just pay mercenaries that bit works as well
my point is that i am not a pirate and shouldnt have to take a sec hit and be subject to death for taking out an outlaw the current system is silly im an outlaw with an outrageous bounty but you cant touch me without dying running around with a repper setup to fix afkers is not a reasonable solution i want to troll highsec with a pvp fit and hunt pirates pirates say they want to pvp but cant so they do this because theyre bored so im willing to give them something to fight but them running around untouchable while they find easy prey is lame if theyre an outlaw they should be treated as such it seems like it should give them the excitement they say they desperately crave and i dont have to worry about being labelled an outlaw for helping to provide that excitementi dont run around afk most of the time so im not really worried about pirates myself i certainly wouldnt spend isk on getting their suicide ganker alt killedhey theres blackbeard in the harbor i got a rack of cannons with a bead on himhe hasnt attacked anybody in the last 5 minutes so you cant touch him
1 its called kill rights so actually u can touch them the problem is u just refuse to utilize it2 what ure not willing to die in a game to get that much isk its u thats the problem because u dont want to take that risk and u want to punish risktaking its the exact same situation as a hauler with expensive cargo except the target is now the pirate with the high bounty the only difference is ure killing for ejustice instead of pirating so im sure the intention would be to your liking nevertheless u know what remains the same the suicide gankers would take that risk to take out that pirate and u still wont again its called kill rights use it and stop ingseriously u can touch him if they can suicide gank u gasp guess what u can suicide gank them u just dont want to cause u dont want to take risks and all u want to do is punish ppl for taking risks u dont want to take risks fine let everyone else play their game while u sit in your station not knowing how to defend yourself and others cause ure too stupid and scared to or better yet go back to wow
i support this idea im not for security status changes but if ship is targeted by concord insurance will not be payed and isk spent to insure ship would be lost also there should be option that player before loosing ship can destroy every module and cargonot like self destructsomething that will be instant
1 i am talking about proactively taking them out before they can start their suicide gank you dont get kill rights unless you get killed by them first by the time they target you they already believe they will win and i would expect that theyd be right as they of course target pve players2 im willing to die if the pirate bests me i think its ridiculous that condord would kill an antipirate they should get a secboost as well and its not a risk the risk is taking on a pver and losing calling certain death at the hands of concord isnt risk maybe you should look up the definition its not the same situation as a pvp pirate vs pve freighter it would pvp pirate hunter vs pvp pirate and the suicide ganker probably uses next to worthless gear and no cargoagain im not talking about stalking a guy because he killed me hoping to catch him before my time runs out it has nothing to do with me being attacked at all i just want the opportunity to take out an outlaw in hisec before he has the chance of carrying out his suicide or be able to jump in when he has someone under attack i dont know what youre talking about here but again you obviously dont know the definition of risk and i am not advocating a position of staying in station when im talking about the ability to antipirate my suggestion makes it so that pirates dont face automatic death at the hands of concord but empowers players to help take up that rolebeing an antipirate  becoming a pirate which is what someone has to do with the present systempirates can try and suicide on me all day for all i care seems like your the one with the sensitivity issues

excellence would be excellent i hope they will take the time to listen and put a little more effort in focusing on correcting some of these issues of the current game mechanics to spend all that energy working on something and never finishing it makes it a waist of time from the start

totally supported many things are left to half assed done to be ignored i joined 3 years ago and there was overview bugs and local bugs today three years later those same bugs are still here and still harassing us new content is always needed but not constantly or as much as ccp thinks a little more time spent of fixing things and id be happy with only new content once a year instead of once every 9 months 6 months spent developing something new and then 6 months fixing things reviewing and strenghting the foundation cause ill be frank it isnt the game that keeps me comming back even though the freedom to do as i please is awesome its my fellow corpmates and alliances members that do not you ccp

it is totally out of hand and ccp need to really reavaluate what the  theyre doing when i look at eve i have visions of swg flashing before my eyes and it wont be long before were there eve is a pvp game but now a 50 vs 50 fight can be impossible due to lag and taranis has been the worst patch deploymentrelease so farfor crying out loud balance the game fix the problemsbalance blastersfix and make fw usefulfix the lag i know youre working on itfix all the other bugs i need not mention

keep this thread rollinnot that ccp cares in the long run but because we care1 account already due to lack of what the op stated
yeah
i support the call for more excellence to go about it imho is that 2 halfs doesnt make a wholelet me explain the last few new expansions were lacking the promised content it was supposed to haveand if you promise something you should deliver imoif its not possible to make half yearly expansions with the expected features then make a huge and very satisfying large one yearly2 halfs doesnt make a wholemy suggestion is to make this a yearly one for new game mechanicscontent like sov changespi that has been properly run though it passes and add corification for future ccp productstoo increase the excellence in the game you can ad new patches on a random basis and that doesnt have to be tide in too the schedule of a new expansion read difference between patches and an expansionin these patches you can but some extra fluff like the scorpion model that got new looks or the luv the faction ships got or the loot changes for missioners and other miscellaneous etc etcto me these sound like diferent itterations of the already available game contentmechanics and should be more easily done compared to new game features no disrespect too all the hard workso releasing stress buildup and giving space for excellence is the main priority herelets be honest what draws us too eve everyday is already there we only need too make it shinier and on occasion fill it up with different stuff
this needs to be done

supportedi will say that i believe ccp does a pretty decent job and sets their ambitions high however what the op has stated does hold weight imo i can only imagine that fulfillingimplementing the ideas laid down must be difficult but i believe ccp is of a high enough caliber to do that much better
supported
i agree with most of the the posts here but i also think ccp are doing a great job with the game i just feel that they have lost their direction slightly just look at this thread ccp and see what the people want spqr and all that
supportedits more than apparent that ccp is moving too fast with their goal of putting out an expansion twice a year id be happy with an expansion once every 9 months to a year i believe its time for ccp to put a hold on their upcoming projects sift through the broken items and fix them they need to listen to their player base instead of being the arrogant bullies they are portraying themselves as their lack of response to the feedback threads is inexcusable especially after a major release further the csm needs to hold ccps feet to the fire on this one the way csm4 rolled over was a joke mynxee has indicated in her blog that she intends to keep this issue in the forefront of the next csm meeting with ccp im hoping she has the leverage to accomplish thisahs
i think this proposal needs to go further and ask for a halt on development until a significant proportion of current features are finsihed andor polishedody

more ehp they should be tougher then af af have up to 910k ehp lets get some dessies up to 15k ehp for a tanked fit cut some turrets and the rof penalty the goal is to keep the dps the same add those missing turrets back in as mid or low slots
this
destroyers are suppose to kill af and frigs they are anti frig boats also i think af already have more ehp then a dessie
i think the best change would be the extra lowmid slot but in general i support the other changes as well
i agreei hated doing all that learning stuffi really think it was a terrible few weeksi also hated waiting to get into a battleship with t2 weapons and modscan we have all those skills to for our noobs i would also like my day old character to be able to fly a carrier with max skillsits done to give you discipline you know that thing most lack their first couple weeksso if you cant hack the first couple weeks this game is not for you anyway
supported heres whylearning skills in eve dont actually do anything they represent an arbitrary time buffer which if i had to guess was originally designed to keep the complete newbies from competing with the advanced players nobody enjoys training learning skills we only do it because if we dont we suffer in the long run is there anybody here anybody at all who enjoyed training up learning skills of course not nobody enjoys sitting around not advancing or advancing slowly for a period of x weeksmonthsgiven that it obviously isnt fun we have to ask ourselves is it necessary what useful purpose do learning skills servecomparing them to other skills is bad because they dont actually affect gameplay at all comparing them to implants is bad because theres no riskreward concerns involvedif the purpose of the learning skills is to keep newbies from getting too good too fast well given that you need a matter of years before you can max every available skill somehow i dont think this is that great a concern anymore if it ever wasif the purpose of learning skills is to enforce a sense of patience i think waiting a couple of weeks for a level 5 skill should enforce that just fineif the purpose of learning skills is to create the impression of character customization this is a moot point most everybody gets learning skills its just a matter of when those who dont get them usually end up leaving the game as the longer waits for more advanced skills become unbearableremove learning skills 50 statpoints and a free neural remap across the board redistribute learning skillpoints in the form of a temporary 10100x training speed multiplier vets get a training boost rookies dont have to suffer everybody gets greater control over their charactereverybody wins
ask the people who quit because of the learning skills how much they liked being efficienta game is not a job the objective is to have fun for some this obviously means being as efficient as possible for many it doesntalso saying this over and over wont make it truein other newsyour persecution complex is stunning and only matched by your lack of comprehension of the purpose of the learning skills
woah woah where did that come fromone ive been playing eve on and off since 2005 so im not sure how id have a persecution complex in regards to being a newbietwo i am honestly unsure as to why learning skills exist a barrier to entry is all i could really think of but i included customization because it also seemed like a possibility and a slightly cynical passing mention to patience because somebody else mentioned it earlier in the threadbesides those three reasons why else should learning skills even exist if you can take the time to attack my character you can take the time to attack my pointsi want to hear your opinions
it certainly seemed that way given that youd guess that the reason for a character development change would be to disadvantage new players when the opposite has always been the case really does sound like a narrowminded insert playstyle complaining about how ccpeveplayersgod hates themto make things train faster thats what they do they dont provide a barrier they makes things fasteri mention some of it here and there is more scattered throughout the thread
im just going to go straight to attack the false premise that these skills add some kind of variety to the gamelets say you have two players player a and player b you give them both an identical skill plan a list of skills to learn and an order in which to learn them now to make this interesting you tell player a to max out his learning skills before following along the skill planto start off with player a is way behind player b in skills besides learning but as they both follow the skill plan something happens eventually player a catches up to player b this moment in time we shall refer to as the threshold after crossing the threshold assuming that player a and b both spend an equal amount of time training skills and provided that implants are identical for both players etc etc player b will never have as many skill points as player athe only real choice in regards to learning skills is thiswill you get your learning skills first or do you plan to be playing for less time than it takes to reach the thresholdto reiterate this more simply ignoring your learning skills is only a good idea if you plan to stop playing the game at some point the fewer learning skills you get the shorter your characters lifespan must be for you to not be punished for itany game feature which discourages players from playing is a bad thing the loss of the paltry choice that is presented to rookie players is a small price to pay because when given a choice of suffer now or suffer later most new players will leave
lets say you have two highschool graduates player a and player b you give them both identical grades and resources but you send b out into the job market and a to college  b is going straight to making money and a is maxing out his learning skills before following along the planto start off with player a is way behind player b in money but as they both follow the plan something probably happens eventually player a catches up to player b this moment in time we shall refer to as the threshold after crossing the threshold assuming that player a and b both spend an equal amount of time working and training skills and provided that implants are identical for both players etc etc player b will never have as much money or skill points as player ayou can make the same analogy with two graduates given money  one puts it into savingsinvestments and one spends it on stuff is it a choice yep is it more efficient to go to college  save money  train learning first yes do people always choose the most efficient path absolutely not people choose when and where to trade efficiency for convenience  enjoyment  etc all the time this happens in life and is mirrored in eve removing choice is bad removing depth is bad if the learning skills are ever removed i hope nothing replaces them and no bonuses are given slow everyone down to the same slow rate no stat increases no skill replacements nothing
yes but when the second graduate runs out of money he doesnt usually kill himselfyou can not reliably compare advancement in real life to advancement in mmos believe me ive tried by god have i tried the fact of the matter is that people are far more willing to leave mmos than theyre willing to leave real lifewhen made to choose between the lesser of two evils an mmo player will leaveremoving depth can be bad but it is not unconditionally badlearning skills are not worth the damage the cause
i suppose thats true if your cause is to increase the number of players at a faster rate than eve has been growing bearing in mind that eve is one of the most stable success stories in the mmo world and still grows im not sure that should be our concern my cause would be keeping it true to the complicated painintheass game that got us all hooked in the first place learning skills are part of that picture  and removing them damages the cause
eves appeal is its complexity and its freedom not being a pain in the ass there is nothing complex about learning skills i could summarize them in a paragraph and they do more to limit freedom than promote it because if you dont get them before anything else then you screw yourself over they actively deter newer playersby your logic how about we add tier 3 learning skills with 5x training multipliers where does it end and more importantly why does it end there
as so often happens your entire argument boils down to the imaginary skills race yes player b will never have as many skill points as a fortunately this doesnt matter in any way shape or form and in return player b will have acquired real skills sooner than a which is presumably what b wants since he chose not to do all the learning skills early on and therein lies the choice which so many wish to deny but which continues to exist nonetheless does b wish to be as effective as possible in the long term as a does or does he instead want to focus on the short term for nowthe idea that you get punished for not training the learning skills is also nonsense and is based on another common fallacy that the training speed you have once you have all the learning skills is the baseline and the learning skills are a mandatory timesink to get there in fact your training speed without any learning skills or implants is the baseline and the learning skills merely optionally trade time for a rate increase there is no punishment merely a trade of a shortterm advantage for a longterm onesomewhere in the middle there you came dangerously close to implying that the game is no longer worth playing if you fall behind in the skills race will you get your learning skills first or do you plan to be playing for less time than it takes to reach the threshold etc i will assume that you did not mean to imply this since such an implication would be ridiculous on a scale never before witnessed on these fora without this implication you are merely asserting that a players highest priority must be their position in a nonexistent race which while still nonsense is a few astronomical units closer to the realms of rational thoughtthe only damage they cause are the removal of people too foolish to understand what you yourself say is not a particularly complicated part of the game they were lost before they ever startedpeoples narrow views of how eve should be played limit their freedom the game does notthere have been requests for them
find me one character who has 3 months of active playtime and who has no learning skill above level 3oneone single character and i will retract everything i have said and concede to your point i will not ask for more players i will not move onto another point i will retract all i have said and concede that they are a viable optional skill choice if you find me one single player out of the 200odd thousand that meets that criteriastay your tongue the fact is after a certain point there is literally no advantage to having neglected learning skills because by the time you reach that point if youd invested in learning skills youd have those other skills anywaycreating a game that nobody will touch is not a goal to aspire to its not about understanding its about choosing if you want to leave an account to boil for weeks before playing the game or suffering for it if you end up playing longer than you envisionedthis isnt about perspectives its about mathwell then by all means lets add in tier 4 5 6 and 7 learning skills too
a fallacious request because even if noone has done it that does not mean it isnt viable certainly not with armies of trolls trying to get people to train learning skills until they quit a foolish request because i am hardly going to spend the time to find such a person just for you and finally a loaded request since you chose a level of the skills which takes virtually no time to train and which will thus be part of even the shortest term skill planyoure going to need a better substitute for an actual argument than thatyes i do believe i mentioned that one was short term and one was long term andand yet ccp aspire to it and the subscription numbers just keep on risingive already told you what is wrong with this repeating it wont make it trueno its about perspective math helps you win the race perspective lets you realise the race doesnt exist
give it up crumplecorn these guys come from games where you win by maxing out your character sheet and theyre not capable ofinterested in understanding any other way to play theyre not wrong in their terms of reference thats why youre never going to win them over
new players have three options train everything frustratingly slow until they quit  ive been playing this game for 6 months and i can barely fly a cruiser train everything frustratingly slow for a month or two while they get some skills for their profession then burn a month on learning skills and continue playing the game burn a month on learning skills and then start playing the game these people overwhelmingly quit the game because its incredibly boringyou may claim that the last option is stupid but i would counter that all of the options are stupid and that there can be no good options for a new player as long as learning skills are in the game i would rather people log in and start training useful skills instead of meta skills this lets them get into a reasonably skilled rifter faster or a thorax or rupture or battleship this either gives me someone to fly with or someone to shoot  either ones fine with mei further find it incredibly ing funny that you decry these people as minmaxers when that is exactly the only type of person that can possibly be successful at playing eve eve is a game of progressive specialization until you have a pretty extreme amount of sp  and people that take the generalist path tend to just suck at everything liang
not as long as i have time to kill though youre right that minmaxers will likely never see past minmaxingyou conveniently left out the most sensible option for non minmaxers protip the learning skills do not have to be trained all at onceeve is a game of doing whatever you want until you run out of things you want
this is your own way of minmaxing but ultimately doesnt change the options that the player has  because youre still effectively burning a month of time on learning skills whether its all at once or not is kinda immaterialone could argue this but that end comes much sooner when you do stupid things and generally fail at the game even still learning skills should not stand in the way of doing what you want to do as they currently doliang
maybe we should have learning skills that help you learn learning skills faster that would give everyone more options and choices of how to create their character
only if you look at it from a will i have as many sps as the joneses in 2 years end game minmaxing point of viewsaying it not making it true etc etc
ill sign this if i get to have my 18 million sp back ill even put it into fighters so its not worth anything again and will let me train that hateful fighter bomber book making me not have all the skills in the set
no not only if i look at it that way more of a this price has to be paid so that i dont frustrate the  out of myself with 75 day battleship 5s point of viewyes exactly you saying that it doesnt matter if it takes 25 days of 50 days to train a skill doesnt make it true it does matter as i said  i would rather have noobs start the game and train real skills that help them do something in the game instead of meta skillsliang
no i claim that theres a 4th option which i have pointed out repeatedly in this an other threads and you have repeatedly ignored for whatever reason intermingle learning skills and other skills 50 of the initial 16m bonused sp will suffice to get a player to 44 42 on cha at which point hell be learning at 90 of the rate of the most maxed out player in the game you can get to this point within the first month with a welldone skillplanif youre going to say that doing this is overly onerous well just have to agree to disagree as it is im borderline on thinking youre trolling me for ignoring this option every time you reply to my posts your refusal to acknowledge anything except extreme options all learnings to v before undocking in either direction not one rank in learning skills before hac v makes discussion with you pointless
i didnt ignore that option at all youre acting like this somehow means that they didnt burn this time training meta skills instead of real skills this entire thread can be summed up with choosing between two situations1 people log in and they spend time training other skills so that they can train skills this significantly delays their ability to train real skills2 people log in and train real skillsyoure choosing 1 for brain dead reasons  straight up theres no excuse for this game having learning skillsliang

supportedregen is the core of their defence sounds like you havent flown a shield buffer ship in pvp ever a spr drake is not a pvp shipyou are either a troll or totally completely dumb or most likely both
if shield regen rate is a nonissue you surely wont mind armor gang links introducing an equally pitiful armor regen rate amirite if so ill tick support so ccp can ignore something else the csm want
sure if you give my chimera extra mids to let me put on a warp scram like thanatoses can do with no issue and remove slave implants from buffing caps
agreed some people will pounce on an idea and bash it down as soon as they spot the tiniest flaw regardless how good the idea otherwise is if this is due to an inferiority complex willful but rather sad trolling or just pure stupidity and narrowmindedness i cannot say every tenth post in these forums are like that even from the csmssupported the shield bonus as it is is rather useless
this needs to be fixed
18 or even 20 hours would be good for meoperation at 0000 eve time op ends at 200 so you cant clone jump back until 0200 which just makes it so difficult if you have regular ops
thank you for your astornoshingly insightful input your posts were ignored let me clarify clone jumping is now a good way to destroy your next day of gameplay it is voluntary sure but sometimes you want to play the game but are forced to spin your ship in a station or go play world of warcraft instead because you cannot forfeit the next day by clonejumping as far as i can see it there are no real reasons why the timer should be so long your illuminating points on space travel are as stupid as they are irrelevant im glad you didnt write a howto on how stargates work either say something constructive or go troll on caod
not everyone who doesnt agree with you is trolling youdistance has to mean something in eve either you plan your clone jumps accordingly or you will have to find other means of getting from a to b for the same reason i would nerf jump bridges to be honest
remove jump clones
i tell you what well do a test by way of a thought experimenti buy 20 haulers 10 for you 10 for me lets say iteron vsi fly around losec and you fly around hisec we keep flying until all 10 haulers are destroyed who do you think will make the most jumps before he has no haulers left hint it will be you
i agree 100 and would like to add if i maythat people who purposely put their ships at risk should also get 0 insuranceif you purposely fly into a pirate or drone infested mission 0gank a high sec mission runner 0undock 0do anything that could cause your ship to explode purposely or accidentally and get paid nothing
this is not about stoping high sec ganking its more about making it harder i built an alt leveled it enought to fly a battleship outfit it with smart bombs and bombed the hell out of people myself took me just under a month and with a little capital the platinum plan payouts kept my alt in bss and bombing people for weeks i just thought that taking away that insurance for anyone willing to break the law seemed to make sense as well as would slow them down a littleas for the insurance not being a rl buisness model i disagree ive bought insurance with my main maybe 50 times and collected insurance on a lost ship but 1 time the insurance company made more money off me then i made off them so i think it is some what realisticadmittedly some people insure thier ships run out into low sec and get themselves blow up for the fun of it but then maybe they should also add high risk polices increases and such like rl insurance would have i didnt know about the insurance changes before i created this post just thought it was a good idea and i wanted to sharefor those who say i want a wow like enviroment well i never said this would stop them nor did i mean for you to think i want a 100 safe highsec i just thougth itd add a little more realism to the insurance then what is there now
for some realism if you purposely crash or whatever you will be black balled and lose your license eventuallyso there you go
i agree the deliberate destruction of your property through illegal activity is insurance fraud as far as i am concerned
if someone builds a space vessel and fits weaponry to it i think they get arrested oh wait this is why real life comparisons dont work isnt it not supportededit for ragecan you morons stop using real life comparisons eve is nothing like real life so making a real life comparison makes you look like an absolute  in real life if there were pirates in your backyard the space police would go and take care of it not tell you to go do it eve isnt a safe place get over it
highsec ganking is already punished with a decrease of security statusi think the highsec is already the ultimate carebearplaygroundthere is no need to add further restrictions for beeing rudeps im in highsec tooactually gategamps only exists because of the following thoughtoh lets take this items with a worth of 1b put em into my badger mark i and fly em to jita 20 jumps well autopilotnothing can happen  its highsecif players would be more careful about that they might split up the cargo take bigger ships  or use courier contracts to those that have the bigger shipswhy carry 5b faction stuff with a badger better use a 200kfitted battleship  and no body would alphastrike you
why not just say remove insurance altogether
id just like to point out again that insurance bears no relation to anything in rl it seems to need repeating a lotcarry on
supported if you want to suicide gank then go for it no problem with it it shouldnt be free or nearly free to do so on the other hand at the very least it makes the gankers cherry pick higher quality targets
why do people keep saying this does it really matter if you are autopiloting and afk a suicide gank happens faster than concord response it doesnt matter if you are afk on autopilot or glued to your screen with you hand on the warp button if the pirates want you dead you are deadi just wish people would stop pretending that somehow autopiloting is less safe sure in the incoming trip to the gate you warp to zero and are gone before they can respond but on the other side of the gate you still have to align and warp off and against a dedicated group with tacklers and what not thats not going to happen unless you are specifically fitted to avoid it and freighter cant fiti will agree autopiloting is a tiny tiny bit safer if the pirates are slow but most suicide attacks happen in seconds and you are dead whether you are paying attention or notanyway just my opinion
i you believe high sec space should be completely safe you dont belong in eve  no one should be able to hide unless their at a pos or docked up in a station or cloakedhigh sec ganking comes with a prize the loss of your ship and a sec hit which it is how it should be
i cannot support this idea the only way i could see it working is if they would offer a premium insurance option to cover for concord interference but even so it would cause problems for new players or people that hit the wrong button on accident etc
indeed no iskies for those foolish enough to mess with concord
im in agreement with this suicide ganking imho is a valid play style preventing high sec from being absolutely safethe only problem i see with it is that a suicide ganker does not lose anything by doing this due to the insurance buy a bs 60m insure it suicide it on someone get 60m insurance payout  anything your friend grabs from the target as such its a safe investment to suicide gank not mattering even what you gank except maybe wasting your time on some small frycarrying 100k tritanium isntead of a juicy freighter full of morphite if the new insurance system makes it so targetting the small fry will make them lose money in addition to the usual penaltieswhich can be negated by simply making a bunch of suicide alts you throwaway after they become unusuable  while still making a truckload of isk from intercepting that big juicy 2b freighter then its a properly balanced way of doing it if not then imho the insurance should be voided if you get concorded
perhaps would make pirates think twice before ganking
show me one insurance company that will pay something when my car gets busted during a police chaselax
i support this for one reason it makes sense in universean insurance company exists to make money if people are making money from them the companies are losing it so it would make sense that they would not pay for a suicide gankotherwise i dont care ive been ganked on other chars it happens just get up and start over
signed inspite of recent changes because well it just makes sense oo
i dont get the belief that level 5s should be in low sec why do people say this ive been playing for over about a year and a half and got sooooooooooooo utterly out of my skull bored with level 4s once i could solo them ages level 5s are tough and a great challenge in my opinion if you dont bring a 15b isk bs you have to really think them through but why oh why on earth would you ever possibly do it in low sec where youre so easily scanned down and attackable by pvp players why the risk reward is so heavily skewed to risk that its silly unless your sitting on a mountain of isk and dont mind losing even a bottom barrel 200m isk battleship our corp loved running these missions in high sec it was a great way to bring younger players along for them to see what a mission is like you have to work your way through the isk isnt that unbelievable considering you have to split it with multiple other players making them an even balance isk wise to a fast run level 4 solo allow these to drop in high sec or else drastically increase the rewards because unless the risk reward gets into balance where you can expect youll lose 23 ships to complete the mission due to pvpers popping you in your pve fit while they have pvp fits and can gate camp with no skill just numbers so even getting to the mission opens the chance of you dying its completely not worth it ccp has made this game so utterly boring for me now i want casual play where i can come in play for a couple hours and go which is i think a large portion of the group and if you hit 20m sp and dont want the politics of alliances what can you now possibly do in eve thats a balanced challenge and allow you make isk relative to your skill point level

how about this feature would be redundant and detrimental to the ingame economy paying for skill advancement is already accomplished through the character bazaar forum except the character bazaar offers a much much larger variety of price points and advancement levels the character bazaar fulfills all the needs of the core idea behind this thread with the sole exception of character name you can even swap your old characters portrait onto your newly bought character if you want now furethermore though you can buy all the plex you want to get a character now the consumption rate of plex is relatively constant barring bumps around expansions which increases competition for plex on the market the proposed plan would effectively double plex consumption increasing the cost of plex in the long run while being more costly than the current system of paid advancementthat combined with the deflationary effects of ccps changes in tyrannis would ensure that only the players paying real cash for plex would be able to use this system of advancement screwing over the poorer players who were paying their subscription with isk the current method introduces more plex into the market than what is consumed or at the very least contributes to the trend keeping the prices lower for players who cant afford to dump real cash down for the game and also keeps the real isk value high helping to counteract real life forces from introducing greater inflation into the games economy
gavjack bunk is quite solid at trolling i give you a 610 keep it up
not supported its taken me years to develop my characters the last thing i really feel like seeing is a bunch of rookies coming in and buying their way into a high end character that i had to wait this long to get into wait in line like everyone else
the post you quoted answered this exact question
heres a good start but it didnt last paying for skill advancement is not accomplished through the bazaar buying characters is the character you buy will either not gain sp or require another account to gain sp thus requiring more plex but go on lets see what you get wrong nextok hold it yes there is more variety you tout this as a good thing yet the variety that i get to choose how fast i gain sp for myself is bad ok im guessing your not going to tell me why the bazaar does not fulfill all the needs of the core idea behind this thread with the lol sole exception of name even the portrait can change o rlyhow long did it take you to forget about standings how long did it take you to forget about my amassed assets how long did it take you to forget about reputationwhen i buy a character from the bazaar is it going to come with baggage and crap its not going to have what i need where i need the standings i want and additionally and this is a really really really important point that gets lost on people it wont be my character it will another character i dont even want another character so whats the cracki have to sell my character dumping assets and sending funds to an alt and then i have to find the  and then buy another character that has the sp i need and then i have to pray i can find one that has the standings i want and without the reputation of the peckerhead who owned it previouslywell thats a delightful process by the sounds of things all i need to do is jump through a load of pointless ccp hoops a load of bitter old veteran hoops and additionally come up with 400 on the nose to get the sp i wantand that would be fine with the bitter old veteran communitybut the idea that i dont have to go through that crap process and that i can find the 400 progressively and easily over six months well thats just so abhorrent yet nobody seems to know why or at least cant explain whyhang on double it where did you get that number from yes i agree people will start to buy plex with isk for a new purpose and therefore starve the current purpose of some plex isk thus yes increasing plex competition possibly even pushing the price of plex up and therefore encouraging people to buy them for  and sell them pushing the isk price down if that is true it is true for all uses of plex there would be nobody buying them for isk at all please avoid talking nonsense in future replies tyrannis has not destroyed the free play time plex market get over it if plex prices rise it would encourage more people to push the price down with increased supplyshall i say it would double it pulling absolutes out of thin air is popular this time of year after all
no it didnt it contained an unqualified assertion with no rationale but a kiddiepron sig that attempts to appeal to the crowd for supporti checked the whole post too nothing that you describe is in itlets pretend for a moment the bitter old veteran convenient assertion is true that their is a well of dollars just sitting there quietly waiting for the moment ccp open the flood gates to infinite skill points in all of evewhy are these multi billionaires sitting in their mansions not training 3 million accounts instead of waiting for ccp to open the door i mean had they just got the ball rolling 5 years theyd be super pwn by now and since ccp arent likely to introduce this until after dust is released anyway starting today they could get a cool headstart on their 3 million new charactersthats right because their is not a massive well of millionaires just waiting to flood new eden with skill points it does not existim just sitting waiting for that one magical reason to appear why its just so wrong that i buy a character from ccp instead of a veteranwell im not actually i already know several extremely self serving reasons why they dont want it but theyre not tellingselling characters on ebay is one pretty good reason and personally knowing how much money can be made doing this i know extremely well why they are keeping their mouths shut on that onei presume that ccp assume that virgin dust players might migrate to become eve players and dust console community will not stick around waiting for sp they didnt buy a console because they like watching numbers tick up very slowly
yes it didbecause having two characters each with half the skills you want is not the same as having one character with all the skills you want
this sums it up nicely
you are incorrectwell the sooner they start the sooner they get the skills that the bitter old veteran community has decreed they should be allowedmy favourite one so far was hilariously if this was true if like im getting so frequently there is a hidden community of millionaires lurking watching from the shadows waiting stalking scheming plotting just waiting for the day ccp openly sell sp then like madner thinks infinite and i quote infinite dollars suddenly become available to ccp then ccp would have it available by noon todayyeah right madner like ccp dont even want infinity dollarswhere do you strange people think this massive pool of cash is going to come from turning eve into a soup of infinity sp so strange that you dont want to tell us no wait not strange the opposite of strange perfectly understandable you dont know you are just sure you are correct
you massively underestimate how willing and generous people are at pumping money into an internetgame youre a prime example of that
any time you want to explain why the infinity dollar pool will burst it banks when ccp freely sell sp and not now when only veterans freely sell sp go right aheaduntil then please entertain me more with tales of how infinity works ill get the ball rolling for you09 recurring  10true or god youre so obviously dumb
a bad can flipper and forum troll worried about picking up a character with a bad reputation priceless youve already answering this yourself many people dont want someone elses character with someone elses reputation and standings and etc etc etc buying a character also tends to cost multibillions if its a choice between forking out 15b for a character or the sly temptation to spend a few hundred million to make your own character cooler which do you think is going to get the most take up
this is idiotic even if everything the whiners above said was true the only effect this would have is to act as an isk drain for every player in eve there wouldnt be a single player who didnt use this except for noobs who couldnt afford it which would of course lead to more whining like omgnerfbuyingspit would be learning skills on crack and ccp has made it quite clear that they think introducing learning skills was a horrible ideanot supported barbie says math is hard
learning skills on crackwhat just because some people would be doubling their sp gain rateon crackwhat did you misread or is this one of those typical reactionary states where you pretend that something was proposed that wasnt proposed you know what i mean where somebody said use two plexs for double gain rate and you decided to read use two thousand plexs for two thousand times the gain ratebecause if thats the case you should speak out against that character bazaar thing their are literally tens of thousands of millionaire bastards just starting eve and buying literally tens of thousands of preowned sp for real money wouldnt you believe how very dare theywhat has ccp saying they dont like learning skills got to do with sp gain ratealso the presence of learning skills or whether ccp admit they goofed has actually nothing to do with sp gain rates bringing that up as some sort of justification is pretty funny
no i have made no attempt to answer what happens when infinity dollars and infinity sp arrive youre not reading the words typed youre reading words you wish had been typed its the other people who are the ones trying to tell me what happens when mr infinity arrives on the scene im the one saying mr infinity is a figment of their fevered imaginations driven by an insane loathing of something what it is they do not know but they hate it they cant describe they cant perceive it they just hate it it makes them foam madly from the mouththey dont want to face the simple truth the price of characters on the bazaar would go down in proportion to the amount of sp people were buying from ccp if ccp were to freely sell unlimited sp characters are the bazaar would have to undercut ccp to sell and undercut ccp by the character transfer fee and a premium for having to have somebody elses baggage and i would be fine with that however since you accused me of saying what would happen when the mythical millionaires arrive there you go ive now said iteven if the mythical millionaires did arrive nothing much would changebut the mythical millionaires dont exist wont arrive and wont destroy utterly the character bazaar it would be merely proportional thought id better add that last bit because the irrational people who keep diving into this thread seem to be largely incapable of understanding words typed which kind of makes this edit pointless i suppose
you can find a character with the majority of standings you want your amassed assets can be transferred easily through the contracts system your complaint about reputation is the only valid concern i see there but in your case it could be a benefit at wellits a shame for the op you took up his cause he might have been willing to refine the idea through discussion without nearly so much ego or trolling
yes you did you just didnt mean to lets try doing this slowly in using simple words you might have less trouble understandingcurrently a tiny number of people buy characters off the bazaar why is this well good characters off the bazaar cost many isks meaning that most purchasers are already quite experienced eve players who want a jump start to a certain skill set they dont have so a mission runner might just buy a research alt or a pvper might buy a jump freighter pilot sure you might get an occasional person who joins eve immediately buys 20 plexs and purchases a l33t omgz titan pilot but this is a minuscule number of people because most people arent going to invest thousands of dollars buying the pilot and ship via plexnow lets look at your desired outcome where a couple of plex gives someone a big training boost it costs a tiny fraction of the amount a character would so lots of people are going to do it if youre an experienced character youve probably got an income of over a bill a month anyway so whats a few hundred mill towards your training suddenly 50 of eve is boosting their training and the number of pilots who can fly the top level ships increases a hundred fold does this have an adverse effect on the character bazaar sure it does although there will always be a market for people who need a specific skill set immediately but overall trashing the bazaar doesnt matter anyway what does matter is that youve just changed a fundamental aspect of the game and made it so any character can advance in a much reduced period of time because youve also made it very cheap and easy to do so now the expectation becomes that everyone needs to do this or theyll be left behindpros of this idea impatient noobs get to feel a sense of false accomplishment i can haz carrierz toowe get to enjoy the tears as they emoragequit you blewd up my new carrier again cons of this ideaeveryone runs out of new skills to train in a yeareveryone gets boredeveryone leavesseriously dude let it go that time it takes you to train up for the next shiny ship is time you should be using to learn how to fly your current one anyway every new class of ships presents you with a steep ass learning curve of how to get the best out of it if youre ready for a new class of ship every 2 weeks then you arent flying the ones you have properly theres a reason why new players always rush to get the next big thing and then inevitably lose it a day or two later thats a big eve learning moment and the people who stay around tend to be the ones that pick up on that lesson
no i didnt get over it i say repeatedly the millionaires arent out there waiting to pounceget over it get over it get over it i answered that silly point once and once only becuase you were dumb enough to accuse me of answering it get over it get over it get over itbecause the millionaires arent out there like i keep sayingso you gone from accussing me of agreeing with the infinity dollars  infinity sp argeument to agreeing with me that there is no well of cash just ready to  up eve the moment ccp let them you are bizare stophammertimesuddenly 50 of eve is boosting their trainingand the number of pilots who can fly the top level ships increases a hundred foldnow youre back to weird bonkers randomly pulling numbers out of thin air100 times the number of top level ship pilotsawesomewell for a start they keep saying they want good fights well they might get them but they dont want good fights really they just want to win really anyhow if there and let me just lol again while i say one hundred times the number of top level ship pilots lawl yes of course lol anyway 100x times  100x the number of titans that need building therefore not 100x the number of titans in space the emphasis shifts to minerals what its a closed system dammitaccording to you fetch me the number on the number of people who quitted at titan level and the numbers who quitted before titan level poll them ask them why they quit then if it comes up in your favour i will accept your listlol so nobody ever blew anybody up in a fancy ship they didnt know how to fly huh this line is pure crap why did you type it why should everybody gain sp at the same rate because of this line because we all learn equally quickly weakso why do people in cp keep saying its not sp that matters if its sp that mattersseriously the hypocrisy is amazing nothing fundamental changes if people want sp they can buy them today just not from ccp nothing changes but something apparently does change just nobody seems to know what it is
pro 1  char bazaar does this without having them still have to play and learn how to survive even when that time to learn is half half  0 pro 2  char bazaar would cause this more proof of concept is point 1 a line abovecon 1 i currently have 296 out of iirc 397 skills trained to at least level 1 for me to get the other 101 skills will take 1034 days 172 and 250 in gunnery and spaceship command alone respectivelycon 2 you get bored from not being able to do things  only being able to do 1 thingcon 3why would everyone leavealso your bit about everyone being able to fly the top level ships is bs i can currently fly every caldari ship other then freighters and transports effectively yet you dont see me trolling around in a levi or phoenix or widow or anything just because i can fly it doesnt mean i will
are you being deliberately obtuseas i pointed out and you seem to have completely ignored most people who buy characters off the bazaar currently are existing eve players who buy characters with isk theyve earned in game not by selling mass plex for iskno youre again mixing up isk with rl money dollars are not the only way to get isk older players especially already have quite a lot of these because of the time it takes to earn sp and the lack of cheap shortcuts the number of players with huge sp totals is very small compared to the number with less like a pyramid shape if you will if you boost sp training you basically flatten out the top of that pyramid shapeso in fact you want a vast number of titanmom pilots who dont have the isk or the contacts to actually get the ship theyve just quick trained to fly awesome im sure thatll make them much more satisfied and happy i didnt say training to titan made you want to quit i said running out of skills completely probably would currently the time it takes to get every skill in the game is so long over 4 years iirc that it generally just isnt going to happen as new skills are added fairly ofteni love the way you try and reverse an argument and then attack that instead of the original its funny to watch inexperienced pilots in expensive ships  lots of death and gnashing of teeth its not a complex thing to understandsp isnt what makes a good combat pilot which is why this idea fails experience is generally what makes a good combat pilot that doesnt mean however that sp doesnt have a purpose it does it provides a gradual opening up of game content and provides timing for the players progression into increasingly powerful and difficult to use ships you do ramble a lot of nonsense
except the high price of characters means this is used by only a minute number of people compared to the overall userbase if an occasional rich idiot wants to spend thousands on a titan char and then gets popped the next week who cares so why on earth make it so everyone can fly them all really quickly if theyre not even going to fly them anyway not that they could afford the ships in the first place
nope read the whole thing apparently you are unable to grasp the simple concept that it wouldnt be some people doubling their sp gain it would be all people doing it except noobs who couldnt afford it to say otherwise is as stupid as saying only some people train learning skillsand for the record i am also against the character bazaar as anyone who knows me ingame would tell you therefore congratulations on again inserting foot into mouth because of your puerile assumptions as one of the literally tens of thousands of millionaire bastards starting eve a while back i never felt any desire to buy a characterthis stupidity perfectly summarizes why you dont get it why dont you propose something for the market next im sure it will be enlightening helpful and totally an original idea
as to the first bit the prices are not really that high this head for example would start at somewhere over 10 billion isk as it has caldari titan at five so its special most usual char bazaar characters are not that special though you pretty much pay cost of skillbooks  amount of plex it ate  some extra or it wouldnt be worth it if your looking off a pure isk sink this plex thing would be pretty close for pilots that are not looking to make a killing take this one for example linkagewith that current layout it took him 922 months to train sixteen million sp and that is if he was able to remap and move his stats around enough to make his spaceship and learning train at the same rate of 2409 sp per hour he would need a tenth plex to give him a rounded month as the 22 doesnt come free most likely as he has 300k sp of uneeded trading skills for a pure miner which would have canceled out the 14 day free trial account came before double training as the head was made in 07so out of the 35 billion your paying 3 billion in plex and another 50 or so million just in skillbooks learning skills and exhumers is 45 million all alone so this guy is making a whole 450 million extra isk off of 10 months of doing crap if thats your overhead a pilot training double speed will get this one in 5 months and cost 10 plex will have the same skillbook price so the difference in price breaks down to 90 million a billing period or 3 million a day that he could have saved wow thats a lotas to the second half i used ships because you used ships no one in their right mind is going to train for them like that since they know they wont be able to afford the titan prolly with normal training much less double but say you really want to take your laser boat and put t2 lasers on it for me to be able to fire that t2 laser it will take me 82 days i might see that as a reason to spend 300 million and cut that down to 52 days notice id did not say 41 days as i will most likely not spend the money on another plex to do half of a half month for the one skill i need faster you and everyone else here on the no side of the fence seems to think that everyone will be doing this every month of all time they play where i think the yes people realize its more of an as needed thing instead of a because i can thing
this conversation gets funnier the longer it goes on
except not that many people in the overall scheme of things can find 35b to spend on a purchase an awful lot more people can find 300m a month so youd train slower than necessary because you probably wont want to use the skills for a while isnt it a lot more likely that most peoples train of thought is going to be something like ill be able to fly a titan and who knows maybe something will happen so i can sure its not likely but millions of people play the lottery each week on much worse odds anyway titans aside people are definately going to be training to caps extra fast and getting the whole range of support and weapon skills much faster then theyre going to reach a point where its all trained and theres no more skills to aim for other than maybe each races titan i just dont see any reason why its a good idea to make character development run its course in half the time one of the big joys of eve is that it has such a long running end game why spoil that
yeah because no one is noticing that the real answer would be to remove plex from the game plex is1 micro transaction2 not an isk sink if you were to make char bazaar and this idea run off of straight isk it would give the game a huge isk sink to play with making this stuff work off of plex in both situations does not cause any isk to leave the system as all you all you are doing is paying money to get the plex if you paid it off of in game generated isk that is huge hole
without plex it still wouldnt be an isk sink though as its just moving isk from one player to another like the bazaar itself though plex have a secondary real world purpose in taking a normally black market industry game currency purchasing and giving players a way to do it that gives money to ccp rather than to some gold farmers
as a bitter old vet with loads of sp i dont support this proposal because im bitter and hate everything and want to keep my sp lead on other players so i may call them noobs in game and laugh at their noobish ways while myself being all smug and bitter
well for the plex for double training time it would be a sink as the money would go to the sink as it would get removed 300 mil at a time and for char bazaar it prolly would 50 the time the same way as someone could then make his trasaction like that one in half the time if he were to give the account the 300 million times x months to train another copy fasterbut if they have all the sp but none of the experiance you can laugh at their noob ways as you blow up a more expensive ship they shouldnt be in granted char bazaar would do the same thingif you guys havent figured it out yet im against both only thing i would support is having grind skilling idk about you guys but i already have to grind missions ratting plex whatever to make money so saying that leveling by killing things would introduce grinding is ed because we all already do it anyways
youre that told me i was the one who explained how the millionaires with infinite dollars will destroy eve with infinite sp and in your previous post you tried to explain to me that i had said that by explaining to me that there are people out there who will destroy eve the moment ccp sell spand now you say im the one being obtuse well ill skip read the rest of your post to see if you have explained yourself if you havent consider it ignored you start making sense with real sentences that dont contradict yourself and we can talk but i suspect the rest of what you typed is as equally mental as what you have managed to type previouslyskip read complete what a face palm learn english come back
and to say that is to say that ive never had to tell anybody to train the learning skills which i have so there anything else youd like to invent in your own head and set forth to the earth in the hope it might make sense outside your headto say that is also to say that just because everybody can buy plex with dollar and sell them for isk everybody will which they dont i know this because again i dontso your assertion is based on the hope that you are correct while all similar circumstances point to the opposite congratulations you failed to think your point through before making it i seriously doubt you are a millionaire oh you cannot understand and you thought i was on about isk in that sentence oh dear this could run longthis stupidity perfectly summarizes why you dont get it why dont you propose something for the market next im sure it will be enlightening helpful and totally an original ideabefore embarassing you publicly on that one please make it all the sweeter for me by explaining why you think ccps dislike of learning skills does matter to the sp gain rate instead of just calling me stupid go on i double dare you because this will be sweet
first punctuation for the love of god second if you cant see how everyone would do this if given the option youre a moron third while doubtless there would be the occasional person who didnt do it for reasons of their own or simply not being aware of the option ignorance of game mechanics would make them like you a moronso you are in fact trying to build your case off potential statistical outliers rather than how it would affect the average player thats bright whatever you sayill do it in character seeing as im pretty bored and youve clearly demonstrated that logic reading and math arent your strong points not to mention youve blatantly ignored other responders attempts to explain it perhaps youll do better with sesame streetccp oh boy was handing out learning skills a mistakecurious forum troll why is thatccp well we created a class of skills that are virtually required and that wasnt our intent at all not to mention it seriously accelerates sp gain to the detriment of our longterm fiscal viabilitycft what do you meanccp well we cut down the time it takes to master anything by at minimum 12 or even more for people who grind the skills to 5s and then stay in the game for an extended period of timecft oh well since theyre in now you cant take them away or ill break out the whaaambulance in a way youve never seen beforeccp yes we know but at least well never make this mistake againbut hey whatever the best part of this game is knowing people like you absolutely never get what they want but seem to always get what they deserve rage on my friend
supported
yes for the love of godpreferably being able to see meta level on the icon or something would be good too
i am quoting someone mentioning the devs response was yeah thats really easy to implementthey said theyll do it and ill keep spamming support on proposals until i see a meta level among the columns in my hangar
brilliant
agreed makes sense shouldnt be hard to fix i wouldnt think

i agree the other problem is that since it does not overheat until next cycle you dont know whether it registered it would be nice if the green back ground immediately went yellow or orange so you know your click registered even though it has to wait till the next cycle before its overloading
can only present my thumb when it comes to making the ui better especially when it comes to heat
yes and it has to change color when activated before the next cycle

youre doing it wrong select them all on the item screenwith ctrla if you want everything shiftclicking for a range or ctrlclicking for individual items then right click reprocess itll do them as a batch
move all items in to your hanger right click in ze item hanger thing select select all right click on the items you want to recycle go to reprocess watch all your stuff get reprocessedvictory
having recently trained up my astrometric skills i wholeheartedly agree with this
sure why not seems easy enough
i support this issue and all but geez you pc only elitists are unbelievableim sure youll all shoot me dead when i say it but i prefer to play my fpss on console if you dont and they release only on the 360 and ps3 woops oh well whatre you gonna do drop your sub with the way ccp has been using their1 shiny new thing 2  3 profitmarketing tactics i doubt theyll miss you just sayingin any case yes release on pc and consolebut im not crying if you dont
no reason that i can think of not to release dust for pcs as well tbh
ccppc games live longer simple facti would like it on all my consoles and my computerexplore the options that other games have done with pcand console gamers togeather im sure this has alreadytouched your thoughts somewhatso perv on it someim the same as the original poster in how this issignedtosses a beer to gerbile that reads the poasts for ccp
would also like to see dust come out on pc all ive got is a ps2 and horrible memories of shooters on it
you failed in your first sentence come back when you know what youre talking about
i dont know much about you guys but i know you guys are allies with atlas so when you guys came down to 00 did you guys not first blue atlas to come down i really doubt you guys could have got a foothold with fighting atlas or aaa since they have so many petsalliesi have never seen a new alliance from empire come to 00 without joining a block most of the time aaa citizens or atlas pets over nc these daysi am not worried about old vets or whatever i am talking about new alliances coming from empire they all just go and join aaa citzens and they are happy
yes i can see how removing an alliances ability to dock in space would allow small new alliances to forge their own way in 00oh wait no thats completely contradictory instead of simply taking the space back from a small alliance they would take the space back and kill any stations they erected
people like this is why i am glad ankh was made csm leader they just want to protect their 00 oligopolies
nice troll but im not gonna bite
oh look yet an another 00 noobletplease go troll somewhere else
not supporting there might be alot of stations in eve but they are stragic points where reds to your alliance and mess up your markets you lose one every ones stuff thats in it is practicly gone too and their services are essentual to 00 life repair jump clone updating clones reprocessing facilitys cause the pos refinerys suck and can only process ore instead of moduals and ships as well as far as how hard they are you make you fly a frieghter with an egg in it though 1020 00 systems and youll see how hard people have to work to get them
since it mentioned ankhuglydumbahaha it is an obvious troll 010
assuming you are not a troll and also believing you actually believe the above ill try to adviseexplainre the 2 major factions comment nope there isnt eve is just as colourful as the histories of rl each of these so called factions are tbh made of of a myriad of differant entities who for the moment follow which ever faction they wishie if you are a corp and wish to survive in 00 the corp joins a alliance that alliance also makes friends for mutual convienience and forms a coalition  that is natural human behaviour and cannot be changedeach and everyone one of your solutions would not work at all as players would just adapt and return to coalitional groups and the blob  evidence of this was yulai  ccp wanted to get rid of areas of space where people collectively grouped together ccp failed and jita was formedeverything was done by ccp to prevent this but obviously yulai just movedwhence everything you do to the game to change it how you envisage how the game should be will failalso you seem to think that station building is a quick and easy job to do from what little involvement ive had and seen its a colosal undertaking which requires man many hours of labour planning and collective organisation you my friend cannot even fathomre destroying player owned stations  i think this was considered and talked about but i believe subject to being corrected the station becomes embedded into the game programme permanantly and therefore cannot be removedbut i can understand why some would want the player owned stations to be destroyable like any other 00 structure that is player ownedbuilt but you will have players docked countless m3 of players belongings dating back to possibly when the station was built  just wont happennot possible
this was already raised and passed it was in fact the sixth issue taken up in csm history youll be happy to note that ankh did in fact vote in favour but theres no need to raise it again
ccp pls fix blasters
i have a drakei had a demiosi bought a proteus which im going to sheild tank sooni would like other cheap ships to look at besides the drakesigned
i hate flying caldari i want my railguns to actualy be worth the money and effort i put into buying and flying the ship real antimatter ammo would out dps any ammo in eve even nuclear missiles and projectile shells let alone railguns can put tons more power behind a normal iron shell then a powder based gun ever could
well written  researched fully supportedi like the idea of every race having thier own flavour so to speak
why not seems an improvement over the current gal ships
as a former gaylente pilot that switched to amarr due to utter suckiness of gallente weapons i support this
supported for multiple reasonsthe easiest thing to do would be to allow for one waypoint to be set as the destination which would be easy and commonly used the more general thing would be to specify that one station has to come before another station both of these would be helpfulfrom a gameplay point of view the benefits would be obvious and from a computing point of view even one constraint can greatly improve the processing time
i would like to propose that the ability to create or rent shared hangers be added to npc stations and outposts the main reason this is needed is the fact that corporation hangers are often not useful for the majority of members corporation hanger access can be limited because of security concerns or simply because corporate offices can located in systems that have no real use for many members although i hate to bring it up because i support moving people out of npc corporations there is also the issue that npc corporations have no offices clearly this heavily affects those who multibox but can also benefit and even promote players running a minioperation with friends such as wormhole exploration trying to share items among characters can be a fairly difficult task especially when everyone isnt on at the same time what i would like to see is the ability to rent a hanger and invite other players to use your hanger via something like a fleet invite the hanger and invitesretractions could then be managed by the renter at the station the rent should be similar to the price of using contracts to exchange goods during the month possibly higher for the convenience of course the rent could also be variable based on the invited users i would like to see either a flat fee like 250000 iskmonth or a variable fee such as 100000 iskmonthuseri am sure this has been brought up before but i could not find an older thread on evesearch to reference
this is a rather minor issue there are much more important things to focus on however you raise a very important point this is a space game where you have slaves and computers and robots and stuff to do your work and for some reason you cannot even divide your assets into folders without purchasing separate cans which in turn make it difficult to contract out items later and other downsides the whole item usage interface would need a serious uptune including your proposal shouldnt be hard in a universe like this neither is it that hard to code wouldnt need any fees at all imoas proposed here i cannot support your idea though renting hangars for temporary shared use nah useless we want real upgrades not payforpolish more importantly you should not have to grind isk which equals real life money  pay to get a better user interface it should be in ccps interest to have the best user interface possible still id rather they removed the lag and many other things before i see this change
asking for a high price is not a scam if you agree to pay a lot then its your mistake since you agreed to it people doing so is not a problem someone asking for a lot does not do anything to you you being willing to pay a lot dos the font being absolutely horrible is a problem since it causes people to accidentally pay an amount of isk different than what they thought they werealso as a note to a couple of people in this thread what the us government does is about as relevant here as how many times have i taken a  during june 1997
this seems to be better solved with an improvement to the ui not with an artifical market capso no support to this but absolutely thumbs up to allowing people with difficulty seeing the damn text to change fonts or sizes or somethingconsider supporting this thread
i support a separate login for web services but account services and in game imo must remain the same or allow account sharing
signedthe accounts of eve and evegate and these forums should be seperated  in my opinion the only case in which the account credentials should be used is to log into the game itselfyep  couldnt find a visible link to evegate too  this should be fixed as well 
excellent idea
counterpoint your inference is that the existence of killmails ingame the presence of the corporate recorded losseskills tabs and the api for killmails means ccp cares about your killmailsergo we can infer that selfdestruct not generating a killmail is working as intended qed selfdestruct does not need balancingis selfdestruct annoying oh yes you only have to look at the venom it generates in threads like these the faked mails when someone sds their carrier etc given the changes in insurance its likely to be far less of an issue thoughon the points re records of engagement  if your carrier victim initiates self destruct you have 2 minutes to frapsscreenshot it mail the link to his ceo post on the forums whatever you forced x to selfdestruct thats your victory everything else is just fluff
yes agreed it will also give traders something else to buy and move and trade
what
to be fair at lot of it was just trash talking devoid of any real concrete argumentscan i ask what some of the sensationalism and lying was all about i wasnt there to witness it personally and im quite curious what was said i keep hearing all about how she terrorized local in some system or another
its all in her thread and doesnt really need repeating in detail here but primarily she implied that every other csm candidate wished to move level 4s to low sec and she was the only one fighting against this
ah so this has nothing to do with the talk of local spamming ill try to find it thanks gladys if anyone can point me to the thread where ank claims the other candidates want to move level 4s to lowsec itd be much appreciatedive searched around and found a couple assembly hall proposals where the move to lowsec is suggested and at least one thread where ank refers to these proposals but i cant find anything where shes claiming any other candidates support this idea
my understanding is she mostly did so in eve mails that she massspammed in trade and mission hubs
good issue but this isnt the right place you want the assembly hall not jita park
why do people keep saying the rifter is the only good t1 frigafter flying it for a while about a month on my old character and comparing it with my current amarr frigs i find i kill things in my current frigs before they even get within weapon range which i couldnt do well on the riftermaybe its just me
yup
whats wrong with frigates well obviously they cost too much
rifter isnt the only good frigmerlin punisher are 2 very good frigs and in a frig fight they have very good chance to down a rifter with equal skillskestrel and incursus ar okish too
no throw together a thread on the assembly hall see what can be done about this itd be nice if there was a button for this in the insurance window

i got this idea this morning how about removing the bs hull and change the bos into force recons with bridge capability and combat recon resist
1 oh right because low sec pirates would never ever attack a pve player right 2 oh okconsequence which is more severe than risk because its a 100 chance u lose your ship amazing how idiots like u use risk simply because the consequence is really worse than risk and whats wrong with worthless gear here in eve gear  winning moron seriously go back to wow if u wanna keep your welfare epics1 lol u really dont even know what kill rights r and here u r crying about something u know nothing about facepalm2 outlaw  red if hes not red hes either safe enough for now or he put enough effort to atone which leads tolmfao your suggestion is seriously the most ed idea ever especially to nerf suicide ganking in fact it would end up buffing suicide ganking to the point where it isnt even suicide cause lemme get this straighture gonna weaken concord to be destroyable and let the players do the policing who can then take advantage of that by blobbing and killing concord and everyone in high sec thats when it actually becomes unsafe for everyone wasnt it like that years ago when ppl would just tankkill concord and meanwhile kill whoever they wanted yeah great idea to really turn high sec into low sec now ppl can clear entire belts worth of miners gate camp and attack marauders long enough to blow them upand still live ure lucky i cant sig that entire suggestion of yours cause u just made my day
signi have seen this problem emerge before and it tends to take far too long to fix usually alienating the player base to a competitoralternative in the interimccp has an opportunity to reverse that trend if they stand up to the problems and start tackling them the latency issue is a start its being solved in small chunks but at least there are changes being made
i agree the mission nerf makes me think that ccp really do suck fat cock
supported ccp needs to step back and say alright guys while we got a lot of great content we need to add the polish and shine to it we promised our players for the next year we will be working on fixing and developing existing content so that we can look back and be able to say we delivered what we promisedof course we all know ccp wont bother reading this nor bother fixing and polishing existing content notice that 50 pages of posts have been made and not a single comment by any ccp employee ccp is going to be butt hurt when their fragile little pyramid of crap finally teeters and collapses from its burden of lies and failed promises
great idea poor title for thread no child left behind was an utter failurelets not let ccp think that they can do the same with features

absolutely supportedthe quantity over quality procedure needs to be turned around as soon as possible to some it currently seems like ccp are running around with their arms in the air to patch on a new halffinished feature here partial bandaid bug fix there etcas i have said elsewhere i genuinely am worried about the future for eve and ccp i care about the game and want to see it succeed but once mature strong and direct competition enters the market of which some are getting close to beta or release i honestly dont see an appeal for players to continue to cling to and develop the fruits of their labor in eveccp can only draw on the patience and good will of the player base for so long before hopes and promises of revisiting fixing and developing existing features such as wormholes faction warfare cosmos missions lowsec incentives dominion treaties sov upgrades and expandability starbases t3 iterations industry game physics fleet formationstactics bounty systems and so on begins to grow thin and players become disenchanted with the whole repeating process of release first promise to iterate on the content as time goes along the iteration never seems to come as ccp gets distracted by a major feature that they feel is central to pushing the game towards a milestone or one of their visions the current example being pi which is required for dust 514there has been talk of excellence agile development scrum and so forth but it feels as if the same ccpesqe handling of features and content is applied to the implementations of these termsexcellence as already discussed earlier in this thread held deep promises in the minds of the players of real changes happening at ccpwe have seen examples of scrum and agile development being trampled on at a moments notice never being properly followed through to commit to a streamlined development process with resources being directed where they really should be given mosti only hope my support is counted and that ccp will read

100 agree
i strongly support thisi am not near as convinced the 6month development cycle is much to blame you could use scrum and get two releases a year out and polish and finish or in the case of the ui begin just fine and you could do one release every 18 months and get distracted by new shinies and still have most of the effort on beginnings 6 months cycles allow you to react better to the hardware and software and competitive landscape ccp can say that in the next 6 months they can live without dx11 64 bit multicorethread and native mac client with 18 month cycles that means a couple of months ago you were drawing up an 18 month schedule to begin in june for the only release between now and summer 2013 it is not quite so obvious that singlethreaded 32bit dx9 thru 2013 is optimal the recent example is apple turning out several versions of their os which was more effective than the excessively long vista cycle interestingly apple announced the plans for the snow leopard operating system as no new features tldr shorter development cycles are not as efficient more betaslaunches but should be more responsive regardless of the development cycle ccp just needs to devote some time to polish and followup

long time player of eve basicly 3 month after release running and paying for alot of accounts but my loyalty doesnt lie with ccp anymore it does with the friends in my community that came through but that group of people have steadily been declining over last few years and im telling you more and more are leaving this gamestep up ccp and start doing what its needed and here is a hint its not new content make eve work like you have promised the last 3UFFFD years
ccp have given us a great game that will continue for many many years more and if excellence truly is realized then it will live even longer
100 agreedeven if bugs dont effect my style of gaming that much but i would appriciat more love to the content that we already have in my eyes pi could have waited till the month of dust coming out

definitelya lot of eve is so rough around the edges
yes yes more of thisi would be happy to see a full year of patches that flushes out bugs makes tweaks and completes on the unfulfilled promises of the last three patches i thought a year of excellence actually meant fixing what was already there not adding new features like pi yes the sov system mail system standing issues and mineral balances needed changing and we are all happy for them but the pi system could have been pushed back for a approach that completed sov changes standings and treatiesi feel bad for ccp on the faction war front fewer players are involved in faction wars pvp side then any single region of 00 and this is a miltiregion pvp arena that is open to the public for all to partake in something has to be done to make faction war worth more then just running missions for special faction gear otherwise it is just another npc faction corporation in eve
completely agreed having run a reasonably sized corp i can attest that at least 1 member everysingleday comes out with some variation on this theme in a frustrated response to one feature or another by far the most common complaint ive heard in regards to eve from long term players

ive been playing eve since 2006 and i can say without hesitation that it is the single best space mmog currently active obviously it has dominated the market for a very long time with little in the way of competition almost no games of any genre can match it in sheer economic depthunfortunately lack of competition seems to have made ccp a little uncareful most of the new content they release is just faulty revamps of current systems wormholes are great but theyre just really hard pve mixed with extranull nullsec dont get me wrong i love wholing everything they release is a new version of something already existing in game ccp should realize how much difference improving current content and expanding current content can be to a market especially with a game as old as eve right now they are releasing new content based on glitchy old contentlooking forward to the 00 changes promised for tyranis hope ccp follows through with themps the little radar on my scorpion is win

lol pure genius but why stop there we can also have learning skills that help the learning skills that help your learning skills train faster for mad leet training
yo dawg we heard you like learning so we put your learning on your learning so you can learn while you learnanyway personally i think learning skills are an unnecessary isk and time sink for new players and should go however for those of us that have already learned them i also think that we should get a training bonus equal to the amount of points weve already spent in learning so we can distribute that sp and the time elsewhere when they are removed
of course they will remove them and make your gameplay slower so you can suscribe for longer kind of this is an elegant solution tho so supported
if ccp are indeed looking to remove learning skills then i too would like a sp boost equal to the sp trained in learningi support lp replacement either in a short skill train boost in game or a web based one time sp skill plan creation and completionso if they are doing away with learning it stands to reason they are doing away with attributes what are they going to be doing with 15 slot implants

id support 23 hours 24 hours is way way too short
another option might be allowing 2 clone jumps per 48 hrs
please reduce it12 hours or even less its what keeps a lot of carebears out of pvp really and kept me out for a long timepve clone with 5 implants nope wont risk that in lowsec or 00 so never even set foot into lowsec or 00 and the 24 hour timer was pain in arse cause most times it wound up like thiscorp pvps todayjumpclone and is readywe make couple runs and wipe when group wipes everyone sorta goes back off to do their own thingnow stuck in pvp clone and a jumpclone wasted while i wait for timerthen jumpclone back to the 5 implants and decide nope not gonna pvp for long time or if everi wouldnt say all but a lot of carebears see it the same way if the jumpclone timer was reduced it was be so much easier to get carebears into lowsec and 00 since they would have the ease of which to go between implant clone and pvp clone little more quickly and easilyanyhow i would love to see the timer reduced by half or even more
the hilarious disparity between implant and thus training time risk in empire and 00 you have to try to lose your pod in lowsec is another matter entirely but tweaking jumpclones isnt the answer to thatid support a small reduction in the clone timer to something like 22 or 23 hours to help accommodate peoples daily schedules but no more
id support a skill that if you got to level 5 would reduce the time to 12 hours
after thinking about this i think it would be a better idea to scrap the idea of tying bounty to agent quality it would be simpler to tie bounty to system sec status in addition to my proposed dynamic quality it would still mean that lowsec missions have huge payouts 05 and 06 systems commonly on the edge of lowsec are now more popular because they give better payouts than 09 and missioning in 09 space is still worse than it is now05 space has much longer concord response time increasing the risk of hisec missions the 05 agents which happen to be nowhere near lowsec will sharply decrease in quality because of the influx of mission runners decreasing lp payouts while not sharply decreasing total mission payouts if 05 bounties are set to what current bounties are then most of the hisec mission runners income wont have changed the players just have moved to less safe space the endbut what happens when every mission runner in the game suddenly starts making half the lp due to lower quality agents lp store purchases slow down lppurchased items go up in price and lp becomes more valuable agents in 09 will start to look attractive again but not to everybody and agents near lowsec will start to look attractive the first time but not to everybody as their higher quality due to less use will mean that they pay out more of the nowvaluable lp players spread out as they decide whats most important to them in true eve fashionlp will obviously fluctuate up and down in value especially as players first get accustomed to the system but it in the long run it will inevitably balance outdynamic quality would be enough to send players elsewhere but still inevitably in 0809 if they want lp thus if ccp is looking to spread mission runners around dynamic quality will help tying bounty to sec status will move mission hubs to 05 and 06 areas away from lowsec if ccp is looking to increase the risk for mission running and thus improve the balance of this profession compared to other hisec professions tying bounties to system sec status to help making both changes at once will achieve both of these desirable goals as players move closer to lowsec for higher bounties and spread around uppersecurity hisec for more lpsince im also a parttime pirate i cant help but notice that rat bounties will also get a boost i know a lot of people who would like to see more people ratting in lowsec 
stop this socialist think pattern geez you are like ccp iceland socialistsdont force people to behave the way you like make them want to make it attractive to go to low0 sec 
i like but1 dont try to lure missioners to lowsec it wont work2 some of the most common questions in the official ingame help chat is about finding agents whether how do i pick what corp to run missions for how do i know when i can use a higher level agent or how can i get my standings up fast those were the kinds of questions pushed me into mining as a rookie add an effective ingame agent finding tool before you add dynamic agent quality3 the standings required to access an agent are dependent on their level and quality it would suck noodles to be able to use an agent one day and not have the standings the next day ideas for a fix for this one
i dont like this idea as it has a major impact on my sandbox heres the problem and an alternate solution to discussa problem  one of my main eve activities is missioning and when i cant find anything worth exploring and dont have the corp backup for lowwhspace ill mission i also trade a fair bit using the loot  salvage as a result i have maybe a dozen ships that i use for missioningsalvaginglooting and a hangar full of misc modules  ammo for varied fits if we go to a fully dynamic system ill regularly face moving a dozen ships from interceptors to battleships and blockade runners large distances and need to manage market orderscargo runs over big distances as will my corp this would not be fun id be more likely to drop missioning from my activities altogetheralternate proposal all the complaints about agents  missions are about either the concentration of players or the isk faucet heres the simple solution  an agent will only give any given player n missions per day kills macros doesnt affect casual or mixedplay style characters retains some sense of market hubs but makes minmaxers or 247 players look into other activites as well as missioning this doesnt deny people their sandbox style it just makes them take a break if they lean heavily on the activity to the detriment of the rest of the sandbox ecosystem
lol your solution creates the problem youre claiming would exist if you can do n missions per day then people will be forced to cluster into the mission hubs giving a huge boost to caldariamarr missions and a huge huge huge nerf to gallenteminmatar so you either have to move to a big mission hub with multiple lvl 4s per station or you dont waste your time doing missions at allthe dynamic quality would not force anyone to move anywhere hes proposing maybe a 20 reduction in payout at mission hubs yes youll be able to make more isk if you move away from the hubs the whole point of dynamic quality but the hubs will still be popular because agent quality alone does not create a hub and as a trader the less busy the hub the more opportunity for large profit margins
1 i see this as a way of bringing some balance to hisec missions with a side effect of silencing players who whine that theres no benefit to using lowsec agents or agents near lowsec2 i agree that it needs to be easier to find agents ingame3 ideally quality would only go up or down by one point per day or week or whatever players armed with that knowledge could decide accordingly which agents to talk to as of now players with negative enough faction standings can only use negative quality l1 agents and that limit would have to be changed to all of l1nobody said you were entitled to play the game exactly as you have for the last 2 years with no change whatsoever this change may result in a change to how mission runners play the gameevery patch ships are rebalanced leading to a change in play style for pvp players the nano nerf basically upended all of pvp changes to drone loot have made the drone regions much less valuable to live in potentially forcing entire alliances to move an entire alliance stagnant and full of donothing directors lost all of its sov space a few months ago because they couldnt adapt to the new sov systemeven miners have had to change their play styles as ore values go up and down suicide ganking becomes more prevalent etc all these players have to adapt to a changing game so why shouldnt youif a player wants to run 10 missions but is only allowed to run 5 per day theyll move to a systemconstellation that has multiple l4s or theyll stick with their main agent but move the 6 jumps it might take to find a new l4 so you either have even larger concentrations of players in mission hubs or you have players being forced to move anywaysunder my proposed system mixedstyle players can simply choose to do their missions out of the same stations theyve been doing them and accept the reduced income with the assumption that theyll continue to get more elsewhere
carebears hate being suicide ganked and want it nerfed in any way possible cd
suicide gankers are the real carebears here they want their form of pvp payed for and no risk except for a little sec loss which isnt a risk because it will happen

got a thumbs up from me i dont know all the ins and outs of this i just gave it a thumbs up based solo on i dont know one insurance company that would pay a claim like the one made when something like this happends to a car in real life
would it help if it was called something else than insuranceeven though it has been explained over 9000 times that eve insurance is nothing like real life insurance in any way people still seem to get hung up on the word
im with bellum on this one although i took full advantage oh highsec lvl5s  my poor 100mill an hour as for the lvl5 moaners use an unprobable tengu and scimi combo
because the people who think its worth it to do them will do themi agree there needs to be better rewards for missions that send you into lowsec see
i do sympathise somewhat with the ops point of view after all if losec agents no longer give missions in hisec then why should hisec agents give missions in losecthe real issue still remains the nature of missions though as long as theyre pretty much straight up tank vs dps then well have these problemscure the disease not the symptoms support mission reform so that we have interesting varied missions that dont simply require slow monotanked bs to stay in the same place for 15 mins
the idea has yet needing refinement simply because there have yet any logical arguments to be worth considering im still reading this topic but im busy irl and rarely id answer something thats already rebutted whichs done remarkably well by some other helpful people if anything id probably extend the op post so that all the commonly listed arguments here get answered i might disagree with his opinion but this guy is probably the most honest person on the other side300m a month afer 12 months total 36b are you implying that an awful lot of people can find as much money as not many people can now in 12 months thats actually quite some many in the overall scheme of things isnt it are you implying that waiting for skill training to finish is equals to endgame and is enjoyable watch paint to dry joke goes here even then mind you current amount of skills takes 30y to finish with new skills constantly being addedfirst quote tag is there so that people dont need to scroll up second name calling spelling pricking and i dont like do not make good argument nor help evading troll detectorsand finally this suggestion is not made to appeal to probability it has covered the probability of everyone obtaining plex and try to double their training speed in the case of such occurence these things will happen  plex price increase slightly plex supply is quite finite and remains constant proven by the amount of plex transactions over time and during the earlier half of this year where plex price suddenly shoot up to over 320  a large portion of people who are already paying shall buy plex to boost themselves this shall the extra income to ccp  some of these people will also join into selling plex because its profitable this and the above point eventually settle plex price somewhere however considering plex price fluctuation since its conception from nov 2008 it wont be much higher then it is now  increase in plex price help kill chinese farmers because it both reduce their income after plex and discourage illegal isk trading cause plex is now better alternative  eventually people cannot train double speed training anymore because they got into the top 10 players my personal estimation is atm the mark is at 5060m sp based on how 50 of characters have less then 2m sp and the rest averaging 20mishin the end the only thing this does is allowing new to medium aged players to lessen the gap with older players if they choose to
you know what i would supportpay a plex to make some other player train at half speed for two months that would be hilarious and awesome
wouldnt matter to me because ive been playing eve since 1986 and have like 200 mil sp and can fly everything anyway and have like a 15 year lead on all new players and have nothing left to train anyway so even if that were the case i could still be all smug because ive 400 mil sp
oo
that number is hugely useless because the percentage doesnt tell anything about  altseg many cyno alts will just have the skills for well lighting a cyno trading alts will just have the skills for hauling and selling stuff or your pirate alt which you keep for quiet times in your 00 alliance all that kind of stuff why would you train more sp than really needed just so you can loose more when you get poddedso trying to use that number as an argument that we need plexes for double training speed is very very weak

well ccps made another lets be idiots change and its even in the patch notesso if youve got a 200 run project to set up that consumes 10 ram per run it should consume 20 units logically you would assume that you could put 20 ram into the joblot location and initiate the job just fine but no ohhhh no ccp has said freck you industrialists you need all 200 units of ram just to initiate the job leaving you with 180 units that you can never use because you need to build another 20 to bring you back up to 200 if you want to set up the same job againconsidering its 40 minutes per unit youve got a substantial investment in time and resources for those 180 units you can never useproposal immediately return production requirements to the proper calculation of consumption not total quantityoh and ccpit is no longer possible to start a manufacturing job without having the required quantity of ramrequired quantity should be the quantity consumed not 1 unit for every single run that does not require 100 of every ram component
if players identify it as a bug its a bug
yes this just turned my monthly batch cycle into a complete nightmareone 30 day batch produces 1600 modules that consume 15 ram per run but it now requires that i have 1600 units of ram just to launch the job thats almost a week just to produce the ram using a single bpthere is one easy fix if they want to go with this flatly idiotic feature reduce the components and build time of ram modules to 10 of their current levels and make all runs consume 1 unit of ram regardless of the items produced turn ram into a fully consumed component and this change will work as intendedas it is now it is not working as intended by the original t2 production design when ram could not be produced it had to be acquired from mission rewards
as someone who is making an industrial alt this new change is extremely off putting i plan to make all the components needed for my invention jobs and needing such a huge amount of ram when you dont need a huge amount of ram is totally stupid in my opinioncan we at least hear the reasons for this change or just change it back

what are your opinions on the recent move of selling an alliance tournament match in the openshould it be allowed probably opening the way for even more matches being soldor forbidden at least forcing the deals to be made under the scenes

in the second alliance tournament qualifier match hydra had wiped out all but one ship of the opposing team agony at which point they made the offer to suicide all their ships in exchange for 3bil isksome dealings went on hydra committed suicide agony won the match in doing so agony suddenly had lots of points to go into their next qualifying match since they had won but so did hydra since they had wiped out all but one of agonys ships with ease so hydra earned a bunch of money got a whole slew of points and also made sure that in their next qualifying match theyll come up against another loser team and considering the ease with witch they nearlywonbutthenaccidentallyallexploded they should have no problems with such a match which means that combined with the points they got from the first match that they suddenly lost theyll should have a pretty easy time going on to the quarterfinalsall live and direct in front of the tournament cameras
i have no problem with what happened because it wasnt against the rules besides even if it is against the rules there is no way to prevent it from happening this is part of eve and i can guarantee you that this is not the first time it has never happened it was just a little more blatant than usual

that is a pretty one sided view you might want to look about the cap usage and fitting requirements for the in navy hardener and using less cpu can be huge on many ships
standing only gains for faction kills is not enough to generate real meaningful sustained pvp in faction warfor the majority of pilots faction war is just another group of npc corps that they have to join if they want to earn special faction gear and while there most do nothing but run missions and avoid all forms of pvp to reduce their personal riskhow about ccp making some level of pvp required along with or in the place of lp and tags for key faction war only items this will increase the value of faction war only items and increase the pvp activity making it more of the pvp atmosphere ccp originally intendedi am sure you can figure out tons of different ways you could tabulate pvp kills and make those count toward faction items each kill would have to take in to account the faction war pvp history or faction kills earned of the person killed vers the killer the ship they were flying vers the ship the killer was in and the number of other assisting shipsthe addition of pvp kills would have to be carefully balanced you can make it as easy or difficult as need be given the faction items market value and time needed to farm up pve lp  tags with the added pvp kills to earn the faction war only itemsthe fw pvp points should be capable of being converted in to lp at a reasonable rate allowing for a pvp only style of faction war game play a style where all the lp and fw pvp kill points could be earned through pvp and tags purchased to gain faction war itemslike the idea reply and support it

ive often thought that more could be done to make the buddy trial invites work better and i had a couple ideas today that would address a couple issues ive had to recently deal with1 ingame notificationplease send me a notification when a buddy code is activated and the person has logged in a character on the account usually theyre very lost when they first enter the game and the simplest chat functions that we take for granted are beyond their intuition a simple notification that they got it installed and logged in would help a lot2 secondary means for entering the codesay id like to generate a handful of codes to hand out to coworkers or classmates that might be interested in eve a means of generating the codes for myself then writing them down and a url to include with it to type in and manually enter the code would really help as it is i get halfhearted pledges to look at the email when it arrives when they give me their email address these are people that would otherwise try eve but dont because its not right there and easy to ignore or forget about i have a lot of unredeemed buddy codes on my account due to this3 tertiary means of acquiring the gamefirst means is to dl it yourself second is to buy a boxed game at a game store id like a promoversion i can dl and burn to dvd as a disc image id want it to autorun a small windowed app with something akin to the page firsttime visitors to eve see with the butterfly effect video if not one or two of the latest expansion trailers or dustincarna vids this applet would of course be the gui installer as well with a button to begin the installits not about making it easy for idiots to get into eve its about making it quick and streamlined for someone to get into eve so that moment they become hooked comes fastertldr1 if someone i gave a buddy code comes online send me a notification ingame2 make buddy codes less emailcentric and more restaurant business meeting napkin friendly3 give us a marketing package to attach to a full download of eves client to burn to dvds to give out
oh and 4fix the give support option for op clicks checkbox
ok i know how to select everything in the hangar and have all items reprocessed at same time works great if item hangar is empty i have a lot of other items in the hangar that i dont want to be reprocessed the shiftclick option is great for selecting certain items out of everything in the hangar but still have to click each one thanks for the tip still have to rclick each item first for info to check meta level i dont know what you mean by range anyway thanks for replying to this post i guess it was a dumb idea
say you have a bunch of items ah laid out in your hangara b c de f g hif you click on b then shiftclick on g youll see items b c d e f g selectedas for meta level it would be nice if we could display metalevel as a column in list view and sort by that column wouldnt it

i just recently got back into eve and while i love the game and ccp for what they have acomplished i find it hard to believe that one of the funnest and as far as a community simplest ways to keep peace is to infact have a sort of self police force available to players the bounty system i shed a tear when i realized that if you wanted revenge and you placed a bounty on a pirates head that you could be infact rewarding the pirate in question because he could take the bounty for himself with an alt i looked at this issue with many diffrent approaches and i found in the end i would need to know some deailed information about my target before i placed a bounty on hisher head like1 the cost of his clone2 the replacment costs of his implants3 the price of his ship and its loadout at time of death the reason so i could hopefully set a bounty high enough to atract compitent bounty hunters to do the task while making it impossable for the marked one to make isk by killing himsself for the reward none of these are possable making the bounty system atleast in my eyes but to many others as well broken i had one idea to fix the issue if it is even possable this is my idea have a ccp run and controled bounty office where ccp workers in game hire and fire bounty hunters off of there cradentials and pilot skills these people are tracked and there kills recorded so they can be reviewed to see if someone was cheating or if someone was actully fighting for there life i know it might add up to a decent amount of work but to have such a wonderful profession available to the eve community that is what many call broken is a tragedy specially for all the boba fette fans in the world please let me know about what you think and no matter who it is lets keep talking about this so ccp can get a working fix into play for there community for which i love so much closing note ccp you really do take good care of us and you have done so much for us your playing clients and customers for this i am greatfull thank you i just do hope in so many ways that this issue could be resolved because if i want to put grief on someone who i personaly dont stand a chance aganst i should have an outlet to express my ragein the form of a paycheck that i know is going to the hero who killed my grief and not to the one who is giving it to memagnetica rose
supportedi would definatley buy and play dust on pc but probably not on console i understand that ccp wants to make a game to appeal to the people they beleive least likely to play eve but they could at least make a pc port

as with the other topic anything that will fix lag i will support
one would think this kind of topic would get more support and attentionim giving it full support but there always will be lag as always has been in eve issues in eve are ever present as welli long for apocrypha really stable expansion
please please either cut back to one expansion per year with 6 months devoted to bug fixesexisting content development this or significantly increase your staff so that a large enough team can work on existing content development rebalancing and backlogged bugs

i would marry the dev that makes this possable
not pimp it out but like add a emblem or something to show some individuality personally i would love just a single war stripe going along the side of my harbinger
personally im in favor of individual paint designs for people to decide on although a corpwide paint scheme could be an option i think both should be a backburner idea one that they work on when not necessarily busy with other more important matters it sounds like a nice idea but i think that it could be tweaked a bitindividual pilots would have a chance to opt out of the color schemepilots would have control over the design ie have only one stripe of the corpalliance colors or the whole ship painted tiger stripes camo etcit would just be the logo and thus subtle enough to not get people upset that theyre flying bright purple domis and junk ultimately if its something thats going to be forced on players instead of being an option just for those who want it then i cant support it at all
yeah because there isnt enough lag in eve already just think of the server having to load custom paint jobs and logos for every individual ship

i love frigs personally id rather fly a frig that anything else however they do ultimately lack staying power any set up can be countered by cruiser class ships while still maintaining an effective combat capability verses other ship types frigs can only really be made more effective by nerfing tracking on medium guns i think which would have a domino effect on the entire combat arena i think frigs are destined to remain high risk role players which is probably how they were designed anyhow so while i would love to have more survivability in my frigs i dont think its in the cards one thing i can think of though would be to include sig radius when a frig is sitting still or approaching straight on i have read that insta popping frigs with larger guns works so well because sig radius is not accounted for when a gun fires on a frig in these situations that sound rightfrig pilots are the fearless warriors gallantly charging headlong towards a likely oblivion in service of their fellow soldiers its kinda neat that way really

i am a software developer too so i full agree with this

supportedi think they should set aside a team to only work on reaching that mark of excellence a team that wont be reasigned at all instead of stoping work on new expansions
tyrannis is an expansion that no one truly wanted pve players pvp players miners industrialists traders not one of them gave a dam about pi i feel these expansions are achieving less and less the more ccp does it heck i bet they spent more effort on perfecting the trailer and adverts rather than the game and features themselves if visuals and effects of the game were as amazing as those cg effects as seem on the trailers i would be happy if ccp continues to put more focus on marketing rather than the game their reputation will fall and their marketing will eventually be taken as a grain of sand some may not like this example but look at modern warfare 2 activision and infinity put so much hype into it but when people played the game they felt dissatisfied and now they dont give a damn about the next call of duty game thats being made especially after the main developers pretty much became crippled
supported ccp needs to fix existing content before adding any more major new content perhaps the next big patch can be devoted to that

got my support for thisbut i do kind of see were ccp is going with this right now there are alot of new things to be added to game like dust415 interaction and station walking i bet once all that there and all the releases that are needed to expand and start new layers of game depth are in place we will not be seeing shinnys for spell and they will hammer out this things
i support this ideatruth is that elegant powerful design gets more and more complicated when you always want to add something newtherefore it can be a far more elegant solution to redesign and enhance existing concepts especially broken stuff like the faction war are easy targets where nobody will cry and shout if you change fundamental thingsjust go out there ccp and make an excellent game if you do not know how to tackle this stuff without damaging your preexisting gamedesign go out their and get in contact with all the other companies that collected some wisdom in game design and improving a preexisting system on a long term scale without braking the eggs read mark rosewaters brilliant weekly blog about game design on mtgcom for instance its even free
good thread the concept certainly has my support
yes quality outweighs quantityi have been playing since 2003 and the development team does look like a kid on adhd that cant keep focus on old content and features please start fixing the end game before adding new content eve is already a very complex game with a steep learning curve for new players there are plenty of old neglected content that has the potential to provide a broad range of experiences for years to come broken or neglected features and promises all drive consumers away one big free expansion a year that add new content should be sufficient give more time for testing new content and many smaller patches that improve old contentlet dust 514 and eve online stay as seperate games until the neglected features in eve has been fixed eve has no immediate need for pi and dust 514 has no immediate need for ingame interaction with eve its a great idea but premature what would be more prudent is to improve eve gate and outofgame interaction between the players of eve online and dust 514 using this as a stepping stone to future ingame interactions

today i logged on to see a news article about how 15000 people cannot be wrong since they were watching at8 on streaming vidccp i ask you50ish pages  30 posts per page  1500 people have posted so far the vast majority supporting the opare we wrongfix eve
i fully support this great thread
i wholeheartedly agree as a loyal and steadfast player with four accounts i believe i have a right to expect loyalty from ccp in return finishing what is unfinished fixing what is broken and polishing what has become dull would make eve more interesting and as a result i believe help ccps bottom line more than new shinys twice a year i like the idea of a 9 month expansion cycle or even one new expansion and one completion expansion a year
could not agree moremy feeling is that eve has only been ok up to now adding new content is fine but if the foundation is shaky youre ultimately just creating more problems most of the critical acclaim eve has garnered is due to the games uniqueness not its overall quality the minute some big game publisher figures this out their going to produce a superior space mmo and steal away most of the userbase the carebears will go first followed by the solo mission runners and casual pvpers only the hard core lowsec people will remain and even many of them may be lured away if the competition is compelling enough ccp will have nobody but itself to blame  the sheer amount of web marketing and hype this game gets is unbelievable considering the relatively tiny amount of customers eve has from what ive heard most of the trial players come and go within days disgusted and perplexed by the halfbaked ui which hinders rather than helps their looking for this style of gameplay but are used to a much more polished experience the resulting feedback spreads through the interwebz where other developers and publishers pick up on it the highly dubious awards ccp receives only draw more attention from the big boys who are already looking for the next big thing to supplement the threadbare mmorpg experience ccp needs to give top priority to bug fixing overhauling the ui restoring faction balance improving the nonpirate experience and allowing for greater customization of player properties ships structures etc if they dont get serious this year then i strongly suspect the clock will start ticking as the mmo audience matures the demand for a more accessible evelike experience will grow exponentially somebody is going to meet that demand
totally support ive felt this way since i started playingi was and still am astounded at the number and frequency of glitches and shotty work i see in evesome issues have simply gotten worsefor example catalyst hulls before they were just fragments of the hull on my screen now they are a blur of overenlargened pixels that stretch the system im in looks something similar to the gate flash except taking up over half my screen and it only happens in select systemsanyways thats just one ccp needs to slow down backtrack and fix the old before it compounds with new problems1 indeed
1and to ccp if you ignore this much support over something it makes us wonder if anything we do will effect your decisions in this game just look at the pages and pages and pages of support for this proposal and many of us have just never brought it

i dont support thisso far i have not seen one good resion to remove them and only bad ideals on how to go about itthis has zero to do with new players there is a point as a new player were you have to come to grips with the fact your never going to be on the same sp level as all the older players that is what turns new players away not the learning skills themself they just make them face that fact sooner reather then latersecondly is i dont want eve to be like all the other mmos man i dont want to race to a cap level i hated that alot i like that fact there is no cap level and that they keep adding more skills all the time so you always have something to work on in the skills part of evelastly you truely dont need massive sp to compet in one single thing you just need to train the right sp pool for what you plan to be doing and pick something that you will like doing for a spell as it will take time to train the right sp pool to go and do something alseedit eve is not a instant gradifaction game its a game were you have to take time to evolve your toon dont jack with the balance or the force will bite us all in the rear
i know with my first character i reached the 16m mark without much in the way of learning skills trained seeing all the learning skills baloon to many days each convinced me to reroll if i hadnt been enjoying eve this post wouldnt existi am sometimes tempted to start another alt and train her properly with all learning skills to 4 or 5 but then i consider the training time to do so and realize that i should just stick to my main and just drop in another learning skill whenever i dont know what to train i know now that if i had stuck to that first character i would have spent my second month training learning skills and might be that much closer to all the things i want to do in eve and i probably wouldnt be split up amongst so many things ah well something to think about when i someday get another account she can resume her training then
yet again i will underline the fact that we dont discuss here about should they be removedbecause its something ccp is working onbut about what will happen and whats the best solution for theirs removal
you need to fix this game breaking nerf and fast ccp in its current state it is worse than useless
when most software companies go to the trouble of rewriting a piece of functionality the idea is to make it better than the legacy stuff not worse how can ccp not see the merit of this basic conceptgive us back the ability to add comments to standings changes too ffs

wtb dev alt so my alliance can have a logo too gotta cheat to get anything done in this game
indeed the lack of this essential survival item is appalling
ill support thisin no way do i want hisec to be safe or even safer much to the opposite i do however see no sense that someone intentionally breaking the law to the point of police intervention should be compensated for it i personally detest griefers so if they suffer so much the better but for legitimate pirating the action should have some kind of profit to it so the loss of the ships to concord was already factored in before suiciding a target i am an avid supporter of pirating but as the name suggests high sec space shouldnt be a walk in the park to pirate i would go into length about my opinion on piracy and the high sec issue but from the mentality i see going around both the pvpers and pveers would be opposed to a more logical and a bit more realistic change im thinking of where both sides would get a boost in options so why bother
supported i cant see why any insurance company would do such a thing
it is more about action and consequence exactly the opposite of wowedit  oh and supported p
i disagree to this idea you pay for the ship you receive money back simple as that i already wrote a page long post on a similar pro carebear post like this but tell me from rp perspective how can you deny insurance payout on a ship that get insured in lowsec thus the insurance company operating in lowsec away from concord oversightsecondly say if you try to move your ship 1  2 jumps through highsec with below 5 status  you get killed by concord can happen if youre too slow you would void insurance tooso no i do not support this proposal better solution is to fit some tank or gtfo when you see a local spike or use a directional scanner1 for this idea

i pay a monthly fee to play eve but it isnt fun when griefers dec me they camp me in a station and force me to not play the game i know ccp wont change wardec mechanics to favor nongriefers but they could at least give us pveers something fun to do while were being camped in a station
my sincere hope is that you are greifed right out of the game now please undock and die in a fire in gameseriously i dont understand how these boards are able to continuously able to spawn trolls that get successively worse each month
so youre gonna wander around aimlessly in station there are bugs that need fixing get in a shuttle and warp around or something highsec griever decs can disrupt your normal activities they cant truly camp you in a station
well at least emo tj here stopped with the all caps posting sure he came back with a stupidly named character and went on a posting rampage of stupidity but he cant very well undock theres a badger outside waiting for his dramiel

1 grow pair of balls2 undock and lern2lowsec3 4 profit
teach me how to learn to complete a mission in approximately 2 minutes before i am probed down and killed by local piratesi sorta like missions being sent to lowsec but the way its happening is stupid just cause lowsec is less populated all border agents send the majority of mission to or through lowsec and the reward is not increased at all if you increase rewards then it would be worth it to maybe risk your ship there currently its notalso changing the entire mission system could solve some problems with missions
i dont want to go to low sec so points 1 and 2 are invalidpoint 4 what profit
i have a better idea remove courier missions from the gameyour welcome
heres an idea you undock in a pve fit ill come over in pvp fit 1vs1 no why not grow a pair
1 altsnewbs are well represented in the 50 of characters have less then 2m sp statement what you are trying to point finger at is the rest from the pov of the system altsnewbs are also characters and no distinction should be made weighted average you should learn it2 do not selectively quote my post and twist it to fit your needs this number is not created to support the idea its a personal indicator for ccp to base upon and estimate how much theyd want to implement the idea it could be 10 it could as well be 5 or 20 but none of that will change the concept behind it to even out the sp fieldedit on that note i should also mention that ccp do like to even out sp field thats why they have been reducing skill preq every expansion theres even a blue post somewhere about it when people went omg why decrease preq we arent pro anymore waahh
i will not give a ok for this but with alittle more twiking i would go with plex from the 20mil mark to the 50mil mark as for why i picked out this part of your quote from develdrins post is what your saying makes you look stupiedas we all know time is relavent
buy a rifter or bb and go find guys with equal after you hit like what 10mil sp you notice it makes little difference how much sp you have
but sp are levels and level 60 is 60 times better than level 1
ccp would never let their game which is unique due to its skill system change even if the whole playerbase gave this the thumbs upso keep arguing till you are blue in the face because its entertaining
only player pirates use lowsec agents and stop others from using them by ganking anyone who comes to their lowsec hub they made the choice to be on the wrong side of the law so the law shouldnt employ them this would also reduce the effect of the mission nerfs because there would be less total lp so the value of lp items would increase if player pirates want to run missions then they can clean up their act and do it in highsec

put pirate faction agents there unless of course the purpose of this whole thing is to screw pirates its not is itaside from that instead of removing agents standings should be more closely tied to sec status instead its unrealistic for empire governments to still willing to deal with outlaws right
bombs are a fun thing in 00 but sb tend to be pretty limited in lowsec and even more in hi sec i have recently looked at the mechanics of bombs and feel they should be allowed to be launched in all space however concord if they can shoot the ship will also shoot and destroy the bomb meaning people wont really be allowed to randomly griefhow would this help peoplepvpers will be allowed to use this for heavy engagements sb are nice for smaller corps  alliances so these will work fine when at wardue to the loss of t2 ships a person will have to decide if the sacrifice is worth itwhat about griefersas stated concord will shoot the bombs and player if they see it launched we need to give permission to players to allow bombs in hi sec not just restrictwhere would bombs be useda player would have to be away from concorde in order to use this correctly meaning it will be best suited for pos warfarewhat about low seclow sec guns will shoot bombs but will not always destroy it so camping will still be possible although gate guns will fry your sbwhat about missionsbombs will be allowed on npc rats however to prevent abuse bombs will instantly cause rats to change targets and depending on how many rats are there will most likely succeed in destroying the bombs and sb assuming it failed at warpinghowever any damage dealt to a neut structure  person will ofc cause you to get aggro from concord like if you hit an accel gatewhat about carebearsbombs will encourage the use of transports with defence mods assuming this isnt at gates  concord camped areas stations etc there should be no real way to get away with launching bombs at gates  stations because of concord but that doesnt mean we should allow people to use themthis wont harm players at all even an inty without mwd can evade a bomb
im not one to cry troll but seriouslydevs have stated that they arent going to do bombs outside of 00 because of what calculating aggrogccs would involvethis is definitely in the category of sounds good on paper until you realize it would mostly hurt the people who think its a good idea
zzzzzzzip
heres a better change  multiply all stacks of ram by 100 and get rid of the idiotic percentage system

drakes only get a bonus to kinetic damage this means out of their four ammo types for t1 ammo only onequarter get a perlevel shipbased bonus on the other hand all other races ships with the exception of a few missile boats like the missile frigates and the eris get bonuses for all their weaponsso i propose changing the kinetic volley bonus to a volley bonus for all missile types or a rate of fire bonus this would make running those odd nongurista missions a bit more enjoyable
drakes already do perfectly fine and some would argue its the best battlecruiser t1 in the game and u wanna buff it do u even fly drake
yeah sorry but no i fly the drake myself and the thing is a beast at tanking im thinking the lowered dps is there to balance out its tanking ability so it doesnt become a roaming deathboat murdering people without them being able to do anything about it basically its already pretty well balanced from what i can tell and like the poster above me said its arguably the best t1 battlecruiser as it is
lasers and hybrids are stuck doing their basic damage types be thankful you have emthexp missiles and are not stuck with only kinetic
supporting my own topic
change drakes bonus to adds x kinetic damage to damage of heavy and heavy assault missiles and yes even thlough drake is good lets have bonuces that make sence
which makes you a troll not even a good one at that 010you mean like giving it say 5 damage resistance per level and a damage bonus to long range weapons that even hit 100 on zero range oh wait
drakes are already one of the most used ships in game even though it doesnt have that bonus so it doesnt need it
drake is overpowered very good tank  good unmissable dps
yes it should receive bonus to all missiles just kinetic damage bonus makes no sense ill support it assuming tank is also gimped drake tanks too much for a t1 bc it makes no sense see there we go
lowsec missioners in alliances that control mission hubs not the ones who venture into 4 get almost twice as much lp per mission as highsec runners and operate at virtually the same risk since their alliance controls their mission hub its unfair to us newer players who cant form a corporation powerful enough to take over a lowsec hub for ccp to increase the gap between newbies and old players even further by giving lowsec missioners higher rewards

i dont see a problem with that at all there is no guarantee that their next opponent will be worse than if they had won maybe a good team this week will have most of their team on vacation next week maybe they are saving their good setup for next week or maybe a really good team lost a tough match and will be a tough opponent next weekyou can game your position all you want it could be beneficial or it could bit in the rear it is their choice and i dont see why it should be changed
losing a match should be made less benefical maybe but otherwise i dont see anything wrong in that matchi suspect next tournament will have some point system changes or something
stuff like this is why i play eve brilliant tactical ruleslawyering by hydra even if they didnt get paid
this is eve you learn to expect a certain level of dishonourable conduct going on behind the scenespersonally i had been running the tournament id have disqualified the hydra team not for the offense of throwing a match but for getting caught in the act
i thought it was both hilarious and entertaining arent these matches supposed to be fun whats the problem again
theyre not doing it for the love of the game theyre doing it for the better part of a trillion isk worth of unique hacs this seems perfectly acceptable to me except for the part where id probably have charged more
as it is now the odds in highsec are stacked against pve corps mission runners dont have the knowledge to be able to defend themselves even though they usually have skillpoints invested in pvpthey are however good at running missions let them run some special wardec only missions for concord to invalidate the dec perhaps there will be no bounties or rewards for these missions but it would let pveers play their playstyle playing ones own playstyle is the point of the eve sandbox after all
playing ones playstyle is fine but that means accepting all the consequenses and limitations that comes with it the freedom and interaction a sandbox requires also means that some interaction will happen whether you like it or not i suggest you learn to better manage those aspects you perceive as negative like everyone elsenot supported
its not that bad really butthered be only one such agent hes in space in a dead end low sec system thats connected to high secthe mission will always send you to the neighboring system in this mission you have to kill up to 2010 lootless salvageless sleepers warping out of the mission reset the spawn timer but remaining rats stay all of these sleepers target paint you to obivilion ensure that you show up on probe scansthe mission shall have 5 ships in initial wave and increase by 5 for every subsequent wave for every character warped into the mission starting from 2nd character 5 more is added on top of itwhenever someone warp into the mission the warring corp is notified
i cant see myself supporting this usually people have a good reason for declaring war on you and one of those is that you are defenseless carebears who could learn to pvp is you ever took the time out of your mission running to do so nothing is stopping you from dropping corp station spinning or you know fighting back like the first replier stated you accept the limitations of your playstyle and therefore the consequences by choosing to not pvp if anything like this were added it should only be able to be run once every 36 months being able to constantly get out of decs would make it not worth deccing at all and i just cant see ccp doing something like this

theres been a lot of discussion lately particularly in the smallmedium gang warfare about people avoiding fights unless they have a guaranteed win there will always be people who want an easy win but i believe that there are ways we can encourage people to just go out and have a good time even if they can expect to die in the processthe purpose of this thread is to get some ideas going about ways we can make pvp more attractive even to the smaller of two blobs many people are of the opinion that people shouldnt need incentives to pvp but frankly its become an obvious problem particularly in lowsec where roaming gangs often go hours without seeing fightsheres a few ideas please give me your critique and offer your thoughtsdisclaimer these are ideas not proposals i agree some of them suck andor need development keep comments productive pleaseissue 1  looting often in pvp even the winners of an engagement come out at a loss because they spend money on ammunition t2 drones and expensive overheating as well as repair bills and are unable to loot the fight for various reasons when fights are lootable only about 50 of modules drop including ammo and charges meaning that relatively very little of value is recoveredpossible solution 1 increasing the amount of loot dropped may help incentivize pvp since it means that killing ships becomes more valuable possible solution 2 creating some form of looting rights system so that the people involved in destroying a ship get a guaranteed chance to loot first rather than being first come first serve this is particularly important in large ongoing fleet fights that attract 3rd party ninja looters and salvagers and also in high security space where casual passersby see people fighting and are able to loot wrecks faster than those involved in the fight who are focused on fightingissue 2  the cost of engaging in a losing battlethe biggest deterrent from pvp is the cost of losing an engagement people dont want to put their isk on the line since it means potentially spending time recouping from a loss this leads to fewer and fewer people wanting to fight just to fight and makes it harder and harder to just go out and have fun i completely agree that pvp should never be lossless that said i think some things could be done to make it a little easier to lose a battlepossible solution 1 insurance rebalancingtyrannis brought some welcome changes to insurance but i think more could be done along these lines if i spend 10000000 isk to buy and platinum insure a vexor t1 cruiser not including fittings i think the insurance payout should be in the neighborhood of 89m isk meaning it retains 8090 of its value when lost not including modules for all t1 ships a payout rate along those lines would be ideal some of them are already up there when you go to t2 ships that rate should drop significantly but not as significantly as it does now for t2 ships i think you should be reimbursed about 5060 of the cost of ship  insurance without fittings for t3 again that number should drop maybe 30 or so these numbers are approximate so id like your inputpossible solution 2 loot retentionreimbursementinsurance this may conflict or compliment the aforementioned looting ideas but being able to recover some of your fitted modules when you get destroyed may help encourage more pvpi know theres a huge desire to stomp your opponent and make him cry like a little baby but the fact is id rather fight 50 people and have 1 cry at his loss irl than fight 5 people and have all of them get upset anyhow i welcome your ideas and critiques as stated above i am fully aware that some of these ideas arent great but i think we can all agree that more pvp is never a bad thing
deleted i didnt read the op enough when i originally posted this sorry tortugan
not a proposal as stated multiple times in the op any constructive feedback then do you agree or disagree that more incentives to pvp would be a good thing if you disagree why if you agree but believe that this proposal doesnt offer any realistic solutions what are your ideas
it wouldnt work for reasons already stated the real aversion to pvp is that when outnumbered anyone whos not a complete idiot would try to make a run for it it might help if theres something to even the playing field for pvppppp to make it worthwhile like an artificial  buff for the minority side and  gimp for the majority
thats a pretty giagantic problem youve decided to tackle there one thing i can say is that controlling looting is not the right answer for this game incentives to pvp should come from things outside of the on grid sphere of implementations like controlling sov etc i think there need to be an expansion of that same idea into lowsec somehow not obviously the same but things that benefit those who can hold their power or even those who roam about and win fights but dont necessarily want to stick to one area there were some suggestions for improving lowsec in a thread somewhere here perhaps if rico could bump his thread again the major problem i see with issue 2 is perhaps more about the difficulty of escaping a loosing battle once you get in it but that is perhaps more a fittingtraining issue another contributing factor to this is coordinated fire has such devastating effect and its not that hard to accomplish i dont see any particular way to deal with these problems without actually ruining a bit of the game id rather just see things left the way they are and deal with itit is extremely brutal and it really takes some getting used to for a lot of people but thats what it is and thats what makes it worth it really
request a moderator to move this to the discussion and ideas section of these forums then
this will prevent mineral prices from dropping too low so that highsec miners can make isk comparable to their nullsec brethren they already get screwed over by having to mine veldspar and kernite instead of arkanor its time ccp gave them a leg up
a big part of eve is that the economy is run by the players and ccp has removed this kind of npc cruthces at a steady pace so while the value of the ore might very well require some adjustments at times this is not the way to do itnot supported
you just got trolled son

youre doing it wrong highsec miners are not screwed by having to mine veldspar and kernite highsec miners are screwed because they choose to mine veldspar and kernite in highsec instead of arkonor and other valuable minerals in nosec or whspace or wherever its the usual lowrisklowreward highriskhigh reward equationnot supported

you forgot one vital thing you forgot to compare hpsec msb will instantly repair the damage the mar will have to wait a good amount of cycle time for the damage to be repaired dead space shield boosters have the capability of maintaining an excellent boost tank and a good sustained tank with management dead space armor is stuck to doing sustained tankingwhy dont you try comparing to gistum atype msb armor gets more utility and shield gets more damage those factors balance each other outdead space shield get both a cap and rep boostdead space armor does not large armor rep is harder to fit on the relative tanking ships compared to large shield boostera large armor rep should be about equal in qualities to a xlarge shield booster due to its high fitting requirements if not lower pg requirements armor may have higher buffer than shields but shields can regenerate the more shield hp you add the shield hitpoint recharge rate increases so not only do you have a bigger buffer but you get a better passive tank

eve is a supposed to be sandbox where you can do whatever you want within the rules of the game but suicide ganking forces players out of their play style which is contrary to the sandbox conceptthough suicide ganking will still occur if ccp subracts the victims hull value from the gankers account it will be used much more as a tool to profit from traders and much less as a griefing mechanic
how exactly does suicide ganking force people to out of their playstyle i can see how this might be if you consider afk flying a paper thin beercan loaded with huge amounts of loot a playstyle to me that seems more like idiocy and less of a playstyle since there are well known precautions players can take to avoid suicide ganking i also dont really see the level suiciding being a problem anymore but if you insist on limiting it even more removing insurance would be a much better and simple measure to achieve what you wantnot to mention the sandbox concept allows players to do as much as possible without any forced paths or spoonfed content or restrictions and keeping the limits on their actions minimal if you want a game where you choose all the interaction you want to subject yourself into you want a themepark game interaction and influence between players is one of the most important aspects of this game so it would be foolish to say that that kind of interaction is contrary to the sandboxnot supported
bolded the important part if i want to nuke your hulk i am going to find a way to do it depending on how much you cry after i do it ill wait for you to come back in another and do it again charging me for the cost of a destroyer hull probably isnt going to stop me which is what im assuming you want griefing is part of the game deal with it or dont undock juicy targets
i do not see how suicide ganking breaks any rules of the game the official rules are listed in the eula or terms of agreement and suicide ganking is not mentioned thereif you refer to the currect concord mechanic that concord will punish or attempt to anybody attacking without them being hostile then also i do not see how any rules are broken or how the mechanic is flawed the person attacking you will lose his ship which is a sufficient penalty on its own in my opinion if you want to charge the person attacking you with an additional fine on top of their shiploss i do not see the logic of itfrom rp perspective the person attacking you will most likely be an outlaw or a person commiting a criminal act and there will be no way that that same person will be a good citizen and pay concord the bill for what they blow uplets give an analogylets say you are irl being robbed by a criminal on gunpoint he takes your wallet with 200 eurusd in it now because he committed a criminal act robbing you all of a sudden that criminal gets a bill send to his address saying that he must pay 70 eurusd taxfine to the government because he committed the act of robbing younow do you think he is gonna be the good guy and pay that amount no way in hell he will live outside of the lawnow back to new eden and back into rp perspectiveyou need to keep in mind that the outlawcriminal lives out of reach of concord in lowsec it is one of the primary reasons of becoming an outlaw so you can live without societies restraint if such an outlaw goes to highsec on a suicide trip to kill a hauler full of goodies his ship will get blown up but concord cannot send him a fine to his address in lowsec where the criminal is living simply because concord oversight of lowsec is limited to nonexistentnow the outlaw has lost his ship and you can say oh lets capture his pod so he can pay the fine now that would be the only way that the ops idea can be rationally and rp wise put to use but keep in mind the outlaw will choose death above imprisonment or paying simply to wake up in his own clone in lowsecso this is my attempt to give a rational and rp wise explanation on how the ops idea cannot be implementednot supportedps keep in mind there is always a choice in eve that is the essence of the butterfly effectsandbox by forcing people to pay hull value you take away choice and now that is against the rules of eve

not supported but not because of this wall of text and fail anologies lol suicide gankers do not lose their hulls because of insurance and why would insurance pay for wanted criminals loss by police irl anologies failto ophull value heh so ill pay the value of your worthless itty hull and keep the juicy loot in it
if a ship is insured in lowsec thus insured by a lowsec insurance company away from concord oversight what possible reason could stop them from paying out insurances
this idea is almost as dumb as the let people double their training time with plex idea
its the same pend insurance company and irl insurance companies wont pay or will charge more if you make too many claims fail irl anologies dont work and none are necessary its just how it is
i do like the idea of having fw involve more pvp  especially small gang stuff however the problem with rewarding kills too much is a potential exploitpeople may just get an alt in the opposing faction and kill them in an insured t1 ship over and over again this is why any such per kill proposals will have to be very limitted
seems reasonable
no no no i still cant spell the name of my tooncause i didnt have clue when i made my first toon and though a french name was rpish and nice for a gallenteseriously though how about just not being stupid and getting infected instead of making it a hassle to log in for the rest of usbut as long as it is optional i dont mind paranoid people being able to have all kinds of login security how about some keycard for those that want
omg is that is like the most stupid thing ccp did lets jeopardise the security measures that we worked so hard to implement i mean srsly fix it
i vote against because the more ccp realizes that their cheap crappy facebook ripoff is a piece of  the better if a company loses all their customers because they fail to listen to the customers they deserve the loss ccp constantly ignores their customers especially with spacebook and for that they deserve whatever losses they get
you meant the first line as something that already existi never had to enter a character name anywhere which is lucky since i cant spell it it logs in as the oldest character in the account then there is drop down list or you can set another one as defaulteven if this is something that actually exist you could always get all the names by just using the details to log into the game or the account management pages how would eve gate have changed anything and this doesnt even sound like a security feature in the first place cause  just a posting character choice  it would be ed if it was intended for security to be honest 
i cant imagine that this would be an easy change to implement and i dont see it being worthwhile enough to justify serious coding time no thanks
actually there is a fov slider ccp screwed us on dominion and changed our fov to this teeny tiny wedge so planets would look bigger at the expense of being able to see whats going on and causing sea sicknessctrlrightclickleftclickdrag leftrightso simple how could anyone miss it
wow thats messed up not only can i not control vertical and horizontal fov separately it is not mentionaed anywhere and is very dificult to control in this way can we just get a freking slider making shapes on my screen not distorted does sound like a worthwhile time spending
this tbh
i hear that corporations cant fly ships train skills or talk in chat channels either stop the oppression
all of these seem pretty good mind you id wager that 23 of buddy accounts are actually alts but these seem good for the other third
just an idea while i was missioning would it be a good idea for ccp to add a menu  preset option for dronesyou could check up to 3 boxesfrigates crusiers battleshipsso you didnt have to micromanage drones when you deploy themmight be going down the path of omgwtfbbq your making the game too easy no interaction etc but it would be a nice feature imo
omgwtfbbq your making the game too easy no interactionyou gave the perfect argument for your idea but still went through with posting it why
i feel such a feature would improve the gameplay at least during mind numbing times as missioning which brings me to tears as it istroll much
yeah id be cool with something like this weve needed a better drone ai since forever and manual target priorities seems a good way of doing that
theres no shame in not understanding eves ui ive been playing since 2006 and theres still parts that elude me
still need your support guys please give these ideas a thumbs up

its not fair but its a good reason dont help a kos
yes
this change has been needed for a while now
i understand that eve has lots of pvp in it thats fine but a lot of players dont like that and should be able to not participate in it without being griefedworld of warcraft has separate pve and pvp shards servers but the probelm is that if you decide you like pvp but youre on a pve server then you cant switch to a pvp server if eve has a pve server there should be switching between it and the pvp server if ccp doesnt want to allow switching thats fine but the bottom line is that a lot of paying customers like pve and we dont want to deal with extortion and wardecs in a game that we pay for
among other problems eve style pvp is unsustainable all the carebears who produce anything will move to pve server and the old server will die as pvpers kill themselves off to extinctionmeanwhile pve server would be flooded with all kinds of materials as there is only faucet and not enough drainwhat you wanted already exist in theory highsec although it doesnt actually work stuff like wardec compromised this supposed safety not sure why ccp would come up with highsec at all then intentionally sabotage it by adding in wardecs they are certainly losing a lot of noobie subscription over it the griever subscription cant make up the numbers they drive away by a long shot but oh well their problem
1 go back to wow2 join pve server3 4 profit
there are a number of issues with your proposal in my opinionfor starters one of eves strengths is the single server setup it allows the game to be far more dynamic than other mmos nearly all of which are forced into having static worlds because the multiple servers would be pulling the overarching story in too many directions for it to be coherent anymore it also fosters a far more involved community as individualcorp reputations star system sovereignty changes weird occurrences etc carry far more weight and are ingrained into the fabric of the community as a whole in ways that are not possible in wow or ddo splitting the player base by adding a second live server would ruin the storytelling abilitysecondly as mentioned before a pve server will tend to attract the part of the eve community that actually makes the pvp possible the pve aspect of eve the miners the manufacturers the salvagers hackers pure carebears much as i hate the term who in their own ways provide the replacements to all those frigates and battleships the pvp community loses in alliance warfare and kamikaze runs in highsec and the pvp is what creates a market for all those pve services if and when all the pve players go to the pve server youre putting a hardline separation between supply and demand leading to the original server that is starved for ships and equipment and the new server that has all the items and no one to sell them toforgive my hyperbole but i think that such a move would actually kill eve online i cant support a proposal that could do that so blatantly
this game is not pvp nor pve so having alternate servers would destroy this concept the basis of eve is the delicate knifes edge balance between pvp creating demand and pve creating supply the supply and demand economics are so well balanced that every change has to be carefully analyzed before being implementedat first i wanted a split server as well while that may work for games like world of grindcraft it will not work for eve this game is playercentric whereas other games are more story or combatcenterednot supported
this person is obviously a troll he has nine posts total all of which are making proposals that no sane eve player would seriously consider everyone would do well to just ignore him
spice missions up a little bit a faction spawn here a strange rat there maybe a special npc pirate who tries to disrupt your mission this would keep eve interesting for those of us who have already ran every mission a dozen timesplus faction rats would keep nullsec iskmaking in check by lowering the value of faction modules
spicing up mission is fine and there are already leads of great ideas on these forums how to do this randomising the missions to some degree is one of the proposals you can go add your ideas to themthere is already a chance of getting faction drops from certain missions and i dont really see any reason to increase them each activity area and profession has different set of items that gives value to that areaprofessionactivity if you start to give valuable items in a easy to grind missions on a regular basis it loses that value very fast if you really want to get those rare items on your own without buying them the option is there to go do those same activities others do to get those rare drops
nullsec corporations are flooding the market with isk gotten from highvalue plexes and highvalue beltrats however since it takes good pvp skills to hold nullsec space nullsec empires often have poor logistics because not many people in them can mine this wasnt a big problem before the tyrannis loot drop nerf but now they have no minerals with which to make shipsif ccp removed the bounties from nullsec rats then mission runners wouldnt get shafted for once because there would be less inflation but nullsec corps wouldnt get shafted either since they could actually have ships to fight each other with
this proposal doesnt take into account that these nullsec sources need to provide an income for each individual and nullsec empires have the best logistics the current system allows most kinds of players to make a good living there the mineral composition was changed to provide better for their mineral needs and they can always compress minerals and jump them to nullsec from other areas inflation cant be a reason to do this since it doesnt seem to actually exist not to mention if you want to reduce the amount of isk produced high level missions are just as bad as killing nullsec rats if not worse you seem to be trying to solve a problem that doesnt existnot supported
if ccp decides to retain lowsec agents maybe they can prevent players below 50 from using them then it needs to make them useful to people who arent in corporations that control lowsec mission hubs no automatic concordokken but it would make lowsec more appealing to mission runners since we would have a chance to survive when a player pirate attacks us in our dungeonbasically these navies would have a jam strength proportional to the systems truesec and would only come after a minute or so of fighting in 4 or almost two or three minutes in 1 the navies would not do any damage player pirates would still be able to kill targets especially if they use teamwork to overwhelm a target but mission running would actually be possible in lowsec without joining a dominant player corporation that controls a lowsec hub
the game for you
im against adding more of these forced npc mechanics that limit players and eve if this is what you wan you can always stay in highsec since allowing people to keep playing their own style seems to be important to you the solution to this issue is to develop mechanics that allow players to make the systems they control more secure they could also develop mechanics that make antipirating work better basicly these npc mechanics should be kept to a minimum so adding more should be avoidednot supported

1 oh right because low sec pirates would never ever attack a pve player right 2 oh okconsequence which is more severe than risk because its a 100 chance u lose your ship amazing how idiots like u use risk simply because the consequence is really worse than risk and whats wrong with worthless gear here in eve gear  winning moron seriously go back to wow if u wanna keep your welfare epics1 well lowsec is lowsec and i think lowsec is fine for the most part i dont have a problem with it and i dont go through there unless im prepared that should be true for anybody2 i already have my own gear but it would be pointless to take out a pirate because his stuff is worthless what would i get out of attacking a pirate nothing it would be a net loss 95 of the time pirates target ships where they think they can get more out of it than they lose assuming that they arent just bored and what the heck does wow have to do with anything you seem to know a lot more about it than i do1 correct me if i am wrong about kill rights i have 30 days to track down and kill the pirate who destroyed my ship but i have honestly never seen anyone who attacked me again in that timeframe that i recognized so kill rights are relatively worthless in my eyes2 right outlaw  red i thought that was clear in my original post that i understood that thus the reason for wanting to shift the limits for when pirates become outlaws yeah well that is the way it was i preferred it but there werent enough antipirate players to actually be effective i think the idea is that concord would bring a giant task force if a pirate blob were to form infinite tank for example especially if they lose a ship to a blob i am not looking to nerf concord into uselessness i just dont like the current system i think its really lacking i was more looking at giving the pirates a chance to evade certain death at least then they might fit a ship worth losing a ship for if nothing else then you would have a riskreward ratiomy suggestion actually does buff pirating in highsec so i am surprised that my suggestion is viewed as screwing over pirates i really thought the station huggers would have been the ones to object but instead im called a station hugger
1 u said that suicide gankers should be punished even more simply because they target pve players what difference does it make whether its done in high sec or low sec2 whats wrong with pirates picking targets if its no different than u not picking certain targets why is it only okay for u 3 some ppl here want high sec to be 100 safe so they can operate in complete safety just like in wow1 what u were describing in a previous post was the aggression timer and dont tell me u were blindly flying around with absolutely no clue where the pirate was 2 which once again goes to 1 u already wanted concord to be destroyable now u dont can u even make a proposal that actually works or r u just gonna keep twisting it to your convenience2 as long as concord is anything less than omnipotent it will turn into low sec because when players r given the opportunity to kill in high sec with impunity they have 1 of 2 options a babysit your whiny ass or b kill u for your whiny tears take a wild guess what theyre gonna do under this new system not even newbies would be safe as they would under the current systemin conclusion your fail proposal fails so miserably that after i pointed out that it would indeed buff pirating too much ure trying to rename it to a fail propirate proposal to save face way to goway to failagain but plz continue cause uve just made my dayagain
1 i dont think anyone should be punished pirating is a profession in eve even highsec pirating qualifies as such2 i dont have a problem with pirates picking targets pirates since their inception have preyed on merchant ships while running from antipirate warships the differentiation is that they have a riskreward ratio to work out whereas an antipirate has zero reason to proactively stop a pirate they get all of the security penalties ship loss etc with a negative payoff3 i think i was asking for highsec to be more risky for both pirates and station huggers the whole highseclowsec 54 cutoff is just too abrupt for both parties1 apologies if i wasnt more clear i think the aggression timer should be longer yes i think i did mention that but if you are a good pirate and can elude long enough to get to lowsec unfortunately concord doesnt allow anyone to stay alive to make the outlaw tag upon the inception of violence meaningful either 1 i think that there is a big difference between making concord instapop anyone and making them a highsec rat if a bunch of pirates start to blob then yeah there are no players that are likely to try engaging them so as soon as concord loses a ship then absolutely making concord invincible would be a valid game mechanic i havent twisted anything you brought up a scenario and i elaborated i still dont think that concord should be able to instapop any ship they dont like but if you destroy one of their ships then you and your gang better be heading for the exit2 you are sadly quite right im afraid im not sure what the outcome of my idea would be but it could make things worse for sure which only sucks because it completely eliminates legitimate pirating outside of lowsec which is seriously uninteresting and creates the current suicide ganker activities which are really quite stupid no reallife pirate would consider this a positive nor workable strategy
this thread is now officially open for comments and discussion you are all now welcome to post your thoughts
comments this seems pretty easy to abuse because you can have 50 people in stilettos hit 50 systems simultaneously if someone comes you do what you can to hold them down amarr are most susceptible to this since they have the most systems i somehow doubt this will limit blobbing because youre essentially telling 250 people where you are but the npcs really do  everything up and i really dislike the whole shoot it and rep it cycle that happens in 00well i support the removal of those npcs so carry onliang
very well expressed proposal and i think its a sentiment that the vast majority of subscribers sharewhile new shiny features capture some game press and perhaps cause a few new subs and resubs temporarily the game already offers a vast range of different experiences that potentially appeal to a wide audience have pride in what you have already made and refine and polish it until it truly shines

1any chance ccp will comment on this
i have to 100 agree to this in my honest opionion it would also help ccp eve is a great game but i think it would attract more players if more of the features would just reach the excellence ccp is preaching
while i agree with this i imagine what this game will become with all the future developmentbecause this game is a world and something is still missing in it from a theoretical point of view so it actually needs new featuresbut from the perspective of a player i cannot disagreee with the op imho ccp should assign permanently a scrum team for every one of these areas improving all ui combat ui corp management ui pos management fix the damn lag and once you did it dont mess with it again at least call for a mass testing before if you did this for dominion release you would have warned before doing such a bad move game design on factional warfare game design of 00 sov warfare about treaties and a mechanic that encourages smaller engagements avoiding lag game design on improving lowsec and generally balancing the revenue of 00lowsechighsec game design on general rebalancement of ships and weapons there should be some sticked threads in the feature and ideas discussion like the one abathur did discussing all these aspect where ccp devs discuss with usits clear that rebalancing lowsecempire will make someone unhappy we had a lot of mission runners whine and any change to 00 warfare will make some 00 guy cry but that must happen and a better ui and lagless game are due so thumbs up
hell yeh
anybody who wants anything good for eve online must support this proposali have a nagging feeling that it is a very specific person or group of people who at fault for this unhealthy development and that they properly have been caught up in routine and fancy slogans and are having a hard time to sit back and reflecti also have a feeling that incarna is a momentous task to pull off and with all the promises and future possibilities it will provide it needs to be delivered pretty soon but when that task is done it is my hope that all 2011 expansions will be about adding to and fixing old stuff
im new to this community but even i find the game needs refininement in many areas supported

i totally agree in fact i wouldnt mind if i dont see a new expansion in the next 2 years if the current game would be brought to excellence
i support this strategy
i support this i am relatively new in the eve perspective of things and we dont need massive amounts of new content in each expansion the learning curve for eve is already like climbing everest all of the details need to be ironed outsignedthis game is alot of fun and quite addictive but we need more updates fixing the existing content

lets give destoryers a chance
link the devblog or gtfo they have talked about mybe pulling them for years but they have not and will not why becouse its not realy a problem and two they cant find a good way to realy do this so its never going to happen they my think or talk about it here and there for 8 more years to come but i would not bet on it happening any time soon
you shouldnt be angry towards strangers you should meditate and find peace in yourself before wondering around forums its good for karmaand stress levelsif you did read this topic then you would seen a link and by watching video linked you would come to realization that you are wrongsecond you are not forced to post in this topic you did that with your own free will and because this topic is not about should they or whenbut howat least pretend that you know about subject before starting an argument
first would you mind reading the thread before you go off flaming
i support the removal of learning skills many a newb has been turned off by the common yet false perception that you need to train learning skills first to get anywhere in the game removing learning skills gets newbies faster into flying ships and having fun retaining their interest in the game
i wish ccp could implement this change already players coming from other games are inclined to think sp  levels and always think they are forced to train learning skills in order to catch up with veteran players the real problem is training learning skills dont help you do anything fun in the game and that is when many new players leave
are you kiding me this video man you could cut a video from every time they touch on the subject of newbies and learning skills and that was what in 2009 were havle way though 2010you got to see its the same old song and dance it ant going to happen anytime soon
you know in the life of a game where wis has been a planned expansion for 4 years and it took 2 years for the latest nano nerf to hit 1 year isnt so long hell its only 2 expansion cycles for a problem they admitted was difficult to solve  mostly because sticks in the mud like you want people wasting time with learning skills instead of jumping right into the gameliang
forgot to support this earlier
in case i didnt support this yet
this would be a most welcome improvement
same here  needs to be implemented right away
yep another simple but useful tweak to the ui
supported
no brainer
supported
the more ui improvements the better making it common sense based makes it a slamdunk
i dont know that im fully onboard with every detail of the proposal but i do agree we should have a way to scan down wrecks themselves or perhaps the mission beacons
could we get the ability to scan anchored cans as well  even if they were the hardest things to scan and require more skillsi would love to go looking for peoples anchored can depots in wormhole space setup ambushes or blow up the cans and take whats insideedit wanted to add my thumbs up and support for this proposal
while i would like the salvaging profession expanded in multiple ways including with the ability to scan down wrecks i would rather support a dual wreck timer approachone timer min 1 hour max 2 where wrecks would be unprobeable until it had deteriorated enough for probes to find it and a second timer until the wreck would disappear completely lost in the void of space like the current timer do
no go for this i dont want my escalations in 00 to be scanned by some hostiles passing by and you can not choose the place of escalation maybe only abandoned wrecks blue should be scanable hmm
as someone born irl on towel day i must support this topicgive us towels darnit
i recently noticed that loot from missions is almost nonexistent while pirates used to drop large guns they now drop scrap metal why play eve if my playstyle gets nerfedanyway i understand miners not being able to make isk but theyre mostly macros anyway and they dont risk anything except the occasional suicide gank whereas some missioners like my corpies and i go up against hordes of pirates with ships valued in the hundreds of millions of isk
you dont read patch messages do you there was a whole blog about why they did this they did this to nerf your income and to lower the amount of minerals being gained from missions just like theyve been doing for years
hisec mission runners are mostly isk farmers anyway and they dont risk anything
a skill that reduces the timer by 1 hour per level would do it give it some heavy prequisites like infomorph psychology v  cybernetics v
people can still escape instantly even with a month timer if they havent jumped yet
shooting asteroids in a missionany other offensive act against any npc entity in a deadspace pocket unless it is vital for the mission for it to be otherwise attacking wormholessrsly ccpapplying any sort of electronic warfare or other nondamage dealing agression to stationary structures in high security space i apply a warp scrambler to a station or hit a gate with ecm burst why would concord give a crap relevant threadsif i tell my drones to assist a guy and he agresses me currently we both will get concorded that should not happen
seems utterly reasonable to me i cannot think of any reason that these actions should give so much as a sec hit let alone concord aggro
crap fair point youre right i hadnt thought about clustering on multiagent hubs being an issue  i was thinking about clusters on q18 agents in 05 or similar id also assumed n was a fairly generous number for the typical player but of course its minmaxers and macroers whod plump for multiagent systemsas an aside but using the same logic are we also in favour of mining belts becoming dynamic and ratting too
no insurance company in the world would pay you if it was proven you drove into that tree deliberately and i dont think there is any live insurance that covers suicide
this you people that go afk in a system like that should be punished for lagging the servers p but anyways people that bomb in high sec do get punished its called sec status some people dont use throw away alts  anyways just build better afk tanks p the agent
supported but this needs to come with high and low slot bikini modules as wello
thumbs up
i support but i would like to make a amended i say we can have a choice between the pillow or a kitty that will sit with us in our pods it can get pretty lonely in the black tell me what chea think fly safe o7
supported want hellcats to have pillows to fight with
i will trade pillows for sammiches
snowballs and frozengoods containers to keep them til next xmashow about pillows for valentines instead
i support this product andor service3 hellcats
i bet we get another useless shuttletype ship
i regretfully cannot support this because it would conflict with my support for faction towelsi will also note that towels especially when wet have a higher damage multiplier than pillows they also track better
supportedcan we have waterbombs for the summer too
supported as long as no hellcats are wearing shirtspants during this festive event
so 25 battleships try to gank my providence freighter i order my first escort to let off his then i order my second escort to let off his ecm burst exactly four seconds later every fraction of a second counts during suicide ganksthe result my freighter was saved as the escorts were not in a fleet with me concord arrived and destroyed all of the battleships my alt had my freighter webbed so i was able to warp out from the drones not too soon afterthe problem my escorts were also killed by concord for using ecm bursts i couldnt give a rats ass if the pirates lost 25 insured battleships for nothing i dont know who they are ill probably never see them again either my problem is my corp members dying to defend me from a suicide gank since this game tries to mimic reality in many ways economical political etc it would make sense that concord would understand the need to use ecm bursts when your under attack by a suicide blobproposal allow a defending playerfleet use ecm bursts near gates and stations without being attacked by concord
it will be hard for you to define defending in a fight because your ecm bursting ships are effectively attacking aswellbut i have to ask you this  you have 3 ships with you 2 ecm bursting ships and your alt with the web and you jumped through a gate with mostlikely 20 battleships sitting on the other side before sending in a scout to check the other sidea smart move would have been to dock upsafespot with the freighter and wait for the gate to clear after your scout reported a bs gang sitting on the other sideso  not supported if ecm burst will be allowed in highsec without concord interference we will see a lot of griefing with it
please attach a detailed algorithm which determines in which circumstances a ship counts as a defending ship then prepare to get criticized on the impracticality of your algorithm as it will undoubtedly open the door for a multitude of exploits
when your aggression timer goes up after being attacked this would only apply at gates and stations as well
its because your burst also hits other random people at the gate the gate itself and possibly the billboard too you cant configure an ecm burst to hit only aggressive people you have regular jammers for that
sure its actually pretty easy if any person in range has a lock or is attempting to get one but does not have a gcc then you get a gcc not that i support the op but what you asked for is pretty easyliang
you know what im going to say who cares its not like its really affecting the random people around you remember this only applies to gates and stations it cant even damage anyone unlike smartbombs regular jammers arent going to stop a 2030 battleship gangagain im going to emphasize for the third time this would only to apply to areas around gates and stations an ecm burst wont bother anyone not involved in the combat near gates and stations it doesnt knock you out of warp or prevent you from warpingand to darius do you really think organized suicide gankers sit at a gate with 25 people for a scout to see them do you have any idea how the suicide gankers work
ecm burst isnt just targetting everyone with an agression flag it is area of affect you hit everyone and everything in the radius of the ecm burst so you deserve to get punished by concordyes most of the time they sit on the gate when you jump through they dont just warp in right after you jumped because then you would be gone with a webbed freighter so if you altcorp mate jumps through he should see 2030 bs on the gate and shout dont jumpyou warp your freighter back to a stationplanetsafespot and wait when you need the ecm burst you already failed at hauling and have to use the last resort safety guardi fly regularly through uedamasivala niarjamadirmilire or the deltole pipe so trust me i know how freighter suicide ganks work
as long as the ecm bursting character only hits corpmates and people with a gcc then he wont get concorded you just need to be more careful about who is in your aoe
and that is almost impossible to do when you want to break lock from all battleships which are sitting right at the gate to be in range where ever the freighter appears so you will hit the gate atleast and get gcc for that
the issue here is that ecm is a defensive measure it causes no damage and has no effect other than to break the lock one ship has on another so someone please explain to me how that counts as aggression unless you are targeting someone you have no way of knowing that you were even hit with an ecm burst besides the graphic effectsi think its perfectly reasonable to allow the use of defensive measures to protect assets isnt there a favorite saying of all those who fancy themselves to be real hardasses something like concord is there to punish not protect if thats the case then players should be allowed to take the protection part of the equasion into their own hands and use ecm in the us military we have our rules of engagement but no matter what the rules are for a given situation one line remains the same always the right to self defense will never be denied to me punishing people for using ecm is tantamount to being told that if you walk down a dark street and get jumped by 10 armed men you have to sit there and take it because using pepper spray to blind them see what i did there is a crime because it could harm someone else or get it all over the sidewalk and buildingsi already know someone is going to come back with you can use directed ecm already yeah great that allows you to break the lock on 1 ship in a 10 fleet and you have to deal with lock time the gankers also have the option of using eccm to counter so dont  about it being unfair i will support this with the stipulation that the cycle timers on ecm bursts be increased from 30 seconds to 90 seconds or more
1 ecm bursts already suck enough outside of some extremely limited use cases hell id be 1 to letting you fit as many ecm bursts as you wanted again i already answered how to make the aggression problem go away you only get aggression if you have 
sounds reasonable but people will use it to grief mission runners and stuff  on alts in highsec wars it might be more reasonable if it didnt provoke concordsentry gun response but on the other hand did flag the person using the ecm burst to whatever targets they hit and if you couldnt be ecm bursted by 5 ships continously
i think the solution is not being about to attack or get gcc from gatesbillboards they are the usual culprits if you set off ecm busts with a bunch of people around tough luck you should get gcc for using an aoe on random innocents
supported assuming it can be implemented to nearby gates only there is no reason for passersby to lock anything at a gate so it wouldnt affect them and there is no new possibility for grieving opening up the only side effect would be on wardec highsec gatecamps but who cares about them
if the proposal is aoe weapons versus gates and other npc structures dont cause a concord response then yes ecm affects the outcome of combat so should always be considered an offensive act when used against players
well thats the whole point really if youre randomly hitting neutral people with negative effects in highsec youre going to get concorded if you want to avoid that fate dont attack random people
yeah that is sensible
fixed
supporting my own topic
walking in stations is the most useless idea everjust use alts in other corps or leave and drop an alliance there are many ways to get around wardecs
will two pilots with exactly same skill points in same areas and same skills fight the same combat  pvp base on spif not why not allow players to skill up fasterthis game should be more than just sp i was told that this game is meant for multiplay that is why skill training q only allows up to 24 hours planning
instead of replying in character could you try replying in englishquoting nothing then talking nonsense and lots of it does not helpsimply learning skills do not determine the final sp gain rate they merely contribute to it if ccp want to take them away its no problem because they have more software that will determine the final sp gain rate and it will be exactly what it is today there that was easy wasnt if only you actually knew what you were on about compared with what you typed this would have been so much more funbecause if it isnt its veteran cry time and we know this because if anybody suggests changing the sp gain rate theyre crying like why you are here nowto pretend that the secret cabal of millionaires is about to destroy evedo we know who they are do they have a guest spot on cable tv rampant millionaires club or somethingare they famous these millionaires who are just waiting to end eve with infinity sp are they movie stars oil barons drug dealerswho are they who are these multi billionaire shadow warriors just waiting to end our favourite land of make believe come on out with itso come on sp increase haters who are these millionaires waiting to end eve and why arent they buying every character on the bazaar
i dont do pi but i doubt you need such an accessible button for it it should be removed from the selected item menu or at least moved away from the warp to buttonpeople spam the warp to button to save pods they dont need it next to a button that forces a loading screen
this was brought up alot on the sisi forums needless to say they apparently like it there edit i dont think it needs to be removed though just move it over where it belongs beside the eyeball button
moving it more to the right would probably be a good ideadid you try to report this as a bug might give a faster turnaround

while we are at it can we move the show info one or two down from the start conversation while you are at it
an option to turn off that background chanting in amarr stations im not sure if it happens in other faction stations but and option to turn it off would be great it doesnt go away if you turn music all the way down in audio settings it only goes away if you turn off all audio which makes you miss out on the other awesome inspace soundssome may like it which is why im proposing an option rather than eliminating it entirelythanks
sounds good on paper and in game at least allow us to be responsible of our bombs  bubbles rather than preventing it
highsec bombs you do realize concord wont show up in time to shoot them unless theyre already there right i can see this making jita more interesting
actually its even worse until the bomb detonates the player hasnt committed a crime so concord wont shoot anything even if they are on site
itd be nice if they were allowed in low sec but to what you suggested no way devastating highsec with random bomb launching greifers loosing relatively cheap ships would cause more problems then the t1 insurance causedi can guarantee you id be on that boat in a flash and just launch a bomb at jita cam purely for the giggles imagine someone or some corp whos actually dedicated to greifing
like i said if concord see a bomb it gets blown up so places naturally not camped by concord will have have their bomb hit such as planets moons asteroid belts generic spots in space complexes etcjita while would be amusing the odds of bombs causing a problem would be slim unless you somehow convince everyone to warp to you at a planetatm bubbles and bombs cant be used in low sec  hi sec but if you try to click you get an odd reason this is very un eve like tbh allow it so concord get ed if you use bubbles  bombs even if they dont harm anyone
as much as my covops 5 self would appreciate this no i appreciate the differences between 00 and lowsec liang
there are already shortcuts the default is shiftfx shiftaltfx and shiftctrlfx for the topmidbottom row respectively still it would be nice if the indicator was more pronounced and a keyclick shortcut added
would like to see the entire module state halo changed  greenred activedeactivating no overload orangeyellow activedeact overloadednot sure about keymouse combo  would prefer dual button so pressing leftright button activates module and overheats or overheats if already active deactivating module or right clicking on module with overheat on will turn it off
hmmmi like the idea of having a modifierkeyclick option to toggle overload right now i tend to rightclick and use the menu just because i miss with the mouse too muchsome other overload issues that need discussion there is no confirmation that you have actually toggled overload until the start of the next cycle possible solution the small green overload arc segment could turn yellow to indicate what state the module will be in at the start of the next cycle ie green  it will be off yellow  it will be on in the overheat of battle the difference between small green arc segment overload off and small bright green arc segment overload on is sometimes easy to miss esp for those of us with old tired eyes possible solution the pulsing halo around each module button green  on red  deactivating could be expanded to include yellow overloaded once you have turned on overload you are committed to 1 cycle  you cant turn it off until it actually activates this is a similar issue to allow reactivation of accidentally deactivated modules csmi am sure other people have suggestions and comments  get them in and if a reasonable consensus can be reached ill submit it for consideration at an upcoming csm meetingbest trebor
definitely supported ive mistakenly clicked or failed to click that sliver of a button too many times to count
i agree with every one of these points
definitely signed  my dream would come true 
im always for ui improvementslax
nothing more annoying than having something that deserves a big red panic button be more of a tiny sliver the skill of using overheat is more in being able to click the button and less knowing when to click it
can we lift the 80 limit on blocked contracts there are more than 80 scammers in eve everyones alt on every account has 5 public scammer contracts up for some items scammer contracts outnumber real ones its annoying to scroll past all those scammer contracts every time you check for an item
block limit is a fail
supportedeven an option to exclude contracts below a user defined value would be a welcome addition
this actually an option already have fun with it
my corpies and i just got decced and have to stay docked for a week we pay for eve so why cant we play a game that we pay money for its one thing to pvp in lowsec and nullsec and the occasional suicide gank is fine but nonmutual wardecs should at least not apply in 8 and higher so that we can actually mine during a dec well make less isk but thats the price we pay
no if you dont want to be picked like lowing hanging fruit dont be low hanging fruit
negatory morning glory in fact i propose that they reverse the alliance p nerf liang
qft
ha ha ha ha ha
there
an idea came to me while slacking off at work just now that i think would be extremely successful and making 00 return to a bit of gang warfare would be to reduce the respawn rate of rats by a great deal and to reduce the rate at which roids respawnreduce the amounts of themi think this would make it extremely difficult for mega alliances to sustain themselves and would cause more small gang pvp if two alliances that are next to each other are having trouble sustaining themselves i think this would either cause them to shrink in size as an alliance or expand outward war deccing everyone around thempossibly add more mission contacts in low sec maybe even in 00 which could in term buff low sec as welli think there should still be some sort of draw to 00 so maybe make it so t2 ships  cap ships etc require special stuff from 00 idkhaving to keep this short and it probably will not be well thought out as im at work but just an idea that couldnt hurt
this doesnt even make sense how does forcing 00 players to have mission altswhich a lot of them do anyways break up power blocs
i dont think it forces them to have mission blocks the original idea which i portrayed poorly and the mission suggestion was just a suggestion i was giving to support my current idea it wouldnt have to be the way i listed at all but maybe make the max size of an alliance depend on how much space they own the more pilots they have the more space they have to have or they must stay smalleridk just rambling i guess
fail cat is fail if anything rats and mining is the only reason small gang warfare exists in 00 if alliances had to rely on that income more than say moon gold there would be even more miningratting and even more reason for small gangs to roam
yes supported gimp the russianswhile most individual income in sov null come from plexes 237 macroratting is big for corps well some corps anyway something along the lines of drastically decreasing spawn frequency but increase bounty and drop rate would gimp macroratters big while benefit legitimate ratters
what are you on about you know there are these things called moons from which material for t2 construction comes
do you understand t2 or cap production at all
im still a bit of a newbie player  but i think it would be kinda cool if evety once in a while  a random solar system security would fail concord tied up or somethingand for like 12 hours the security would hit like 4 or to 00would make things interesting not only for being stuck at a base but also needing to haul stuff from system to system you would have to watch more the securityany thoughts on this
only if it happens in jita
yes cause having all you industrial assets locked down in a station or your research poses suddenly free for attack would be so much fun  get out
interesting in theory but broken now if the sec status was to constantly fluctuate within the highlownull groupings and on a longer cycle including moon mins belt rats navy response concord response times etc that could be an interesting way to keep the landscape fresh probably more work than ccp would be willing to put in though it would help make the game more interesting which seems to be against ccp design philosophy these days
i am so tempted to support this
i see a few problems with this ideafirst if a high security system falls to lo or null sec people could jump capitals in and nothing forces them to leave second people could technically anchor starbases in a 10 system that falls to 3 or belowone bright side i see however bubble spam a gate and unless concord destroys them suicide ganking gets a whole lot easier and tears will flownot supported however
me too seriously good idea from sujanra but ultimately probably unworkable
youre not helpless try to fight hire mercenaries or go back to wowhowever though this seems like a good idea especially if cap bomber pos etc rules dont change when a systems sec is lowered i cant support it unless dynamic sec status drops were made a core part of the game since it would cause too much disruption
there is merit in the base idea no not the lulz partbut players influencing system security status would be an interesting angle to pursue not just in high sec but primarily low sec and even nullsec that way youd also be able to avoid hiccus along the lines of omg my stuff is now camped by mackinaws since things would evolve along the way
when you try to drop a bomb in high sec youre informed that concord law prohibits it if concord can lock modules like that why cant it lock aggressive modules against nonwar targets or noncan flippers
you know its just a thought but you dont actually have to make a new alt every time you want to spam these boards with troll threads in fact you dont even need to spam these boards you could go to features and ideas section and learn why everything you say is wrong
get out
this
because that would be a terrible game mechanic thats why
go awaynot supported
theres ecm bursts imagine if there were target painting modules i understand not having tracking disruption burst modules since that could hurt droneboats too much and sensor dampening bursts are rather pointless because bursts have a short range but target painters are the least useful ewar and definitely need a buff
i forgot to check the support boxvag
lol
so you want to take the two least useful ew modules and then mash them together so that you get the worst of both worlds brilliant why dont they fire defender missiles at cosmos agents while youre at it
tottaly supportedhaving eve with no aa is like going to a playboy mansion and having nothing but old ladies with saggie  there
the watch list is too small and its too easy to miss broadcasts i propose a skill which gives 5 people on the watch list per level for a total of 35 people on the watch list i dont care what the prereqs are even if its logistics 5 its fine
or instead of adding a pointless skill ccp could just make it so you could have like 50 people on the watchlist

last night i went to go build my first ship i loaded my mats and bp onto my badger and headed for the nearest station with an assembly plant having played for less than 2 weeks i didnt know rancer is a bad spot so i went to jump through therewell befor i even finished loading i had about 10 pirates on me my warp drive disabled and i was crawling well to put it short by the time i loaded up on the other side i was half dead and nothing could be done end result lost what iv been working on since starting and pod killed to boot all befor i even could react i propose that there needs to be an invulnerability timer once you jump this would allow unarmed ships a chance at survival and discourage huge gank fests at jumpgatesi fully understand the chances i take going into a 04 sec area and wholy accept what i have comeing to me if i get caught in the open but to not have a chance to load up let alone react before having my ship blown up seems like a rather poor design for any game and discourage new players from staying
first off this is the wrong subforum to post this read carefully in which forum you are about to create a new postregarding your issue feature exists its called gate cloak to progress in eve you need to be able to teach yourself and learn from your mistakes consider your badger loss a learning experience and move on try googling eve session change mechanics or eve gate cloak mechanics
welcome to eve
if you are reffering to the cloak you have on when you come out the other side of a gate then obviouslly the mechanic does not work since not only i but anyone that came through there was practiclly dead befor finishing loading but i am new so please enlighten me if you are reffering to something else
the cloak works you moved or something well you know except when you jump into a node with huge fleets and it takes 30 minutes to loadjust keep out of low sec until you learn the game you will be fine
yeah everyones talking about the gatecloak but in a system like rancer its probably pretty useless the gatecloak lasts 30 seconds and rancer grids are busy enough with smartbombs running 237 that a session change would easily take longer than that however in a badger youd have been lucky to get through even if everything ran perfecti dont think the solution is to add invulnerability timers though insteada better route setting tools  it should be easy for a rookie to tell if their route takes them through lowsec and the recent stats about those systems that info is collectable through the map but the map is awkward and slow even if you already know what youre doingb better navigation tutorials  the tutorials tell rookies to autopilot everywhere they go by default stargates do not even show up on the rookie overview once rookies learn how to navigate safely theyll be more likely to be successful in first lowsec travels and have less fear of itc clearer and better default autopilot settings  does anyone know exactly how these work the basic avoid lowsec setting with default security penalty will route you around 05s if possible and try to keep you as high sec as possible security penalty of 10 will send you through 05s but not into lowsec the way i figured this out i set a dangerous route and used trial and error why is the default setting not better and why is the default autopilot setting not avoid lowsec why do we have to go into the slow and useless map to access our autopilot settingstldr helping rookies be smarter about lowsec is better than game breaking new rules
better idea change it so that you are only spawned on grid if it has finished loading i think that should be not too hard to do i dont know if it would increase the server load though
there is no system in the game where going to the nearest factory sends you through rancer so whatever method you used to pick a destination was bad also the 30 second gate cloak timer is what you want did you have autopilot on or something
first of all the cloak last for 1 minute not 30 sec it is longer then the session change timeri am guessing the game cant tell the difference between lag and disconnects so if you did this you would be able never appear in a camp if you just shut down your client or pull the cablealso you emergency warp away anyway at least i always do on exceptionally slow loads so it would only make a difference for cloakies in camps large enough to lag you out ie no chance of running back to gatehow about fixing the lag instead so a grid loads in less then a minute
not true ive gone through rancer a few times in the past month and havent seen a soul
drake its a good solid ship that is easy to fly that is it if every idiot and his dog flies it because its easy does not mean that its op
one thing that i have been waiting for a good long time are some kind of logs or security in pos sma maybe add a log file section that directors of the corp can access or maybe even beter have similar password security that is on the gsc on ships in he sma the corp maybe have to pay more for the added security for the smas but it is much needed and shouldnt be too hard to implement
have a rating system where people can rate their market experience with other players similar to ebay you can filter out people in local based on this rating this will not eliminate scamming entirely but it will save other players time by us not having to look as closely at contracts since most of the scams will be filtered outthis will also make loan contracts actually useful since you could say something like he paid back the loan or he was a good lender thumbs up
please stop posting ideas here already try the features and suggestion forums see which ideas people like and then maybe bring them here you post tons of ideas and every single one of them bad
even if this were implemented itd break down instantly id get a bunch of alts to thumbsup my scammer character then scam with a positive reputation you could allow people who havent traded to set ratings with someone but then scammers would just rate down genuine traders solely to poison the rating system even if this was a good idea  and its not  it wouldnt work
it could work if there are some restrictions on ratings make it so that only those who traded with the toon with public contracts above a certain isk value can rate contract feestaxes on those high value trades would act as deterrent for spamming fake ratings through large amount of fake tradesor it could be a public rating from specific watchdog groups there is already a jitascammer watch corp basically ppl with too much time on their hands how they keep watch on that comainducing soup of jita local is anyones guess
whats to stop asshats like you the op from making altstoons and friends from giving you false positivesthink before you speakyoull live longer maybe not
looks good with gooses modification not sure how easily it can be implemented but there is no downside since it cant be easily faked
a would be scammed by again
i think the troll has run enough a 1week forum gag would do fine
this is outrageous nobody gagged ankh when she said she wanted to ban highsec wars and shes a csm
sweet jeebus yes its a pain to have to avoid certain threads just because of the banal crap that a certain op posts
monsieur picard this is a proposal to the csm not a request to ccp as it was the same for ankhs proposalsyour disagreement is noted and acknowledged the outcome will however be determined by the people of eve good luck to you i guess
thanks us pveers should be allowed to have a voice too just because the pvp crowd disagrees with us doesnt mean we shouldnt be allowed to post
considering how he is reacting i support thisone less idiot to watch post trashedit apparently i didnt edit my post fast enoughbut my point remains this is getting out of controla warning is not enough
oneweek ban yeslifetime ban noget real thats way too harsh for a days worth of trollingedit i went through and read all his posts and whoa but still not bad enough for a permaban
its not because youre a pveer its because your posts are so awful you make spacejeebus cry you sound like youre on trial account most of the time you are so clueless as to how things work anyone can come up with ideas that would completely break the game and this week anyone is you imagine if everyone just spouted every halfbaked idea they could think of the good ideas would be lost in an ocean of mediocrity have less mediocre ideas and then maybe people wouldnt pour on the hate so much
just start reporting him i do believe spam is frowned upon in the forum rules but other then that supported the dudes a waste of timemaybe the csm should work on modifying the assembly hall rules to limit morons like emo tj here
whats outrageous is having to filter through the constant bull threads you continue to create
first i thought surely assembly hallfolk are overreacting then i read a few of his threads facepalmeither hes a terrible unamusing troll or just completely ed not to make a personal attack or anythingsrsly guise ban him at least a temp ban so he gets the picturetortugan is not amused
if we ban him can we also ban all the people that keep bumping his threads
much as i think hes the most pathetic troll ive ever seen  and if hes not then he is clueless in a way few people could ever dream of  we dont ban people for being morons stop feeding him and hope he goes away if you want to bring a csm proposal up on this topic heres one  let us give thumbs upthumbs down in threads without needing to post that way we can all collectively point and laugh without needing to bump his garbage
supporting both proposals
14 replies and only 7 supports this thread speaks for itselfquit trying to muzzle pveers

thanks ed
god yes
yes at the time of you posting this 9 people were stupid enough to support this personally rather than work on the myriad of existing issues and introducing new ideas into the game i feel that using the csms time with ccp in this way is optimalpathetic

this was a brilliant move on hydras part im sure they made out like bandits even despite the big lottery shutdown and they move on to the next part of the tournament in excellent shape to still possibly winbravo for being such an excellent example of what extent of strategic freedom is inherent in eve hydra
not supportedhire mercs learn to pvpgo play wow
that makes me consider the idea of somehow gaining skill points from pvping though i suspect lots of people would oppose the idea since eve is so unique in its skill point systemwhat would you think of some sort of skill system in addition to the current one maybe based around individual ships example if i fly vexors constantly i get a bonus to drone damage based on how much time ive spent flying them would that be a welcome addition or cause more trouble than its worth not sure i agree with you here as nice as it would be to escape from every fight increasing the likelihood of escaping fights means fewer opportunities for others to get killsa fair point but i think youre contradicting yourself you mentioned expanding lowsec as a possible solution in your first paragraph which is a viable possiblity it sounds like youre in support of certain changes but maybe not as fundamental as some of the ones ive suggested
until very recently insurance on t1 ships was actually higher than what you advocate was that sufficient to incentivize enough pvp in your opinion and if so have you actually noticed a significant difference in this short a period of time imo the only decent suggestion on how to do this ive heard is to transfer more of a ships value away from the hull and towards the modules so that they can drop itd be terribly complex to do without screwing everything up and the transition would be as bad for windfall profits as tyrannis was but itd do the trick at least in theory a simpler version might be to make mission rats salvage for less and pvp wrecks for more  the missioners wont like it but again its wealth that a pirate can get their hands on
other then the contentious learning skills the skill system is pretty damn good imo should definitely not award sps for anything done in game down that path lies madnessbut perhaps adding something along with pi that planets have to pay protectcia money or that there are reduced costumes charges for goods produced there for corps with a presence in the system or around the planet or perhaps one could stick them up and rob planets in low sec or a boost to the restricted goods aspect of the game which can be produced in low sec in order to smuggle to empireyeah pretty much im against changing any of the pvp mechanics to achieving your purpose really i think its more a low sec problem the it really s a pvp problem 00 has reasons to go out there empire has reasons to stay there the only reason to go out to low sec is to hurt people thats not actually an incentive to pvp that is pvp
theres just no good way to do this no one is going to stand and fight when there fairly confident there going to get there pods handed to them and there normaly right thats why they run
now if you scale loot with the number of participants so solo kills get you mostly everything something like 25 people is same as now and over 10 people on km practically nothing you incentivize small scale pvp and bc of larger fights yielding much less loot probably more stuff gets destroyed
thats a pretty damn good idea as difficult as it may be to implement risk vs reward and all that
while the insurance rates for t1 ships were high actually too high imo pretyrannis the insurance rates for t2 and t3 were and still are though slightly better now terrible think of it this way of the 3 tech levels of ship only the lowest most primitive one is viable to lose frequently in pvp if you open the door to more t2 and t3 ships by softening the loss then instantly the average player is able to field more competitive ships more frequently i do think there should always be options for people with tons of excess isk faction ships officer gear t2 rigs etc but i think that the vast majority of pvp ship t2 included should be cheap enough to lose occasionally without spending hours grinding for iskinteresting idea to transfer value to loot though that would still only benefit the winners of a given engagement it might be a viable option alongside some other changesi also like the salvaging idea but thats bordering into another discussion imo the salvaging profession needs some love make entrylevel salvaging less profitable and add skills to make expert salvaging more profitable
yes and no im not saying this is a perfect solution nor do i fully back it but one example of an incentive to stay and fight even if you knew you were going to lose could be a pvp experience based ship bonus system the more you fly a ship the better you get with it in that case along with insurance being cheaper it would be worth it to stay and fight maybe get a kill or two die and have a few more skillpoints for itthat said that system probably isnt viable especially since ccp seems perfectly happy with the current sp system what that idea is though is an example of an incentive to stay and die fighting im sure theres a viable incentive out there
not a bad idea i remember seeing that idea in another thread a while backi do however wonder whether people would start exploiting it by roaming around in larger gangs but delegating small squads of people to certain targets it would give them a disadvantage to not focus fire sure but not a very significant one
in a real world the only reason to stand up to a larger force is as a last stand 5 guys will never beat 300 and they are best off either harassing the edges or providing movement intel to other friendlies as in rl i think people fly in large fleets because it makes them feel like they are part of something bigger not because they are particularly fun small gang is much more fun to actually do 530 pilots but they arent provided the opportunities to do much more than hunt down other small gangsi think what you really want is a mission for small gangs to have an affect on the landscape where a defending force like a way for small gangs to disrupt sov and things like that there are posts running about that kind of stuff
they dont have to put npc min buy orders in to have a floor they could have just left the insurence be i think there is no dout that ccp wants the players to end up with full control of the markets and resoures all to are selfs to ruin or build as we see fiti dont like that ideal anymore then most goverments its going to screw alot of people over at some point with out regulationsmicro mining is the real world of slave labor theres just no way for an honest man that pays his employs a far wage can compete with that shi z
under eve insider  patch notes  in testingin developmentthe drawing board linkageit would be nice if ccp updated these a little more often im just curious as to what direction they are heading in and stuff and im sure others are as well
supporting my own thread
see who can blitz worlds collide the fastest or who can mine the most arkanor in a belt whizzing with npc pirates us pveers like to compete too and our playstyle is just as valid as pvp give us a tournament with unique ships as prizes so that we can show others what were worth
im a pver too but i cant thumbs up this one its just not the same brother as a side note the ships they had out are realy a jokethey cant use them with out a big target on there back and no way to replace them its mainly a trophe that one day will get blowen up or sold for lots of iskit would be about the same thing if they just handed the winers a crap load of isk and gave them a flasy title

1 goodthen quit trying to push a fail proposal that only upsets the balance of the game2 fixed in bold3 whats more risky than consequencesthats because its supposed to be a consequence to suicide gank not a risk if it was a risk1 then theyll just rr the dps from concord while still killing everything they want they have no reason to run when theres no instantkilling concord and why would they even bother destroying concord knowing its only gonna bring more enemy dps to them when they can already tank the current dps as is the only elaboration ure doing is trying to save facemiserably 2 no

nice ideas there would need to be fewer plexes necessary i think but make them take longer i agree that spamming plexes in small ships could be annoying noobship alts anyone easy to kill but not in 50 places at once thus make each plex take say an hour but only have on average 02 per system scale necessary victory points accordingly
plexing in fw is pvp not pve this is a common missconception with those who assume plex  pvegood thing we have plex restrictions to manage the engagement size and allow for fights even when one side is vastly outnumbered then why not use the plex size restrictions to get an engagement of a size you can handle npcs allow you to fight those blobs youre complaining about they are the solution to the problem you seethe npc ewar does require a rebalanceno it wouldntby removing npcs and messing with plex size restrictions you remove the very mechanic that allows you to fight blobs when the enemy is stronger for your timezonethis has needed fixing for a long timeplexing is already a pvp activity and fleets that plex are already fit for pvpit wont it will however remove all the mechanics smaller fleets have for managing themby removing the ability to use npcs as a force multipliersmartalready the case already the case so your suggestion is that the larger militia should have complete dominance and the smaller militia should have no tools for engagement size managementamazingly shortsightednot supported
not in the usual sense  unless theres an opposing pilot involved at most it might amount to poor market pvp for lp or standings gains or somethingwhat the hell are you talking about the npcs are the biggest deterrent to small scale pvp ive ever seen id rather camp gates for pvp than do plexes because plex npcs make it impossible to pvp freaking brain dead i swearthe only intelligent thing you said even still the plex npcs are a catastrophically stupid way to handle things and if one side is that outnumbered it might make sense that they loseliang
you must be talking about solo plexing in backwater systemswith fleet plexing the whole point is to choose plex for the pvpwhen the enemy outnumber you smallmedium plex can be used to force the enemy to ship downalso unrestricted plex can be used to engage larger fleets including capitals with the help of some npc dpsimpossible to pvp i can show you hundreds of fights where the plex have been the sole reason for a fight being at all possiblewhen the enemy is flying around in a 3040 strong bcbs fleet its the plex that allow your 1020 strong cruiser fleet to engageif you think plex somehow block the possibility of pvp then you really dont know how they workplex are a tool for the underdog to gain initiative and force the larger side to reactthey are a very important part of fw pvp which expand the fight beyond gates and stations
yes because thats the order of the ing day man if people want blobs they go to 00 if they want small gang  they goto low sec fw is in low sec q e ing d fantastic in my corp alone theres been thousands of potential fights that were avoided because we couldnt pvp inside fw plexes and missions ive seen two fw fleet this strong two ever ing ever come on now way to use the once in a decade argumentsno youre just out of touch with reality  the fleets simply do not form up the way youre suggesting it doesnt happen stop using it as an argumentno they arent theyre an impediment to pvp because it takes a dual logistics blob to go after a ing rifter in a plex lianged and yes im currently in the faction war and ive been in it before and when my pirate coalition gets to rolling we blast through amamakeauga and outnumber both militias
size restrictions on plexes is probably the only good thing about the whole fiasco called fw yes it means you have to have more stuff ready to fly but it beats the hell out of any alternativesnpc damage is beyond pitiful look at the mails even frigs out damage them on most mails the only issue with them is the ewar  that is what makes them troublesome for plex fighting aka the blob magnetizer would create insurmountable spam mail or channel would not serve to rally any more people than are already willingable and benefits numbers in pilots and systems significantly more than currentthere will be no change what so ever tons of frigs capturing every plex in sight run to next when enemy shows  will have zero impact on amount of pvp will be particularly grievous when there is a large number disparity between two sides as defensive squads can only cover so much ground1 how does this differ from the way things are today blobs means no fights the large fleet slugouts rarely if ever happen atinnearin relation to plexes2 how does this differ from the way things are today blob on call camping goddess knows what with frigates plexing 3 how does this differ from the way things are today blobs in fw are not necessarily bs the most frequent composition is frigatecruiser with a smattering of bs for damage  the heavy blobs only form when plexing is done and is a recreational tool  they have no impact on plexing what so everyou even mention the obvious course of action as a possibility  well guess what it will be the de facto standard operating procedure for everyoneblob on acceleration gates with single frig taking plex  or even better have the blob roam around an area while frigs plexes in constellation and call blob in to whatever system the defenders arrive in  impossible to counter as the one plex you may save is just one out of a dozen  you lose over timeyea strategy tactics and conviction has no place in war at all read up on the history of warfare and youll see what i mean  hell you only need to look at the us fight for independence to get the gist of it fw is tolerable because numbers does not equal iwin like it does in bloblandthere is no solution to fw unless you are willing to revamp the entire thing  the basic mechanic is what is brokennot supported the turd called fw cannot ever get the required shine regardless of how much polish is applied  revamp is only optionps the link to my thread from last year now locked due to age still my baby though
thank you all for your posts i recognize this is a pretty big change and needs to be considered carefully but i have thought this through quite a bit so before you write it off consider what i raise in light of your objections just to be clear i would not mess with the plex size restrictions this proposal does 2 things and 2 things only 1 remove npcs and 2 inform player militias of who is taking plexes where through a seperate channel the plexes would still have the same sizes i suppose i added 3 that plexes spawn throughout the day but i think this change has already been promoted by csm i am not denying that some pvp takes place during plexing i dont participate in it because it is done during down time but i hear it is great fun but the vast majority of pvp takes place outside of the plexing context what percent of fw pvp kills would you say take place in an occupancy plex i would guess 2 the plex restrictions make them an awesome system to prevent getting blobbed they are a great place to pvp yet they are almost never used for pvp why 2 reasons you have to hassle with npcs or have the enemy hassle with them  and they will often just say thanks but no thanks if i want to pve i will run a mission and 2 if you clear out the npcs who says anyone is even going to come in your plex you just sit there waiting i really think with my proposal you would see at least 50 of fw pvp occurring in plexes and it would be the same great small gang pvp you guys who are lucky enough to play during down time see liang im not sure i understand what you are saying you would do with 50 stillettoes if a stiletto is an a plex he needs to stay a certain distance from the button so you could just chase it off i mean im not saying certain tactics wouldnt develop im sure they would but im not sure i understand what you are suggesting as far as the timer im not sure it would have to increase that much  if at all i think fleets would tend to spread out you would have medium plex fleets large plex fleets and minor plex fleets roaming around when they see a similar sized enemy gang has jumped into a plex the make the few jumps and fight there would be constant pvp activity throughout the fw systems
well either npcs are blob equalizers like dr battlesmith is saying  or they are next to nothing but you both cant be right i think they are one thing  dampeners on pvpi like the vast majority of pvpers tend not to engage fights with npcs shooting at me i dont know what all the funny ship names mean and i have no intention on learning them i do not think i am alone on this let me explain if i see 2 ruptures a thorax and 2 rifters in a major i have an idea what im up against if i have those same ships with an asston of wacky named npcs i dont know what to expect how much damage will those npcs start doing if i get scrammed and webbed who knows and who cares not allot of people are going to want to try to figure that out instead they will just do their pvp outside of the plexes like the vast majority of fw pvp is currently done thats just it though fw has these great plexes with ship size restrictions which could yield so much more but those mechanics are getting all fed up by npcs and games of hide and go seeklet me ask what percent of plexes taken do you think involve pvp when i started fw i took a few plexes but found it to be mainly a pve activity has this drastically changed despite no changes to the mechanics it doesnt seem to have changed now i will occasionally fly to a plex if there is an enemy in local almost always when i fly in the enemy warps do i blame him no he often has about 50 shields from npcs why would he want to pvp with that handicapi think that if this proposal was implemented even if the plex wasnt contested we would still get pvp in them people would see these plexes as a great way to limit blobs and get a variety of pvp would the side that can field more ships win yeah i suppose they would but its hard to say they shouldnt win moreover if we are getting great fights who cares occupancy doesnt mean much of anything other than a medal if that medal was based on pvp instead of pve it might actually have decent value but even if one side loses because they are outnumbered just keep fighting the fight until the tide changes and they get the upper hand at least with amarr and minmatar the numbers tend to go up and down quite a bit
if we did away with npcs we would make plexing and occupancy pvp but not without strategy i think the strategy in fw pvp would be some of the richest in eve nor would it lead to blobs it would split them instead of everyone hanging out in a blob as they do now because almost no pvp takes place in plexes anyway gangs would split up and spread out with different sized ships if you are really organized you can have different sized ready fit ships thoughout fw space if you are really good you can have jump clones ready if a big blob comes you can do minor or medium plexes blobs tend to be unwieldy and take a long time to get reshipped or move if they move too fast they may tend to be reckless and get caught having multiple gangs able to get in different sized ships fast would be what occupancy would be all about that is what real war is all about having the right troops present when you need them not having a big lumbering blob that cant even enter the plexbattlefieldits unlikely that a militia will be able to field 3 different blobs at once each of which would need to be bigger than any single gang the opposing militia can field there would have to be one for minors one for mediums and one for majors and even if they canvery very unlikely you just do plexes away from the enemy blobs that apply to your style of plex intel would be important as would logistics and strategy but for once we would likely have fcs splitting gangs to try to accomplish different strategic goals instead of everyone trying to stay together and blob all at oncewill blobs still exist sure they will but if you are in a plex that doesnt allow bigger ships in they will not matter as much
1 removing npcs from plexes makes offensive plexing as boring as defensive plexing  when nobody shows up for a fight it also makes offensive plexing easy and will lead to massive numbers of afk plexing alts contesting systems2 broadcasting where plexes are opening is a great idea and will help with defensive plexing efforts with more chances for a fightbut heres whats going to happen plex opening up will be broadcast to all the first three days everybody will rush to defend the plex and the afk plexing alt will simply warp out and move on the people looking for fights will soon get bored of going ten jumps for nothing and then having to sit on timer for 20 minutes to decontest the plex well be back to three dedicated plexers on each side hunting each others afk plexing alts downbottom line if both parties want fights then fights will happen otherwise it wont fights does not equal occupancy orbiting a button for n minutes equal occupancy sometimes you have to kill npcs sometimes you have to bail because the other side wants to win more than they want a fight and sometimes you bring too many people because your goal is occupancy and not fight and sometimes you get a good fight because both sides bring an appropriate force to the plex
x gallentiuswhile i agree that if both parties dont want a fight you likely wont get one but often im looking for a fight and im sure there are plenty of enemies out there looking for a fight to but i cant find them or we are in the wrong fits we can make it a lot easier to get good fights these changes to plexing are essentially a way to make it easier to find a fight im not sure you would have to go 10 jumps you would see the plexes popping up throughout the fw area the only questions are are you in the right sized shipgang to head over a few jumps to fight what they have if not how fast can you get in the right ships you could of course just continue to roam around like you do now if you want pvp but i think we would find most fights dont happen that way with this way of finding good fights fasteven if the changes were made i would likely not do the plexes for occupancy at all i would do them just for the fights i would probably orbit the button for the heck of it while i am in there but currently i really dont care about occupancy i may if some interesting strategies started to spin off of how it was acquired and they involved pvp lots of times many on both sides want fights but have very little idea what they need to bring so one blob for each side forms that way yoru ready for anythign right blob a sees blob b has the advantage so blob a ships up half hour later blob a is out and blob b has disbanded so blob a ganks a few things while it waits for blob b blob b reforms and by they time they are out half of blob a left etc the proposed system would be much more fluid you would see gangs entering plexes all the time thorough out the faction war area and hopefully throughout the day and not just after downtime you know they will likely be there for the time it takes the plex to run so you can decide if you want to go fight them sure some people will run but if you bring a somewhat comparable gang and you will know the size of the gang in the plex so why not you will get a ton of good small gangsolo fights fast for myself i know that if i didnt have to mess wth npcs and i knew someone actually knew i was sitting there i would show up solo in my frigatecruiserbcbattleship whatever 70 k off the warp in gate so that even if they try to bring a blob i have a shot at taking out the bait or getting away before i get blobbed i do not think it would end up with people semiafking these think about it if you want a fight now what do you do you warp around looking for targets here you might as well do a plex and let the enemy come to you if they are coming for you then you know they want a fight it just helps likeminded people find good fights it does so without being staged or prearranged
you need to read and understand what i actually said no where did i say they were next to nothing i said the damage can be shrugged off but the ewar is what breaks them  remove all npc ewar and be done with itpirates have no qualms about taking what little damage the npcs give be it in plexes or on gates the only wtfgrrrr i have ever heard from them is that they were webbed neuted painted jammed dampened etc ie the ewar by the rats so they baileddieddidnt loot  very rarely do i hear damage from rats mentioned as reason for a missed opportunityif you assault a plex that you have not previously been in there is no spawns of consequence if you are running a timer without clearing rats when an enemy comes in then the fault is your own  stop speed tanking the bloody things and npcs become a triflea lesson you are free to pass on to the 50shieldsrunner example you gave  a couple of guys in proper ships yes even pvp fitted can wipe out all spawns almost as fast as they arriveyou cannot possibly be that naive look at amarr space a bcdown blob could linger in dalamamake and reach any amarr fw system within 56 minutes the whole splitting the blob up will never happen unless you give them reason  allowing any nonnoob ship to plex with not even npc interference does notas i said the bs blobs rarely shows itself except on weekends when they slug it out for fun the everyday blob has more than enough ships to go into any plex they want and still outnumber a plexing contingentyour attempt at polishing the inherently flawed system does nothing but benefit numbers and encourage even more plexingalt lameness something we have thankfully not seen en masse on am front the way the plexes work needs to be looked at if any sort of headway is to be achieved we also need to look at possible effects of acquiring occupancy to make people want to plex then land in play needs to be drastically reduced to discourage the bumblebee plexer from being able to run from plex to plex evading any attempts to kill itbut it is a moot discussion as ccp is never going to take it up again except to remove the bugs they themselves introduce when they mess about with the code elsewhere fw is a mashup of bits and pieces from all over the damn place  my faith in them wanting fw to be all it can be is long gone
nice suggestions but if youre not interested in occupancy then why tie occupancy war into the proposalfyi certain plexes already operate in this manner the npcs are activated in some cases when you start the timer not when you enter the plex otherwise they stay inactive and all you need to do is open up one of these plexes or missions in a heavy pvp system like tama oms or heyd and youll get all the pvp action you want
you need a couple of guys in proper fits just to kill the rats why not just do away with the rats so you can bring unqualified pvp fits not a little bit suboptimal for pvp but proper for plexing fits frowning at everyone who speed tanks the npcs in plexes even though that is an effective way to plex under the current system is no real solution the basic problem i presented is still the same either the rats have no effect or they have an effect the only effects rats have is that they tend deter pvp you suggest we mitigate this by taking their stronger effects such as ewar so that they can be shrugged off so its just a little bit annoying but of course reduce ewar and you have more speed tanking why not just be done with the stupid npcs and be done with itpeople who do plexes generally want to have some sort of active tank ability this doesnt do well with pvp if you dont have some sort of pve active tank you are likely to get caught with some of your tank missing this stuff is why no one wants to bother with these plexes well that and no one may even know you are there
you cannot possibly be that naive look at amarr space a bcdown blob could linger in dalamamake and reach any amarr fw system within 56 minutes the whole splitting the blob up will never happen unless you give them reason  allowing any nonnoob ship to plex with not even npc interference does not ok thats a good example consider what would happen if we take a large bcdown gang in amamake lets say they are faction a the other side faction b is well aware of this large gang after all its in that crossroads system so faction b actually uses some strategy in their attacks the fc of faction b makes sure everyone enters the plexes at roughly the same time so fc of the blob in faction a sees that there is a minor plex open with 3 frigates in asghed then there is a medium that pops open with 2 cruisers in aset a major with 2 battleships in taff and a medium with 2 cruiser in sahtogas here is a map for those who may not be familiar with the area
im glad your warming to the suggestions you ask a fair question it doesnt really need to tie in to occupancy  other than i think winning faction war should have something to do with pvp instead of just pve i fully understand others will disagree and will like fw occupancy to remain pve centered even if the system was not contested so it doesnt really effect occupancy i would still probably jump in the plexes to get good fights without constantly getting blobbed usually by the time of night i play all the plexes in the busy systems auga amamake dal are closed i do often try to jump from place to place to get a level 1 or 2 mission in a busy system but there are just too many backwater systems so its rare that i get one even if i do the other side or the pirates doesnt really know what the size restriction on the mission is before hand so even in auga an enemy hub i will just sit there unless i post in local asking for a fight im sure most dont even bother to check mission or plexes with the assumption that if i see them come i will just warp off that is the way the current system works i dont mind asking for a fight in local but i would really prefer the spontaneity of not knowing who will show up etc if you like to pvp in smaller gangs just think about how this would work it may be that there should be overall more plexes spawning though out the day i tend to think many people who gave up on fw might come back if there were a decent pvp system like this i just doubt many read fw threads anymore if you like the idea spread the word and support the thread if you dont feel free to post the issue you have

suppored howeverccp are the controllers of thisthey have been defining the boundaries and they will continue to define the excellence boundry also which is probably a false positive meaning what they class as as excellence really falls quite short of the real excellence markto be honest after all these years i dont trust a single word ccp says anymorethe are more interested in bringing in crap unfinished features just to grab a quick bucksad but true and the more ppl eve brings in the less likely ccp will listen because for every 1 person that leaves 5 probably join so they think hey who cares we dont need those players anyway
agreed wholeheartedly eve is already deep enough and has such an overly robust feature set that i feel like i could play for years and still have only scratched the surface i can understand the sense of urgency to get incarna prepped in time to release with or before dust but ultimately it only makes sense to have the rest of the game as polished and ready to go as our fancy new bodies seems like it would go a long way towards subscriber retention and eventually attracting some future dustheads that dont realize they have an internet spaceship addiction yetsvb

hybrid weapons have been broken for long time now people still use them because they dont have a choice but they are seriously underperforming compared to projectiles and lasers both other turret types got completely overhauled in the last couple of years and now its time for the hybrids whats the problemrailsuse a lot of cap have very low alpha strike and dps not very good tracking blastersblasters were designed in the good old times when battleships were going 1200ms and you could actually get in range a lot of things changed since then they completely lack the range to be effective in any kind of small medium or large fleets they have same tracking as autocannons best dps and alpha for sure but use a lot of cap and ammowhat needs to be done adjusting the damage modifier and rof to the following effectlarge railguns get 10 dps and 2x alpha strikemedium rails get 10 dps and 15x alpha large blasters need their optimal increased by 100medium blasters need their optimal increased by 150idea of the changes the idea is to put rails between beams great dps and artillerys insane alpha strike a balanced weapon platform that can still compete with the other two in most tasks  the idea is to make blasters usable in small gangs and fleets not just camping station undock points or shooting capitals in point blank range also it will put blasters between autocannonsbad optimal huge falloff and lasershuge optimal mediocre falloffdeimos and ferox been  for years now they need some changes too swaping deimos 10 falloff bonus for 5 optimal wll get it to exactly the same optimal as muninn and zealot using rails also it will work pretty good with the changed med blasters some people might actually fly blaster deimos again the slot changes been proposed few times by now and its about time it comes through one less high one more mid and powergrid adjustment will put it inline with other gallente ships compared to their amarr counterpartsone less low one more mid atleast 100 pg ferox needs another turret slot and possibly some more powergrid with the blaster changes it might actually become an interesting blaster platformbelow are some numbers for the people that are actually interested in theorycrafting

and about blastersfirst of all my idea is targeted at boosting rails and not nerfing anything i just want more options its obvious well still fly zealots and apocs and abaddons and shoot poses in geddonsand bhaalgorns booosh what im aiming for is artillery  uses no cap and have headshot alpha strike rails  use cap have more dps and medium alpha strike lasers  use lots of cap have even more dps and worst alphalasers still dont need ammo and reload in like 1 sec have epic tracking and epic dps there must be a downside but it shouldnt come from nerfingcomparing brutixferox to harbihurri might seem wrong but this is due to the fact that myrmdrake doesnt fit in any kind of turret based fleet checking on killboards youll see that harbihurribrutix are the most common battlecruiser choices with drake working mostly with other drakesanother point is that comparing brutixferox to cycloneprophecy is comparing them to ships that are obsolete basicly saying noone uses prophcyclone brutixferox should be the sameas for cap usage lasers are still high on topmegarails 33 capsec per 425mm ii 31 per 350mm 4341 for 3x mag stabsabaddonbeamsjust for comparison 79 capsec per tachyon ii 75 per mega beam iiapocbeams 52 for tach 49 for mega beam this ofc is neglected by the fact that apoc has the idiotic 9375 cap271 recharge while mega has 7031203 abaddon 7969213 and hyperion 900020as for blasterspulsesmega pulse ii uses 26 cap on apoc neutron blaster cannon ii uses 24 cap on megathron lasers use a bit more cap on armageddon due to rof bonus instead of dmg per levelthere is another thing some crystals have cap usage reductionstandard is 45 tracking on mega is 007442with the 375 ship bonus 05412 on hyperion 042 on geddon for a fair comparison we should be running of numbers for pulsesmultifreq against blastersnull as for autocannons 800mms tracking is 0054 optimalfalloff numbers aream l blasters 4513 null l 1116emp l acc 324 barrage 636multifreq l pulses 1510 scorch 4510blasters got about 20 more dps25 more alpha than autocannons 15 more dps15 more alphathan pulse lasers
i support that message
fully support it
may i point you to this thread and this thread and maybe also thisyour idea just seems to be collection of the first 2 threads they discussed both blasters and rails in full length already up to 27 pages in one thread
my idea is adressing the whole problem unlike the other threads and offering specific solutions to most of the current problems  reality check on how changes will work hopefully csm will take a look at this one  ive read some of the stuff in both the other threads here is a batter overview of the hybrid problem

so what youre saying is that rails do better dps than arty at better range but they need a boost right not supported
hehe that was my thought aswell especially with rokhs
1 lolrokh is the long range hitter tradeoff is it doesnt get the golden banana dps ccp giveth and taketh awayif anything if something needs to be fixed for rokh its making rr shield as effective as armor so thats actually on the logi side thin
the idea would be buff me gimp the other guyif rails suck so much and laserprojectile pwn why does every noob and their mother choose to be cadari gallente isnt rare either its easy to see why the last i found myself on the wrong end of a brutixnext thing you know there will be even more cadari toons and amarminmatar would be demanding to have decent missiledroneboats every race has strengthweaknesses unless youre proposing a gimp to missiledrones at the same time buffing rails unbalances races as a whole and well have even more cadari toons than there are alreadynot supported
yet another thing to add to the fix the ui discussion p

cant imagine why this has never been implemented b4 ho wait yes i can ccp anyway supported
i whole heartedly support this idea
1i havent been much in the highsec lately but every time i think of it an image of a zoo comes to my mind this would not eliminate suicide ganking destroyers anyone but it would sure bring some order to highsec if you still want to gank industrial
i agree but i think applying riskreward to suicide ganking should be done in a way other than by changing the way insurance worksthe problem is that when it comes to attacking cargo haulers its actually harder to do so in low sec because they can be defended properly with escorts in high sec the authorities are actually doing more to protect the criminals activityso my first proposal is that when aggressing a ship that is in a dedicated cargo hauling class you also aggress whatever ships may be in its fleet and wing not too sure how fleets work but there should be some kind of limit on the number of escort ships allowed this bonus should only be the case for cargo haulers you put expensive cargo in something else cant pay for escorts or dont bother with them youre sol it would also open up the role of escort pilot in the game to include work in hisec and interestingly the possibility of the gankers bribing the escorts or even being the escorts or at least having agents in a cargo escort corpit wouldnt stop suicide ganking just make it so that haulers with expensive cargos can take measures to protect them in hisec the same way as they can in lowsec and make it so the gankers have to make similar preparations to get access to the bigger profits as the haulers do to protect themthe second proposal also increasing the timeeffort that the gankers have to make to increase profitreduce risk is that both cargo scanners and their blueprints should become contraband in hisec with carrying blueprints having a much higher penalty as their existence in hisec means an easier source for scanners thereeveryone is free to buy weapons and ship scanners regardless of location because both can be used defensively as well as offensively however cargo scanners have only 2 uses as part of law enforcementcrime prevention something players dont have anything to do with as we cant work for concord or for use in crimetheyd remain usable as part of hisec suicide ganking but the criminals would be taking a risk in either shipping the blueprints into hisec to manufacture them there or in posessing a now more valuable scanner that could either be confiscated or get you killed for owningusing it maybe with each use having a sec status penalty the penalties could vary depending on which factions space you are in so that ganking remains as easy as it is at present in certain areashaulers get the opportunity to put in timeeffort to protect their cargos dependant on how much they are willing to spendget organised gankers get the same kind of opportunity to counter whatever the haulers may do and still have the ability to do it cheaply just without it being so easy to make a huge profit from it both parties have more of a gamble on whether or not the investment is worth itthe whole point isnt to make suicide ganking so its no longer profitable just so that it has similar risksrewardscosts as cargo hauling because the gameplay is more fun when the challenge lies in outwitting an equal opponent there is no challenge in being unable to defend yourself or in attacking a target that cant defend itself

i think this would be also easy to implement with the ship model overhaulingsupportified
easy way to encourage plexing is do the followingremove the npcs doing so encourages a pvp fight when not worried about the extra dps and ewar the select npcs will do to youadd notices when a plex is found andor is being captured throwing a notice in militia chat as simple as said militia has found a complex name in system name and said militia will capturecomplex name in system name in time remaining can rally a opposing militia to gang up and come for a fight and also notifying in your own militia that friendlies are attempting a capture may garner support from those that just logged on or were clueless that a gang is out or in essense missed the gangadd a benefit to fighting in a plex great things about the plexes is there is a set ship type that is allowed in to even the fights and make them interesting yes i know big ships can camp the gate and blobing can still ruin the up coming fights but bare with me you already get a small bit of standing for capturing and a very little almost insignificant amount of lp for a fw kill why not boost the amount lp given for kills for attackingdefending in a plex andor maybe insignificant standing too why not make the award greater for a even fight or fighting against a bigger force and netting some kills maybe count it as a mission and give the amount a level 12 mission without making it too profitable depending on the length of the fight participation penalty added to blobbing they are just small things to do to boosting plexing and the fighting to systems that you can think about it can breathe life into fw too making it more attractive while also not making it the next best isk maker and still keeping it about the fighting and the learning of pvp for the younger generation for their possible move to 00
how bout they fix lowsec where faction war largely occurs then work on fixing fw or fix them both at once or we could just accept that ankhstupidnamekahs myopic appraisal for the games problems and the solutions is going to remain largely unaffected by other people anyways
ok there are a whole bunch of ideas in this thread i both agree and disagree with so i wont pretend to address them all however im going to throw my voice into the pool just a few ponderings more than anything fully coherent  thought out initial post short term goals are pretty straight forward i agree with the bugs obviously and also plexes spawning throughout the day forcing pvp in plexesmissions would be nice move target spawn closer to warpin make missions harder to do its impossible to catch all but the slowest of people when a frigsb combo will complete a lvl 4 i can see why some people would be upset about the fw missions disparity between amarrgallente missions vs minnycaldari missions is a little off though doesnt bother me personally mid term the recent live events have been a lot of fun although despite some form of reward being indicated we assumed faction standing or something we didnt notice anything minor quibble there i suppose i could see fw specific events being fairly successful no preference on the other twolong term there needs to be something that motivates people to actually go ahead and fight for space benefitsconsequences would be good though an exact approach is difficult perhaps a few staging systems cannot change hands the rest can be contested any mission agents in those systems are reversed perhaps have the losing side have agents on gates w lower quality occupying faction has agents in station w higher quality some form of pvp missions nice idea but i dont really see it happening unless it spawned a mission beacon that only a certain number of ships from each faction could enter at a given time although this approach would lead to potential exploiting by using alts in opposing faction to fill up slots  get slaughtered by mains pirate fw yes please just balance the pirate ships a bit morealso as graham said there are really ugly penalties for pilots repping outlaws participating in faction warfare in the sense they lose faction standings each rep cycle also repping someone who sticks a smartbomb on and hits other faction members by accident leads to some really bad penalties per rep cycle one of our pilots went from 80 faction standing to 3 faction standing due to repping a new member to fw who was not aware of this whilst other militia members flew through his smartbombs this is a mechanic which could also be easily exploitable to destroy hard earned standings which are not easily recoveredoh yes another edit in here more system resources available to fw related nodes even when large fleets do happen theyre largely ruined due to the node crashing  lagging to hell with under 100 in local
attacking random people how does disrupting your target at a stargate affect you or any other neutral party the chances are you dont even have anything targeted if you read the proposal it clearly says stargates and stations onlyim not attacking anybody in that case i am simply defending myself as someone mentioned above concord is not there to defend you this means that players are supposed to defend themselves
not supported it would be heavily abused by faction warfare and alliancescorps in war not all of the wars are about bad guys ganking carebears ex bringing a group of alts to ecm burst the hostile gang thus potentially involving third party into conflict be it a war between corps fc or just attacking a player on witch you have kill rights this was never meant to happen
rr in highsec wars by different corps are abused too yet somehow no one have problems with it and they dont get concordedso you got hit by ecm burst it turns out to be abuse and not accident so shoot the person youve got kill right sensor boost or use drones or something whats the problem
if you read the original statement which you didnt it says only defending fleets can use it without consequence thus your fleet needs to be attacked first it also says strictly limited to stargates and stations if you can tell me how that can be abused please do so or please do us all a favor and learn to comprehend what you readnot all of the wars are about bad guys ganking carebears this isnt about the carebears me this is about the pvp pilots that escort me far from carebears
 you should do your self a favor and learn how to comprehend what you read first of most of the battles happen on stations and gates in eve  secondly so if my fleet is attacked first i then can bring a bunch of alts and fire up ecm bursts without consequences  how that makes any difference on the matter of third party involvement in war i dont get you dear sir
if i understand what youre saying is if group a aggros group b group b wont get concorded for using ecm bursts against uninvolved group c how is that fair to group c you say its okay because oh they shouldnt have anything locked anyway if thats your logic then you should give me all your isk and assets because you shouldnt have any anyway as proposed the proposal is fail however if it was group b regardless of the actions of group a should not get concorded for hitting npcs and npc structures with an ecm burst that is then fairi think what you really want which would probably be a pretty good proposal is a fof ecm burst maybe as a script to a regular ecm burst rewrite your proposal so that group c doesnt get punished for a fight they have nothing to do with and youll likely get some better support
exploit example1 get a fleet of neutral ecm burst ships together2 get an alt in an ibis to suicide on a single player in the ecm burst fleet3 proceed to break all of your enemys locks with your neutral fleet without consequences
as i said a reasonable solution is only counting people who have a lock or are attempting to obtain one if you disrupt someone who didnt have gcc or aggression you get aggression and almost certainly a gccthe worst this system could be gamed is having 5 ecm burst ships sitting there for 5 successive lock breaks  not significantly worse than having 5 blackbirds ready to ecm your enemy im also completely content with simply removing npcs from the aggressiongcc calculation and for that matter im content with the way things areliang
so theres no neutral folk on the gate no faction police officers no gate guns billboards or gates must be a pretty special gate if those things dont exist you dont get concorded if thy do exist youre attacking neutralswhether thats your intention or not it is the result of your actions which the police dislike if three dudes jump you in a barfight youre not allowed to fight back with a flamethrower no matter how much your intention is to defend yourself or how effective it might be in an empty field sure but not when theres innocents nearby find a more appropriate defence
the result of this would be out of corp toons ecm bursting all over the place in empire wars high sec wars are already terrible enough with the out of corp logistics
out of corp toons cant ecm burst if they are not attacked my proposal still clearly states that you or your fleet needs to be attacked for concord not to intervene
somebody attacks you does not give you the right to ecm burst all the other ships on the stargate for example if this proposal is implemented i can suicide my alt onto my ship and proceed to break locks on the gate and screw with highsec warfare for a good 15 minutes
you cant base aggro on fleet formations or corp membership it would open a good number of exploits and greifing possibilites this affects so many aspects of the game it if based on fleets people in wars wouldnt have a clue about the opposing forces they could shoot a target and suddenly the whole system lights up as hostile because they where in fleetoutlaws would be able to help eachother if aggressed around sentries and there are probably a good number of other ways this would radically change the gameyou could make a really complicated system with designated escorts that are approved by concord and visable to everyone as escorts i guess but that is just overkillwhat you did seems to have worked just fine so what is the problem here anywaya ship with a ecm burst on doesnt cost anything anyhow
train that webbing alt to use smartbombs on their pods after concord kills them sure youll take a giant sec status loss but just delete that alt and make another one 
you know this is against the eula rightedit clearified quote

as ccp makes it really hard to find the post  eve search on the topic
none of those posts show any dev confirmation concerning the topic of recycling alts a forum moderator said you can be banned for griefing by continually doing this however as suicide blobs are the actual aggressors youre not griefing themalso its not like you recycle an alt every day to pod kill suicide blobs that attack your main characters freighter at the very most you should only expect a suicide attack every months

well we have heard from past csm members and from our own experiences that ccp dont really interact with csm or even listen to a word they sayso whats the point of csm ccp set this up and promised it would listen but infact its just an empty promise and empty shelllook at the votes of support the waiting of scanning time got have ccp responded not at alli think the whole concept of csm is great but if ccp dont really recognise it or dont even listen to it then why really have itit needs real teeth so ccp step up to your promises and start listening to your players and the csm and be accountablewhat are your real values visions and goals towards the player base and eveand to be honest my trust in ccp has died due to things like this
if csm were allowed to make serious decisions that would be just bad tbhas bad as ccp sometimes is players sometimes really outdo them by several orders of magnitude when it comes to stupid suggestions
even ccp show great capacity for extraordinarily bad decisions the csm candidates tend to be egotistical freeloading wazzacks as opposed to actual game designers or towering intellectsthe best people to decide how eve should develop are ccp if they want to hire people to design the game they can and do they probably hire some decent people as well as nepotised that a word muppetsthe csm isnt there to design eve its their to fill column inches in marketing editorial websites what is called internal affairs is what we were first promised the csm would be which is what i want the csm to be except with the one small difference being the csm as internal affairs actually do things bring people to account publicly harshly and without consideration as to whether its the bosss son theyre investigatingthe csm is a poor joke internal affairs is a poor joke ccp never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity
the csm as it is elected now is pretty terrible you get people who are seriously bias or just plain trolls and not a very good representation of the whole player base at alli think ccp should be involved in picking candiates if this is to go on setup some criteria for the various csm posts and screen nominations like a job applicationthen the player base can vote between a few by ccp selected candidates this way they can ensure they get a good representation and not just trolls or representatives for the largest alliancethey could also hire a dude of there own that is actually paid to screen and evaluate player suggestions and brainstorming and discuss with the community though he would have to get a troll vaccination first
please explain to me how bias is a problem
well if you get a dude into the csm that is really into something no one cares about  like say building stuff on planet then if ccp listens to him they will spend alot of time and resources on something no one cares aboutmore likely is that they will be sorting out problem of a very specific warfare tactic or something of this sort it is naturally a problem if you dont get a good representation of the player base but people promoting special interests in the csm just like in every fing other democracy in the world
perfect
how do you tell whether an opinion is widely or narrowly held i mean you can poke around on the forums but forum s arent normal players and there arent really very many of us or you can ask the players as a whole which program of action that they like the whole purpose of the csm is to use that second method if someone builds a platform around a particular issue and finishes with a csm seat that would seem to imply that theres at least a decent number of people who like that opinion if the rest of the csm goes along with it that would seem to imply that theres no strong opposition to the idea from the other eight which generally means its not crazy your doomsday scenario consists of a lot of people liking a candidate the csm saying that the idea is a good one and ccp deciding that its both good enough and a high enough priority to actually code if all that happens then maybe you should look into the possibility that its not actually a bad idea
uhm station background sounds fade away after a short period of time 1 min maybe ccp already added that in tyrannis this also happens with rat sounds
its still highly annoying especially the chanting since it cant be disabled any wayif i turn of eve music because im running music from another source or watching a movie on my 2nd monitor id like to not be interruptedby some religious nuts chanting around my ship
then you shouldnt dock in amarr stations perhapsi dunno i just dont think its an important issue
im based in amarr to leave amarr space because some instation chanting wont go away would not be a good reasonand it actually doesnt go away after a minute that might be true for other faction stations but it stays in amarr stationsit sucks when docked and trying to watch a movie or youtube on the other monitor i have to go into audio settings to disable all audio so it wont interfere with other sound related activities that doesnt make sense to me i might chat and do other casual things in eve while watching something else so exiting the client doesnt make sense eitheri agree not a horribly pressing issue but nevertheless annoying and hopefully addressed someday
ohmmmmmmmmmmmmmmsablelasable stfuoh and while you at the planet music also gets annoying after timecrazy o
anyone know the error message that appears when trying to drop a bomb  bubble in empire
i am afraid this proposal doesnt get my approval the amount of extra calculation involved and the griefing potential is astronomicalwe are trying to alleviate lag this proposal would crash nodes in low sec with 20 in local we are already getting node crashes with 90 in low sec and 150 in 00 which i expect to get worse with stupid planet mining after dt today
i have been doing some more research on this and have come up with a draft issue proposal for comments the big change is that i realized the proposal should be careful to address the needs of colorblind players  if there are any colorblind players reading this thread please let me know if the changes are appropriate this is in wiki format summary overloading modules is a crucial pvp gamemechanic but the current user interface is difficult to operate and errorprone unless a keyboard shortcut is used activating overload requires either clicking a tiny area at the top of a module button or accessing a contextual menu both of these methods are errorprone and can easily result in the module becoming deactivated once overload has been toggled either on or off there is no visual indication that the command has been accepted until the start of the next cycle additionally an erroneous command cannot be corrected until after the start of the next cycle the overload activation cue is just the change in the intensity of the color of the small overload activation area at the top of the module button it is needlessly difficult to determine the state of the modulein addition to the difficulties faced by all players in managing overloading players who are colorblind face particular challenges in effectively using the module buttons because they have difficulty distinguishing between red and green hues which are used in the pulsing halos that surround activated modules solution the current colors associated with module buttons are green and red according to information on
sounds good 
sounds good but id still like to see a bigger or more click friendly overload button be part of the solutions you listed
the proposed shiftctrlaltclick method kind of eliminates the need of buttons providing cleaner interface in addition it would prevent accidental overloading which happens also because the overload button is directly on top of the module activation button
this is an interesting suggestion actually several issues that immediately come to mind if anyone else has things to add please do soa larger overload area also means easier to misclick and activatechanging the general button look means artwork changes  more workthe current overload area is already often partially hidden behind the button type badge for example by the ammo of guns a larger area with the current layout would be more hidden and so it would be harder to figure out where the click area ison the plus size a change here could also help those eve players with physical limitations that make modifierclick combinations difficult to enterif you or anyone else can come up with a sketch of a button redesign that addresses these issues then with a little more work this could be added to the proposal perhaps things could be worded so that the proposal contains subproposals modifierclick halo changes button design changes which can be independently considered for implementation
there is a lot of unused space around the buttons some of the problems you mentioned about making them bigger could be alleviated through use of that space for instance the over heating buttons could be a little circle the same size as the rack overheating buttons that is half on half off the module circles at a corner of a circle rather then the top this would also alleviate the issue of cycle bars occluding the button or module icons as well which is annoyingreally i dont think its much work for the art dept to figure out solutions if they have a guy who can draw concept design for a bs in half an hour and honestly i wouldnt mind them spending a little time figuring out improvements for the ui regardless of what ever else it is they are doing if nothing else you can present it and let ccp decide a hot key or modified click is better then now for sure but really only goes half way i think
i support some form of improvement to the overheating setup those proposed by trebor look pretty solidits frustrating when your overheating goes fubar
ui improvement  automatic support
anything that improves the ui and this would has my support
anything that improves usability gets my vote i hate that tiny sliveredit to tick support
i really like this idea a loti personally would make the overheat buttons as large as possible they might for example modify the button so one quadrant topleft or topright would be more like the corner of a square so theres a nice triangular area to click in
the csm proposal is up on the wiki herei would appreciate any comments and suggestions it can still be tweaked for the next 24 hours or so
supported on the basis of fitts law
i like it it looks like it covers everything

as far as i can see highsec wars are just broken game mechanic that should never have been there in the first place its both far too easy to be abused by highsec pirates and even more easily dodged by the pirated the fee is chump change for alliance tooits just a tool for highsec pirates lacking the spines to go to lowsec who poach miners and indistrials instead and the said noncombat toons would just swap fake corps or even alliances 1b isnt that much for tradersindustrialists or crossdec with fake corps or use any number of ways to dodge it the only people who get stuck are noobs who dont have money or dont know better

dont stop there just replace the csm with a forum poll ccp arent stupid they can count results just look at the overanalysis of the isk faucetssinks they refer to as an economy in the qen or the csm results they can count those till cows come homeso yeah winner forum pollwhichever forum polls get the highest count ccp have to promise to faithfully that they will come up with lip service first instead of silently ignoring them and doing whatever they want to do
forum polls can be sabotaged just as easilyif not bullted
if you find me a forum poll with 40000 votes ill agree with that until then the csm reps provide better representation than any forum poll ever will

cloaks are the only offensive system that do not have a counter the same way other systems do a good example would be ecm ecm has eccm to counter it but the counter is still not 100 moreover eccm takes up a valuable medium slot and does nothing else but counter ecmimo cloaks should have a similar feature cloaks are the counter to probes but should not work 100 of the timeif this idea is still too much for the afkcloaky fanbois then i propose that cloaks should not be able to be fitted on any ship with weapons if people want to pvp they shouldnt have to hide and if people are going to hide they have no business pvping

i think it should be possible to swap your portrait to other races or at least make an option to make a character portrait that looks good within every bloodline for example i think the achura bloodline has some very limited choices when it comes to making a portrait an achura toon can choose to either have 1 specific shape of eyebrows or none at allso if you are not going to allow race swapping which i think you should then you should make a lot more customization available for portrait makingwith regardsghost
hahahaha i laugh at you foolish achura i imagine though that should incarna ever role around in the mythical future people are going to have another shot at character design
well it is possible according to eve chronicles to swap faces
rumors say you can redo your portrait better with incarna but i think the bloodline restriction should stay
caps mostly stay where they are lives and dies there they dont go to highsec moon farming is a major source of income doesnt mean there arent others its like how most people think of missions as highsec isk faucet when insurance fraud was actually also a much bigger slice of the pie then they realize before insurance got gimped if you can look at the wallet of some of those corps youd be surprised how much 1015 of 237 macroratting adds upit wont break up sov null alliances just weaken them
sure reduce the income from ratting and mining and watch the highend moon materials skyrocket i would love to hear your opinion when hulk price breaks 500 mil isk and t2 modules cost tripleswrong they will grow even more to cover the wallet gap by sheer numbers or merge other alliances with similar goals around them making new powerblocks and one more thing do you really think that big alliances live from mining and ratting individual players maybe but alliances  nowhat this has to do with powerblocks is beyond medo i smell troll here or are you that unfamiliar with the game t2 stuff materials are already located in 00
courier missions are literally the most boring thing imaginable they do nothing but waste player time for isk they require no skill save to scout lowsec gates and consist solely of moving from one system to another furthermore they are incredibly vulnerable to macroing people have talked about how they should or shouldnt be improved but seriously what is the point of them why even bother keeping them surely there are better ways to implement noncombat missions than this mindless busywork
supporting myself
they make sense and provide an easy way to get your standings up without having to focus on combat or mining related skills standings are so basic game mechanic that there needs to be a way for most professions to gain them there might be better ways ways for noncombatnonmining to get standings but since all missions are basicly just mindless grinding courier missions arent much worse than the alternatives
combat missions are just as boring the only bearable way to get standings in this game is to do couriers for fast storyline
this i hate them but theyre a valid and necessary game mechanic
new rules1 systems under the occupancy of an empire will no longer allow those allied to enemy empires to dock in occupied systems militias must occupy a system to dock2 imperial mission availability is effected by how deep into enemy territories an empires occupancy extends the more systems a militia occupy the more rewarding the return is3 all nonmilitia imperial forces are to undergo new training to improve their ability to defend their space and vips fw mission npc now receive sleeperlike ai

with respect ankhesentapemkah could likely reduce though not eliminate some of the sentiment arrayed against her by looking for ways to work with the csm and improve current processes rather than go it alone in parallel from the minutesi definitely do not belong to the antiankh camp but after reading these minutes i can understand why it exists far more than before her suggestions regarding links to issues and whatnot seem like good ones but as the csm pages dont appear to be moderated nothing prevents her nor technically any other player from working to improve things in their current state

how about introduce the notification to chat channels when someone starts running a plex timer as mentioned drastically reduce the number of plexes plexes spawn in waves of between one and maybe five plexes exact number debatable when all the plexes in a wave are completed a new wave spawns plexes should spawn only in systems adjacent to a system occupied by the enemy the border maybe one jump off that some special case would be needed for the situation when one a faction occupies the entire warzone ideally weight the number of plexes per wave by player load during way off peak hours only one or two might spawn on peak would more likely see five or whatever the max number of plexes per wave is remove the npcs

not sure this is the best solution but im supporting this because destroyers have needed work for a long long time
no your wrong i would love for them to refund my sps and i would take full advanage of starting sleeper accounts for rd datacores im just saying it ant going to happen anytime soonyou see there are more problems then just giving the sps to people that already trained this skills it removes alot of barrers for older players to explot tooedit whats to stop older players from starting a fresh training first thing for  implants and speed training to rd on the toons one account and just sleeping it nothing and you can now do it in so much faster if you bypass learning skillsthis is just one possablity its also has to do with why you can only train one toon at a time on one account should we though that out the door tooi would love to see training skills go and beable to train all 3 toons on my account at the same time im all for it but to get ccp to say its wrong and were going to change that is easy to get them to realy change it thats a hole differnt ball of wax
this man bring sup the first relevant point ive seen in this thread vulnerability to exploitation i personally believe the exploitation risk is fairly minor but i have no hard and fast counters to this because industry isnt my gameive been thinking about this for a few days and i havent really changed my mind i saw one post in another thread they basically said that learning skills are optional in the same way that legs are optional you wont die without them and you can still get around but its generally going to be extremely slow and inefficient and good luck competing with anybody else who isnt also missing limbsthe fact is there is a skill race that skill race has a cap in the way that you can only get so efficient at piloting a specific ship and the returns are diminishing but ultimately there is a race itd be different if we were just wandering around whacking wolves for 20 exp a piece but this isnt a standard mmo eve is and always has been very pvp centricif youre going to get learning skills youre going to have to spend a lot of time learning them when you could be learning skills that actually provide some useful purpose if youre not going to get learning skills youre crippled compared to those who are it doesnt matter if you get learning skills right away or after 5 years or spread out over the space of six months youre still going to be burning that time and if youre going to get them the sooner you get them the better off you are in the long runbut i really need to say this hard and fast without the speed increase from the learning skills eve is horrendously slow thats a completely subjective opinion but given how many people have high level learning skills im going to take a stab and guess that a lot of people agree with me

must have
so you then also would assert that blasters are balanced as well worse dps and range than both autocannons and pulse lasershaving to spend most of a fight moving into range is fkin annoying
because of missiles and drones duhamong caldari ships missile boats are used way more often then railboats and domi  ishtar are probably most popular gallente shipsrails could use a boost but isnt there already a big topic about it
i can not support this change with out you at the same time giving good missile and good drone ships to all the other racesadd good guns ships to gallente give then add good drone ships to ammar add good guns ships to caldair add good missile ships to mins
blasters could use a range buff of some sort with autocannons getting boosted as well so that autocannons stay the intermediate short range gun rails well if beams are high dps and arties are high alpha why not make rails the longest range seems fair to me
rails platform is already the turret platform that can get an optimal range beyond the locking range rokh with 425mm rails and spike ammo
supported theyre supposed to be hybrid  a cross between a projectile and an energy weapon so lets see them placed between the two
this tbph supported
not supporteti will not support stuff with blasters and increase range in the same sentence
like thesesacrilegearbitratornaglfarvengeance rockets suck someday when they are fixedabaddon 5 large drones and laserstyphoonpurifier huge em damage bonushound huge exp damage bonushereticcurse aka best recon with drone bonusespilgrim drone bonusesyou want more dronemissile boatsthe rokh is admittedly a fantastic killmail  but it is not a productive part of a fleet gallente hybrid platforms do not have extra range dps or alpha blaster boats need some repair as they have been overnerfed honestly i think both ac and blasters need more range
those examples suck for dronemissileboats and you know it ac and blasters do not need more range if they were to keep that dps you just want amar to have their ss handed to them well others are gonna switch too it wont help you in the long run itll just imbalance the game and create even more loopsided populationsthis thread screams buff me gimp everyone else
i like it though the usual suspects are already making a mockery of intelligent debate
this doesnt even make sense my argument was that he says arty is fine but a weapon system with better range and better dps is not fine yes arty has some advantages  cap use and damage switching most notably  but he was making a raw stats argument and the raw stats say that a railgun is better than an artillery cannon blasters on the other hand specifically trade off range in favour of more dps theyre the highestdps weapons in the game but they have the shortest range the question there is whether the tradeoff is worth it  do you get enough dps to make up for the loss of range at present id say that you probably dont and that blasters could use some tweakingsome tracking love say but its a sensible enough design and i have nothing against it and amazingly enough thats exactly how it works now where did you ever get that idea theyre nothing at all like halflaser halfprojectile weapons
supported gallente hybrids feel broken to me to the point where i crosstrained to amarr for lasers as much as i love blasters they need fixing
i fully support giving missions dynamic content i also fully support making missions viable in pvp style fits  it should be an option to be able to better run a mission in an armor buffer than in a duel rep it should also be possible to be able to choose whether to use longrange weapons or shortrange i want to be able to use blasters a level 4 should drop you into a small gang of 12 bss and maybe a cruiser or two plus a couple of tackling frigs which can do 2000dps if they all get you into their optimal make it into a pvp style encounter and each bs worth 5mil and make exactly what setup you go against randomthis imo would make pve far more entertaining and make it possible to actually do pve in a ship that can fight effectively in pvparazel
yes
im not really sure if i should support this yes or no yes mission running feels as broken as an asian mmo grind and definitely could use some revampingthe one thing i am worried about with dynamic content is the influence it could have on the sandbox if the dynamic content is implemented as you proposed will the outcome of the dynamic content be fully influenced by player actions with different outcomes for individual players based on individual choices or will players be forced to set a predetermined scripted path with 1 or 2 variations of the outcomes second thing how many players do you propose would have to partake in such a mission in order to have any impact will it be individually based or group based or multiple individuals doing thesame mission solo in this case im worried about a single player trying his very best and completing allot of missions but his actions have no influences because there are not enough of other people doing the missionsthird point if you propose people to work in groups how will this affect lowsec missions trust is a very scarce commodity in eve and is earned through hard work and i do not forsee people grouping up very fast especially when in lowsec you can pop the other guy after he did the work for you at that point i also would not like to see any mechanic to prohibit that because in the eve sandbox all choices should be yours to makelast comment i do support the improvement of ai but what are your thoughts on how this will effect the current economy ratting is a major income in 00 space and yes i would like for it to be more fun but if the difficulty of ratting is increased by a huge bit thus making it harderlonger to kill them it will give less income to players now i am not qqing about less cash i would see it as a setback especially if you are active in pvp and need to replace ships on regular basisanyways ahnk if you can get a more interesting way of missioning working please do so because tbh anything is better then the current state of mission grinding if you can give any feedback on my questions or give some more explanation it will be greatly appreciated 
would it be game breaking to make lowsec gate guns speed tankableas of right now low sec pvp is for battleship pilots only unless you have relaly good cruiser and heavy dictor skills
or shoot people off of gates and stations
you mean lowsec gatecamping is not for frigates which is just fine want to gatecamp in lowsec get a big expensive and vulnerable ship theres no issue there
this
yes this would chance the game radically and make lowsec much more similar to 00 in terms of travel safetynow unless you are an outlaw it is very unlikely that someone will manage to tackle your small ship on a gate in lowsec it takes a well setup gatecamp with remote sensor boosted hics or special assault frigates and good logistics to the be able to snatch small stuff on gatesif any stray interceptor could tank the gate guns not so much
i can tank sentries in my skimitar try getting one of those
we could use more people in lowsec not less its empty enough as is
allowing frigatesized ships to safely engage in pvp at gates will make it even more vacant as there will be more risk of being ganked
isnt that why its called lowsec the security status losses are enough supported
the reason lowsec is vacant is because no one wants to risk the expensive ships that are required in low sec to pvp battleships its too dangerous to even bring a hac to the damn gates which makes up a considerable portion of pvp pilots
if your gang is prepared you can bring hacs to a gate campanyway  to the frigates  there is plenty of frigate pvp in lowsec especially in the faction warfare areas gate camping is a tough one true but if you are fast you can land the suicide tackle and warp out before the gate guns kill you or you end up as suicide tackle hope you got a lot of ships that said  if your corp mates sit on the gate for camping run belts or neighboring systems maybe you find some targetsps if you start shooting pirates sentries are so kind to look away might be an option to consider not supported
not supported if anything i think the gate guns could use a boost to cut back on gate camping its a bit too easy to tank in big ships especially if you have several of them i think if gate travel were made a bit safer it would result in atleast some increase in low sec traffic thus making it more interestingand btw if you want to gate camp in a frigate in low sec join fw it can be fun at times running around low sec in a fleet of 20 faction frigates and camping some of the major arteries
hell no there will be instalocking inties on every lowsec gate camp
nah keep gate guns as it is a decent bc can tank the guns so thats quite affordable

so far weve got polytextiles one step closer to a towel  the most useful item that any space explorer can have
u mean the consequences of ship loss sec loss and the t1 insurance nerf u mean the lack of consequences of a t2 mining ship in high sec oh okcause then i dont see why eve needs to have a 100 safe blue zone u have in wow since we already have stations
consequences of actions matter more than lack of actionssupported
since when since ppl cry so much about the mineral prices all over the universe cause theyve been oversupplied to death by overuse of otherwise riskless t2 mining lack of action against this is what caused that fyi and r the high sec belts deserted like low sec no ok thenthat means the system is working as intended to be more precise in the miners favor considering that suicide ganking is an intended mechanic
i dont recall op or anyone who supported this crying about mineral prices if you or some other ppl do its yourtheir problemsubsidies for suicide ganking is not an intended mechanic suicide ganking itself is the insurance company would rather not pay for your insurance fraud
its irrelevant whos crying about itthe fact is it exists because many ppl overuse this riskless profession and when prices drop universally it becomes other ppls problem whether ure able to understand that or notactually it is intended just like how low sec pirating is subsidized otherwise they wouldve removed insurance from all criminal acts high sec and low sec included do u know what else would void insurance irl taking a vehicle into a war zone and losing it regardless of criminal involvement aka anywhere in space where u can get shot at then again this isnt real life
majority of minerals come from missionersratters rather than miners its also besides the point as op and supporters didnt whine about mineral prices if yousince you brought it up or someone else do whine its yourtheir problem deal with itinsurance fraud is when you buy insurance before performing an action that intentionally destroys the item insured probability of destruction 100legitimate insurance buying is when you buy insurance for an item that is under risk probability of destruction less than 100
thats the same excuse every miner makes in defense of their riskless profession likewise if your exhumer is being blown up u deal with it instead of crying about thatso an insurance company would accept a 99 probability either case ure expecting it to be destroyed otherwise u would not buy the insurance in the first place if its likely enough for u to lose it that u have to buy insurance for it in the first place its gonna happen enough so that insurance companies would go out of business either way legitimate or not just because its legitimate to u doesnt mean the insurance company would accept the terms irl so your logic is faulty both irl and in eve then again this isnt real life so thats why they dont have a choice in the matter so its accepted for all
i dont have an exhumer and i dont mineas i said insurance fraud is 100 probability of destruction it was your intention from the beginning to get the ship destroyed and get paymentnormal eve insurance buying is less than 100 probability of destruction you know youre taking a risk therefore insures the ship to guard against that riskthe difference is destroy the ship on purpose and collect the payout vs trying to keep the ship alive in pvp but not always succeeding one is insurance fraud other is pvpnot sure how much clearer i can explain it
if this is to go through ccp best get on it now there are so many other things that will need to be considered for example a whole new set of trade commodities will need to be created such as baby oil mud jello bikinis etc will evetv be covering this can we get this feed in high defthere will need to be advertisements for color commentators will there be a tournament set up or a freeforall concord will have to be bribed or distracted windows and closet doors will need to be assembled around the hellcats home system for the peeping toms so much to do

allow players to replace their command center on a planet with one of a different level i imagine this would be as simple as changing the target cc level in the database then destroying the cc in the hold of the ship youre flying
i agree with thisat present to upgrade a planet you need to wipe the slate clean and start again which also means losing any products that have been produced or any components waiting for more advanced processorsmy guess is that it is just an oversight and should be fixed very soon

if someone dont wont pvp this should be respected not imposed if ccp wants to make eve a pvp game bether say it lowd and clear close missions and empire sec status just make this an entire 00 espace its much bether than just be hipocrit 
yes corp logos tooccp have said that theyre in the process of rejiggin all the ship models and textures they should work this in as well
your whole idea revolves around the notion that 1 single ship should be able to defend itself against a whole gang using only a single module it should not and your entire thread is therefore pointlessyes you will need more then 1 directed ecm ship to stop that gang thats exactly the way its supposed to be like

so the csm board responds to cap ship proposals that 99 of the eve population that voted for them could never have any use for fix destroyers and afs firstedit lets add interdictors to that list too no one flies them anymore only heavy dictors
supported i really hate having to use third party sites to see easily if i can make one jump
better idea allow arbitrary filtering by security status eg i dont want to go through hisec because im 10 and i dont want to go through nullsec because of lawlbubblecamps but yes good idea 
the csm members probably know better than you what demographic voted them innot to mention youre rather wrong about the dictors theres plenty of them around in real fights
there are many times when a warning window comes up there are two options yes  to proceed or no to disengageas of right now if you hit enter or any other similar key ccp has the default on yes although this is fine for most things like jetting ore out of ship it is a problem for other things like if you proceed you will be attacked by concord and suffer a sec status loss i cannot say how many times i have lost ships to quickly hitting enter under the subconscious thought that it would register as no  to disengageproposal set the default to no for all criminal and other negative actions
not supporting this  although ive only just learnt that pressing enter translates to a yes for these popup windows from your post this sounds awesome and just solves a lot of awkward situationsdont take this away ccp
sounds reasonable youll want a new name for this thread though yours is remarkably nonspecific
so we all know that remote ecm bursts arent worth a damn and this is why to those who have never used one once you activate it it takes 20 seconds minus proj ecm skill level to actually fire a brust and break the lock of targets within 20kmso with this said i propose that ccp at least makes it so it actually jams the targets for about 510 seconds instead of the current 20 so its not too overpowered in a gang of supercarriers oh and make it have a cool effect like smartbombishin regards to the actual skill i propose that it reduces the capacitor usage of the module by 5 per level or maybe the reactivation delay which seems reasonablesupport or flame away

its already been made
its called watch the tutorialps i agree with the serious lack of qc in eve being a mac client victim but this area is imho pretty damn straight forward but then i actually rtfm most of the time
the csm doesnt need teeththe population however needs more power over the csm for checks and balances to prevent screw upsuntil such time certain modifications are made as to how you become a csm its still a comedy show at bestsorry for my pessimism but ive been seriously disappointed as of lately1 the csm mocks the public in claming they pay attention when in fact they have a serious case of selective reading loss ha ha2 the csm has its own agenda always minus a very few select individuals who actually care and they tend to not last long3 the bulk of the csm only care about getting elected for the free trip and strutting there stuff and personal agenda yes im repeating myself4 they get in too easily and get elected way too easily because they drag in there alliances and blues to get in just like that5 they now can get reelected a idea that was soundly tarredfeatheredshotdown without limitation causing an issue of getting rid of the ones that arent so good while denying the good ones from getting in6 the so called vote is a total waste much like the votes in the usa and doesnt matter much unless you have a few hundred to a thousand accounts at your disposal to actually make it count7 csm hardly participates with us due to getting too much spam and become reclusive cant blame them for that8 last but not least they continue to lose favor with the overall public when someone on the csm theres always one does something so stupid that they attract all the trolls and it becomes the headline of the month and nothing serious gets any attention biggest issue they spend alot of time putting on a show and less actually working on problems unless its very serious and in alignment of there own agendabottom line  giving them more power would cause more harm than goodnow i can accept that i dont see whats going on in the background but in all honesty no one knows whats going on and getting that information is like pulling teeth seriously full disclosure would go a long ways minus any nda material like prompt minutes posting etcps id run but i feel its a total waste of time imho all id get for my trouble is trolled and ignored or spammed to hell and back and im too contrary and oddballish to be heard contrary to my fans who actually tell me id get somewhere that and id lose my temper a problem i tend to have all too often i have enough trouble tolerating the one hit wonder idiot posts in spite of my ideas being not so smart in themselves id make an effort to be more diplomatic because id be representing the voters and not myself i speak my mind more readily i dont mess around and i dont bs im a literalist its a curse and a blessing all at once
well you can remove the part about ccp giving it priority cause that is what this tread is about and what i am against forcing ccp to spend time on what the csm wants so that is not a probability it would happen if this is implementedmy examples wasnt that good i was trying to be funny but the thing i described will happen and here is the more realistic scenariolarge nullsec alliances promote there own members these being the only ones getting enough concentration of dedicated voters get in so the csm will have a large representation of people from large blobby alliances so what issues will are these people likely to push onto ccp yes that is right to make it easier to be large and blobbywhile other stuff that very large portions of the player base do and enjoy gets neglected small gang warfare for instance and all that pve stuff
we need the possibility  to carry rigged ships in freighter cargo restrictions could be ship must be unfitted execpt rigs and empty cargo to make the difference with others ships capabilities to carry other types of unpackaged cargo containers ie giant huge medium and smallthx to check that o7
you can do that already just make a courier contract for the ship the courier contract limit got increased to the size of the largest freighter a few patches back now you can carry up to 2 fitted and rigged battleships in a freighter
yes the courier workaround exists but it should be possible to do it without needing to flip things between alts and ruin insurance and im fine with carrying containers only if theyre packaged  no cargo expansion on freighters
having a workaround is not the same as a working mechanic
they will never or should never let you put assembled cans in a freighter the reason should be obvious a gsc takes up 3k space but holds 39k its the same reason why carriers can no longer carry ships with anything but ammo and charges in thier holdsecondly it just doesnt make sense to put assembled ships into a freighter it would be akin to bringing an assembled tent in your car when you go camping in the woods
no it would be like putting a assembled car in the hold of a truck which makes sense to me or would you take it apart and then transport it
why not simply make a ship class that can carry assembled ships but has no jump drivemake it slightly larger than the carriers ship bay maybe 3 bs sized and utilize all the rules of regular ship maintenance bay transport suddenly youve solved the highsec movement issueas for the assembled cans i dont see it happening at all use courier contracts otherwise as mentioned it will make their holds ridiculously large for the devoted pilot
this some items are meant to be easily assembled and disassembled for transport ships imo do not fall into that category once they have been rigged
i would like to propose that ccp start focusing on some details in the game and dont push in more content imo eve need a bit of help to get in shape and back on track to be the game it once wasit feels like way to many pilots are quite upset over this patchlag being one big reason i remember when ccp had several dev blogs braging and showing of how they improved the lag situation for a while there things went rly well and you could have a 1000 pilot fight in 00 with decent lag recently it seems like the lag have increased allot and you have now big issues to control it removing brackets turning effects off and running on minimum settings does not cut it you find yourself outlagged in fights with just a 200 in system decissions decissions either eve is a fleet game and then some focus need to be made on that or eve is not a fleet game and should be adapted to small scale combat eve is ofc not just pvp but in the end that is what everything leads to everyone in high sec that claim they dont want that is cool to say it but what they do helps others to keep the fights up in another placesmall bugs fixes or other things it was some time since the forums was loaded with several several threads about how bad something is i remember the never ending rage on amarr but now there is no rage on anything special still there is plenty of small things that need a bit of attention i only ask ccp to hold up and look at the game dedicate some quality time and focus on what once was before you keep running out and create new cool things thx for me flame away
agreed this is the best time to stop and take the time to clean up ignoring the oblivious moar pvp and less pve commentsthe real issue is more technical than ingame mechanics although they have some issues there toolike the mac client base of which is really ed right now trust me its not prettyright now i feel like they arent even testing there own bloody product inhouse and they spend more time pushing it on the guys who live in singularity and honestly they dont outnumber the general population in tranquility that muchbiggest issue is all this new content is causing a distinct bloatedness and its got me really concernedim willing to bet good isk that that is really the main cause of the lag problems its just not so obvious because we tend to blame other thingssmellsfeels too much like windows xp  windows vista  windows 7 to memany little problems that still havent been fixed but keeps looking better and has more featurestime to hit the brakesand get around to fixing the really nasty bugs that drive people up the wallthe game was very clean cut and good at apoc now its just worse than dominion yay new ship skins and pi but what about all that other crud that still is causing problems hmmsupportedps id be very embarrassed right now if i pushed crash reporting only to find out it was total epic failness seriously youd think they would have bothered to test there own program before releasing it how the heck do you expect to keep customers if you pull crap like that people can only take so much of that before they walk away
thankswhat is ccps plan rlyis it only money that drives them and if so this thread is hopelessi rly hope somehow ccp can listen to thier members and make the most for the game aplying new stuff cool and fun specially for those that havent palyed that long tho when new things gets introduced before old things are fixed it is rly sadid be interessted to read what ccps plan with eve is what is the goal for the game and what do they want it to be and becomeeve have loads of things to offer and if you got the time and imagination you can never grow tierd of it but when you see how fun a thing is and you rly lvoe it but the game mechanic destroys it that is wrong
one idea i have to bring more individual people into low sec for mining is if there was a mechanism that took care of most or all of the steps of mining ie mining hauling refining and made it into a single stepwhat if we could strap a warp drive onto a roid put a energy transfer on it for warp and warp it to a few roid eating specialized station found only in low secwould also create a combat hot spot the kicker would be that it takes say 3 mins to strap a warp drive onto the roid and 13 mins to transfer enough energy for warpof course this could only be done in low sec because for role play reasons the factions thinks its dangerous to strap warp drives on roids in high sec and null sec stations dont have the equipment doing this in null should increase travel travel time by several multiples or should not be possible at all or should result in diminishing returnsto balance the influx of roids would be the time spent in transit no one would be strapping warp drives on roids in the same system of the specialized stations since there would be so many people looking for kills so they would have to send the roid light years away for reference going 5 light years at 3 aus takes 12 days refining the roid could take maybe 1 day then one would have haul it out of low sec for useone last thing is that i hope there isnt a new class of ships that can only do this id like to see big battleships to frigs able to do this mind you bigger ships can fit larger energy transfers
no i am not in favour of generating new weird and even more boring ways to mine ore in hopes of possibly solving the lowsec mining problem
would it actually be more boring youre committing a battleship or what have you for 47 minutes which is about 2 mining cycles there is huge risk of combat in every step and it would require much less player inputedit opps alt poast also i am not a miner i have never spent more than 1 hour my entire time in eve mining
not gonna support people like mining for some reason the key to start fixing mining is to nerf macro miners without hurting legitimate miners once the macros are out and the mineral prices balance then its time to figure out a way to make it more fun propose a way to nerf macro miners wo hurting legitimate players and youll have my support and probably the support of thousands of miners
due to the low production rate of extractors in high sec many components stand idle waiting for raw materials to gather in abundance during this time however they consume full cpu and power its easy to destroy them when they are not required but that then costs isk to rebuild them what about  standbyi propose 2 levels of standby level 1 offline consumes 50 of normal power and cpu when in standby mode consumes 100 of normal power and cpu when offlining consumes 150 of normal power and cpu when onlining onlineoffline takes 1 hour level 2 mothballed consumes 10 of normal power and cpu when in standby mode consumes 100 of normal power and cpu when offlining consumes 150 of normal power and cpu when onlining onlineoffline takes 24 hourscommand centres  no standby modelinks  no standby modeextractors can only be put into standby mode when not mining cannot route products when in standbyprocessors must stop processing before being put into standby mode cannot route products when in standby any items in store are lost when entering standbystorage cannot route products when in standby any items in store are lost when entering standbyspace ports cannot route products when in standby cannot send or receive goods when in standby any items in store are lost when entering standbythe use of this mode would be to run one set of extractors for a few days then another set to build up a stockpile while processors are mothballed then you standby the extractors and fire up the processors until the products are all generated then mothball the processors and repeat this enables you to gather all of the products required for various process jobs without having to destroy and then rebuild extractors and processors all of the time
youre allowed to have multiple extractors per processor you know if 11 makes sense in 00 and highsec is 13 as good make it a 31 ratio its not totally crazy but i dont think it is at all necessary
only 31on the planets around here 05 sec i have installed between 4 and 8 extractors to match the pace with a single basic processorif i want to take the next step constant tier 2 production means 1 advanced processor4 basic processors24 extractors based on 61storage linkseven without the links thats 6600 cpu and 23800 power  not even an elite command centre can match that being able to alternate between an extraction week and a processing week would be helpful

my corp has been war deced several times in the past few weeks id have to say that it hasnt been fun we arent a small corp eitheri ask that when there is a war dec all alts on the same account and all alts on other accounts created by the same person billing or contact information be valid targets if the war is declared mutual then all alts be considered valid war targets on both sides if the war is not mutual then only alts on the decing side are valid targetsi know that everyone is going to say that this has always been a part of eve but honestly in rl unless you are some sort of spy or identity thiefyou dont get to have eyes on your target at all times cva fell because of similar issueshavent you heard of the fog of war there is none in this game and no element of surprise its one thing to have a cloaked shipits another to have your enemy right next to you and able to sum up your entire fleet with the press of a button and for you to not be able to do anything about it without the fog of war everything comes down to numbers skill points and types of ships this would solve the remote repping problemfor an honest netural to remote rep is one thingfor some alt char to remote rep is just down right cheating
you pay isk to be able shoot everyone in a certain corporation or alliance that is all you should get if their alts bother you dec that corpalliance too
im not talking about the corp that does the war decing being able to shoot at any alts im talking about the defending corp that was deced being able to shoot at alts so the paying corp doesnt get to shoot at alts also most eyes are in noob corps so declaring a war on a noob corp with countless members probably isnt a good ideaif its even possible at least one fleet that was roaming in cva space right before they fell was nothing but neutrals cloaked up in completely random corps so in a null sec example youd have to war dec about 20 different corps just to be able to attack members of that fleet 24 hours after they already ganked you but null sec right so why bother my point is if you use alts to stab corp members in the back or if you use alts as eyes so no one knows who you really areor if you use alts to form a fleet in null sec and attack your enemy for corps that are nrds in null sec this obviously is a problemthere should be a way to track the connection between alts in game
it cant happen because of same reason you cant outlaw alts you can never know which alts belongs to who for sure and ccp earns too much money due to ittbh he has a point high sec wardeccers usually are telling the miningmission runningrookie corporations they wardec that eve is a pvp game and they shouldnt complain while at the same time they have alts for their own completely risk free isk making
let me get this straightyou want more war targets and your tired of wardecsyeah makes senseps i dare you to have the foolishness to tell me that only you can shoot said alternates thats just begging to get trolled
yes the game wont know its an alt if its on different accounts this wont work
i dont know how much more i can explain this if a corp is going to try and defend itself from a war dec it needs to be able to attack the pirate corp that is attacking them if the pirate corp can have eyes on you at all times and know exactly what your fleet is doingand you have no way to stop thathow can you even consider building a fleet to counter attack when the pirate corp has spent every second of their eve time training their toons skills up for tech 2 guns and tech 2faction ships you come in with a fleet of all battleships and they have a fleet twice your size just waiting you come in with 1 tech 2 recon they have a fleet of faction ships waiting its impossible to defend yourself because there is no element of surprise at least if they dont know youre coming you may stand somewhat of a chanceit is entirely possible to link accounts based on whoever is paying it and whoever supplied their contact info for the account you just have to carry that link into the game
first off your completely missing the pointsecondly did you realize that the spies your talking about are usually the ones in your corporationduhtime for you to walk away your wasting your timeyou have no concept of wardecs you barely understand the mechanics asking ccp to change it to the way you suggested it would completely unbalance a already broken mechanicwere done here im not feeding this troll anymore
yeah i think youre just mad cause youve used an alt for similar reasons yourselfthis would solve the problem of spies in a corp as well unless someone wants to tarnish their ingame persona which is not just one alt but all of their alts the entire point of ccp not allowing a player to change their name is to show that what you do in the game sticks with you im just trying to carry that to having alts as well your behavior in the game should reflect how all of your alts are treated seems simple enough honestly the only people that would have a problem with this are those that have cheated people in the game those that skip off to an alt why they war dec someone else those that form random fleets of random corps to attack a corp in null sec that has a nrds policy if you want to be a spy then by all means be oneim just saying that if eve is supposed to be like real life you shouldnt be able to pull the same trick twice you shouldnt be able to declare war on someone and then choose your battles based entirely on the fact that you always know what the enemy has at all times spies eyes corp hopping alts designed to not be targets to nrds corpsim not sure why youre getting all emotional about this im making a suggestion that makes perfect sense
heres the thing ccp only responds to unimportant issues anything that needs fixing like destroyer can go ignored for years
a friendly amendment please allow us to turn off the sound in all stations

i was borededit forgot the tickto explain the design i stuck to the current theme minus the centre of the buttons being opaque mostly its aimed at better visibility see the bottom row to see the visibility being tested and much broader visual differentiation between different states theres no overheat button though as clicking with both mouse buttons or holding a modifier key instead would mostly eliminate accidentally overheating a modulei just noticed i forgot the overheatingbutnotnextcycle one its centre is the same as the overheating button with the green blinking active halo
supported if the overload option was in the middle of the module icon but was given more surface space so it can be clicked without deactivating the module may help
and a hotkey combo plz
still supporting thisin a game like eve having to rely on self made lists of people to avoid buying stuff from is a little irritatingccp move the blocks client side so we can block anyone or everyone if we want you mean minmax it does not work in this way if you put any nonzero number in the min box then it removes all want to buy contracts even changing this would be good

likely living up to namesake hersch that only applies to nooblet op no offense to other gals in this thread and yes theres at least one watching this thread for sure
hello mr smartguy i vote to have this troll thread filtered
i was thinking about something much less dramatic than replacing csm with a forum poll and no  this is not a trollfor example assembly hall is full of threads from people who want their side of the game boosted and also nerf everything else that they are not using  be it a ship play style or something else in the game when you look at some nonsense of a topic you simply know that the original poster is just trolling whining or just dont understand how the game works i dont see how that kind of ideas are constructive and relevant to the csmexamples of some topics that will never get even 5 of positive comments defensive ecm bursts in highsec make highsec wars in 810 sec mutual an idea on how to eliminate power blocks pay plex to double training speed missions to get out of wardecs and more just browse the recent topicsnow i would love to hear how are these topics constructive or in any way relevant to csm
the first thread you mentioned ecm bursts actually has some merit although cannot be supported in its current form the rest are crap though
its simple fix ram if it needs to be 200 units then remove the damage and adjust ram blueprint accordingly
ankhs number one priority is not the csm it is ankh
casiellayou may well be right still a gentle caution not to jump the gun here most of the csm represents a narrow range of special interests mynxee acknowledges an antiank sentiment and weve little idea of the neutrality ie absence of political bias of these meeting notes most of us have seen these dynamics in other public private or nonprofit spheres no surprise there setting up a separate issueswiki may indeed be a mistake or it may be a smart move to avoid politicized bickering and scapegoating so lets see what happens here and hold all the members of the csm accountable for collaborating doing a good job and representing the interests of the entire eve community delilah
not in those minutes she acknowledged disagreeing with ankh on some issues there is a rather large difference since im a helpful alt troll here are the raw logs for the first meeting and here are the raw logs for the second hope that helpsoh and come back when you have a clue what youre talking about
thanks for linking these threads it will make it easier for folks to follow what is going on at the same time please consider that my thoughts on special interests sentiments and neutrality are not dependent on one set of minutes i think youll find it useful both in and out of eve to consider alternative meanings to words and actions before firing off a hostile response delilah
oh hey look its someone who doesnt get the difference between i disagree with you and i am automatically opposed to everything you stand for furthermore sss rabble rabblealso lawling at ankh two meetings two paranoid meltdowns awesome
to be fair the fact that mynxee appears to be the former and not the latter is making me reconsider my vote for her
i guess and evil griefers that like pvp hold a grudge ehreap what you sow
no delilah is quite right from the minutes linked above mynxee didnt say she disliked ankh but acknowledged that the sentiment exists we do need to see how things play out since the term just began and we have 12 months to go
ignore this i cant find a delete button
ok thanks for the information 
no worriesfor the record ive hassled them again today id like to get it sorted
itd be nice to know  else ill have to convince mynxee to give linux a go so she can see the pros and cons of using it herselfid like someone to champion the relativity simple and not so labour intensiverequest of having the windows client compiled using wine unix windows comparability layer libraries in order for the client to be made available from the official sitei know from the tone of the devblogs that ccp does not really want to alienate this rugged proud and independent community so very similar in character to themselves
id rather have ccp use resources on fixing stuff than catering for an os with less than stellar performance in games
you know what  youre right what was i thinkinglinux runs eve with a bit of encouragement how stellar can you get
i believe eve did have a linux client at one point but it was abandoned since wine was easier to set up and was giving a better experience to boot i think theyve since said that theyd rather work on improving the windows clients compatibility with wine than maintain 3 separate client bases
good luck looks like a pretty decent group this go around too 
to the csmi read that there was only a 12 turnout for voting from the eve player base would it not be ideal to make a request to ccp to possibly add vote beacons in certain areas of the eve universe eg new player hubs market hubsa pilot warps to the vote beacon activates it and then they are presented with a selection list each selection also links to a url for the csm candidate
improving csm visibility is always something we work on  im sure well talk about it with xhagen and diagoras when we are in iceland
might not seem like much but it was nearly double the previous election there was a lot more blogging tweeting and forum discussion on this and other forums this time around and i noticed ccp gave csm events more splash screen notices dev blogs etc the trick is going to be to maintain that momentum and build on it with each election responsibility for that is shared by candidates ccp and the community the other key is building csm credibility that can only be done by showing results which means proposed featureschangesideas actually implemented rather than disappeared into the backlog we can invest many many hours of time discussing analyzing and recommending and believe me we do spend those hours but unless there is a result to point at and say that got done because of our work with ccp the players will remain skeptical of csms effectiveness can hardly blame them hopefully our status as stakeholders will give us more influence over priorities going forward ccp has some responsibility for highlighting tangible cms accomlishments as well if they want to stop getting  from players about csm being a worthless exercise in marketing for example every set of patch notes should have csm labels next to the items that csm championed if there are not at least several of those on every expansions patch notes then houston we have a problem
even having a vote icon under station management for when csm elections come round would be another optionreminding players of the csm is lost as soon as the player logs in to eve you may have the news banner on the right of the screen when you select your character or the information banner above the login box once you are past those screens anything to do with the csm is lost and forgotten about and that is a shameanother option would be for ccp to allow csm candidates to produce an evemail that can be sent to all active players this is one way for the candidates to canvas the user base
i believe i had notified mynx that i wouldnt be able to be there but apparently i didnt apologies
i completely agree with this initiative raising csm credibility and especially visibility will be key when i ran for csm4 i got a lot of blank stares from pilots that didnt know what the csm was let alone the impact they can have on the game by accomplishing this goal and gaining a higher visibility the csm will gain more leverage with ccp in completing the implementations that it initiates ahs
i love the way ankblablupblipblop gets sidetrackedkeep up the good work

hello
supporting the legolike station idea
youre skipping over solutions to chase a big ideayou say that plex pvp only happens around downtimethis is true thus the solution to your timezone not enjoying plex in the same way is to fix the broken spawning mechanicyou say that npcs unbalance the plexthis is true it is their ewar that is unbalanced and it needs to be removed from all navy npcsboth these issues have been known for a long time and ccp has taken no actionthese major changes arent needed just 2 very simple broken things that have been known about since day 1 need to be fixed
even though i already cancelled all my accounts i support this i hope ccp gets their act together until then ill look for my gaming fix somewhere elsetyrannis is a pot s and not worthy of being called an expansion
i agree with this 100ccp needs to finish on and continue to improve on expansions and stop this policy of rushing features out the door half baked and then dropping them to work on the next new thingi also would like to see a more open bug tracking and reporting process maybe an open list of known bugs possibly with some type of priority level to be fixedplayers could submit new bugs or add information to an already existing case players could also try and say how sever the issue is for them so ccp could prioritize and fix the bugs that are most important to players first
just another thumbs up to add to the ball
of course im supporting but i doubt ccp will ever really shift their focus ive just about had it with ccps baitandswitch routine
support of course
supported
maybe in your reality but not in ours  at best 1020 of the effort was on code repair imo tyrannis was 70 pi and 20 meaningless ui changes and no amount of spin will change that sure there were bug fixes but nearly all were minor bugs hardly anyone cared about meanwhile were still playing this broken game year after year because theres nothing better out there in the same vein but the minute there is the clock starts ticking for ccp in fact im pretty sure it already is theres way too many professional programmers and such in this game and they know people who know people
yes yes yesrather soon not soon
supported
agree
fully agree
i fully and wholeheartedly support this and hope ccp reads it and responds to it in some manner if nothing else
i think that if they made the next expansion one that focuses on expanding thereby finishing whats already present then about 60 of the problems are gone they would have to find some way to make it more marketable than just hey we fixed some broken features but you get the idea perhaps have two expansions a year one focusing on new material the other to expand and improve existing material in the 6 month intervals they have goingpersonally i think the reason behind the big push of new materials is to try and keep people playing eve when star trek online comes out i love eve and have no intention of jumping ship but thats not to say others wontsupported d
i strongly encourage this and as alongtime player i certainly do hope ccp does whats been suggested here
im a bit concerned about the way things are turning out regarding the recently released expansionsfull support
this thread appeals to my interests
full support from me we dont need new stuff we want the stuff that was promised but under delivered
needs more thumbs
absolutely supported ccp have made a great game polish up the existing dont leave half finished bits hanging
supported ccp said themselves that 6 months isnt even enough time for the csm to do anything worthwhile thus extending into a 12 month period how do you expect to full on create a brand new patch of gaming software of this magnitude in 6 months when its claimed that you cant even talk about it effectively in that time
yupp its true ccp has to look more at theyr excellent features

yes please new content can be based on previous content while ccp feel they need new content to keep current subscribers making current content easier to use ie ui updates or adding challenges ie improve fw will make the game more complete

1 3 and 4 i agree with 2 i think has a better solution  make storage facilities and spaceports upgradeable like linksthough with a different scale  each upgrade costs exactly as much fittingisk as a storage facility and gives you exactly as much space that way you can avoid stupid routing problems from having multiple storage facilities without getting any sort of advantage to doing it one way or the other and 5 i dont think is actually a problem  every expansion has profit sources for the people who are paying attention and the scale of it is small enough that it doesnt bother me itll go away soon enough still supported in general
my largest problem with pi is that specific 00 systems that are player sov are not usable in pi because ccp says so you cant even view the planets hw is an example toss that in there and i will gladly support this 
i dont think he meant that the storage needs to be increased to have less warehouses in the network but instead decrease the cpu and pgrequirements of warehouses which id fully support theyre just too demanding for a simple building that does nothing but beeing mainly big and hollow
yeah i was referring to the cpu and more importantly pw demands i think ccp need to spend a little more time invested in balancing those two things in genreal anyways but its especially egregious with storage facilitiesim not sure to what you are referring here are you saying that you are part of the sov holder in that region but that some planets are still off limits or that you cant place pi in other peoples sovif the former you should note thet there are some highsec planets unavailable as well it could have rp or other purposes which we arnt aware of
sov holder where entire systems are unusable despite the fact we hold sov this is most definitely not ccps response to me asking why as i would never post a gm response we are the native faction we did not request this if they are referring to guristas i call bull 
the other thread in fi that jin mentions is here
that seems really odd but at the same time im hesitant to include it because i was looking at more basic fixes and it seems to be intended same thing with having customs offices in wh or 00 its kinda of dumb but it gets the job done ill mark it tentative
oh that the reasoning behind that is simple they want pi to be something you cant afk usefully its designed to force people to deal with it daily and if you could have useful amounts of storage then you might not need to move goods around every few days it was specifically intended to promote terrible gameplay i dont like it but it wont change
my apoligies if im posting in the wrong area but this looked like the best fitsuggestion for pi improvement allow players to logically remove power and cpu from existing structures and links removing power and cpu costs nothing while bringing things back on line takes isk by logically i mean if a mid link or structure is deactivated everything tied in upstream is also deactivatedim guessing most players are extracting several materials at once and this would allow a more efficient use of factories and extractors as the market shifts production can be ramped up or decreased
agreed also i would like to add 2 points6 could the customs office be given an access customer office button in the selected item window i find it strange that i have to right click it you cant target it so if necessary replace that button7 on the planets tab of science and industry either could the view planet button of the screen be moved closer to the minimise button or better still minimise the dialog when pressed
good point
i feel the need for a great justice bump so thins isnt shelved
supported
more importantly give us back our folders a lot of people lost a lot of data when they were removed obviously the contacts are still there but the folders are invaluable metadata that give meaning and context to the contacts
well honestly its no different in the sense of security than say align to a celestial and having a bm in between but just makes it more convienent to be able to warp to ss
supported
mmm yeah
i feel this would also be a minor boost to losec as mission runners can align to a good safe inside the mission

you obviously have no idea what you are talking about you say yourself arties got other advantages  damage switching trackingboosting ammo no cap usaged which is for sure a major advantage and yet their ships do more dps in general tempest has 2 dmg bonuses maelstrom has rof bonus which give more dps than damage bonus so minmatar ships do more damage in general on the other hand amarr primary beam users got range bonusesapoc zealot and still a lot greater dps alphafor apoc and tracking than gallente shipsand if you were ever involved in some medium and even large scale fighting which i really doubt you wouldve know that alpha strike is as important as dps and doing 4 times the alpha of another weapons platform is gonna be better than doing like 5 more dps in most caseswhere did you ever get that idea theyre nothing at all like halflaser halfprojectile weaponsyou are wrong hybrids are called that as they are both projectile and energy weapons as the projectile itself is meant to create a field of extremely hot plasma around it much to the same effect as laser weapons in addition to the initial massive kinetic forceive been flying amarr for more than an year now and about half an year in minmatar ships so youre kinda wrong
can we keep all our support behind 1 topic instead of multiple ones
oh god not another hybrid threadunfortunatly your blaster suggestion is poor moar range is not what blasters need its the last thing they needi agree that hybrids do need to be rebalanced with the other weapons systems out there but just simple damage boosts are not going to cut it the biggest problem with balancing hybrids comes from the fact that two races with very diferent combat philosophies use themalso the thing about alpha being king in sniper fleet fights is a bigger problem with gameplay than weapons systems there are some combat changing suggestions being bounced around at the minute to look into this issueone of them is here
blasters need a dpstracking buff not a range buff but that would be nice and buffing rail dps between arty and lasers would be nice and do to the 250km range cap an apoc can match a rokh in range and deal more dpspsfor rails this is going in the right direction
1k dps blaster brutix does not need more dps it does not need more of anything whatever happened to buffing prophecy cyclone and such ships that suck by design
and why shouldnt we double blaster optimalplease visit your user settings to reenable images40km blaster optimal thats 840 dps out to 40km  20km fall off editoh for gods sake the image wont show up
i wouldnt care if i got less isk for mission running if the ops ideas where incorporated fun  isk
yet another ankh idea ive thought about myself it wouldnt matter if it was just a couple random branches or a diablostyle randomized dungeonit would make things a lot more interesting but the likelihood of ccp even considering this idea is probably less than zero like pretty much every good idea their presented with
the main reason i hate pve is because it is unchallenging repetitive and makes me wish i was lobotomized after doing 2 of them at least make them fun or suprising anything better then what it is nowan overhaul of the pve system is long overdue
this gets my vote a million times i believe ccp wants us to interact with each others providing people with a common worthy enemy is a great deal more effective than setting up everyone versus everyone and be like lets go kill somethingthis dynamic system will ad palpable value to eve hey what do i know the harassing whines might stop at least a little and people just might start getting things done together
this project describes something similar to what ive been thinking for several years now is missing in eves pvei support this and would like to see it ported to all pve that is missions complexes sleeper sites those have the same issues despite the improved ai  which i deem barely acceptable   and even occasional belt rat spawns
then why else would u possibly make ed excuses to nerf suicide ganking as u said its your problem so deal with it no thats what selfdestruct is for do u know why its called suicide ganking its cause its the intention to destroy the targetgotta have a target to be a gank moron the payment is part of the deal because1normal eve insurance is buying insurance to compensate u for ship loss as long as u didnt repackage it or someone else boards it period the selected item will be insured while in your possession for the duration of the contract repackaging the item will void the contract the contract will be considered void if the item or ship is destroyed while being in the possession of somebody else do you accept the above terms and still want to insure the selected itempoint out where it says otherwise2 semantics with riskconsequences aka 100 risk seriously whats so special about 100 that its somehow the only magic number to void insurance by how would 99 or even 98 probability of destruction by endangering a ship in any way to bring about certain destruction qualify as not being insurance fraud its still high enough for an insurance payout to be certain so why should the insurance company pay up because theres a slim chance u couldve failed in committing insurance fraud your whole post is as ed as u r simply because ure trying to tie guaranteed concordrelated ship loss with the sole intention of destroying ones own ship just for payment when even a slightly less 99 chance of loss is somehow not insurance fraud to u epic failtheres no difference at all as explained by the above and technically suicide ganking is pvp its just nonconsensual like regular ganking and blobbing fyiall uve done is attempt to separate suicide ganking from every other form of pvp and cry about it just like the others that want someone else to hold their hand when they want high sec to be 100 safe like u said its yourstheir problemdeal with itor u can keep coming up with other flimsy excuses modified logic and any other brand new ways to failso what else u got
doublepost from editing
i didnt read through all of that wall of text but just to repeat againwhen you destroy the ship to collect insurance fees its insurance fraud when you try to keep the ship alive to the best of your abilities and thus trying to prevent yourself from collecting insurance its eve pvpin the first case you have a conflict of interest that runs counter to insurance in the 2nd your interest align with the insuranceask for specifics if theres anything you still dont understand
not supportedyou high sec bears need a taste of living every now and then nobody should ever feel comfortable ratting in a mutlibillion dollar golem or pressing that delicious autopilot button while shipping a thousand t2 droens from jita to osmeden in their badgeri just cant stand the thought of industrialists and mission running lap dogs of the empire existing with low blood pressure
supported when ganking industrials with billions of cargo or pimpboats with billions of deadspace mods cost of a gank phoon is chump change insurance fraud need a gimp suicide ganking does not need to be costfree everything in eve cost isks so swallow it and htfu this whinning is getting old
more like u ignored it cause it actually refuted your sorry excuse of an argument troll first of all ure not destroying the ship just to collect insurancelike i said before ure taking out the target via suicide gankgotta have a target to be a gank moron but by your logic sending a ship into a losing battle is also insurance fraud since its a 100 chance of destruction and trying to warp out before concord arrives or the blob tackles u is technically trying to keep the ship alive to the best of your abilities and preventing insurance despite the fact ure gonna get blown up in either case second the insurance contract says nothing relating to how insurance is collectedtry reading it sometime so maybe u wouldnt have to continue hiding in your ignorance lmfao t1 insurance already got nerfed but of course ure too ignorant to realize it funny how the ignorant and stupid carebear tries to act all hard when hes the one crying so much and not even attempting to htfu and adapt eve does not cater to stupidity so ure a moron if u still expect ccp to hold your hand after all this timethen again is this post too long for u or is it too true cause maybe the truth hurts so much that ure just gonna continue ignoring my arguments and continue repeating yourself
and you resort to name calling instead of trying to understand the differenceeve insurance is a game mechanic device to make pvp viable its purpose is not to earn npc money its not a matter of margins but of principle as its never intended to make npc moneylet me repeat again when you destroy your own ship with intent to collect insurance its insurance fraud when you try to keep your ship alive but sometimes fail and ended up collecting insurance its pvp in one case you try to collect in the other you try to not collect the alignment of interests is in opposite directions this difference of principle is black and white
ittgroup 1 hey people getting insurance payouts for breaking the law in highsec that seems kind of stupidgroup 2 what do you mean there should be consequences for my actionssupported though i will say that maybe laws in general need working over and that this is just a bandaid solution to a bigger problem
there is no difference moron only u failrefuse to understand that suicide ganking is still pvp just like regular ganking and blobbing so thats why insurance covers it as welllet me repeat again ure not destroying your ship via selfdestruct concord is your intent is destroying the target and warping away to attempt to evade concord is trying to keep the ship alive too but why should that alone should qualify for insurance when it has nothing to do with the insurance contractthe selected item will be insured while in your possession for the duration of the contract repackaging the item will void the contract the contract will be considered void if the item or ship is destroyed while being in the possession of somebody else do you accept the above terms and still want to insure the selected itemis any of this getting through to u probably not
goose is a moron for wasting his breath on you youre not a moron just a troll why would someone exploiting a loophole admit the loophole exists people lie for money youre no different its stupid to try to make people admit the truth when its against their interests they already know just pretend not to happens all the time
well if he wasnt such a moron he wouldnt be wasting his breath if he didnt repeat the same stupid  so many times simply because he was so blissfully ignorant of the responses to his posts and once again upon reading the contract its no loophole cause i didnt repackage it nor did i let someone else board it which were the only conditions what possible loophole can there be in such a brief contract remember its not real money and its not real life
we already have pillow launchers ever heard of rocket launchers
this could tie into pi as well goose farms goose extractors produce geese process into down combine with textiles  pillows
im sure there is a whole package of tweaks wed like to see in pi for example the current routing algorithm is appears to be static after you change the network of links the routes do not seem to recompute to spread the load over all the available paths and you have to manually reroute things it would be nice if this was done automaticallyif people could post their pi wishlists in this thread and gather them from other threads please pretty please with sugar on it we can discuss them here and ill work up a csm submission
supported this is the entire reason i am not setting up on a planet until i can use elite ccs

note this is in no way a gripe or a whine against ninja salvagescan tippers or anyone who enjoys using such mechanics to there advantage im not here to buff or nerf this is strictly about the aggression counter so if your here to flame me then please do stfu and move along have a nice day and enjoy your complimentary cookie for reading thissome time ago i was enjoying a level 4 with my corp mates when we got visited by a tech 1 frigate who was intent on pilfering our hard earned work yes yes im aware of all that bullcrap about it not being our property and what not im not here to debate point is we where intent on claiming that as our own so i locked him up and made it clear i was intending to make my point clear he went blinky and then i opened up on his shiny little rear end and sent him screaming awaynow at this point most noobs fall prey to the gank that takes place when he goes to get a bigger ship not intending to repeat history i ordered my fleet to warp off to some deep space and sat there for about 10 minutes the aggression counter was ticking down predictably at 15 minutes so i knew i was going to be freeforall to him and his corp if applicableeventually i docked up and sat there you undock with said counter it warns you that your in a nasty situation that may involve you getting shot at i moved my mouse cursor over the timer and could see there was 2 timers one was the standard and there was an unkown classic eve glitch ehi waited until the timer finished no more pop up window i waited an another 5 to 10 minutes and then went back to finish my missiononly to see a tengu warp in and light my ass up ouchnow let me clear something up1 aggression counter is gone nada zip plus 10 minutes since that point2 i didnt shoot the tengu as i was busy killing something else3 drones where stowed didnt need them at the timeeveryone i spoke too tells me that he should have been concordd would have been a classic epic fail moment to be sure but instead he was able to shoot me without restrainti petitioned this not for my ship mind you but for clarifcation if not indicating a problemi was told paraphrased that they are aware of the problem and its a legitimate mechanic that pilots can shoot wrecks to extend the aggression timer atwill to keep said victim free to open fire onnow id be first to call that an exploit because there is no indication of such a thing taking placehowever i admit this is a legitimate albeit nasty and disgusting profession and i cannot on good conscience as a participant of these boards screamcrywhine about itmy problem is that there was no timer whatsoeverwhat is the point of having an aggression timer that doesnt show up when being extendedeverything ive read researched discussed even pilots who do this for fun gank baiting via ninja salvaging have told me that the 15 min timer is the golden rulestandard if i didnt encourage more aggression and theres no timerhe should have been concorddcontinued on next post
that said i propose the following be done1 aggression timer gets updatedfixedpatched to indicate any changes or extensions of that timer in any form or fashion to indicate to you that your able to get shot at2 aggression timer is yanked out and removed entirely as at this point there is no relevant reason to keep something that is completely useless and broken3 remove the exploitive nature of extending a timer by shooting wreckscans when no notice is given to owner thereby going back to the standard 15 minute rules so to speak and in all honesty that timer should be extended by the one that shoots back not the one that does the ninja salvagingcan tipping but thats a messy businessproscons1 no changes to mechanic other than the pilot who shot at ninja salvager is aware that ninja salvager can shoot back no cons2 pros ninja salvagers and can tippers get an unspecified amount of time and its a guessing game cons its a guessing game for everyone3 pros ninja salvagers cant exploit the system by extending the time to shoot back 15 minutes is all you get cons depends on your perspective but 15 minutes is an awful lot of time to respond for crying out loudpersonally i prefer 1 keeps balance and no one loses anything other than knowledge that the situation is getting extendedagain i knew what i was getting into and i have no qualms about what took placebut i was told understood aggression timer means you can get shot atno aggression counter means im safe for the most part invisible aggression counter is bad stupidso yeah flame away and make with the whining xand i feel its unbalanced
i agree that either the timer should be fixed optimal or removed viable since having a broken mechanic designed to level the playing that can be exploited so easily in a way that makes it unbalanced is absurd the fact that ccp knows about this issue but chooses not to fix it in some way is infuriating the timer is there to tell you that you are in combat and at risk if the timer is there you should be at risk if the timer is not there you should be safe i acknowledge the fun of ninja salvaging ive done it myself but even i think this is insanely unfair to the people who think theyre fine only to be blasted to bits due to a broken mechanic i support any of the mentioned remedies preferably fixing the timer or removing the ability to extend the timer
insist on escalating your petition if it really was like you said then its a firstclass exploitso just to clear it up he shoots your wrecks and your agressiontimer gets an extension thats just rediculous
heres how this exploit and it is a blatant exploit ccp has made no pains to eliminate worksget aggro from target in missionmining area aggro party leaves to safe or dock upreturn and find a wreck or jetcan and plink it every 30 seconds just make sure it doesnt pop a scram works well for thisthis will maintain aggression for up to 30 minutes this was the longest duration i could be arsed to confirm after the victims timer has lapsed if not longervictim thinks theyre clear and returns to the missionmining area to be happily bbqdcorp mate lost an orca to this exploit docked for 30 minutes after initial aggro undocked and got pwnt but ccp said it was not a reimbursable lossthis hole needs to be patched
legitimate my ass thats just broken how blind do you have to be to see that as working as intended
bingohonestly the bit about extending the aggression timer isnt my beef its the lack of an aggression timer periodhowever i admit its rather exploitative as far as how you highlighted it
modal popup dialogs are a terrible ui choice in any game that cant be paused especially one like eve where the death penalty is so high no dialog that pops up should ever be modal period frankly there is no reason for these to exist at all its only more bad coding and design on ccps part if some other element of the ui needs to be locked down fine but locking down the entire game is simply unacceptable im sure this has already been brought up but seriously the csm should push this
yep modal dialogs are bad

heres a fun word you must have missed in preschoolpreparation
and im sure that response makes lots of sense in preschool as well
yeah these are silly
i think there is general agreement that aacrc has been rendered almost useless and certainly onerous by the sheer number of threads that blanket it literally any subdivisions would be improvement but for simplicity i recommend1 highsecurity corp subforum2 lowsecurity corp subforum3 nullsecurity corp subforum4 alliance recruitment subforumthe only argument i can foresee against this idea is but my corporation hangs out in all security space i cant possibly put myself in any of those categories to this i answer sure you can where is your standard base of operations where do you normally roamindustrify remember this is a measure to declutter the horrible claptrap that is aacrc my guess is that in the future youre much more likely to get pilots reading your thread when they dont have to wade through mountains of threads theyre not interested in

so recently i had a deja vu moment and thought i updated my clone when in reality it was prior to my last death this caused me to lose over a month of training which brought much frustration and prompted the question what benifit does this bring to the game and does the benifit if any outweigh the frustration and loss of players as im sure people have quit over this before its easy to say up on your high horse if youve never forgot to update your an idiot live and learn but in reality it is an honest and simple mistake anyone could make it is in my opinion this brings more frustration and hardship to the game than enjoyment a suitable death penalty is already in place with loss of shipimplants and clone costs why is the simple act of forgetting to update take it to such a higher level for this reason i am proposing the addition of a 1 limit backup clone in the game that might only be able to be put in 1 selected station and is difficult to obtain either through cost or something like a special mission once obtained it stays there and is only activated if you regular clone cannot cover the the skill points this still provides incentive to update with the difficulty of obtaining and renewing the backup clone if it is activated but lessens the severity of fist pounding and broken monitors im sure many players have gone through without even providing enjoyment to othersif it did provide enjoyment to others somehow i wouldnt be proposing this but whoever kills you doesnt even realize you didnt have an updated clone for the satisfaction yes eve is cold hearted and should stay that way its my belief this would enhance the overall experience of eve not degrade it looking forward to your responses but please no one on there high horse posting youre an idiot learn to update actually evaluate the proscons the current system and the proposed system have thanks
as someone who made that mistake once i say you screwed up learn from iti play eve instead of other mmos just for the fact there is risk associated with screwing upif you screw up eve will punish you through loss of ship loss of isk or even loss of spif you dont like being penalized for dying either dont die or find a game that doesnt have a penalty for it  they are out therei like my mistresses harsh cold and pretty  probably why i play eve
i agree the extra risk in eve should stay and should stay as coldhearted and as cut throat as it is but you failed to list the benifits this gives to the game risking expensive ships gives you excitement and enjoyment and objective to those trying to take you out this isnt the case for sp loss can you think of any benifits like the rest of the risk in eve carries
you screwed up by your own admission and now all of eve needs to change to protect you from your own forgetfullnessi want to know why a mechanic the rest of of us have adapted to as a natural consequence of foolishness or forgetfullness has to be changed just because now it affected youby the way thank you for bringing the topic up my clone was 2 grades out of date and im heading to wormhole space tommorow  that could have sucked
i dont want to argue its fine that you dont support this but i would like to point out i dont think you answered the question of the benifits of the current system over the proposed system reguardless of this petitions outcome i will not recieve my sp back so this isnt about me screwing up i posted here because i genuinely believe this proposal or something similar like an option to automatically update and remove the isk from your wallet when you die would benifit eve by lowering frustration while not sacrificing any enjoyment lets keep the discussion to the proscons of this idea please
thats my issue right there being a sitting duck in a pve fit because my agent tosses me low sec missions which due to changes in tyrannis happens more often than getting a high sec mission taking a standing hit by declining 3 missions so i dont have to go low sec isnt an acceptable solution for a mission runner if the agent is in high sec space and giving out low sec missions you shouldnt have to take a standing hit or take a very small one to decline the low sec missions
ill be in turnur liang
want a better solution remove missions from empire or low sec
man youre pretty insightful these daysliang
it would definitely fix the problem cant argue that
2 minutes what is with this misconception lowsec is packed with pirates waiting to kill youive been running plexes in a drake in lowsec followed expeditions and taken deadspace loot back to highsec and most locals never bothered to scan for me if there even was anyone therei lost 2 or 3 drakes in half a year and got billions in loot
most empire carebears seem to have this huge misconception that low sec is filled to the brim with probing gatecamping pirates in every system just waiting for an unsuspecting victim to jump in they are of course wrong because low sec is largely empty but good luck convincing them of that
what they arent wrong about is that a pirate will likely visit them through the course of the night we roam pretty far and wide trying to find anything moving and many of us take scan probe launchers on the roams really just watch dscan when theres someone in local with you but even still the sad truth is that most agents in low sec really arent worth bothering with over a much better agent in high seclianged btw carebears stay away from my agents that i worked hard to secure i want to carebear in peace with my 13 billion isk pve ship in low sec

remove kill rights theres no need for them people should know the dangers of going in lowsec and why exactly does 00 not have themkilling someone in lowsec gives you these penalitiessec lossaggresionkill rights that last foreverbut by far kill rights is the worst thing on that list if a person wants to play the revenge card then he can freely locate me and try to kill me but he shouldnt have a way to kill me in high sec when he sees fitmy char flies a freighter in hi sec and on autopilot one pvp kill and i will have to use an alt si say we make kill rights 24 hours max but the victims for those 24 hours gets to see what ship his murderer is in and his locationthis will in return make for some interesting pvp fights that doent involve 5 hours of docking games and will encourage low sec activity  pvp
if you want to be a pirate be prepared to pay all costsmy pirate has only been attacked by a single player with kill rights unsuccessfully and they attacked me with an orca of all things lol while i was missioning with a tengu thanks for the deadspace fit gila sorry about the hulk 
just throwing ideas here about make low sec better and probably making people go in there more often than highsec i also realise that this kind of post as being posted but another one cant hurthere are some facts first theres lots of mission runners in highsec lots of people in highsec too much if you ask me rewards in low sec is not substantial when compared to highsec null sec rewards are substantial compared to lowsecproblem lowsec is emptyreason 1 its not rewarding enough for missions about the same bounties and rewards2 exploration gives about the same payout rewards to highsec3 when you engage someone in lowsec you lose security status which could cause you to stop you from going to highsec gate and station guns do not protect the pilot enough 4 pilots in space can get scanned way too easyif these are solved i believe people will populate low sec a bit more solutions to these problems1 make the rewards substantial for the mission runners in case you dont know ccp they do risk there ship when doing missions and because scanning is so easy they wont go there2when doing exploration make sure the payout give you lots more isk in return seriously ive scanned in low sec for a while and the payout is the same with radar sites for example than in highsec 3the most shocking of all dont change anything but when you engage someone dont remove security status lossnothing else dont touch the gcc only the securty statusim not asking much here4mhhh this might seem stupid but how about some neut towers on gates and stations that would make rr battleships gatecamping a bit harderif not impossible in the end that would tell people that you wont lose your ship if you enter low sec space5 this one might not be liked but its just ideas anyway make scanning ships a bit harderor at least the ones in missions that way mission runners would be more appealed by this feature if they go in low sec the would still be vulnerable on gates stations and such6 more entry points to go inside low sec less chance of getting caught in a gatecamp the same could apply to null sec entry pointsnote i realise number 4 is kinda debatable but ask a mission runner or anyone why they wont go in low sec  one of the answer would be i hate gatecamps those in lowsec are usually done from pirates corps with a load of battleship which are able to tank the sentry guns so either neut towers should do the trick no cap no rr theres not a lot of ships that will be able to tank in this situation
kill rights too remove them imo
supporting my own topic because no one else does
i am xeraos and i approve this message
its annoying enough before a buff
probably 120 times a day the question is asked how do i join chat channelsthen on the accessability front the removal of zoom buttonsor the font issueccp have often shown that usability and accessability are not their strong suitsteps should be taken to improve these areas of qa testing
ccp needs to farm out the ui work entirely its clear their either incapable of doing it right or simply dont care of course the same could be said of bugfixing game balance meaningful content additionsi fear tyrannis may have been the last straw for a lot of us the next six months will make or break eve for me and ccps record so far gives me little confidnence
no guys usability testing is not about watching tutorials or playing on the test server its about inviting users not employees or csm give them a list of tasks and observe their every action like the author says itll force most programmers to rethink most of their wonderful creations although they are so rarely qualified to handle user interfaces that said eves ui is being used to display massive amounts of information and do an incredible amount of tasks i think it does pretty well but i can think of dozens of improvements i also know that whatever i can think off more than 90 will be deemed complete nonsense when exposed to serious usability testing
its just like rl politics  those with the resources to stuff the ballot box will get a seat at the table i suspect this is by design so ccp can say its what the people voted for and then do what they wouldve done anyway ie more pvp content more propirate game changes removal of more useful functions addition of more meaningless functions etc
itt people butthurt because the csm didnt get their pet change patched onto tq within a week
1 large blobby alliance have fairly consistently gotten 34 csm members  in csm5 theres vuk lau korvin and sokratesz thats a strong contingent but its still a minority and from the assorted survey results ive seen its a decently representative number 2 people in large blobby alliances tend to like small gang warfare and tend to do pve just as much as most other people ask vuk about his rattlesnake collection sometime 3 look at the issues that have been raised in the past i see no real bias to 00 empires in them
the goal of any antimacro solution should be to make mining require players to do something that cannot me automated or at least cannot be automated effectively and to do so without changing mining so that it cannot be done casuallymy suggestion for this is to make mining more visual what i mean by this is to have visual properties of the asteroid be what determines its contentthis means removing typespecific information from the overview and other sources heres a full list of suggested changes remove typespecific labels for asteroids in the overview and directional scanner have them only say asteroid or something remove typespecific labels and images from the targeted asteroid again having the name just say asteroid and maybe a generic roid image remove typespecific information from asteroids in the cargohold in this case all veldspars could just be listed as veldspar in the hold making them behave a bit like bpcsbut we cant remove all of this information without giving players a way to determine yield so we should increase the effectiveness of scanners and make them more visual change roid scanners to be more like the pi resource scan overlaying colors on the roid to determine the quality of the roid introduce subtle graphical differences without scan between different qualtiy roids of the same type introduce lower quality ores in asteroids no actual player would sit there and harvest something for lesser yield make it so asteroids dont disappear when depleted just make the stupid macro harvest depleted veldspar for 10 the regular yield
the only way to prevent bots is for ccp to actually do ban bots and also ban isk buyers
yes macros recognize colors and shapes your pi map wont help
its not to make macroing outright impossible but to make it more difficult for them and at the least would stop your smalltime macroers from just making thier ownalso wouldnt determining which roid it is in space be a bit difficult for a macro program with other roids in the view and such
the macros will just adapt their programs in the meantime its taking up ccps resources to implement and annoying the rest of the nonmacroing playerbasenot supported
supported in principle but not in practicea lot of your ideas are neat but they wouldnt help macro mining in any great capacity theyd probably kill off the lower end macro miners who only do it because its got a low risk to profit to difficulty ratio but beyond thatif you believe mining needs a revamp and by christ it does then by all means work on a revamp but its a bad idea to try and revamp mining based on how macro miners operate because macro miners can adapt much faster than ccp can mining being difficult to macro should be an emergent sideeffect nothing more
yes please
hes talking about moving a vehicle not a dwelling so your analogy is way off when i brought my car to the states from germany they did not disassemble it before putting it on the transport ship it was transported and delivered in one peicei support this idea
agree with the pirate agents comment it makes no sense that most of the best corp agents are in lowsec there should be independent faction and pirate stations there and nothing else well maybe the occasional really well defended navy station a frontier fort kind of thing but those should be rare
yes it does more risk more rewardalso im miyamoto isoruku and i dont support this thread
sadly i dont think you can put pirate agents in lowsec as lowsec is still empire space while id like to see them there i sadly dont see it as fittingas to removal of all agents from lowsec you best be trolling if youre not well you should stay home and prepare for nine acts of penetration
change it to remove all agents from low sec and empire and ill support it
up a bit
you should just add your support to the ccp commit to excellence thread its a fullblown threadnaught dont see how you couldve missed it
1 dont duplicate threads on the front page ffs2 learn how to use a god damb apostrophe
the key to nerfing macrominers is to find a way to make mining require skill
yeah i gotta ask any lexx fans here
yep closely followed by being evas no1 fan loloh whats the vote for btw if its bug ships in eve then errrr no if its to have eva habermann visit iceland on next fanfest then yes p
no it wouldnt think this through you want to install twice as many extractors and have them running half as often what exactly does that do for you it wastes your money demands more storage space than you would otherwise need and requires more timeeffort to do all the onliningofflining and you have no extra production to show for it
cause its annoying and you know at least the jump to and bridge to have cascade menus to save them
mate i agree it is really annoying to have them so close put the show info at the bottom of the menu
sounds like youre an incredibly terrible frigate pilot tbh

can you update the op to include links to each of your updates in this thread also saying which of the csm voted each way would be pretty fantastic liang
i believe it was ankh that voted against it someone may want to fact check me on that one though
yeah 00 system names are a pain sizable font would be amazing since i have both a 18 laptop and a 42 monitor and the font is unreadable on the monitorps windings would be a great addition too
in the name of all that is holy and righteous    please fix the font its 2010 and eve is nearly unplayable at 2560x1600
the eve font is absolutely atrocious and should be changed to something less horrendous

i like it
also add an option to manage all extractors or a group of extractors at once

all good ideas an overview on extractors would help alot when running strip mine operations moving to a reactivating a large number of extractors is currntly a big pain supported
updated now im not too sure if we should just keep this list down to glaring buglike pi problems or open it up to improvements on what is thereintended personally im inclined to keep it to just the worst and most obvious failures

supportedi recently got a friend to try out the game loved the tutorial and was interested hes still up in the air about subscribingbuying but when i explained hed be well off training learning skill first it somewhat deflated him hes a smart enough player to realize they are extremely helpful long term but what i think some of the detractors here fail to forget is that sinking 2 weeks  1month into something is commonplace when you have 20m sp during your first month or two when you can hardly fly anything or use anything buckling down and training for nothing but 1 attributes for weeks seemslameremoving skills and giving everyone 10 and 10 simply makes it easier for new players to get into the game id appreciate a refund but its really not necessary and if this is one more thing that helps retain new subscribers then im all for it new people are the continued life of the game
screw it i dont even care any more just give me my 1892315 sp back and we can all get on with our lives
if ccp are taking away the deep safe spots because they are an advantage to older players that have them then they should take away learning skills as well it is the same principle newer players are at a disadvantage because of the lack of the learning skills being trained where as the older players already have themand for those that will argue that the difference is that you cannot make the safe spots anymore where as you can still train the learning skills new players get a 2x training time multiplier for 16m sps whereas we did not get that a few years ago i think it is best to get rid of the learning skills and credit them to the players in a way that they can distribute them to skills as they see fit not as an increase to training speed the time was already spent in training the skills so we should be able to keep those sps and not spend even more time to get them backi support this idea
not supportedlearning skills are not the factor that drive newer players away it is the factor that drives players that would much rather play wow awaywe have to be careful how much we dilute this game and make skill progression too easy when i was a noob i invested the time for learning skills i was not bored i killed a few miners i had a war even though i was a corporation of one if you define your time in eve as skills then you are missing the point eve is about stories not skills if you wont play a game because of a little thing like learning skills then gtfo these people are not going to contribute to wild and adventurous things within eve just more whines and more standardization eve is a sandbox unfortunately as more time passes i see a growing trend in eve to move away from the traditional chaos and diversity to standardization less flavour and more of the same learning skills are vital to the butterfly effect of eve and should not be regarded as just a skill set that does nothing they create a greater differentiation between all players new and old this means that age isnt everything in eve as like so many other choices learning skills in effect create a discontinuity that eve imo is defined by be careful how many of these things you standardise because the eve you know and love is in danger of becoming just another mmolearning skills should stay for the benefit of eves dynamism at some point ccp needs to consider its original vision over its drive for rl isk too much growth without a consolidation period will always end in disaster ccp this will really change the make up of the player population of eve and that is not a good thing the vets who want to remove learning skills just dont want to train new alt 2487 up again dont depend too much on capital from addicts its not ethical
by that logic we should get rid of level v skills because the vets have more of them than the new players and it takes sooo long for the poor newbies to train them hell lets get rid of isk  the vets have more than the newbies capital ships those damn veterans have more of those  everything must go every new account should have all of the same stuff as a five year old account where does the whiningmadness stop still not supported
mmmmm yes
learning skills dont do anythingthey dont influence how well your ship flies they dont influence your guns they dont influence your market abilities or your industrial investmentsif you remove any other skill then you take some depth out of combat or industry something is lost but if you removed a learning skill nothing would change level 1 skills would still be level 1 skills and level 5 skills would still be level 5 skillsthis is an important distinction that not enough people seem to getyou could say that without them you get too many people with too high skills but given how big and grindy eve is even with maxed stats i dont think thats fair to saydid you know that itll take me over a month to get advanced weapon upgrades to level 5 a month for a 2 decrease in powergrid requirements for turrets and launcher bayssomehow i dont think eve is going to collapse if we kill off learning skills
tell that to someone who never trains any of themand if you remove these you take some depth out of the skill tree
solution 1 is fully supportedwasting time to save time wasnt that fun a game concept after all
the learning skills are the only skills that offer any depth at all in the skill tree without them it is simply a direct train to whatever you want
definitely a direct train when youre going after something like the triage module yep any noob can train it and use it effectively the depth you speak of is a bad thing liang
you are standing here you are telling me with a straight face that you would turn down the followingreimbursement of a load of skill points and maybe a minor isk reimbursementa friendlier world for newbies who will never have any hope of overpowering you anywaypossibly faster training times depending on if you have your learning skills maxed or notat the cost of11 skills that all have the same basic meta affect and that have never had any direct influence on industry or combat are now obsoleteyou would actually sacrifice the good not just of others but also of yourself in the name of having 11 extra icons on your skills interface an interface which is already loaded with skills an interface that you could never hope of fully filling in anywayyou are either a masochist a sadist or obsessive compulsive either you like suffering you like seeing others suffer or having those learning skills fulfills some deep need in you to see large completed spreadsheets i have been over the problem a dozen times youre not an idiot like many you understand the problem you understand the arguments you just dont agree for some bizarre reason that i may simply be unable to appreciate because im cursed with a mind thats designed to think outside of its own spacethe only people who enjoy getting learning skills are those who enjoy seeing progress bars climb the enjoyment of watching progress bars climb could be better spent on other skills without screwing over all but an obsessive minority any new player presented with all the facts would surely choose to have learning skills removedperhaps you simply have a burning desire for the days of old and will cling to that past even if it leaves the world around you burning either way i give up i dont know what convoluted agenda you hold but i am certain that it is deep seated emotional and altogether irrationalfitting for a gallente
while that was quite a well written analysis it is predicated on the assumption that i care if they remove the learning skills i dont nor do i see any reason to reimburse vets for skills they would effectively still havei have no agenda remove them dont remove them makes no difference to me i simply disagree with the arguments made in favour of removing them
currently from my experience exploration can be a nice profession however some aspects do not seam to be balanced the balance between the types of exploration sites greatly varies for this i will assume that radar sites are standard and acceptable so from there things will be compared from my experience from explorationcurrently radar sites can yield a decent surprise for me its a 4060 chance of being worth the time sometimes i will find a radar site and there be nothing inside at all and even rarer as expected i will hit it big grav sites are pretty much similar the harder the site is to find the more valuable the assets within the best sites really cant be found with out the specialized ships example given by finding a bistotcrokite site in low sec scanning from a standard cruiser was not able to pin 100 scan this imo would be expected for such a valuable site grav sites like radar sites in their own way scale appropriately ladar sites i honestly having found enough of these to rate them the ones i have found since aprocrypha needed hacking tools and those sites were worth the effort now the issuebut the seriously unbalanced part magnetometric sites i have found myself wanting to ignore these but as an explorer i just cant but every time i find one they are not worth the time when salvage is found its just not worth the time for a salvager to cycle i can get more salvage from a level 1 mission and then the chances for anything else seam crazy from my experience mag sites just are not worth the time to bother looking for i feel that mag sites should be brought in line with the other types of sites and be a bit more worth the effort for salvage find i feel the amount of salvage in each can should be increased per chance for the big find sites possibly increase the chance of a rig bp or skill findif this issue has been raised before feel free to flame me then get on with your life
though i agree i think magneto sites in wspace is where they become valuable as sleeper salvage is where money isfor highsec at least where are some thoughsradar sites are goodmagnetic sites are next to worthlessgrav sites are ridiculously hard to pinpointhave never seen ladar
mag sites are the salvage ones right yeah i wish theyd just remove them because the frig rats that spawn to defend the cans are worth more than whatever might be inside the cans sofreakingworthlessliang
yep they need fixing big time they should drop t2 salvage sometimes and also blueprints that are worth something i once found a large t2 bpc and was super happy but then i saw that no one ever uses powergrid subroutine maximizer iis
mag sites in general are really quite awful i run them anyway because thats the kind of person i am but srsly its rarely worth the time in fact i dont think i have received anything worthwhile from a mag site in at least six months
i love to be the one that throws the spanner in to your little steem engine but high security scan sites are not suposed to be isk printing machines they are to give u a taste of the things you could be getting more of in low and null secthere is nothing wrong with magnometric sites at they currently stand they can drop obsceen amount of salvage or they can yeld none i usualy run these sites in low sec and i have run them in 00 b4 nowu can expectlarge quantitys of t1 salvage componentst2 salvage dus drop quite often for merigging skill bookst2 rig bpcs in the realy good sitesif ur not having luck with mag sites in high sec just find a quiet spot in low00 to scan and do the sites there u will soon change ur oppinions reguarding mag sites
i wasnt talking about high secliang
maaaaaani cannot do my job  i feel completely unorganized without the organized structure we had of being able to sort pilots into different folders these folders dont just serve to organise corporation pilots but also by common location fleet adjustment groups etc etc so many new carebear features no new merc features and ontop of that the only usefull feature that all mercs swear by is removed i just dont understand are we all gonna become peace loving share your loot with me np ppl  how boring
give back to us the old system the new sucks
can you imagine opening up the yellow pages and instead of searching for a plumber by looking it up under a relevant category you have to find a single number that is under one of 5 categories based on how much you like that businessi can now experience that every day thanks to tyranniscan i have my folders back
a very good point maybe an encouragement to go run those lvl 5s that are being put strictly in low and null now lol

supported if only to encourage csm and ccp review of hybrids
definite 1 from me
the comparison to wow was made but its more of a similarity with dull and boring than it is a differencethe main difference is that everything in wow is tied to a story in eve ccp hides their lack of storydriven elements behind its a sandbox do whatever you want they apparently arent willing or able to shape and mold the game and the story around the actions of the players in a game like this what players do today should define what happens to players tomorrow instead player actions have very few consequencesthe missions eve has would be more closely related to wows daily quests repetitive grindfests earning reputationstanding and money all games have these kinds of missions the games that either fail or never develop more than just a niche following never move beyond these kinds of missions the games that draw a large following offer a lot of content for a lot of different people and actually spend time to develop that content fullythis is where eve fails the hardest they have a lot of awesome content but the implementation is only prototypequality not releasequality spending some time to revisit their existing content and making it excellent would benefit the game far more than continually adding additional halfbaked ideas
normally i would support these kind of proposals but i believe there are other game elements that are in much greater need of improvement and care than missions so i have no interest in this one getting higher priority within the pipe at the moment
well said imho p
clearly it is under the current set of rules possible to do insurance fraud  as it is looked at in rl  legally within the gamehowever i agree with what goose99 said note my change when you destroy the ship to collect insurance fees it should be insurance fraud when you try to keep the ship alive to the best of your abilities and thus trying to prevent yourself from collecting insurance its eve pvpin the first case you have a conflict of interest that runs counter to insurance in the 2nd your interest align with the insurance so this is how it should befurthermore evading concord is against the rules therefore you meet certain death after suicide gankingso it is the same as selfdestructing basically
because its a game and not real lifeso basically uve contributed nothing but a support without any of your own supporting statementswell besides the notion that a loss to an npc is somehow the same as selfdestructing
fellow capsuleersim member of a pirate corporation which recently joined the amarr factional warfare we have encountered a very irritating problem whenever we remote repair any of your outlaw corp mates we recieve a 075 amarr faction standing penaltywe found that out when we tried to examine why our amarr corp standing was going to dangerously low levels checks on standing logs revealed the issue we immediatly stopped using logistic ships and doing rr bs gangs and petitioned it this is what gms had to say this is obviously stupid why would amarr empire penaltize me for repping members of their own armed forces if they hate pirates so much they would deny access to fw for everyone with negative security rating in the first place wouldnt theyif empire factions do not like repping criminals why do i not lose any faction standings when im not a member of a militiathis makes it impossible for anyone with negative security rating to do rr bs gangs or use logistic ships because this will eventually get them kicked out of the militiaif this game mechanic does not change my corporation will be forced to leave amarr fw only because we are remote repping our corp matesthis makes absolutely no sense it needs to be fixed some csm support would be greatly appreciated this thread proves that the issue has now existed for almost 15 years and nothing has changed
yes this is just stupid ive experienced this before it was enough to rep a member with just a slight negative sec status to loose standings
i absolutely agree the standing loss makes absolutely no sense at allfirst you do the amarr navy a favor by repping one of their militia members so if anything you should get a standing gain not a losssecond the claim but you support a criminal and thats a criminal act is also nonsense because if i kill dozens of ships or even pods i do a lot of criminal acts as well without losing any standing to one of the factionsthird if the factions do not tolerate outlaws they should not hire them for their militiachange it
thats ridiculous and good to knowsupported
meh ive known about this for a really long time  maybe 3 years or so i can go with you getting a notification of your aggression being extended but this is a legitimate thing to use situationallyliang
well basically it just looks like an extension the fact that its invisible makes it even worse on my booksomeone does an act of agression towards you and you are the one who takes the penalty instead of the agressor how can that be legitimate am i missing something
if you have an aggression counter towards you that counter should be visible regardless
fully agreed the status quo is silly
supportedif youre going to have a timer on display it should be accurate no matter what
wait you attacked them and got aggression aggression is and should be renewed with any hostile action by either party no i dont really support changing it but i do support the timer always being accurateliang
said timer better be effing present or its an effing exploitno ifs ands or buts about itdont give a crap about who extends what and where and how no visible timer means its crapend of storyps although extending it is a bit of a cheap shot to be quite honest 15 minutes is more than enough time to go find someone and you get what 5 to bar them from docking upgating out please cry me a river
maybe next time you wont engage somebody with lethal force just because they took an item from youyou started the fight pay the pricei too want this bug fixing its an entirely unreliable means of extending aggro if they leave system it barely works at all and then if you dock yourself you sometimes end up being vulnerable but no longer with shooting rightsccp fix this immediately so that i can extend aggro indefinitely and reliably against these vigilante thugs and their associates
this should be fixed but cpp likes to ignore it for me this is a very unfair exploit ccp really sucks if they dont fix this fast

after a good month of hashing this topic out among various forums this is the general consensus that most players seem to agree onhere is the very simple fix that all interdictors need1 immune to warp bubbles especially their own2 get a 15 speed boost to afterburners per level3 reduced sig radius to 50554 have no bonuses to turretsinterdictors should be all about dropping that bubble and getting out alive with no emphasis on dps whatsoever we have reduced their sig radius and made using abs the preferable propulsion moduleon the subject of t1 destroyers1 reduce sig radius to 50552 remove rof penalty3 remove two high slots4 add one low and one medium slot to each destroyer5 give each one a 5 speed boost to afterburners per level6 allow each destroyer to shoot out to 30km with a comfortable fit7 replace falloff bonus on the catalyst with a 5 damage bonus or give the catalyst a larger drone bay8 remove tracking bonus on corm and give 5 damage per level bonus its a boat that can snipe over 100km tracking is unnecessary check this link to see the 100km sniping corm
add a proper salvaging vessel to the game since you are nerfing my current one with these changes and turn these combat ships and others like them into a clear secondary option for salvagers
you should open a new thread asking for a salvaging cruiser then your comment is borderline trolling except i know that you are seriousgiving my support since theres apparently no large objection to this
1 cross posting is bad2 you should link your features  ideas thread if you insist on doing it
the point of this f  i forum is to work out ideas before bringing them to the assembly hall ive made several different posts on the subject there for over a month now as ive seen no large objections other than lol salvage boats will be ruined i think its time to move it here
then you should post in ah after you got a good consensus in fi atm you got not one thread where people didnt state that your ideas are overpowered and in the end your ideas get discussed in 2 places in the meantimeso be a bit patient and keep discussing your ideas in fi before bringing them to the ah
hellosome time ago i made a thread in the ideas section and some people seamed to like the idea so im going to post it here maybe one day it will be put into evewhats the ideathe idea is to place conquerable structures in different lowsec systemsto conquer them you have to shoot down the shilds then a npc will contact you an tell you they will pay you if you stop shooting them the structures should have enough hp so a 5 man gang will need around 510 minutes to conquer them they will pay the money directly to your corp every 20 minutes they will only pay you if there shilds are at 50 or higher and not during downtimesi thougt that 10 million per paycycle could be enough so big blobs will be useable but not profitableevery time they are conquered the payment will be lowered a bit the npcs are interrupted and have to repair some damages it will regenerate after some time so constantly fighting over 1 structures makes it inefficient and encourages people to move aroundif the structures you own get attacked your corp will get a mail telling youand the attackers will get global aggro or so so you can shoot them without geting a sechitthere should only be 1 or 2 of them per system and the next system with such a structure should be 2 or 3 jumps away so gatecamping a system isnt too usefullstructures could be pleasure hubs or mining colonys or other things we already have in missions so no additional models have to be createdgoal of the ideai would wish to see many small roaming gangs of 510 people running through lowsec and stealing each others structures or defending there own so they have something to do if there are no enemys around and something thats profitable for them and cause of there low hp and no rf timers the big alliances wont be interrested cause its to much work to defend them all not like moonshope you like and support it
what you describe sounds pretty much like conquering systems in faction warfaredid you ever try that
well pi is up and running and its truly awesomedid i mention the exportimport taxes well i had a sudden stroke i mean a sudden ideawell with all issues surrounding player ownedoperated banks why not tax those taxes and create an investment bank systemtruly with all the tax income it would conceivably be self sustainingplayers could invest money in the form of savings and or be able to receive loanseach bank would be run by its respective empireim sure their would be issues involved development wise but hey ccp has shown its genius why not put some brain power on this
theres a caldari ecm boat i understand that caldari are the ewar race but it seems unfair that the other races dont have an ewar boatthus i propose ccp convert the dominix from a drone boat to a damp boat the armageddon to a tracking disruptor boat and the typhoon to a target painter boateditgive the dominix a damp bonus instead of a blaster damage bonusgive the typhoon a target painter bonus instead of a turret rof bonusgive the armageddon im not sure maybe a neutnos bonus a small one so that the bhaalghorn isnt just an expensive armageddon instead of a turret cap use bonus but a tracking disruptor range bonus would be interesting too for fleet work
ban forum trolls
im in a player corp
this
wait i really like this ill definitely trade the gun rof bonus for a painter bonus and an extra launcher slot liang
and only gallente have a drone battleship your point iseverything doesnt have to be so symmetrical i mean just look at caldari ships
symetrical or not the current state of affairs are inconsistent for frigates and cruisers each race get their ewar ship but for battleships only the caldari gets ithowever removing an existing bonus from the geddon the domi and the phoon for a new ewar bonus to tds rsds and tps repectively will essentially gimp those ships badly and render them more or less useless the scorpion has its niche but i dont see much need for a tech 1 battleship with bonus to targetpainters nice for missions maybe but mehwhat you could do however is include a tier 2 ewar bouns it will still be consistent as the caldari ewar are the same ecm for both tier 1 and tier 2 in this way the geddon will get a neutnos bonus like the bhaalghorn but without the webbing bonus the domi will get a bonus to warp scrambler range while the phoon gets a webbing bonusthis will ensure that each race have an ewar bs but with a tier 2 ewar bonus beeing battleships and all this is just a comment though i am sure all my esteemed collegues out there will have lots of misgivings lol
i proposescorpion lose ecm range bonus its useless anyway and increase ecm str bonus to 25lvl since you have to be up in peoples grill now replace ecm range bonus with 5 launcher rof bonus trade a high for a low and add a launcher slotfinal result585 5 launchers 5 launcher rof bonus 25 ecm strengthlvltyphoon trade turret rof bonus for painter bonus 1 launcher slot add some fittings to accomodate being an ewar bs geddon trade cap consumption bonus for 15 nosneut amount bonusdomi touch and die lianged and in case you cant tell im dead serious about changing the scorp and only half serious about the phoongeddon id be so stoked on the geddon change
the typhoon doesnt have enough grid or cpu to fit another torpedo launcher and still be useful even as it is now its forced to brick itself 3x trimarks really crush its speed since its almost impossible to fit an effective active tankbut of course ccp could give it more gridcpu to fit a sixth launcher
if ccp focused on walking in stations women would have avatars that they can associate with and would be drawn to eve more a lot of women play warcraft and it has humanlike avatarsvag
the new nooma klarr of the assembly hall
worse at least nooma had some sense of reality
for the record the op threatened my spreadsheets there can be no greater offense
if eve fanboys were less obnoxious women would be drawn to eve more
no offense but i didnt need a human like avatar to make me come play eve if thats what youre looking for perhaps imvu would be more your style
eve players are to mmo players what mmo players are to normal people
this would eliminate all the troll posters
looks at the ops corp nameno no it wouldnt
care to elaborate at least support your argument with valid evidence instead of simply stating it

you are wrong a computer has no default the default is what the programmer wrote some ccp hired or contracted programmer had to first select which key to use and then define the function of that key im going to give you a bad example of a programmer screwing with peopleheres an example of a programmer purposely being a clown1 programmer selects the backspace key2 programmer defines that the backspace key will select the yes option in the warning window3 programmer selects mouse 2 rightclick4 2 programmer defines that the mouse 2 key will select the no option in the warning window when hovering over the yes optionwhat this translates toif you press backspace you will proceed with the action if you press enter nothing happens because enter is not defined if you leftclick on yes or no nothing will happen because mouse1 isnt defined either only if you rightclick on no will something happen except it will still choose yes this is very common for popup windows on websites and other types of malicious adwarethe result you will be a very confused and angry personheres an example of what the ccp programmer did1 programmer selects the enter key2 programmer defines that the enter key will select the yes option in the warning window3 programmer selects mouse 1 leftclick4 programmer defines that the mouse 1 key will select the yes option in the warning window when hovering over the yes option5 programmer defines that the mouse 1 key will select the no option in the warning window when hovering over the no optionthe result you are not angry nor confused if you use your mouse to click on the warning window however if you use your keyboard and hit enter you will accidentally commit a criminal action in highsec spacein the future dont make comments on things you really do not understand you tend to hang around these forums a lot and makes lots of comments that just make no sense
enter return andor y andor yes are confirmation commands by default in every operating system ive ever heard of though you are right that it is a human defined convention and nothing intrinsic to the machineyou assert that a user could mistakenly think that enter means no but offer no reasoning that was a lot of typing to end up saying nothing
while i havent lost ships to this several times i have selected yes when i didnt wanted to do it simply because i was typing in chat and the pop up appeared wen i was completing my phraseat 200 keysminute you are several keys ahead of the pc when the pop up appears and you dont have the time to stop
1 what ever the solution it needs to be consistent always yes or no in every confirmation window in the game one of the most horrible things in a ui is inconsistency and eve doesnt need any more problems in the ui department2 players need to be able to disable all of these windows currently you can just hit enter when an annoying mandatory window blocks your action it is still crap but infinitely better than changing the default option to no3 enter is the confirmation key in every program i think i have ever used so i dont really agree with this catering to the few exceptions who havent grasped that concept is not a good reason to punish the majority who have
no enter should always be to confirm ie actually doing whatever command you had already issued why would you think that enter means canceli would support a proposal for clearer error messages though
ladies and gentlementhe csm was originally intended as a way to get things done in game that the player base by and large viewed as necessary to improve the gamehowever recently in the campaign video of eva jobse it was mentioned that there is currently a huge backlog of issues that were approved by the csm and brought to ccp and that nothing is being done with them and that it is possible that many of them are now invalid due to changes in the game systems that have happened since they were submittedit is this players opinion that it is time for ccp and the csm to be a little more transparent with whats submitted and whats been implemented thus far by ccp in the gamebecause lets face it the csm is only effective and working as it was originally intended if the issues that are submitted to ccp are actually implemented and not completely ignored by the development team in favor of devoting development time to new and shiny features to attract more lemmings to the cliff so i leave it to you the csm and ccp lets have it how many of the changes that the players have brought forth to the csm that have been submitted to ccp have actually been implemented or is the csm actually what many people have come to suspect it to be a farce in place to only appease the players while maintaining the status quoi think its time to actually see some of the results of the csm so the players can see that it is in fact not just a free trip to iceland and gaining inside information that has in the past been abused by at least one csm memberdrachenlord
i just wish when you are podded you get reminded to purchase a new clone if you ask it too hell id pay for it like 10k isk a week or somthing stupid for it to saycongratulations on your resurrection success dont forget buy a new clone to avoid loss upon dieing
im sorry but there is just no justifiable cause or concern for this to even be consideredit is your responsibility to check your clonenot the machine not the server not your friend or your neighborwith tools like evemon and evehq you literally have no excusewhats next a little reminder to remind you to push the button to shoot your gunsdemeaning or not human error does not need a patchits called experience youll forget once twice not likelynot supporting a patch for absentmindedness
drake you didnt address what benifit it brings to the game flying a half bil ship into a gate camp provides benifit to others on your expense flying it into rats and going afk provides incentive to be careful and take care of your assets isk loss is a fine and justifiable penalty for complacency or mistakes but as i said its easy if you havent done it or done it in awhile to be on your high horse and say youre dumb live and learn but its a simple mistake anyone can make and one i do not normally do in fact ive never done it before so over a year until one day i remember updating my clone but forget it was prior to my last death a simple mistake anyone could make and wham 1 month training i think this penalty should be switch partially to an isk or time penalty by having a 100 mil or difficult to obtain backup clone you now have to renew instead of all your skills being pwnt updating your clone helps the game by adding to the death penalty in clone costs but with a difficult to obtain back up this incentive is kept in game still giving a huge penalty for the complacency of it since you lose the back up without causing over frustration losing 1 month in training without even giving satisfaction to other players on your expensewhich if it did would be fine with me eve should be cold hearted
who said anything about benefitswhen i fly into lowsec space with a outdated clone am i suppose to pony up like some little poor nooblet and demand benefits for my stupiditywhat is this hello kitty onlinei think not your saddly and poorly and lacking in seirous knowledge here literally figuiritvlyand aparnetlyskill points wiseno one said anything about getting benefits for playing eve onlinethey did say its an experince you wont forgetin short  welcome to eve online
any in game mechanic should provide a benifit to the game in some way not just frustration leaving frustrations in that provide no benifit is a recipe for medicrity im advocating for the sp penalty for this to be switched to an extreme isk penalty or time consuming penalty in the form i have proposed by back up clone because i believe it would acomplish the same things not degrade the eve experiance in any way while lessoning a huge frustration some playerssome due to negligence others to an honest msitake anyone could make will encounter either way there is a severe penalty for fogetting just i dont see why one of arguable the worst penalties in the game is for a simple mistake anyone can make and one that provides no benefit to other players in comparison isk wise or satisfaction wise just my thoughts agreeing to disagree is fine
uh ya there is a big difference bt flying into lowsec with an outdated clone and fighting in 00 where you will be podded and cant do anything about it and wakeup in station to hop into another ship and undock into the fight having forgotten to upgrade your new clonei would like a popup reminder that you can turn off if you wanna be hardcore lol when you try to undock that lets you know you havnt updated your clone i dont think thats unreasonable you can play more often and get more iskships to replace lossesnothing hurts like sp loss tho
all i see is a pathetic excuse for a lapse in memoryseriously i was in 00 i had access to clone baysmost alliances worth there salt has such resources availablestop making excuses and just deal with the problema reminder will only fuel this little issue more than necessary
not supporteda far easier solution would be to just make clone contracts autorenew unless you cancelled it or didnt have the moneyproblem solved
you do realize evemon warns you if your clone is insufficient
you do realize relying on a third party program to improve an in game mechanic to an acceptable state isnt a valid solution i would support an option to auto renew your clone contract and a notice if your isk balance cant cover it would be a simpler fix btw no one trashing this proposal has listed a benifit it gives to the game that the proposed option doesnt have your just trashing it because is human nature to feel above the issue if you havent done it before or in awhile and just say your an idiot actually look at the pros and cons of both please
ehhone the one hand you have nobody to blame for this but yourselfon the other hand there are popup boxes for you are about to engage in a dangerous act and you are about to wander into lowsec so why not you are about to undock without a proper clonesupported if only because it might help some newbies and itd be pss easy to implement
this sort of puffing up when someone downplays their rep is what perpetuates the mythedit i do think that low sec agents need more incentive however i also think conq 00 needs agents but thats an entirely different issue
lol at care bearand your right low sec isnt full of pirates just the initial jump in which is of course where you diei would rather be aloud to decline as many low sec missions as i want with no penalty instead of none at all
i had hoped that the snarky comment about my 13 billion isk pve ship would have tipped people off i would argue that all low sec rewards and mechanics be normalized around 01 space 01 is sufficiently different from 00 and the rewards are much better than high sec and all low sec is equally dangerous which is to say that its not instant death on a stick but even the most wary of us will end up getting screwed occasionallyyeah  maybe an amarrcaldarigallenteminmatar relations upgrade which puts an agent from the appropriate faction maybe fwlike agents which examine your red list and their sov space and put up smallish missions to be run in their space to incentivize a roam dunnoliang
supported why should high sec agents give low sec destinations there is no point since high sec mission runners are only going to decline them anyway i cant really see high sec dwellers being forced there it may make them less likely to be interested in low sec as a whole if they want to join us in 00 im sure they will once they can make the isk
theres already ecm burst to make caldari ewar less proportionally overpowered ccp should make target painter sensor dampener and target painter burst modules the sensor booster ones will need to have a very big range 40km to be useful thoughvag
1 youve already made a thread on this topic like three days ago 2 ecm bursts dont make anything overpowered 3 you cant even keep your names straight from one word to the next 4 tp and td bursts even if they were created would have zero game effect theyre continuous effects by nature hey just dont work instantaneously 5 sd bursts could work in theory but theyd have the absurd effect of being more powerful the farther away you are thats essentially impossible to balance 6 please go away
i moved missioning corps recently so i am working on grinding up standings while blitzing a level 3 i noticed this shield under the name on powerful em force field compared with the current pos shields i think this one looks much better as this is the only mission or indeed anywhere that i have ever seen this force field type i think its fair to say its wow factor is clearly lost what i propose is a simple database swap which will replace the pos shields with this one and completely get rid of the old effect i dont like it and neither does anyone in my corp once they see this one if anything get rid of the bars and replace it with the other effectbad pictures courtesy of me
that effect would make it harder to see inside the tower and after a week of it being the default effect youd be just as bored of it as you are of the current effect

pi is a very interesting and useful feature i am enjoying it but there seems to be a few issues which will help make it a little more workable after ofc the npc orders are removed1 ability to move command centres already deployed on planets without moving this can be done with an isk charge ofc but it would be nice to have your commands moved to where you see fit in case you wish to change your primary extraction2 ability to upgrade commands i really hate the idea of destroying command centre just to place a higher level one only to route  link and deploy again it wastes time isk and kills the whole network3 must be near a planet in order to deploy a command centre i find it odd how i can deploy a building on a planet 16 au away tbh i think this is a bug as it is wrong in everyway take this for example jump in a system move to gate you jumped from deploy commands jump out careless of range of the planets4 corporate interaction there needs to be some way to have pi corporate so people can actually benefit from being a lets say pi only corp not just about trading goods but corporate links much like when you can launch a pos for corp  alliance5 building  link overview it is pretty obvious what is on a planet and what you have deployed but for better management i say we have a building  link overview which shows current extractions and all other useful information6 power reduction of storage centres there isnt much of a need to have a storage centre atm a space port uses the same power has a better use and only costs a few more cpu7 expediting needs a buff right now you dont need to expedite anything the only use i have seen it for is if you are in a hostile situation where you cant collect goods and you need to store items but then it is easier to just launch goods insteadtheres also some extra buildings which i feel may be of some use and will make pi different for everyone these will be used in ways of add ons and have their own risks the risks will increase power cost  cpu cost  duration of extraction  storage amount etc they can only be attached to current buildings in forms of upgrades

rubbish idea
i say we just ban all the trollsstarting with the op
the current system is that a pi player chooses to have the planet be mined for 5 hours 23 hours or 3 days the problem with this is that it makes it too repetative and has a huge difference in gains ie the 23 hour routine makes 3x as much as the 3 day i propose that the planet mining system be switched to be similar to the pos system where a miner works until the cargohold it is told to distribute to is fullalso to nerf planet macro users the 5 hour 23 hour or 3 day choices should be removed and the mine once every hour option similar to moons should be the only thing that planet mining buildings can dopros it would make the storage buildings actually usefulit would free up planet industry players to be able to visit systems far away from their planet or to be offline for about a week or two without their planet going haywirelevel the playing field between macros using 5 hours constantly and players logging in once a dayconsplayers that wish to do only planet industry may feel nerfedpossible programing bugs ie only space for 1 mineral is available and 2 modules finish at the same time dumping minerals into the storage bin
they designed pi to be a highworkload system its supposed to suck i hate it but youre not going to get them to change one of the fundamental design decisions
suggestion for pi improvement allow players to logically remove power and cpu from existing structures and links removing power and cpu costs nothing while bringing things back on line takes isk by logically i mean if a mid link or structure is deactivated everything tied in upstream is also deactivatedim guessing most players colonies are extracting several materials at once and running mutliple factories being able to manage the cpu and power usage without having to deconstruct would allow a more efficient use of factories and extractors as the market shifts production for one material can be decreased or shut down altogether and production ramped up for a different material

tyrannis broke the smuggling mechanicsas a full time smuggler i make my entire living in eve moving contraband of various sorts the profit margins are always awful sales very slow and my personal capitalization almost non existent but this miniprofession has been a way of life for me and my primary source for income i do all my work with my main as it should besince tryannis i have been absolutely wholloped by customs to put it in perspective i have traveled through thousands of gates with contraband and received only a few fines in a smuggling fit frig after the patch i did an 18 jump trip and received 6 fines totaling 12misk  standings penalty after posting on si i was able to confirm something broke in the smuggling mechanicwhat people tend to forget about smuggling is this if the consumer can not move their purchase from a station the product will not sell at all i am aware of more exotic ways to smuggle boosters in high sec but it is absurd to expect casual booster users to go through the same ritual in order to get the boosters from a trade hub to its final destinationunless something changes i predict the booster market will crash any day as for my professioni am looking for any support to get this fixed

alright you added it thanks bro at the very least i would like an answer beyond resident factions asked concord since the resident faction is us and we sure as hell didnt ask for it
i have two things to addthe customs office transfer window should show how much volume is being transferred and how much volume is in the customs officeit should be possible to name launchpads its not a problem for planets with a single launchpad but if you have more than one random letters dont help you figure out which one you want to use
storage should hold massive amounts of goods launchpads hold more

same here dark drifter even in low sec and null sec mag sites you get crap
i have 0 experience with low sec and null sec mag sites so cant say anything about thosehowever i do agree that in high sec the mag sites compared to the other sites are worthlessa decent radar site is worth around 10m a grav site can be ok though still not as good as simply mining high sec minerals but thats just because the lowsec minerals arent worth enough theres plenty of value in the sites themselves quantatively ive never found a ladar site in high sec i am assuming they only spawn in lownullsec and wspacewspace is a totally different story because everything that drops in there is in some way part of making t3 components so they all have their values and uses right now a high sec radar site is worth next to nothing especially if you compare the time you need to find and clean it out a level 1 mission or a run into a 110 plex will get you better resultsbuffing up mag sites in high sec a little so they are more in line with the others would be very good for my favorite profession
i have experience with null sec mag sites they suck most of the time and are much harder to scan than radarafter years of notices ccp still has not done anything to improve lacking content

if this is true its absolutely stupid it should cause a sec penalty not a faction seems like its an obvious coding glitch that i hope ccp will correct
that gm obviously doesnt understand what you are concerned about reply to the petition stating that you completely understand and agree with the standings loss towards concord which is what you get when you rep an outlaw but that the standings loss to amarr empire shouldnt have anything to do with the repair recipient being an outlaw or noti do have a quick question though do you receive the same standings loss for repairing a nonoutlaw militia member if you dont then it makes no sense whatsoever to lose empire standings for repairing an outlaw in the militia
one of many fixes needed for fw
as someone who has watched his amarr faction standing tumble from above 8 to less than 2 i fully support the op also there is no way to regain faction standing in fw so they get you from both sides
it is the derivate modifier effect you lose standing with concord concord has positive standing with all the empire faction so when you lose standing with concord you lose standing with all the different faction or at least you should lose standing with themif it happen only when you are part of the militia or only with one of the different faction it is broken and a bug if it happen every time you remote rep any outlaw even if you are both outside the militia it is working has intended changing that so that it will not happen when you are both in a militia corp while doing militia things but it work when the outlaw is attacking nonmilitia targets would be a very hard thing to code and seeing how smaller changes in the standing checks in the past had large negative effects increasing lag in fleets i think that implementing the needed checks to avoid this kind of problem will seriously increase lag can someone confirm that this kind of loss happen only when you are in the militia and it dont happen if you are outside it
venkul i can confirm i never recieved any faction standing hits before my corp joined the militia besides your arument makes no sense because if these were derived standing modifications they would show up in the logs as such but the logs do not state derived mofification they state assistance to enemy of amarr empire
i am ceo of kyangs corp atm we are forced to not use logistics or rr setups thats not an acceptable conditionso please fix this or better fix the whole lowsec
please fix it
should have been fixed a long time this is not the first thread about this
support this this need to be fixed fast
the faction standing loss is stupid sec loss is ok but faction standing los for repping an friendly milizia member is nothing else than stupid
no brainer
i fly nothing but pirate logistics and my standings are unaffected if someone is taking faction standing loss then that should be fixed and similarly you should not take a gcc for repping an outlaw that does not currently have a gcc
i agree its stupid and i am a victim of it my sec has been rising im up to around 6 from 10 but still it should change if i remote rep an outlaw not in the militia i take only a sec hit and gcc im fine with that but if i remote rep an outlaw in a militia i take a hit with his militia in addition to the gcc and sec hit its the standing hit that es me off and it is a bug regardless of if the gms and even the devs realize it it defies all common senseedit forgot to support

first off make it easier on us rsi are not fun and ever more often eve goes further and further toward the clickfest of a browser gamea  have a survey all button this would survey all current nonharvesting extractors the results are not shown only the option to set 30m 52496 hour options for every extractor thats not extracting at the moment optionally allow surveying only selected extractors any extractors without routed product would start to flash or do something unmistakably visible so we know where to look to fix the problemthis will save our poor handsb extractors autosurvey for the love of everything they have no other function at least have them automatically survey when selected one less click is a win for everyonec  cancel job pretty simple allows you to shut down the current operation loosing whatever it was doing just like pos and let you start a new operation this would be big win when you accidentally select an extraction duration you didnt wantd  logistic handling facility manages storage arrays that are routed through it becoming the master storage capacity linked storage arrays you still need them are then simply used as a single bulk raw capacity with the handling facility showing total capacity in use you can then link from the handling facility to your assemblers individual storage arrays can still be used along the routes from extractors but will not benefit from the handling facility powergrid usage of linked storage arrays are halved through the handling array costs are the same to build  linke  upgrade control center you pay the market price for a new control center but upgrade it onsite without having to rip out the entire network due to paying full price for the upgrade its not going to be cost effective to install lesser centers and build them up but if your skills only allowed standard and you can now use advanced you should be able to upgrade onsitef  corporate links special links that go from your control center or launch pad to the controlpad of a fellow corporation member isk costs are four times as much as a standard link to install or upgrade and are paid by the corporation creating them link pgcpu load is shared equally between the command centers alternatively introduce a corporate logistics handling facility through which product can be routed identical storage quantity to a launch pad but half the cost and fitting load as it lacks the ability to launch productg  alliance links these require a special facility alliance planetary logistics center this facility can only install alliance resource storage arrays that hold 20k m3 per they cannot install launch pads nor launch product themselves or support assembly or extractor arrays these links cost 10x the isk of standard links to installupgrade and are paid by the corporation making the link they draw 3x as much pgcpu routing materials through alliance links incurs the standard material transfer cost as if you launched product from a launch pad but 50 of it goes to the controlling alliance link pgcpu load is taken from the alliance center
no just no words cannot describe how utterly terrible this idea is
oh god liangs scorp change is the only thing that even came close to making any sense but no you cant get close to t2 ecm bonuses for a t1 ship you will have to keep the sub par strength bonus hell i think dropping the strength bonus all together buffing the range bonus and giving it a launcher rof bonus with a 5th launcher is better pushing its range out to where the other two bss are designed to operate 200km makes more senseedit actually scrub that just had a play in eft scorp can already get around 200 km ecm range 50 fall off though without implants which is acceptable at these ranges scorpion in its current form is a very good ship the other races do not need an ewar t1bs

 supported something needs to be done for the field command shipslots of different ideas adding slots andding pg etci remember when i trained for cs i thought i was getting a tougher bad ass ship that gave bonuses during small gang  fleet ops oops so how about focusing on what the ship is all about commandwould a bonus unique to field command ships workexample command ship skill additional 2 bonus per level of command ships skill to all leadership bonusesthis would encourage thier use in fleets again this bonus would be in addition to any warefare link and it would be across the board for every leadership skill the pilot hasat best it gives an additional 10 to one warfare link and an across the board boost to shield hitpoints speed agility etc of 10  at level 5tribe

what is this i dont support ops silly proposalhere he puts up better than i doqft
i agree with the op in principleimho if ccp really wants to dump the learning skills then just slap all chars with a pool89 skill points 39base points  50 from maxed learning skills in a pool that players could cash on each attribute however i feel that the base learning skill itself should be kept doing the same thing it does now adds 2 per skill level to the total sp on each attribute then pull the total skill points that was used into a respec pool that players can distribute to which ever skill they wantin principle i agree with the op i think the method should be slightly different i like the pooled concept a bit better than a fixed attribute map
learning skills are a viable tactic in determining the ability of a pesron to allocate skills in a realistic and game changing way whether or not people choose to train them will either better or worsen their experience to eve the remap feature along with implants make these skills optional to train however beneficial if trained early this is a benefit to the game this topic is not supported learning skills add a significant feature to the game
they are stupidevery one who has sp in them should have it refunded onto their training queall characters existing and new should then have the maximum potential attributes for their bloodline and what the current learning skills would have addedsimple end of talk should just be doneno one can really argue people without them now get the bonus people with them get keep their sp and maybe get to fly a new ship or sumthingthey add nothing to the game the player picks the skills he learns and thus the effectivness of his overal characters specilization the learning skills themself simply determine the rate he heads down the road as a veteran i do not hugely care if i do not get the sp i have invested in learningskills i do beleive that it makes sense to reimburse but i also beleive that the learning skills should be removed more
learning skills basically look like a tacky facebook game feature like paying money for extra turnsa new player doesnt know what the full skill tree looks like generally before research players will assume after seeing the second tier that there is probably additional skills beyond the 11 that actually exist and dont put much more thought into the game after that

it is the same in the sense that you know you will loose your ship with 100 certaintythis while other ship losses are not certain and on many occasions my insurance ran out without ship lossthis is the difference between on the one hand concord kills and suicides and on the other hand all other ship lossesone can also allow other people to kill you  like between corpmates  to then claim the insurance however this would be too hard to find a workable solution for so i am content with no insurance payout for suicides and concord killsthe main reason why i support this is that i believe suicide gankers should have more consequences than they have nowso thats all there is too it pretty simpleso i agree we disagree and that you think the current consequences are enough
no support reasonhighsec pirating is part of the game autopiloting is dangerous and part of the raeson its dangerous is because its feasible please leave us our freedomoptions

1 npc loss or not it is suicide all the same2 i dont introduce it it is already part of the game also it takes a bit more effort to do it and you need to be in a real corp  nonnpc  anything promoting joining a corp is a good thing3 the intended mechanic is already being punished just not enough imho i dont hate the mechanic since i live mainly in lowsec i understand the risks of eve i just want to raise the bar for suicide kills from low value shipscargo to higher value shipscargo

its optional if youre 100 confident that your account will never be hacked dont get it
i like this only ask for it say the first time you log back in after at least an hour of inactivity maybe even just once after downtime and when a dual login occurs this will usually occur on the same machine eg by forgetting that you are already logged in that way crashes are mostly covered those instances where you have to quickly relog because your ship will be sitting at a gate for the next 15 minutes and it wont get cumbersome quickly usability vs security most people will in fact forego the extra security even after already taking the extra measure in use
thats your not he im the one making this proposal you sure your reading correctlyif you had read the proposal you would have known that this is specifcally about the agression counterinstead your trolling to be trolling and if anything its a clear sign of your inability to pay attention to details i dont give a  about the ship i lost anymore moved on to something else and having a ball doing it so spare me the lecturethis is assembly hall a place where people make ideas and propose fixes old or new for that matter its what we got for a system and until such time ccp gets up off there ass and comes up with a better system lets make sure it gets used to its maximum potential now if you just dont give a crap than please dont bother participating as your no different than most of the trolls around these partsoh i read it alright all i got was the same exact message you know its a problem but you dont give a thanks for clearing that upif i was posting to whine about losing my ship this would be a different thread all togetherbesides i never liked that ship anyway it was a piece of trash so im glad its gonemy point is the aggression counter now if your going to insist on accusing me of throwing a fit over attacking someone and losing my ship you can go to crime and punishment where you will find plenty of people doing thatas i said for the nth time now this is about the agression counteri was told on countless occasions now if you engage its 15 minutes if you engage again it renewsi waited the full 15 minutes time and it still glitchednow cut the bs and get back on subjectthank you for your cooperation

the purpose of this proposal is togive small gangs one more thing to do in enemy territorygive bears one more reason to defend their spacegive people something to fight overprovide planetary interaction with some very minor drawbakcsremove one invulnerable object form game because we all know invulnerability is lameproposal cargo links are vulnerable they have 50 resistances across the board they slowly heal armor and shield themselves but not structure they have enough hitpoints to take 510 minutes for a small gang to blow them up like that of a medium pos gun not counting structure upon destruction you can no longer use spaceports to send materials up and down untill another cargo link is anchored in the orbit their production cost should be between 10 and 30 millionand they are built from pi materials wehn a link is destroyed all meterials inside it are dropped in a can
just wait for dust 514 and you can get all your planetary pew pew
i am sorry what does this have to do with dust
facepalm
agree the dust will come and solve everything attitude is bit over exaggeratedhowever your proposal while based on right basic premise seems very wrong in implementationsomething that is possible to destruct by small gang in 510 minutes needs to be guarded 237 which is impossible both by gameplay and rl reasons your proposed costs may be higher than whole income from planet say assuming customs are destroyed every day unopposed due to timezone problems
how about adding a little to this and popping it into a new column altogether

instead of a survey all button how about to give us the ability to group similar extractor types as we do with the launchers and the turrets and have a group survey result for the selectable extracting times canceling an extractor cycle and upgrade cc ability are a must
oh sweet lord yes
you cant just say upgrade and have the cc automatically upgrade without you bringing anything to itinstead of an autoupgrade cc function make it so that you must still buy the higher tier cc from the market and be in system then when the cc is in your cargo hold have an option to upgrade
i know that im not the first to ask and i know that it cant be that big of a graphical challenge can we please get some missile launcher graphics
this is a joke right that was asked a couple of time it would take monthsyears to put missile launcher graphics onto all ships with launcher slots apart from a complete revamp of the way missiles are shot probably the idea is cool but the graphics department may have better things to do
like reskinning the fugly navy megathrondominixvexordiemost
1judging from the scorpion alterations there is a big graphics update cycle coming to eve again where all ships get the new textures some new effects and changes to old ones is also propable the idea in the op is nice but also old so dont get your ho
it would not ake years months maybe would mean thaey have to edit every modelwhile we are at is can we have it so taht guns actually miss now that is not hard
10 mil every 20 minutes thats worth more than a dysprosium moon back in the glory days like 1 mil an hour maybe also id say it sounds more like conquering moons than fw still you could try that too
well its more like the really old way of conquering outposts with less hp i hope cause of the facts that these structures have to be defended actively that you have to fly a good disance to reach the next one that they are easy to conquer and somebody else will grab them when your offline that they dont become moons i thought about the domination gamemode in ut or other gamesi hope a gang of 510 will be able to maybe hold 23 of them when they actievely defend them so it will be 2030 mio every 20 minutes for 510 people so its like mining in highsec with the profits
can we have derivatives trading too
sure go code it
ya i have to second this too 
i wouldnt complain if the phoon lost its turret bonus for tp bonus and gained cupgrid for 6th torp launcher id actually wet my pantsi agree that there is a disparity in ewar through the ship classes however i think this would take a huge amount of balance testing on ccps part that they just arent going to do instead they will spend the time on other things that noone is asking for lol
hmmm an interesting idea i could get behind this if it is hashed out a bit more and details are givenlight bulb turns onwait i think we might have found a suitable replacement for the hyperions armor rep bonus
should the typhoon retain its gunslots at all if it gains a launcher and a painter bonus theres plenty of situations where you want that extra bit of dps instead of neuts
this is strange its a obvious troll post but it makes a good pointcaldari is the only race with an ewar bs it may be a bit sucky at anything out of that role but it does seem a bit unbalancedif the typhoon got a bonus to webs it could compensate for is brickness if the geddon got a bonus to neutsvamps it wouldmake it a half decent solo boat if the domi got a bonus to sensor damps it would make a usefull addition to sniper bs fleets but i guess all this would make the tier 1 bs abit overpoweredmeh got me thinking also the phoon needs some love on its texturesmodel it should be the next ship to get a make over
this
the neutageddon is already stellar but a role bonus would be nice
dont you touch my domi
touch my geddon and i will cut you also this a bad idea due to the fact we love our teir 1 bss as they are
i dunno man i took a look at the thread and i knew it was meant to be a troll but i thought about it a bit and i came to the conclusion that it can almost be made a good change speaking specifically to the geddon i think it might actually be more powerful if you trade the cap use bonus for a nosneut amount bonusitd certainly become the ship of choice for taking out cap fleets as if it werent alreadyliang
a t1 bhaalgorn basicallyyeah that could be a pretty sweet niche ship but i too would cut you if you touched my geddon
what about a tracking disruptor bonus instead
i think we fundamentally view the ship differently im all for things which increase its power  like trading the cap use bonus for a damage bonus or somethingliangedi wouldnt be a fan of it mostly because it would involve a significant change to the ship the cap use bonus is something of a useless bonus but its far more useful than a tracking disruptor bonus on a ship with 3 mids
my idea sucked and i realized this was a colosal waste of time faction bloodline or race doesnt even matter
agree 100 i made myself gallente just cause i randomly picked one race thinking i would have one industrial character and one combat character well i figured id start skill training the industrial to make isk for the combat one then after a while i realized im just gona use one char for everything cause skill training takes 2 long so now im stuck as a gallente drone lover also flying caldari ships and that is a break in the lore id wouldnt mind paying for this one eithersupport

im astonished that this isnt possiblei think there should be a bookmarks filter so that you can have a tab for just bookmarks i think this will make it much easier to warp to them instead of right clicking in space  people  places for example an undock bookmark during your period of invulnerability switch your your bookmarks tab and start spamming the warp button on your undock point i think its a nobrainer to include them in the overview settingsmaybe you could even designate which folder to show on the overview that way you can have a preset for undocks safespots special places scoutingobservation etc

since contracts now have a written as well as numerical value markets should as well be controlled somewhat to let the buyer have a clear view of what they are purchasing please either a limit the market to disallow people to increase the regional price of an item above 100x its normal value ie an item is 500k somenoe puts multiple sell orders up at 500000000 and thus hit above the marker and are thus not allowedthis could get more specific  complicatedb add a similar system to market orders as are in contracts to allow the person a written and numerical value to judge by c suggest below
why
d teach people that they should read things before clicking on them so that when they epicfail hardcore in a game they learn they should read the fine print carefully then hopefully they should learn this is a fact in real life contracts too as a result people learn to be smarter in real life too and we all benefit in the long run one day theyll remember how they got scammed in an online game and lost a ton of virtual money and read real life contracts more carefullya valuable lesson indeed
so you have a habit of not reading fine print carefully that is so nice do you want me to sell you a halfbrick er a house
or you just go to the market settings and configure it properly not supported scamming is part of the game and stupidity should be punished
ccp has no obligation to protect people from their own incompetence or lack of common sensecaveat emptor
this proposal is against people spamming scams therefore supported
er no it isnt
fineprint the only thing you have to look at the market is items price if you fail to do that you deserve to be punished for ita you really dont see how this could be easily exploitableb sure something like this item costs one billion two hundred and twenty five million nine hundred seventy eight thousand three hundred and twenty four point eighty two isk i see how this can be very helpfulnot supported
sounds reasonable
this idea is simple but i feel it will go a long way towards more dynamic 00 warfare as most of us know poss have a large amount of health i propose that this amount of health should be reduced substantially in order to compensate pos resistances should be increased to bring the ehp of poss near but somewhat below its previous levels this change reduces the amount of time required for a fleet of battleships or dreadnoughts to destroy a pos however this change does allow defenders to repair their poss faster which means less time spent sitting around with a rack of remote repairs this change also makes a guarded pos substantially harder to capture while shortening the time sink that results when an alliance starts burning through unguarded possclarification  by pos i mean any player structure with a large amount of hps related to sovereignty or 00 warfarein sumposs lose actual hp but gain larger resistances making it easier to repair them out of combatposs lose overall ehp making it easier for a fleet to burn through them while unguardedposs become harder to take while guarded because remote repairs have a larger effect due to the higher resistancesthis encourages  fighting over poss while discouraging focusing on a single location over others because the effect of both actual attack and actual defense are magnified while massive fleet fights and heavy latency can and will still result the choice belongs to the attacker they can either split their fleet to send many bases into reinforced mode in a shorter timeframe than they currently could or form a massive blob to wipe out bases one at a time and hopefully encounter the blob formed by the defenders in response defenders are now encouraged to meet the attackers either with smaller gangs and repairs on many bases at once or by blobbing their blob this gives the attacker another tactical tool and gives them more control over where fighting happens and makes the results of fights over poss depend more heavily on players and fleets than afkbashing capabilities
the proper fix would be to triple hit points and increase resists making it harder for poss to be destroyed and take longer for them to be repaired
not to be inflammatory but why more hp would mean more afkops more incentive to drop poss like candy and less sleep during wars
not crazy but really why is the rr side of thing privileged over the dps side its not like we dont have to sit there forever with a rack of guns 1710
encouraging rr encourages fights since you cant rep from inside the pos shields thats another idea perhaps require ships to be further than 2km away from the pos shield to activate rr modules that could help with the bubble games

active tanking is a joke im thinking it is only useful in missions or with caps so i have a solution that will make active tanking worth having without nerfing passive tanking or buffing mission boatsactive tanking modules will use charges and no longer have any affect on cap based on the size they will hold a certain amount of charges similar to cap boosters when a pilot activates a module the amount of damage they received will be taken from charges however there will be a set cap based on sizethe duration of repping however will be significantly reduced and if theres no charges you wont be able to repairthis will work much like a cap booster but will hold more the duration will be significantly reduced meaning more repairs but dependant on charges this will increase your overall defence but since theres a duration on repairs it will be brokenpassive will still be viable and ships with repper bonuses will greatly benefit from this modules in high slots used to repair other pilots wont be affected by thisthe problem i see with active tanking is you cant really buff it without indirectly buffing mission running so lets change it to make it a little more workable and allow players to actively manage repairing
first ideas go in fid then they go to assembly hall
anything that would make active tanking competitive with passive tanking in large fights would make it completely overpowered for solo and small gang combat for smaller engagements active tanking is already very strong if used by a competent pilot
so in other words you want to make missions unplayable smallgang pvp a joke and keep active tanking worthless in fleet fights brilliant
look at the boosters and their uses the common used boosters are blue pill and exile gases for them are hold by bloc factions foutainvenal and wars were never declared for the holding of the clouds but for moons rarity mainlynow even for a really good smuggler not affilited with those factions its hard to get those cytos gases back to empire i think the cosmos contellations should be reworkedo7

the only reason i couldnt see this pass would be also the reason they cut engine trails from ships way back when lag issues if you coauld find a lowimpact way to do vectors it would be nice i think
i agree that plexes need to spawn much more often throughout the day but you say we need to remove the ewar from the npcs you say this will balance the npcs  i have my doubts but maybe your right i just dont see why we have npcs at all to the extent they have an effect on the pvp fights its a negative effect removing npcs will balance things wont it what do you think of the idea of letting militias know where and when a plex is entered i suppose this is the biggest change of my proposal its not really a big change its just an improvement to help pvpers get fights faster no more wandering around hoping to find someone in a plex that wont immediately warp off you can have plexes all over but to the extent you have npcs in the plexes people will need to pve their fits and if we dont know where they are that means we do a lot of roaming around for nothing
i very much agree with the op and would like to propose that the seemingly hardest to tackle problem of this game  namely grid  node lag  be taken seriously as a feature and receive much much more development attention very well said

1 by your logic if even high sec pvp is suicide then bringing a ship into low sec and especially 00 wouldnt be any safer especially to warrant a payout2 nowhat u want is to introduce is a nerf to suicide ganking in the disguise of antiinsurance fraud while at the same time proposing a loophole for corpmates to kill each other for insurance and the best part u think thats gonna get ppl to hold your hand when they can use alts 3 with your flimsy excuses this goes back to my previous 3 despite what u say especially since u claim it does not affect u in any way
1 i never said highsec pvp is suicide suicide ganking however is are you honestly saying that bringing a ship into lowsec or 00 is just as dangerous as a 100 certainty of death by concord2 yes i want another nerf to suicide ganking as promised by ccp did i ever deny that i want to up the ante and if someone then still feels it warranted to suicide gank a low value cargoship then so be it 3 well it does affect me when i cruise around in highsec of course it is not because i live in lowsec that i never visit the big city p

you seriousarchon
wow aeon is the best looking supercarrier imothe nyx is cool looking and same with hel but i do like the aeon allot 
itt people deceived by one side of the aeon and fail to see the otherside missingone of the many reasons i will refuse to fly an aeon is because it is the only under construction sc which is a shame tbh since i prefer the stats and like having 8 low slots instead of 7 nyxsupported it needs a facelift fast
aeon is one of the best looking capital ships in the game its design really say this is a massive capital ship with a big c not supported
exactly the aeon isnt missing a part its simply a huge protection shield for the landing and starting crafts in a fleet fight get used to it
a carrier that resembles a carrier clearly its got to changealso choans that santa pic in your sig is messed up dude
supported it rly dosnt belong the 2 sides clash badly dosnt mather if its the uglyest or best looking sc it rly needs a facelift make it look like symetrical like most of the amarr ships
so it is a bug

gavjack bunk then shoo troll shoo before the mods have to clean up your mess again because obviously your just flat off your rockerlowsec00 doesnt really matter too much as concord isnt involved except for stargate lockoutstation lockoutsentry aggroas far as i know the rules apply to everyone and everything just not swift enforcement when you break them like you would have in high sec spacei have read some frustrationscomplaints and other issues involving this nasty little glitch but its not a frequent occurrence due to lack of concordps why isnt there a full disclosure on aggression mechanics posted somewhere just the rulesguidelines ccp enforces ingame youd think you could find information easily
if there is a piece of ui in eve it needs to work unfortunately frequently that is not the case this bull needs to be fixed i personally would prefer 3 because it makes no sence how does someone get an extended right to fire at me by destroying my property another case of something being missed out by ccp fix this jesus crist and if this really existed for 3 years that makes me sad you know how about we make an invulnerability timer for nullsec that does not do anything huhbecause not a single thread can go about without a personal judgment on the op the only advice i can give is next time more lethal force needs to be applied so that ninja looses both ships eve forums is a place where brave man battled against trolls like gavjack bunk and b tards good job finding another mishap that costed people lives
see the overall impact of this is actually pretty small in 00 it mostly impacts people that are ratting in a system and then attack someone  and then run away and afk cloak if someone sits there extending the aggression counter theres a small chance that the original party will log out for some reason leaving him open to be scanned out in low sec the same risk exists but theres stations everywhere and someone will just dock in one of them no the problem is most evident for people that rely on concord to protect their mission move to low sec and just blow him up when he enters your missionthis is really an extremely small issue  and in reality the only real issue here is that the aggression counter isnt visibly renewed for both parties thats it aggression should be renewed by any hostile action by either partyliang

if its destroyable by a small gang in 510 min it should have a value listed in few k isk and drop nothingat 1030mil thats like the total pi output of a single player across a couple of worlds for a few days no just no your clearly looking for quick and easy profit the drops into acan suggestion without having to work at it at all if the cargolinkcustoms office became a targetable vulnerable object it would have to be tanked along the lines of an ihub well maybe 12 to 110 as tough otherwise pi would be impossible in low and null sec as any ass and his three mates in bcs could disrupt a whole constellation in an hourthis is the whole reason why posstationihubs have reinforcement timers huge hp etc etc so a small band of s cant massivly impact the income of a corpalliance etc without actually having to work for their win and then expecting loot out of the deal as well thats just pure greedbesides without all them high extraction rate worlds in low and null sec importing up to empire building anything up here where extractors are near useless will be impossible
most people dont anything lying around in the cargo link 237 there simply is not point in doing that therefore the only point of blowing it up is to disrupt enemy operation as it will give nearly nothing of value alright so suppose we give it more hp let it last 1520 minutes its not suppose to take as much effort as it takes to sieghe a pos its just freaking 10 mill my pi system produces more then that in one day ok lets say we make it cost less
no defiantly not we dont even know if pi will be hugely profitable yet and wardeccing in highsec is stupid enough as it is since its next to free under all situations dont encourage it
actually hp and prices are barely relevant you still cant counteract such attack without being online 237 which is unrealistic to say the least
because this clearly makes sense and obviously places vulnerable to attack would never ever equip them selves with a means of active defense more hp is clearly the answeralso severing links is a huge disruption at no cost to the attacker in your proposal itd be less disrupting to shoot extractors wait what are you referring to when you say links because rereading that last bit you are not using the term in the same way the game is
wth who is talking about links that hangar in the orbit is what i whant to make destructablei am doing pi it made profitand how is it relevant to highsec and wardecs again in highsec the cargo links belong to the owner of the planet the empire i doubt concord will like you shooting the cargo links now thats a thought give it a couple of guns should we
yeah but prices in empire are highly inflated because noone really knows how much pi is worth someone is buying industrial fibers for like 4k each as it takes something like 8000 to make an ihub worth 500mil someone threw that number at me and i havnt checked it but its probably not far off your looking at 32million for one component of which you will need similar volumes maybe a dozen or so more at that rate your not going to make a profit with all the other materials consideredcap parts etcwhen the npc seeded market starts to dry thats when planets will settle into their real value and until then going oh yeah 10 mil is nothing for a planet is a jokei will admit i havnt actually done the math and trusted someone elses bucket mathsand even if your right and you can make 10mil a day per player per planetat 15 min to kill in null sec them alliances will be replacing their customs offices every 23hrs and like i said i want to see minerals coming to jita so to hell with thatand lowsec would possibly become lost offices per hour
problem with destroyers is their intended role can be filled with better ships that take approximately the same training timethey need a total rework tbh from damage output to tanking abilities i know that i can run a cormorant in a lvl 2 and low level 3s with ease but with 3s its much more effecient to run with a drake or even a cruiserother than that what they need to do is redefine the role of a destroyer also would it be too much to ask for another t2 destroyer the salvage ship 
theres more to eve than mission running having said that the thrasher is a good ship but the other three have anemic slot layoutsthere needs to be a rework but i cant support an empty post like that
sorry for the empty post i have read several threads here about them but i have yet to see any action from ccp about them after reading the quarterly report i am a little concerned that when the people at ccp read it they will say see nothing wrong with the destroyer look at how many are being flown i am merely hoping to get them to look at how they are being used as opposed to the stated purpose of the ship if they do that then maybe they will look at that very good thread and even give us a t2 salvager in the process
quick research on bc yeah i know but its the best i can be bothered to do right now suggests that more ruptures are used in pvp than destroyers of any naturethat shows that something is truly messed up somewhere
ae definitely yes fg are arguable but i think that something in that vein would be reasonable
same opinioni dont really care about corp links but something to make easier the surveying and the linkage and an option to upgrade cc are really neededwhat you want with the click is that we are here its only a way to make the 30mn cycle something we wont use a lotthe clickfest itself is not needed by the gameplaygive us at least an option to choose a timer for all extractors and dont have to choose it each time thats really painfulli want 23h cycle i wont choose something else so add a button somewhere
im assuming the ability to select groups of extractors and storage facilities with the shift key comes in with this me and the rest of my corp consisting of another player and our alts support these ideasespecially the first onemy clicking finger it hurts
absolutely these suggestions are just basic functionality
supported as it is fw is just a money sink with no rewards why take the risk if the rewards arent there how will fw take off if there is no real incentive to join in particular i support the idea of rewarding fw more and differently than how l4 missions are rewarded and add global rewards for the whole militia special advantages in the occupied territories perhaps
thats because occupancy is mainly a pve activity as fw is currently set up get in your pve fit run timers and if someone happens to stumble on you warp out the occupancy mechanics have no decent reward pay less per hour than many other activities and doing them is not fun if they were fun to do people would do them even though they dont pay well indeed pvp doesnt pay well but its funi think this thread demonstrates why ccp is not taking any action on fw players really dont agree on basic things eg should occupancy be pve or pvp should occupancy have larger consequences etc and the bugs involve an activity that very few people engage in because it is not fun or rewarding so really until the players can come up with some clear ideas on what they want why should ccp mess with it
why dont they use existing models and just set where the missiles originate on models that have what look like missile launchers
if they did this they would also have to adjust the velocity of every missile fired out of each launcher on a ship the reason for this is that if youre firing a salvo at the edge of your effective range youd end up with some missiles stopping short simply because they were fired from a launcher sitting further from the target than the others of course adjusting the velocity doesnt solve the problem entirely either you might end up with a scenario where you launch missiles at a target their velocities are adjusted accordingly and then the target zooms past you meaning the slower missiles that were closer to the target are now further away resulting in them missing while the faster missiles hit this is an extreme case but its still something that has to be consideredturrets work fine because their range from the target is actually calculated from the center of the ship just like how missiles are currently launched the turrets that you see are merely eye candy
uhh malcolm who said the missile graphics have to be anything more than the current eye candy turret graphics he was talking about graphics not mechanics i think you thought a little too much on that one when u started talking about changing missile velocitysupport fix the eyecandy factor looks terrible having missiles fly out from the center of my ship from a hole that doesnt exist
only if the drake gets its 8th launcher slot p
the whole world economy collapsed because of too much loans and you want the same to happen in evenot supported
so lets get this straightin a world where tens of thousands if not more of missioners bring in 100s of billions isk into the world you want to take all the money thats going out of the system and pump it back indo you have even the tiniest idea of what thats going to do to the economy the more logical thing to do would be tie mission rewards and other isk sources payouts into the amount of money taken out of the system but thats still a terrible terrible idea
this ship will be designed to deal damage when it bumbs another shipit will be a t2 cruiser hull type yet to be announcedbonusesrole can equipt bulldozing modulebonus 1 50 bonus to max velocity per level and 10 bonus to bulldozing damage per levelbonus 2 10 increase in smartbomb radius and damage per levelhow this will work well the bulldozing damage will occur when a module is activated on the ship this will increase the mass and speed of the ship even more the damage will be depend on the size of the target and how fast you are travelling before impact but it will be classed as kinetic damage due to how it is donethis can be quite interesting in bumping situations since bumping actually happens without effect it would be cool to see a ship that deals damage simply by bumping
rather than a new ship bumping in general would be nice to be able to cause damageon a funn side note about bumping the orca that never made ita bunch of pirates were attacking one of our alliance members posses in wspace me and a couple of them were somewhere in the fights sitting at the high sec side of the wh entrance to the system several of our enemies entered the system and also were sitting there then they bring in an orcasince were in highsec just opening fire wouldnt do hence we decided on a different tactic denialflying at the orca and bumping over and over and over again keeping it away from the entry point as long as possibletook the orca pilot a good while before he finally got himself into the whi still wonder what they would be saying to eachother on vent when they figure out what we were doing
bumping is odd tbh i always thought if two things collided at speed even in space a collision would happen especially if its going at 4kms hehebut yeah a bumping type ship sounds good 
yeah i can see why you say this considering that youre a member of an alliance called kamikaze project but have you thought about fleet warps like this for example

i think you should find a character called pnis monologue and you two should get together so you are too tied up to continue posting

flying the ships and working for a race other than your initial one breaks the lore it doesnt break the lore and i cant see how could any thinking person even think thatpersonally i would like if characters would stay the race and bloodline they are what you want is superficial change anyway and that doesnt recuire a racebloodline change as you said there is little point to it anyway so why waste precious development time on doing it im sure once incarna comes out you can do plastic surgery to make yourself fugly so you resemble an achura and put on some caldari clothes that way you can achieve what you want and ccp doesnt have to waste their limited time with a feature like this
pretty much thisnot supported
whats this about not wanting ccp to devote time to this and spend time on better things if ccp was to do this there would be a fair number of people doing it and i said make it a payable change which means more money to fund the things you say they should spend time on out of 900000 accounts how much money would u think an account service like this would ring in which as i said more money  better products
on behalf of the playerbase would the csm be so kind as to ask our developers to give us an update to the development and drawingboard notes in developmentthe drawingboardmany of the requests harped upon in the assembly hall have been on these lists since 2008 where do these items sit in the production backlog presently
a update would be nice but well the chance to get one is

what is wrong with frigates is that the bridge doesnt come with a preinstalled beer fridge and a pole for the exotic dancers d
clone costs i cant fly frigs as my clone costs 30 mill or somethign stupid 
this is probably the only good argument against frigs in the whole thread frigates are not cost effective for combat when you take into account the cost of replacing a lost clone on a high sp toon
omfg yes ill support thiswhen i first started this game 2 12 years ago i thought to myself cool players can own stationswhen i saw what stations were in videos little boxes tethered by strings taht you drive up to like some kind of inner city mcdonalds i was disgusted at the fail of it allplease actually make poses haev a look liek a real space station like the npc ones
1ekrid1 youre confusing poses with player stations and no they arent the same thing the playerowned npcstyle stations youre thinking of do exist and they can be found throughout 00 space head out there sometime and check it out although you probably wont have docking rights unless youre friendly with the owning alliancethat doesnt change the fact that poses still need an overhaul

dominion was pretty much a toy for us nullsecers to play with while id love to see some of your proposed updates zerolag is a technical impossibility due to the perversity of people taking jita the urexample jita can handle 500 600 want to go there lag it is upgraded to take 700 thinking ahead to add redundancy because its now awesome 1000 turn up devs headdesk round about therethat said post dominion and now post tyrannis us nullsecers are noticing increasing lag and inability of the server to handle small fleets movingthe most egregious example i can think of was a gang of about 30 of us planning a long roam heading over two regions from our home in the region next door in almost empty systems in a quiet region with nothing in that region or nearish using a jb we were creating the kind of lag and jump delays i used to attribute to a 150man fleet moving around
instead of boosting blasters im saying its a good thing that weapon systems for different races has advantagesdisadvantages like dps rof falloff optimal this game would be pretty boring if only the name and the damage type would be different for all racesclearly you need the balance these weapon systems tho instead of boosting the falloff and optimal of blasters i think the ship platforms themselves should be changed for example the typical blaster ship hulls like thorax brutix megathron and hyperion and their t2faction variants should get a 25 base speed bonus so you still need to get within point blank range to cause a lot of damage but with a faster ship u would have the chance to do itnowadays its really not a wise thing to pick up a fight for an astarte with a sleipnir because u wont stand a chance to get in range in time the same applies for fleet fights for example 10 cyclones would simply  10 brutixes in no time because the brutixes would spend the most of their time by chasing down their targets instead of shooting themits pretty abnormal that i have to use acs on gallente ships since theyre better even without the ship bonuses
so if someone disagrees with you and has a valid point its a troll ok nice to know
yup thanks for the bump though

command ships definatly need some love particularly the fields so i support this for a ship that costs more than a battleship and cant be insured there has to be some payoff for using it im not saying better than a bs but still there should be a pro and the fact that almost all the fields are outclassed by the tier2 bc is just wrong these are advanced battlecruisers they should definatly outperform a t1 bcbut this proposal improves them without making them uber god

heres another annoying little itemlets say you have two processors that both need a resource and are both fed from the same source an extractor or storagewhen more resources become available it apparently goes to a processor at random it may be using some internal order what it should do is preferentially fill the processor that already has the most resourcesin other words lets say the processors need 40 units of reactive metals one currently has 20 and the other 0 now 20 more units become available those 20 units should go to the processor that already has 20 so that it is completely ready to goas it stands now the new resources will often go to the processor with 0 units both become halffull and both are stalled in a complex multistage pipeline these pipeline stalls can add a couple of hours to a daylong precursorfinal product runmore precisely the rule should be when distributing resources first fill the destinations that already are closest to being completely full if multiple destinations are equally full fill the ones that are closest to being full with their other requirements note that for a hightech processor a full7040 would rank higher than a 909040 because the former would get filled to full70full and be more likely to get filled up and start running faster
looks good supported 
id prefer fills to thing closest to starting a run if not already run its annoying as all hell when you have enough mins  a tiny amount more to run 2 factories in parallel 6k per half hour it seems to want to fill one and que up enough to fill it for the next half hour leaving one empty until the next round of minerals come in where it refils the one thats been working non stop and puts just enough into the second onei dont know how much extra maths it would take in the system but a little more intelligence to let facilities run more effectively as small hiccups like this amplufy so if your running dozens of factories you can have half sitting there going im empty while the other half go i have enough for now and later and head hits desk
ok not saw if this has been mentioned in among the tons of repplys to this thredthe skills should still mean somthing they are a majure part of the eve learning slopeif ur gonna take the attribute enhancement away then dont get rid of the skill give it a different bonus like15 bonus to accumulated sp ph primary attribute0025 bonus secondary atribute to all skills requireing its ond atribute enhancement so at lvl 5 it would give a 75 bonus to total sp gained primary attribute 0125 secondary u could have one new skill un the learning headding for each seperate tree whilst keeping the learning skill its self
alot of the people not supporting dont seem to be able to read or read half a line and red mist decendedccp will get rid of learning skills  they only need to find a solution then they will do itergo there is no arguing for learning skills they will go as soon as ccp has a solution or says to hell with it and just abolishes them and angers the players because they couldnt get a supported solutioni support give all characters 10 to all statsbecause that increases the divisor for skill learning by 15 for all pilots and what is a big barrier to new players is the time it takes for them to train up reasonable skills a flat boost in stats to everyone wont affect the old vets who have 8  10 in all stats from learning anyway but will significantly improve the training time of skills for all players under 1yr old helping them get the skills needed to start doing more fasterremember this is about giving ccp an option that dosnt just simply remove them and annoy everyone
maybe make it so they only show up on the tactical overlaybut i support
an awful decision by ccp to release tyrannis without this
top pls having to go through 20 pages of old contacts instead of having them sorted into folders is stupidly time consuming just to find 1 you want to remove
we need the folders ccp i am ed in war without them
im sure forgetting to route our finished products back to a storage unit has probably happened to many of us as the large amount of clicks necessary to craft an efficient pi network can make us lose track of certain changes we make during the process a small blinking notification on the extractor or processor window alerting us to unrouted goods would be a great benefit to ensure things run as smoothly as possibleits a simple change one which shouldnt really cause much if any annoyanceswhat do you think

good point count me in on this standoff
1 depending on the situation why couldnt it be ppl have gotten into impossible situations with 100 destruction and they still get insurance and r u honestly saying that high sec is more dangerous than low sec00 2 when is ccp ever obliged to turn eve into wow how about making an actual effort on your part by using a better hauler for once instead of making excuses for ccp to hold your hand3 define cruise around because unless u always cruise around high sec carrying high value cargo theres no reason why ud somehow be scared to death of high sec after supposedly living in low sec
1 i give up and agree we disagree2 it is about risk vs reward i want more risk for suicide gankers just as i think that moving level 5 missions to lowsec was a good move  fix or nerf whatever you call it  however when people start to kill for example hulks just for fun then the price for suicide ganks has to go up it has gone up but not enough imho3 i am not scared of death and take calculated risks when hauling stuff from empire to lowsec or back thing is i really dont have to carry high value cargo because people do it for funwhat i ask for is the implementation of ccps promise 
1 fair enough2 ahh so it is about exhumers too cause a t2 ship should have have zero risk to use right and games should not be played for fun right 3 news flashnewbies dont really get suicide ganked in their rookie ships as they would in those nightmares u keep having so yes its still safe enough and factoring this with all uve said and claimed so far only proves that u know almost nothing about this threadbut lets see if u really give up and agree to disagree which i seriously doubt
only agreed to disagree on point 1 not the rest but i will stop arguing i gave my support to this proposal and i hope that one day ccp keeps its promise quote from ccp fear in addition the highly requested feature of removal of insurance in concord related events will be implemented in the near future
as one of maybe 3 people with the purchasing power to actually buy an aeon if i wanted in this thread i agree with the op the aeon is by far the ugliest of all capital ships with its half built bestower looks i dont know of anyone who owns an aeon that actually likes its look i know of quite a few people who go so far as to train a completely different racial carrier just so they can buy something that isnt an aeon
aeon deserves better there are people that train for nyx instead of aeon simply because the aeon looks silly those people also prefer the stats of the aeonplease make the aeon look like something i want to fly instead of just something that sounds like i want to fly
looks like i forgot to support my topic
just to clarify the op is not wanting to change how aggression works only how the timer is shown or not also as i understand it this is what liang is suggesting  the timer needs to be accuratei would have to agree the aggression timer needs to show whether aggression can legally happen between two players its that simpleregardless of how or why or whether its fair that the aggression timer changes it is critical that the player is given the correct information about aggression so that they are able to make choices sid meier defines a game as a series of interesting choices the choices arent so interesting if you are given false information to base them on
semicorrectthe main point is the visibility of the timerhowever to me it is exploitative to be able to extend that timer without restraint by shooting wrecks i would hardly consider that an act of aggression as its just a pile of trashbut yes the timer visibility is the main issue
one could similarly argue that you shouldnt get a timer just because someone shot you thats equally as wrongliang
as near as i can tell the lachesis is the only ship in the game to have a heavy missile bonus but not a ham bonus although the sacrilege gets a ham bonus but no heavy missile bonus note that the huginn which also has split weapons systems and gets a missile launcher rof bonus gets a bonus to hams as well all this just makes me suspect that ccp forgot to update the lachesiss bonus when hams were introduced unless someone has a reason why this would be gamebreaking i think this should finally be fixed
kk so this hole thing is based on risk v reward right thats what i get from most of the posters now low sec people are always tring to claim there is no risk in runing missions so the good paying ones should be in low sec to inc the risk becouse there is no risk in runing high sec missionsthen your going to love this i just wish they had one for all ships and not just tech 3 but we will use what they give usfirst quarterly economic newsletter of 2010 security group counthigh sec 1228pve 964pvp 264low sec 601pve 75pvp 526null sec 1514pve 449pvp 1065wormhole space 680pve 283pvp 397total 4023now if we look at the high sec will see that 964 ships were lost in pve and that in low sec only 526 ships were lost in pvp i think thats a clear and cut case of high sec mission runers lossing more ship in pve in high sec with out help dieing then ships were lost in low sec to pvpso clearly level 5 missions should be in high sec becouse the greater risk is in losing a ship in a mission in high secplz keep in mind this are just tech 3 ships only there is no telling out many ships are realy lost in high sec missions verses low sec pvp but people were using them for both here and they are the best ships out there right now that are not capitol class ships originally by vaerah vahrokha quotenice troll though ill give it an 810i have the foul feeling he was not trolling so op if you lose 1000 ships in hi sec with ie a 200k player base in hi sec and you lose 500 ships in low sec with a 20k player base you say hi sec is riskier for reallet me just copypast this one too man i could probly copypast this for every low sec reply as its going to be the numbers now matter as there replyyou see people this is how low sec crys about high sec and mission running first they cry for mons that there is no risk no ship loss in high sec pveing and we the high sec pves cry that were the larger crowed so give them to usand they say the larger number dos not mean anythingand now we show that more ships are lost to high sec pve then to low sec pvp and now there cry the numbers matter the numbers wtf man is it just me or is he crying the same thing that they told us did not matter
supporting my own ideal
this has to be the most ed logic ive seen in a long time you have to be trolling no person could possibly seriously think like this
damn just flaming here any logic you got pointing to my ed logic
im not him but i can give you some logicfirst there are more people in high sec lets say that these is 10x more people in high sec than low sec i really dont know but there are probably more than that so if the number was equal it looks to be like um 964 vs 5260 thats more than 5x less in high secsecond you are comparing pve to pvp when they are two seperate things and the number of ships dieing in pve will remain no matter what system you are in if you have enough people running missions so if you add the added risk of pvp ontop of that pve you get 964526 which is 1490 and you get 964 vs 1490 again high sec wins on lowest losses
kk then by your logic we should look at the big pic right so lets take this game wide not just high sec low sec but game widepve loses 1771 or 4402pvp loses 2252 or 5598so game wide there is close to a 10 higher chance of lossing a pvp ship then there is a pve shipand the highest level of pve is in wh and null sec and pays alot better then level 5s but low sec should have something more profitalbe then high sec so what do they have that high sec dont o ya moon miningcapitals better belts better q level mission givers and lower sec states raising the pay outs of this missions fwso ya for a 10 diffence i do think high sec should have level 5 missions
first off nooblet whs has no bounties or awards you have to haul out what you gather and its not as easy as it soundssecondly null sec has big rewards but at great riskcost unless your a big fat alliance capable of holding your own space you ever been to null sec help maintain an ihub with sov bills yeah rightits quite obvious you have no ing idea what your talking aboutyour just trolling to be trollingso please go troll somewhere else and stop wasting everyones time with broken logicthis reeks of bullcrap
ya i have done whs low sec and null sec i have not done 00 but i just think low sec with better rewards and im probly not to far off and becosue i have been in null sec is why i know what 1010s pay out and how much better it pays not even counting the faction loot or that you can use carryers do help with themwe dont pimp ride fraction bs in high sec level 5s for shi z and giggles its becouse we cant get carryers into high sec for the missionssecondly you loot your bountys in whs they dont weigh much at all and pay good and good paying salvage too not like the crap salvage we get in high sec missionsnull sec has lower risk and higher rewards then low sec it is vastly easyer to lock a system down with cryo jammers and bubbles then how you have to do it in low secso plz dont try your low sec bs proaganda on me thx u have a nice dayedit as a side note the time i spent in null sec was before the changes with help maintain an ihub with sov bills but i did not much like the blob then and probly will not like the blob now
i get what your saying here you got my support
th155 already pointed out the most glaring errors you are either intentionally misinterpreting the data to suit your goals or cant interpret it either way it doesnt make for a convincing argument you are also using just one ship type as an example a ship type that is too expensive for most people to even use in pvp so the numbers will naturally favor pve losses more than if the comparison would be done using another type of ship the point is that this info cant even be used to prove what you are trying to use it forwait what you have done null sec but not 00 this is the problem right here you either have serious issues expressing what you mean make stuff up to sound like less of a noob or you are trolling on purposeyou are ignoring the fact that it isnt easy to secure that space initially it takes constant work and sacrifice to maintain and you still risk losing it at all times usually so much work that a small entity cant even hope to do it alone even after you have locked down a system it doesnt offer protection if you dont constantly defend it against intruders 00 is also far more dangerous to move around in since you can use bubbles there just because you can achieve a position where most of your areas are protected and people can live there in relative peace doesnt mean the risk and cost of 00 is any less it just means that your safety is earned by the work of others the higher rewards are definitely warranted
this thread is made of win supporting and bumping just to see more posts
your analysis proves nothing statistically and if you think it does please post your prooffirst flaw is that your sample is scewed beyond what any person would think is a correct sample of pve ships instead of taking just t3 move to encompassing the entire population of pve losses and then provide the numbers of the amount of missions done in highsec vs lowsec you can even go as far as to give the amount of npc piratesdrones destroyed in each of those areas on a daily basis then you numbers will more likely show that the opposite of what your arguing is truethe shear mass of pve ships and missions done in highsec is staggering and the losses more than make up for the amount of completed missions i say move lvl4s to systems bordering lowsec and have half of those missions be in those lowsec systems or move them to lowsec all together this is not a move more people to lowsec issue it is based off of that same risk vs reward factor you want more reward take more riskpresent your mathematical proof and the link to your statistics proove me wrong with math then ill support this topic
the main flaw is assuming that a loss pve is the only risk to a mission runnerquestion does a mission runner in lowsec who got scanned down and gang dropped by players count as a pvp loss or a pve one if pvp then the lowsec risks are increased because the total loss is the risk to a mission runner becausein lowsec your pve ship might get caught by a roaming gang and ganked in pvp similarly in null sec there is no neat line between pvp and pve people loose hulks and ratting ravens too often due to rats jumping in in high sec pve losses are in total the result of people not fitting their ship right and being killed by the ratseverywhere else this is not the only risk factorby examining only one risk factor it screws the results to fit your assertion but all factors muct be accounted for the numerical disparity as well which someone already caught
some literacy could help in putting your idea forward nonetheless i think this is a bad idea you heard the man high sec was never intended to harbor lvl5s if you want to do them occupy a lowsec pocket militarize it and reap the fruits of your labor no risk no reward
so your theory is that it is less risky to mission in low sec than in high sec well by that logic low sec is less risk and more reward so i guess you are living in low sec space along with the majority of mission runners right no your logic is wrong your math is wrong your theory is wrong and you are wrongccp wants level 5 missions in low security space ccp created the game and that is what they want if you do not like it then you can gtfo the end
all though your logic is slightly off you are absolutely right about one thing more ships will be lost to pve in highsec if lvl5s are allowed there not because the risk of loosing a ship to pve is higher in highsec but because more people do pve in highsec compared to lowsecthis is the only reason why more people loose ships to pve more often in highsec safety means you lower your guard and stop paying attention lvl5s are more dangerous in nature so more ship should get lost logically speakingeither way i dont see why they shouldnt be allowed in highsec
level 5 and high quality 4 missions were never supposed to be in highsecso it is good they finally removed themit will certainly draw more players to lowsec maybe not much but so be itand even if it does not attract more people to lowsec at least the lowsec mission runners will have more reward for being in lowsecnow we need to remove the level 4 quality 15 and higher agents from highsec and fixed oh and not supported
uhm you are the one crying about your lost toy we  lowsec mission runners  are happy with the status quo  level 4 quality 15  20 agents can stay in highsec while level 5 agents stay in lowsec 
erm level 5 missions are not something that people can simply jump into unlike a level 1 therefore just moving the level 5 will not make more people mission run in empire and if simply moving the missions is enough well they have been moved back to lowsec therefore more pve will happen in lowsec and more people will move to lowsec by your logiclastly it dosnt actually matter if level 5s in high sec mean more ships are lost to pve thats no the reason ccp moved them loosing ships to pve shouldnt happen as the rats dont do massive damage and you should know what your up against and prepare its like saying better minerals in belts will mean more miners exploding in high sec they shouldnt be exploding in the first placethe risk v reward isnt the only argument and even if it is players are the biggest risk in lowsec you have to get past gatecamps get to the site go in finish before being scanned down and ganked then get back to base thats the challenge to mission run while under a crossfire
not supported lvl vs were supposed to be in lowsec and should stay in lowsecfeel free to pay us protection money that will be a great boost to local economy
ya right you just pointing out why low sec is just fail on ccps part anyone will to pay for protection will pay for null sec space and anyone with the manpower to lock down a low sec system for any kind of activity will rapidly fig out that they can make more doing it in 00null or whjust becouse low sec is fail dos not mean they have to turn around and make high sec fail too
i think youre totally missing the point here people dont do missions in lowsec because the primary point of doing missions for most people is making isk players shooting each other tends to get in the way of thatas people are already doing lvl4s in highsec without any trouble they might want to try a lvl5 all though trying a new and more challanging set of missions and have people shoot at you might be a bit much so most people decide its not worth the riskand yes i know most people dont loose ships to pve unless thteyre not paying attention but that does not mean youre not supposed to loose them it just means that most of the time it can be avoided one way or another if ships werent meant to be lost then npcs wouldnt do any damage and they most certainly wouldnt use scramblers and webs
ccp knows low sec missions are broken they learn that lesson thats why they changed sleeper ai to what it isthey need to pull 100 of missions out of low sec put them in high sec and set up a hole new better paying mission system in low sec based off whsedit and the low sec lp stores should be differnt with better and differnt iteams then the high sec stores so that us high sec mission runners dont delud low secs profits with are massive amount of mission runing and lps
i know many of you have accidentally passed waypoints without noticing and then ended up 10 jumps past where you needed to pick stuff upwellhow about a circle around each waypoint system dot on the top left for thatmaybe even have the ui voice say waypoint reached just like while on autopilothave the voice optional so it doesnt annoy people
i ran into this same issue recently when i had to collect all my items of certain type across the universe luckily i could use the assets window to keep track of things but there really isnt a reason not to have this integrated to the normal navigation system it is just a simple usability tweak with no negatives
if you can add waypoints and it says destination reachedit cant be a massive leap to add waypoint reached
proposal  make the distribution of generated anomalies by the pirate detection array a bell curve ie mostly the average value anom for your current upgrade level with some higher and lower rather than the current low end bias also the range is currently including anomalies not normally encountered in nullcurrently the infrastructure upgrade pirate detection array comes in 5 levelseach level adds a number of auto respawn on completion anomalies to the system it is installed inthese are something around 4 anomalies per levl of upgrade with a small quantity of the higher end anomalies based on the upgradeat level 4 this is a haven and 2 hubs approx at 5 2 sanctums and 2 havens more hubs and more of the lower ends the idea is to improve the ability of a nullsec alliance to live solely in 00 making money from its own systems rather than clogging mission hubs running lvl45sthe problem is the weighting on anomaly generation is a decay curve that peaks at the weakest anomalies and generates some mid level ones and a few highsexample a quick scan in two systems with a pirate 5 array got thisyard 2den 3 rally point 5 port 2hub 5 haven 2sanctum 2yard 2den 2 rally point 4 port 2hub 5 haven 2sanctum 2now the guide to anomalies says null sec typically has the top third of the anom table which yards and dens are not in teing in the low end of the mid rangealso there are a large number of rally points in both those systems again a lower end plexim not asking for pure havensanctum but if the maths generated a spike round hub tailing off to rallypoint and sanctum in a bell curve fashion it would bring the generated anomalies in line with wild ones and make it more viable
they do need a total rework and the problem is that frigates and destroyers are made useless by droneslook how they nerfed hybrid guns because gallente ships were putting out too much dps but they havent ever touched drones with their ed high tracking rate ridiculous damage and so on and so onthe hit ratios need to be reworked because anything smaller than a cruiser is cruiser lunch with or without drones that goes doubly for destroyers with twice the sig radius as frigatesdestroyers also need 10 ab speed  2 cap use per level to be able to go fast like a destoyer should but for a limited time the sig radius is their achilles heel but frigs and destroyers all got a 15 boost to shield armor and hull then wed see a rapid increase in viability of frigates and consequently higher usage and viability of destroyers people used to fly frigates for pirating back in 08 now that the majority of players can run bchacbs the frigates mysteriously disappear from usage in lowsec could it be that drones are bull could it be that hp is too low could it be that hit ratio is too high because of the way sig radius and so on are calculatedthe coercer would be a much better ship than it currently is but it only has 1 mid slot do you put on a speed mod to speed tank large guns or do you put on a scram to prevent escape and get d by large guns hmm choices no not really any choice at allas another suggestion destroyers need more mid and lot slots because theyll still be limited by their upper end fitting ceiling so they can focus on using a few slots for one task or using more slots for more generalized tasks
oh youre an empire carebear it all makes sense now no wonder you have zero grasp of carrier mechanics here i thought you were trolling but you were in fact just a really really ignorant poster

this might sound stupid or seem like a troll to some but for those of you who enjoyed playing starcraft and played as the protoss and enjoyed using a swarm of fighters to destroy your enemies through the use of carriersimo i think it would be a great addition to eve to introduce a light carrier class shipfrom what i have noticed there a 3 tiers of ships in each ship class for example the armageddon apoc and abaddonso in this case introduce a light carrier to be a t1 light carrier the carrier would be t2 and supercarrier being t3the light carrier would be able to be flown in high sec meaning it would not be so large as to require a cyno to jump systems allowing it to travel into 5 systemslike the other 2 carriers it would not have any turret or launcher hard points its dps would rely solely on the drones it could field it would not be able to field fighter or fighter bombers just drones have the ability to field 1 additional drone per racelight carrier skill level up to a maximum of 10 drones making its dps compairable to the dps of other high sec class ships at their lvl 5 skill levelits special abilities would be partially based off its t2t3 counterparts ie drone dmg increase armor resist increase shield resist increase armorshield transfer ammount increasethese are just some ideas i know that ccp will probably never implement it however i am just posting it to see what others would think of iti know at one time ccp had a few ships that were able to field more than 5 drones but took them out due to lag issues but i do not think that would be the case with this shipanyway you opinions
meh just fly a domi it pretty much does all of that
dps wise  you would end up with the same dps as a domi that said  why invent a new ship when an existing ship can already do the same
buy a domi
well i like the idea but it would need other advantages over the already mentioned domi perhaps a clone vat bay actually scratch that it should have a special kind of drone speed of minnie drones combined with gallente drone damage  interceptorassault drones speed of for example a warrior with the dmg output of a hammerhead edit or valkyrie so that race bonuses could be applied
the concept of a light carrier in itself has merit though id say perhaps a jf analog in that it could both cynojump or use gates but have say a jump range half that of a conventional carrierand maybe able to field a maximum of 5 fighters with a few other mods to make it a useful ship would still be hellaciously expensive though
5 fighters do as much dps as a domi with 5 ogre ii why would you need a new ship for that
light carrier that can do the drone thing but with half the bay and no or not as good rr and no triage then seriously people if someone puts down a vague base point thats approx domi you just go use a domi rather than go hmm but maybe with this
no the point is what youre asking for doesnt require a new ship you see most eve ships except the legion have a role that they fill your light carrier would have no role since the dominix can already do everything youre asking it to do including rr btw and would probably do it better and cost less for that matter you could pull off the same thing with a typhoon just with less reserves in terms of dronesnot supported
pshh carrier like i give a rats i dont heck i barely leave jita im just working on constructive criticism now you have been sir i salute you you pointed out that there needs to be a role for the light carrier and there isnt really onethe people who said buy a domi could have ended this so much earlier by just adding that issue about no roleand now i shall cease the devils advocate role on this at leastexit stage left with ominous laughter
a subcap carrier would be a nice idea similar to the subcap orca to give fighter  rr support i would buy onesupported
the idea may have merit but it needs some way of being differentiated from the domi without being overpowered and it needs a specific role to fill ill see about hashing out some ideas for it later
i would let it keep fighter drones but it gets no more then 5 out at a time no 1 a skill level or the ablity to fit the high slot mod that also 1s them5 fighter drones would be hot to play with in high sec missions and ya i would stick with the other bounses as the biger brothers ie no weapons in high slots that kind of thing but less tank and all that too

youd have to change missile mechanics regardless currently missiles arent just graphics like turrets are theyre actual objects that fly through space change course can be shot down by defenders speaking of mechanics that need to be changed and all this other jazz that people seem to take for granted if you want to demote them so to speak to being just graphics it would require a rework of the missile codethe point here is that this proposal brings with it a significant amount of work that a lot of people dont seem to realize its not just having some modeler slapping launchers onto each ship theres a great deal of programming involved here as well
when mining in general the ore is added to your cargo once the cycle has finished in terms of strip miners my proposal is that i would very much like to see the ore being placed into my cargo as it is being mined and not all at once at the end of the cycle i have no doubt that the mechanics of the game could easily allow for this sort of calculation to be made and doneapologies if this has already been raisedthank you for reading my proosal and welcome any criticisms regards c linski
to what end whyit changes nothing and honestly it already does that just shut off the strip miners sooner rather then letting them finish the cyclesorry but i dont see anything constructive about this other than adding more work for ccp that needs to be spent somewhere else
i am in agreement with you that it does not change the outcomehowever i feel that it adds a more realtime aspect to miners it makes it more enjoyable seeing the consistant build up of ore going in than the bulk drop at the end for the small amount of work for ccp it would take to impliment this idea i feel that it would make mining that little bit more enjoyable thanks for the feedback all the same though
i wonder howmuch the servers would enjoy this real time process
its a good idea but would completely destroy the pvp aspect of mining im referring to situations where the bloke next to you starts mining your targetted asteroid and its close to popping and you cut your lasers off before his cycle ends so that you get the last of the asteroid and he gets nothing or is it just me that does that
i dont know if it is just you that does that but you make me want to give mining a second chance just to try it and see what happens
confirming that this  and arkonor are the only reasons to mine
useless idea as it serves no purpose and creates necessary strain on the serversccp has bigger fish to fry
supported its face book allover again
yes it is total unethical all you need is a lil check box that allows you to flag a petition to take it higher

attempts to neutral rr people with aggression timers against other corps should be considered the same as if firing on that corp they are neutral towards ie it can be done if you want concord to pop you concord allows itself to be payed off for two corps to kill each other even with podding i suspect that concord would pop anyones ship who is attempting to influence that while remaining outside of a wartarget via neutral status

hi jin nice postive been updating the thread you link to and ran out of space i made a new one used ideas found here too with the a new address
thanks for the heads upupdated to reflect changes
i dont care and probly most dont care about the if they add stats to all or boost training times what realy maters for us older players the trained them up is geting to spend thoughs sps right now on the skills we want them inbecouse we already spent that time training not only that we have 5mil sps in max training skills but when we trained them it was a much longer training time to get up to themso the real deal here is do we just give them the 5mil sps they have in there training skills are do we also rembust them and addital amout of sps for all the time they spent training learning skills with out max learning skills to help them train themi say remburs all learning skills sp  10 sp as compistion and let that pilot pick were he wants to place the sp right at that moment he logs in to his toon
if learning skills had never been in the game it would have taken all us vets another year or more to get to where we currently are im sure my learning skills havesaved me months thats the whole reason why we all trained learning skills early they paid themselves back in spending a month training them by saving us months in the long run we have had the benefit lots of it and by getting 10 to all stats we dont loose anythingas an example this is like someone investing money in a companyyears later share dividends have paid back that investment many times over and the company is about to go under and you complain that just getting your money back isnt fair you want a proiftyou already had the profit it just didnt announce itselfstart a new toon on your main only temporary load him into eve mon set up a network of skill plans to train up to all the skills you have right now but without touching learning skills see how many years that would take now look at your main characters ageyou got your profit right there youve saved time the one resource thats near priceless
not supportedthis game is about making others cry and learning skills do thatideally add a third tier of them to filter out those players with weak spines before they ruin the game further
i have to agree with tak here i am roughly the same age as most of my corp mates and i have all but the two charisma skills to lvl 5 which took me ages all my corp mates in the beginning said that i was a bit stupid to take them all that far however i have now surpassed most of my corp mates simply because i took the time this solution that has been presented is almost fair however it does not account for the accelerated training time i have benefited from in the mean time how would we calculate that or is it simply stfuagowtthis game is all about investing time thats what makes it so special when you lose a ship or a clone its not the isk youre bothered about its how long it took you to accumulate that isk and then build your ship get all your implants in etc etclosing learning skills all together is imo a bad idea perhaps new people could get an option in character creation to apply some sp in the basic learning skills area i have no problem with giving new players more sp on character creation
maybe give all new chars basic learning skills to l4 and advanced 3 in addition to what they currently get
not supported however i do agree that learning skills can be tedius yes but you arent forced to train them in the first place true however is that most people including me will advise one to do that i did it myself and ive only played for a few months myself but i also have a solution for new people many complain that new people spend their first weeks just sitting around being bored etc which can be true if you take on learning skills asapmy solution is that you spend the first 23 weeks either training for a mining or combat ship say getting racial frigate 5 weapon skill to 5 so that you can use whatever t2 weapons system and tanking skills to reasonable level this could also go for a miner aswell getting into a retiever and start making some moneyplaying around some in evemon gives me that for the non missile using races it would take about 1 month to get into a fully useable combat frigate with t2 weaponsskills weapon system of your choicespecalisations to 4racial frigate to 5estimated sp112 million sp as far as caldari and basic skills go for combati dont fly caldari so i could be wrong here it is about the same timeskills rocket specalisation 4missile launcher operations 5rockets 5caldari frigate 5estiamted sp 12 millionnow for a miner basic choice here would be the retriever theese are only the basic skills neededbut for a completely fresh toon to get into a retriever it would only be about 2 weeks netting you a sp amount of aproximately 561ktrue going for combat is abit more skill intensive and puts you at a higher estimated sp but it would also nullify the argument that you cant do anything because of learning skillsi chose only to pick up the most common proffesions the advantage here aswell is that once you complete your learning skills you will be able to get into any t2 frigate of your choice once you train the skills needed for it but you will also be able to so something while you train the learning skills granted level 1s arent that much fun but you will be able to do them somewhat efficently the skillplan lacks other needed skills which is true but those do not really have a huge impact on level 1s in my exerpience anyway theese are just my two cents
lowsec needs this attention an improvement to lowsec would increase the enjoyment of the game for a large portion of players and may entice others into more interesting better developed areas of the game like pvp for instanceso bump
agree with most of the points mentionedhowever if you want all of the empires to be bordered by lowsec you have to make sure there are no easy chokepoints do not want rancer mk ii

1 u agree to disagree on one point because your semantics dont work on the others not that it wouldve made a difference even if it did2 it aint gonna happen since high sec is still very populated and active even with other nerfsbut plz not argue some moreid really like to hear it

why dont we make everyone loose standings with jove when i remote repp them makes just as much sense
2 years ago i would have said faction ships were forgotten relics of a time long past in eve with their recent buff and new ships added frequently it is clear ccp wants faction ships in eve and is going to be adding even more in the future why not faction capitals and supercapitals obviously the cost of both the bpc and producing the actual item would need to be much higher than anything any lp store or industrialist has ever seen especially in the case of a faction supercapital faction capitals would be the toys of the rich who do not wish to be trapped in the tombs that are supercapitals but find faction bs far too common cost would be entirely up to ccpfaction supercapitals would be prohibitively expensive for all but the absolute richest in eve again cost would be entirely up to ccp but hopefully it would remain high enough that 40b for a non faction titan would seem cheap in comparison it would also give people who have a titan and get bored because there is nothing left to achieve in eve in their eyes from quitting how cool would a true sansha mothership or titan be something that large and spikey would just be impressive to see cyno inonce the cyno effect stops suckingwe have faction pos guns webs points and even ecm why not give us faction pos hardeners labs factories miners cyno jammers cyno generators and cyno arrays these things wouldnt always have more hp but would instead benefit from higher productivity less waste and lower ozone usage on top of all this why not allow these items not to be farmable by the random high sec macro only through missions for corporations exclusively located in lowsec or npc 00 would allow you to gain the lp for these items this would give lowsec its own niche value that 00 and empire already have ccp has struggled with why people dont go into lowsec much beyond fw and pirating because quite simply they lack any real reason beyond level 5sand that is very recent just as every ship in eve fills a specific niche low sec needs a niche yes i know they are super carriers and not motherships but jesus  is that an awful name and i am writing this while pretty intoxicated so sentence and paragraph structure be damned faction supercaps wont ever be about cost effectiveness or even having the biggest ship they will be the shiniest and largest of all e in eve sought after by manyedit i would like to emphasize the faction capssupercaps would only be the peak of the lp store not the entirety of it you would be getting other toys such as destroyers battlecruisers tier 2 faction bs for pirate factions tier 3 faction bs for navy factions implants pos mods and the usual assortment of ammoshipsimplants found in all equivalent lp stores
faction capitals fapitals
fapitals indeed
thumb up for fapfapfapfapitaledit up not ip
i endorse this product
not sure if wantthat would require the creation of a separate lp counter and then 5 years of lowsec00 mission running for a fapitalthis also raises the question about t2 capitals tho admittedly fapitals are much easier to introduce because you dont have to find a role for them
it would only require a new lp store for the new corps as i already said since the corps selling these items are only found in lowsec and 00 these lp stores would also share many of the items for their racial empire counterparts ammo cruisers frigates bs implants etcno seperate lp store for a corp based off where you are just a completely different corporation you are working foredit and yes a very long time farming lps would be ideal to keep these as rare as possible rare items are expensive items expensive items are prestige in many peoples eyes
well alright why not tho i still dont see a good reason to introduce them other than give the super rich something to sink isk into500 bil faction titan km anyone
the caps and supercaps are primarily toys for the rich the other faction items such as pos mods would be more for your everyday eve group obviously you would need other faction items that simply arent in the game yet possibly things like faction outpostsya i went there and sov structures hopefully more things usable outside 00 would also be available end goal is to give low sec its own special thing you cannot get in empire and making it valuable enough that people actually want what lowsec has to offer enough to venture from high sec in search of greater richesoh hey i forgot faction battlecruisers and destroyers would be pretty amazing toys as well lower end of the isk totem pole
i like the idea altho faction bcs would reduce the command ship niche even more which is a shame
unless you took away their ability to run gang links in favor of damage or mobility bonuses
i want a blood raider dreadnought
yarr i want a republic ragnarok with a topwingybit for more speed
you dont think it would be a better idea to move away from capitals online by means of looking for ways to promote and reward small to medium level pvp prowesseright now the supercapital card is the ace that trumps everything for all intents and practical purposes up to and including killing nodes as a means of campaign doctrine its one of those points of presence in eve where volume impedes dynamicspushing to encourage this trend under the marketing of lets make low sec interesting for faction bpcs seems to be a continuation of a school of thought which is counterproductive to pvp i admit it would be very nice to see low sec being useful and interesting but this format is just following the path that builds upon and promotes trench warfare on an increasingly higher scalei can see why many people want that but that is a political instrument not something that ties to game design look at the state of eve in china where political polarisation and arms proliferation has resulted in an environment of several great virtual walls in space behind which people do as they please for the sake of the grind while the subscriber and concurrent user counts continue to declineim sorry but you need to do better marketing this is just politics understandable but not attractivehonestly low sec would be much better served by mechanisms that enable players to influence it directly and dynamically through their actions this is a principle that has always pushed eve ahead
you know i was taking your post seriously until you described faction warfare as the feature to save lowsec i especially like the bit where you said essentially lowsec could be useful and interesting or we could give them faction warfare its like youre ing on everyone who reads your posts without the courtesy of even trying to call it raintry harder next time this was such an obvious troll it hurts me you thought it would work edit added in a quote of your post so you cant change it 
dont twist words or try to put words in someones mouth youre better then that i never mentioned faction warfare far from iti agree low sec needs viable elements that make it worth peoples while to dabble in it to live in it to work in it and kill in it and yes that is very limited right now however throwing one structural challenge of eve in as a means of reward of the negative spiral is not a solution id love to turn my titans into faction versions i can just picture a true sansha mushroom with globular extensions underneath  but that is a topic entirely on its ownif you truly want to make low sec a viable niche within eve i wouldnt put it to the use of other niches but try and think of ways where low sec as a niche is able to function as a niche first and interact with other niches second
so you agree lowsec needs to be viable but you dont want to see a pile of new faction things because you disagree with the idea of faction capitals because somehow it encourages trench warfarethat will be there anyways you think lowsec needs a draw that isnt this but its a vague feature that allows players to influence the game directly with their actionsfaction warfare but it most definitely is not faction warfare youre either trolling or ing ed
i agree even if the faction capitals were functionally equivalent to the current capitals but with different models true sansha supercarrier yes please
faction capitals would make this game even more insane then it is it is simply content that has no relevant purpose right now in evesadly more and more content required to hold subscriber retention shows us quite clearly that eve is slowly becoming more like the game of wowthe trend that new expansions are released and there is a massive boom of online players then slowly over time that player base fades away eves content has imo been flawed massively over the years that has dragged us into this wow like state to keep players interested in the game and keep players dumb that isk is the ultimate thing that will keep you alive in eveinsert troll the north are blue for the whole reason of prosperity and enrichment of eve the mass scale production of things that is on a huge level slowly breaking the game we all ready have 400 titans in game or something now and the north in the hw scenario brought a massive 17 tot he field and won the fight because they can click the i win button 17 timesnow imagine faction titans with some silly ship upgrades to the doomsday weapon or even improved dps power the i win button turns into i defiantly winreleasing faction caps will within a year or so show that money makers who have no real clue how to fight except for enmass to hide skill will have another win card over those that dedicate there game to fighting right now stupid overall game mechanics as it isthis idea would imo break eve even further and only a dedicated money maker would care about such stupid contentps nerf drakes
id love to see low sec have commercially interesting elements stuff that makes it worth peoples while to venture there you and i both know this is one of the reasons why 00 attracts people its the concept of if it doesnt pay it aint gonna go your way ccp will among other things have to think of ways to address thisthat being said i do think that taking the angle of supercapitals as a point of interest here is the wrong angle to take i think it is fair to say that there are differences in how people approach 00 and the empires players build but i think it is also fair to say that there is something of a law of diminishing returns that already applies to 00 for reasons directly tied to the topic of supercapitals several parts of that challenge have already been addressed but as we all know 00 is where it is the most clear of all places that there are limits to this race between the mythical bullet and the armour not the least in terms of performance but on a more fundamental level in terms of human behaviour were human beings we always seek shelter and dominance alike in numbersbut that is a topic on its own which is one of the reasons why i think it is not a great idea to use this as an instrument of pushing another niche of the gamealso repeating something which is your conclusion and not mine does not make the insinuation that i am advertising faction warfare any more true truthfully on the contrary i see faction warfare as its own niche within the game and an admittedly failed annex flawed niche but that too is a topic on its owni think that the commercial value is only one piece of the puzzle for low sec it reminds me of something we have in 00 the ability to influence the territory to build a dominion within it to leave a mark on it to have an impact on the elements and people within the niche these are things which low sec simply does not havethat being said ccp always establishes niches in such a way that they are interconnected but always with tangible merit from the niche to the niche this is what makes people live build work and kill in those nichesbtw vuk just said he is buying us a suite in the mo hotel so we can get a room there were getting tj and chee as personal assistants sweet deal no
faction ships have 50 more ehp hullarmourshields and either more weapon mounts or two extra slotsdo you really want dreadnaughts that do 33 more damage or carriers that tank harder than anything in game as tools solely for the stupidly wealthyreason why frigs through bs work in faction flavours is because they are within reach of pretty much everyone skill and isk wise  capitals not so muchps pirate factions should never ever have anything resembling agents in empire would make farming faction gear a trifle and break what is left of rppf in eve 
i agree ccp has a lot to do with already existing features to make the game more attractive to the players currently here but in this thread that is neither here nor there because in the end ccp decides which they do and to a very minor extent you do with your credit card this is an idea that would likely be more of a long term goalyou even admit this is a troll titan is definitely not an i win button and we both know thisi do not think this would be released within a year ccp stated in a dev blog in the last year that making a ship model takes six months we are talking about several dozen ship models this is obviously a long term project only a dedicated money maker would care about breaking into a completely new market where demand was high and supply wasinitially incredibly low i think one would say anyone that can do basic math would rush to at least try this just like wormholes exploration invention moon mining and other features ccp has introduced but i guess that view is why i am space rich and you are probably not i routinely pursue chances i see to make money in new niches in eve those who are content to do nothing but run level 4s in motsu are free to continue doing so this would simply offer another path when the rest of the population tire of thatother post is under this linea dread is pretty easy to kill and there is no carved in stone rule saying these ships needed such a massive boost in ehp i personally would be against 50 more ehp 1020 at absolute most if they needed some sort of ehp bonus the turret bonuses are also not set in stone simply giving them another bonus would likely be enough and possibly 1 more turret slot or increased tracking while sieged think outside the boxmany faction items and ships are outside the buying power of most of eve without a very long time of planning i could buy a dozen of every non special event faction ship in the game and still have enough to buy several titans i am not the only person in eve that has amassed a wealth why should we be excluded just because you cant afford it the pirate factions would be in npc 00 as stated above also pirate factions are allowed to hold sov by concord so they could have lowsec where they hold sov or simply have a station under another empire that shares their interests 
i will have to respond to this fully later a group of fifteen people are throwing out paragraphs of stuff concerning this post where you are either blowing smoke or ed i dont have time to condense it all now
what i am saying isfc pirate erebus with some awesome armour buff per level 35 on top of 75 per level is i dont do maths dwc some normal erebus at 75 per levelsc i dont know a damnation with armour buffs insert omg i win and will never die god modethe reason the buffs would work is because these are 2 unique shipsthis is what i mean by game breaking
or as stated above for faction battlecruisers you can remove those sorts of bonuses in favor of more aggressive bonuses game breaking problem solved
erm a move aggressive titan would be scary stuff to quote nuker payback properly fit titans can instapop battleships a more aggressive titan would be something along the lines of titan warps in locks 6 or something battleships and puts 1 laser on each bssomething which i havent seen done since flying with someone called zeal dragon in curse whom at one point put 1 laser on multiple battleship targets to destroy them back when gank geddons off course existedscary proposition mr ed 
i can assure you i dont treat the assembly hall from any angle of politics blowing smoke or limitations on intellectual capacity considering the new status of csm and its processes as a stakeholder to ccp such approaches seem counterproductive to the principles this obviously aside of being counterproductive to the fundamental requirements for such processes to functionbeside that i dont do blowing smoke a little asking around internally can easily attest to that relaxi am intruiged btw by the angle of approach putting commercial interests in low sec can be one part of the solution with the part of staying away from putting it to use for marketing or mixing it up with structural challenges in other game niches i do think that low sec can be a viable environment for faction elements i like the faction bpc angle within limitations but i wonder how it would play out if pos gear andor ship bpc drops were to be moved to low sec or do you see that as something which would be available both from 00 and lowsec the pos focus i can see since with the pi drama there is much more viability for the milking of planets in low sec then in high sec
no nothing like that the things most these races already get in their faction ships for the navies its usually an extra faction and tank slot for pirates its everything from improved drone useage to nuetweb range bonuses these things wouldnt be game breaking or i win buttons you wouldnt be getting 8x the power you currently have just an extra feature or gimmick
create a new low slot module that gives 20 chance to prevent cargo scanning with a stacking penalty this would prevent freighters from using it but would allow industrials a chance to prevent cargo scanning since its a low slot module those same industrials would need to give up cargo capacity to equip one and since there is a stacking penality it would still allow a chance for cargo scanners to work i think it works well as it doesnt remove the risk but creates a tradeoff like so many things in eve
alternatively dont afk auto pilot
negative this is irrelevantthis is something else entirelyhowever the idea has merit in one major areasmugglinga module that jams or prevents scanning of cargo cans would be greatthat or a new can that prevents scans based on chance where you have to rerolluse the survey scan to make the odds go up or somethingthis should be broken off in a different threadsuicide ganking happens for any number of reasons and while i dont approve of it i cant justifiably deny it either
actually smuggling would go quite well with my earlier suggestion of bribing concord to look the other way based on security of the systems youre in the amount would be based on the criminal act you wanted to do and how much you wanted them looking the other way jihading someone would be pretty expensive and would only slow concords response less than a minute at maximum bribe smuggling could possibly completely pay out concord to leave them alone even though i think its faction police that scan you
bumpstop the invisible aggression timer madness
one could argue that h i t l e r why is it censored please was right does not mean that is the caseif someone shoots my property i assume you want to count the wrecks as my property i should get the right to kill him for longer not another way round you dont get a right to kill someone by shooting his garbage that just doesnt make any sense i see no reason why eve shoudnt make sense i however support this motion regardless of how it is fixed no matter how small a mistake in ui is it shall be fixed
the aggression timer is used for more than determining who has rights to shoot someone without concord intervention or sec hits its also used to determine who has been involved with pvp recently
that doesnt change the fact that extending it without any sign of it is idiotic thats even if there was a nonridicules way of extending it other than the one described in the first few posts supported
god yes most annoying thing ever
wat
supporting my own poast
yes please and since you mentioned it extend the bonus on the sacrilege to hmls
supporting the original idea but not this  whole point of the khanid ships is that they only buff the shortrange missiles also lach needs 2 launcher hardpoints
i am not a missile user but this makes no sence
as this thread goes on you start to make less and less sense which really is quite an accomplishment given the original post level 5s are in low sec for a reason this post i quoted sounds like a conspiracy theory with no proof though you know they are watching you right nowalso 4 is not a proper substitute for the word for just for future reference
its a better ideal then low sec and ccps learn to pvp and blob or htfu ideals as in the end ccp is the only ones that will hftu when one of the other mmo makers gets it righ and dos not copy some cheazie tv or movie show but reather builds a new freash scifi world of there own with good pve in itthe fact that the other mmo compys are trying is prof they know the market is there they just have not fig out that some already made tv or movie back groud story is whats killing them but with the kind of mony there spending on it someone will take the time to get that part fig outso if ccp dos not want its pve players cash some one elsa dos
woweve is not wowmost people play for the sandbox feel mainly pvp combat mining industry and market manipulation is all eveidence of this pve content is there for people who enjoy it and as an isk faucet so there is always a source for more money to come into the gamedrop the whine and the anger and accept that most of the wya things are happens after hours of debate im not saying ccp is perfect but there has been not major change to the basic concept of the missions for a long time its all small manipulation from here they like it the way it is and no amount of forum rage will change ther mind come up with a solid plan privide proof and a positive action plan and then you might get a better response from the communityacps not supported again
explain two things1 why missions that were implicitly designed to only occur in lowsec should be allowed in highsecand2 how considering the mechanics seperating highsec and lowsec concordfaction that ships and items that are unable to travel to highsec would suddenly be allowed in highsecps stfu and stop complaining about l5s theyre staying in lowsec where they bloody ing belong mad
i stoped at wow i am a scifi guy not a fantasy guy
1 becouse they have already been in high sec for the last 3 years no reason to move them now2 i dont understand this  any body using a carry to do level 5s were already doing low sec level 5sbut 2 dos give a cool ideal that low sec fraction stores could have fraction capitals for low sec mission runners and that low sec missions could be more in line with sleepers or fw missions more inline with pvp shipsthat i belive would be a much stronger boost to low sec then puting this level 5s in there only after 3 years with nothing in the lp stores that you cant get in high secedit see this is what i dont get man why dos low sec cry nerf high sec instead of demanding buffs to low sec
because until high sec is not as profitable as it is a lot of the little care bears like yourself wont leave i love the logic of this thread btw people dont know how to fit their ships and lose them to missions so obviously level 5s should be in high sec
yeah it is bemusing to use one word i also love the argumentswell you were doing it wrong for 3 years so there is no reason to fix it and do it right there are reasons to change it after 3 years ccp stated them when they did it and the more you go wah wah wah we want our super isk faucet back wah wah wah the less likely you are to get any support from anyonei really am so glad i live in null and treat empire as the place where domination mods and skill books come from
the reason pve losss are gretaer in high sec than lowsec is the simple reason that all mission runners live in high sec no missioner in there right mind goes to lowsec since lv5s are in high sec therefor they need to be moved to lowsec to give use more pve kills d
tldr  add to sensor dampeners max  target lock reduction attribute could not reduce available target locks below 1 lots of charts and math and explanations as to why this might be a good ideapurpose change to sensor dampening mechanic in order to bring it in line with other ew warfare modules while maintaining current themes and game balance while requiring the least amount of new coding needing to be implementedproposal add to the current existing sensor dampener modules the attribute target lock reduction that reduces the maximum number of target locks a particular ship may have active the percentage should simply mirror already existing percentages on said modules create a third loadable script for the sensor dampening module that will only affect the target lock reduction percentage at the expense of the other two attributesthe equation for the target lock reduction should be exactly how it sounds if a ship is capable of 6 maximum target locks and receives a 50 reduction to maximum locked targets it will now only be able to maintain 3 locked targets and will drop any target locks past the 3rd starting with the most recent locks being dropped first in the event of a decimal remainder after the reduction equation takes place the maximum number of locked targets should be rounded to the next highest number so as to ensure that the ship is always capable of at least one target lock and helps give a buffer in favor of the victim ship to prevent mechanic from being overpowered all stacking penalties for multiple ew modules on a single target or module modifiers in this case rigs should applyimpact on play the proposed change would give viability for the implementation of sensor dampening in large scale fleet battles a commander could order target dampening on say a high lock count destroyer to reduce their ability to chew through swaths of drones or to reduce the effectiveness of large scale spider tanking setups those under the effects of max target reduction would have to pickand choose more carefully which ships they choose to lock onto creating an even deeper level of play for logistics pilots and giving a viable counter outside of standard jammingcounter modules to this form of ew are allready in existance with the auto targeting module high slot that boosts the maximum number of possible targets this would not be a game breaking mechanic the pilot would still be capable of unlocking switing targets and resuming firelogistics it would simply make things more difficult and quite possibly synergize well with the sensor dampeners natural locking speed reduction slowing down the pace of battle testing would be necessary to see if implimentaion would cause any unforseen problemsin summary this sort of change would increase the effectiveness of the sensor dampener while keeping it in line with the current themes of operations sensor dampeners are not meant to completely shut down a ships targeting system and their overall aim is to help controll the pace of battle by allowing them to reduce the number of targeted ships you would slow down large fleet scale engagements and give a ballanced tactical advantage to the useri have included reference charts in order to ease the understanding in the level of effectiveness this sort change would make all equations are basically existing rate  reduction  and accounted for stacking penalty utilized the simplified percentages found on the eve online wikipedia 100 87 57 28 10 3 final module percentages were created utilizing eft all final numbers were rounded to the next highest number if there was any remaindersee below

best bet  it does work that way but your buddies are running all the sanctums and the respawns are random instead of being linked to the type of anom that just got completed
nope these are consistent over all time a system with a level 5 upgrade always has precisly 2 sanctums and 2 havens at all times trust me in all the weeks in 00 in multiple systems its a proven fact for all the systems ive seenbut the other issue is yards and dens do not normally spawn in 00 anyway
despite their claims that the pi development team will still be working on it i really doubt any changes will come about for the better part of a year or more if evertheyll get pulled for yet more content development and leave just one more broken feature in the game never to be looked at againthe list is stunningly long at this point
god yes at least some of these suggestions should be done asap
im wondering is there any interest in the community to have ccp look into ways to change the duration of session change timers im well aware of the purpose they serve and that such a change would create new problems or exacerbate old existing ones but i feel the timers are too long in some cases and the new problems created would be manageable or solvableas i understand it ccp just uses a universal session change timer for all kinds of different activities some seem more justified than other for example i can accept the timer while jumping or having just undocked but the 30 second wait in a station while changing ships is just annoying would it cause an apocalypse if it was much lower with the ship change in a station if the issue is people docking and quickly changing ships and undocking couldnt there be a separate timer that starts when you dock that prevents players from exploiting thisi guess i just want ccp to have a goal where they look into reducing these timers to the minimum when and where ever it is possible the bottom line is that they are annoying and at times disruptive to the pace of gameplay so ccp should on principle reduce and replace them with alternative mechanics if and when such methods become available do the timers bother others too or am i just the only one
the ship change session timer is just horrible i really see no justification for it
supportedits also stupid that we cant see whats fitted to a ship without having to activate it first
cant you implement a feature where you can change your name just as you have with portraitspay a sum to be able to change your namei know there reasons why you shouldnt be able to but like employement history cant you just put a formerly known as your previous name
no the name is your identity in the game
not enthusiastic about such change i want to be able to see your original and only name easily and not have to track it down from an info window with several other aliases everything is tied to it in this game so any ways to alter or mask it should not be allowed most of the people who care so much about names already made a decent one at the start anyway
in a game like eve changing identity should be a viable choice you can already change your face why shouldnt one be able to change the namethink about all those shady dealers going underground changing identities sure you wouldnt recognise them first but just as you check employement history you can check former aliases there are people here on the forums that love tracking down character trades old posts etc etc private investigatorsits not just a way to change a stupid name in my case i mean it was 6 years ago i made my character my idea of funny isnt really funny anymoreand of course like attribute remapping there could be a cooldown and for example a 25 pricetag on it so everyone doesnt go changing name
we need to fix low sec missions to be more in line with low sec they should not have high sec missions and high sec lp stores forced on them in this blantent maner1 low sec is hard and should get its own rewards to reflect that fact all carebear level 15 missions in game right now should be shoved right back into high sec with there bloted worthless lp stores 2 there should be two differnt lp tabs one for high sec lps for high sec lp stores and one for low sec and low sec lp stores as we have to spilt low sec and high sec fraction lps up but still beable to work for the same fractions that are already in place3 place new level 15 pvp based missions into low sec something in line with the sleeper and fw were missions are made so that pvp fitted ships are needed to run the missions4 new low sec lp shops to spend this hard won low sec lps at and this stuff has to be not just good but great i belive that tier 3 fraction battle ships and fraction caps like carriers and dreadnoughts should fit in here with fraction mods to fit them up with even fraction ammos and fighter drones as wellthen ccp should see that it is good and do the same in 00 
i actually like this lowsec needs something that is completely undoable in highsec not just doable at lower profit as it is lowsec is a complete hole until the masses start moving into lowsec we wont see masses moving to 00 they need to encounter pvp and see that it is not as scary as many view 
supporting my own ideal as it could get me and other carebears into low sec for this but for the level 5s and the low sec lps right now not a snowballs  in hellbesides this is a much better fix to risk v rewards you dont have to nerf high sec to the ground you can buff low sec instead
so more or less fw missions without the need to joying fw it should be a bit worse than fw supported as any things that can make mission better is welcome
low sec missions already receive roughly double rewards the trouble is its tied to the agents location rather than the mission additionally it only applies to rewards not lootsalvagebounties which are the main source of income with the exception of lvl5s if bounties are tied to system sec the problem goes away mostly i also think the rewardsbounties should have only three tiers high sec low sec null sec there is no difference in risk between 01 sec and 04 sec the rewards should reflect thatin regards to special missions and lp stores im not necessarily opposed but fw missions are not the thing to look at fw missions were designed to generate pvp as such they are typically 1020 jumps from the agent in the opposing factions low sec space they also throw a beacon on the overview for all to see to balance that out most of them can be run solo or pairs in under 2 minutes as they require you to kill but a single bs or a handful of haulers the result is nearly everyone runs them with a stealth bomber and a t1 throw away frigate the frigate pulls aggro while the bomber kills the objective if a hostile shows up the bomber cloaks and the frigate is 100200km off the warp in its a brain dead exercise that poses virtually no risk to anyone but the throw away frigate and who cares about that thing thats not the model to look toi think the current setup is fine but the difference in payouts should be enhanced via bounties being tied to system sec i would also support the actual mission rewards being increased from 2x to 3x that of mid high sec 08in short i dont support your proposal because its poorly thought out and you know nothing of low sec pve or pvp you also clearly know nothing about fw missions else you wouldnt have suggested them as a model
actually doing something as simple as giving lowsec based corporations lp stores things like faction capitals faction pos mods both offensive like we have now and defensive such as hardeners or even faction factories labs and extractors incentives you can only get by running missions in low sec these are simply examples any sort of faction gear that is both useful and not to be found elsewhere in eve will do or at least not in high sec you would see the amounts of people daring lowsec skyrocket for the chance of these riches i would also like to see missions somehow extend through wormholes but that is a completely different topicedit in fact im making a thread about itbuffing lowsec itself wont really do much beyond make the people already there more sustainable the goal here is to attract new denizens from higher security space not to enhance the lifestyle of current lowsec dwellers
buff low sec not lowsec missionsedit linkified for your greater viewing pleasure
defensive for you and for the other people shooting eac hother at the gate who are not involved with you in any wayoffensive because it stops rring energy xfer remote sensor boosters remote eccm etc etc ad infinitum all of which degrads combat perfomance for random people trying to fight each other and you interfering because u didnt want ur freighter poppeddoneexcept that everyone has alts and power of two encourages faceless masses of consequence avoiding drones to do things in highsecits not against the eula to use an alt to avoid your negative security status as a pirate to get your good shipped to your main from empire spacehow can recycling alts be against the eula if the above is true in both instances youre avoiding the consequences of actions ccp cant make one against the eula and not the other without becoming hypocritical
well the alt problem can be avoided by simply having the pilot who initiates the ecm burst get an aggression flag to everyone he hits but no gcc simplebut i do agree an ecm burst is a purely defensive measure and shouldnt be considered a criminal action
why not let it use 5 fighters but with a lesser bounus than the domi that way it does less dps but give it a logistics bonus so it is like a heavier logistics ship that fits between carrier and logi
let it be able to fit dcus then it would be able to reach max of 1000 dps which is fair compared to other sub cap ships the carrier with 5x dcu can reach 15001875gallente dps  which i may add it does nicely in sanctumhavens
now switching to the anti sideso suggestion of less dps than a domi but with logistics ability to be honest in high and lowsec a domi with rrs in the highs does a good enough job vs anything your going to have a chance of surviving so the light carrier that was weaker in damage than a domi but with some leet rr would be overkill in almost everything and in a jumped by 20 your still dead and loosing a cap ship more over im sure ive seen a ship that gives caps a run for their money with rr and are dps low from only having a few dronesthere they are logistics ships
have you folks ever looked at the cost of a fighter drone a wing of 10 fighters has a higher mineral cost than a whole tier3 battleship youd essentially have a whole freaking abaddon in your drone bay thats insane on a subcapital just buy a domi
no bad idea from a bad player

i for one am looking forward to walk in station its a feature you can enjoy if you so wish but your not forced to use it in any wayi for one would enjoy it it adds another level of depth to the game
youd rather have some more pretty flashy instead of fixing game mechanic issues go back to wow
not supported station walking is useless there are many mechanics that need tweaking and doing something like station walking is a lot of work think of all the character animationsunless they actually decide to add real mechanics that involve stationwalking then its a waste of resources even then id rather see other stuff fixed

loading video as bitmap frames into a game engine for renderingwhy not just use a real browseredit wow html5 video has market penetration in the single digits doesnt even function in any browser without plugins addedflash is on 98 of computersoh and ogg sucks h264 is the current accepted standard
from how i understand it the browser is a separate process on you computer and is done locally ergo it works the same as a normal browsersome people still play in full screen mode i dont personally but seeing when i click any link opens in the igb it would be nice it it workedif you dont realise html 5 and the video tag is being developed by google and the igb is based on chrome youtube is currently beta testing html 5 video and it works perfectly in chrome without plugins again which the igb is based onthis is one of the many reasons it as you eloquently put it sucks shy why not fix it instead of having another broken feature
if only it was that simple in practice you have multiple standards competing on the technical as well as the political level corporate interest a good read from the x264 developer from before google opened vp8 which sucks btwoh and not supported btw introducing a browser into the game already brings enough security risks

yes video in the igb will definitely be a nice additionthey do its called chromium confirming that firefox chrome safari opera and the next internet explorer are single digit marketshare this is wrong and it is  and it doesnt even function in any browser without plugins unlike html5usually html5 video uses h264 and aac for playback there are even alternatives with matroskavp8vorbisthere is no html5 video implementation i know of that uses ogg how misinformed are youby the way flash on youtube etc usually uses an old video codec that is not hardware accelerated on most systems named vp6you are right that h264 is widely accepted now  because of html5 videodvdiphone playback using it flash is late to the party though and they still waste cpu cycles like there is no tomorrow for video playbackthis was one of the most uninformed posts ive ever seen and i consume quite a bit of them on slashdotedit and supporting it now duh
html5 isnt even a fully ratified standard yet a lot of people are talking about html5 but there are major disagreements between major companies that could lead us to another browser war honestly there is a browser war going on right now but generally speaking the public hasnt hurt too badthere is a disagreement about the video tag and to which codec to usethe flash ability in html5 is called the canvas tag which is a proprietary technology patented by apple not all browsers that support html5 support the canvas tag so no not supported ccp has more important things to worry about than developing an entire browser on nonratified amorphous standards

i invite you to read the raw logs of the 3rd meeting of the csm at
 ankhesentapemkah  dierdra has done the same thing with his unfinished expansion and his issue was passed even though i argued against that and now i do this thing and everyone is against me it seems i find this odd and would say this is antiankh crap againthis was a petulant and childish thing to say and she does it every time the vote goes against her sokratesz could certainly have been more diplomatic but that certainly didnt justify the behindthescenes threats that were apparently made and frankly he had a point ankh shouldnt be surprised that people dont like her if shes going to a have the well documented attitude that she does towards the pvping population and b take it personally whenever someone disagrees with her
why wouldja look at that you just happened to fail to mention anks hissyfit where she whines about how people had the nerve to disagree with her and goes on for quite some time arguing about how people not voting for her proposal must be because antiank sentiment to say nothing of the fact that many of her suggestions are ed and advanced due to her complete lack of knowledge about pvp we need to give people incentives for pvp in fw really and here i thought that the fact that there are ships piloted by other players there that give killmails when popped and drop loot was a pretty good incentive and one thats good enough for the entire rest of eve in any case three meetings three hissyfits each time because of the same reason ank cant behave like a grownup and isnt able to deal with disagreements without adopting a martyr complex you must have accidentally failed to mention that ya know by accident and stuff i think that many folks can at least empathize with sok and really while ank was having yet another temper tantrum over not getting her way sok added one joke about how it was to be expected as shes now three out of three for going a bit bonkers over minor disappointments the fact that he was told off for by dierdra is rather absurd and it only happened because sok asked folks not to make threats to him in private conversations if they were going to and mynxee is a fine enough csm delegate her agreement with diedras statements is troubling its all well and good to say that people cant try to give ank a hard time but if ank is unrestrained and allowed to go bonkers once or twice every meeting then shes the one who should be dealt with anks manifest unsuitability for the csm is the problem not someone cracking jokes while ank goes buggy yet again and quit your bull we heard enough of it during the campaign quoting ank is not trolling just give it a rest already and find a new way to slander her honest critics eh
so sokratesz has less of a hissfit i have been threatened the horror
did i mention how much i love space politicsi think i need to reiterate that i really really love space politics
stop being dense tu quoque is a fallacy not a great way to argue and even that being the case sok at least had a valid point he was evidently given some sort of ultimatum off the record and it was confirmed on the record ank on the other hand pitched a hissyfit each and every single meeting so far simply because she didnt get her waydo you detect a difference

i disagree with opback in my fw days when it first came out i remember hanging around in a fleet of roughly 30 people sitting around in a system when someone would say on eve voice guys i just heard that the squids have contested insert system here and the hype confusion and adrenaline fueled race to that system that followedplexes may not be everys pvp cup of tea but plexes cause pvp whether you like it or not
bfish those days are gone people have since realized that hide and go seek pve plexing is the optimal way to plex with the current mechanics they orbit the button and finish the plex before anyone sees them if they get seen then its often a mismatch leading to them either warping off or the other side not going in there are exceptions but that is the general protocol  if you want to plex in an optimal way people who used to do what you described have long since figured this out about the current occupancy mechanic now the vast majority of fw pilots rightly think the plexing mechanic is too stupid to bother with its time to adjust the mechanic so people will start doing what you describe again

you could also utilize a midlowhigh slot module drone maintinance bay whereby it locks the mothership from launching any new drones for 1020 minutes but at the end of the cycle all drones within the bay are repaired it would consume either nanite repair paste or power cores or stront or whatever1 would prevent the need for having an extra cargo bay needing to be added to the ship prevent extending drone bay sizes2 would solve the issue of invincible drones if your repairing your not utilizing any new drones on the field no pop in repair redeploy  forcing out of battledesperate combat situational usage3 would add a need for the carrier pilots to give up a slot or another ability to be able to utilize this ability

all amarr ships are symmetrical apart from the aeon
this and its not a half finished bestower its a half steamrollered providence
wrongthe omenzealot are not symmetrical who says they all have to be symmetrical just because many of them are you all are a bunch of ocd kids
aeon looks fine imo however like the other assault carriers they are visually too small
thisthe ships are physically too small to carry that which they are designed to carry how can you fit a battleship inside an aeon or any carriersupercarrier for that matter when the internal space of the model isnt large enough

as much as i like the idea that might make the lach dangerously overpowered especially if the hybrid bonus were dropped to go along with it wed then be talking about a ship with the firepower of a rook a 44k ehp shield tank and the ability to point to 60 kilometers that said there could be some virtue in turning the lach into a pure missile boat if on the other hand you also turned the huginn into a pure arty boat something to think about anywayfist every race has multiple ships that require missile skills including both minmatar and amarr second 400 dps out of a recon is excellent damage third short of mounting them on a ship with numerous specialized turret bonuses as for instance to the zealot eagle and muninn medium turrets simply do not have the flexibility or firepower to operate effectively at the ranges the lach should be operating at 40 km minimum missiles do and do so very well as such they make an ideal weapons system for this ship fourth extending the missile bonus to cover hams would not force you to train any additional skill to use the lachesis effectively what it would do is make short and very shortrange lach fits more viable fifth this is a matter of consistency it simply makes no sense that the lachesis should be the only missile ship in the game to get a bonus to hmls and amls but not hams in conclusion its clear that you are either a troll or not very smart and should leave this discussion to people who actually know what theyre talking about

how would the game decide which targets to drop because i know everyone has found themselves in a situation where they are shooting at a target that they locked after changing primaries if you just dropped thier last few locked targets then they would have to change when there may be any number of targets you arent doing anything with they just happened to be locked
good pointwell sensor damps are now ecm so i would imagine with that mentality the best course of action would be something like1 drop all locks outside of new dampening range if applicable2 does  locks exceed new maximum if yes then 3 if no stop3 drop oldest locksbut that may unfairly hurt logistics ships that do power locking on each other first out of the gate the most fair thing to do would be to make it random your probably looking at only really dropping one perhaps two lock on if they are also putting the range dampener bit on itif you go with the newest locks you hurt combat ships pretty hard if you go with the oldest you hurt logistics ships pretty hard so go with random and youll keep it more stableedit on second thought randomness would mimic ecm more id say start with the newest locks and work your way down through the oldest locks that way when you spin uyp your locking grid you can pick and choose which ones would be the best to hold onto when this sort of tactic is in play but the player would have to watch the ranges carefully to prevent the ship getting out of range before the sensor dampener hitswould encourage more balling style tactics with logistics but would allow them to maintain their spider tank to each other fairly reasonably though with the fewer locks they wouldnt be able to support the fleet as well allowing more kills on the other offensive ships sounds like a good balanceadded to description text in main body drop newest locks first
this has come up countless times its still a bad suggestion  feel free to evesearch the other threads on this for a huge list of reasons why this is either totally useless or extremely expoitable depending on implementation1liang
i have done a search and most suggestions failed to say anything more than oh target lock reduction  win this is one of those suggestions that tries to find that ballance between totally useless and extremely exploitable that you lumped everything intoif you feel its a really bad idea what would be your solution to bringing sensor dampeners up to usable levels
the damp nerf did more than just separate the scan reslock range aspect of damps  it also adjusted the way direction that they stacked if you will this made for an extremely strong nerf of damp ships  which could now no longer damp someone down to web range and similarly had no lock time buffer with which to save them it really made for tons of lolmails where nano ships just mwded up to the damping ship and obliterated it in a couple of secondsso then we need to examine the reason that damps were nerfed the turning point in the damp nerf seemed to be a team of 10 caracals damping the other team out and killing the other team without taking any damage at all hi pl so id argue that it wasnt that damps were too powerful on bonused ships  but on unbonused ships so what we need to do is unnerf damps for bonused ships and keep the nerf for unbonused ships fortunately these bonused ships have a bonus that can be increased to unnerf the moduleof course were still looking at damps having been rather strongly nerfed because the module was cut in half so to speak for that id argue that the damp bonus should put unscripted damps at 6065 of where they were prior to the old nerf this would mean that in the end we traded cutting our module in half for the ability to be slightly more powerful at one or the other functionliang
i see you point from the shift from old to new and a shift for dedicated ewar ships back to the old would be a viable solutioni doubt that will happenfrom my play experience the problem with sensor damps is either up close and personal range mwd counters or preexisting locks if anyone sees a keres on the field they lock up everything they can so to have a que of viable targets to shoot at while the new looong lock time takes effect and in small squad  large fleet engagements its kinda useless as either youve allready locked every logistics ship and the primary secondary and possibly tertiary target and are sitting right on top of the ship set allready the only way to make these modules work in those two very common situations is to get a lock break on someone which requires ecm modules by cutting down the number of available targets it makes it far more likely a target switch would need to take place allowing sensor damps to be a viable ewar tactic as now there is a limited ability to force enemies to switch targets allowing the range or target locking reduction to actually have a viable battlefield context
i dont know if ive ever seen a damp ship using lock time scripts that wasnt playing supportsupport for an ecm ship there just isnt any point in it also wtf is up with not having everything on the battlefield locked anywayit used to be that the locks would break because they got damped to within 10km and if they were already there then tough luck youre using the wrong ship even back then ecm was actually a better option  which really rubbed salt in the nerfwound because they boosted ecm ships in the same patch they nerfed damp ships i dont see this being especially useful stop flying in blobsliang
whats wrong with having everything on the battlefield lockedthats exactly the thing that makes current sensor dampener usage very very hard to use effectivelysensor resolution dampening  if ships allready locked sensor damp is uselessrange dampening reduciton  ship simply moves locks to much closer ships useless in close range engagementsapply target lock reduction and it changeswith a lock reduction if they loose locks outside of target range range dampening it makes it more difficult to simply reapply to the next nearest target slowing down their reaction timeswith scan resolution  lock reduction  targets loose 13 target locks and if they need to switch to a new primary the increase in new lock times actually has a chance to make a difference in just how flexible that ship is in reaquiring a propper lock gridsensor damps arnt supposed to replace ecm modules with this sort of change but rather make it more viable that the module will actually have an effect on player behavior which is the goal of ewar currently with the way sensor damps are now the player behavior  combat effectivenesschanges the least in the most common battlefield situations
i disagree with liang i support this proposalhowever i would modify it so that existing locks do not break if target ships maximum lockable targets drops below the number of locks it currently possesses so it impedes the ship from acquiring new locks or workable in conjunction with ecm or existing locks break in the order of distance in other words farthest locks break first this should eliminate possible exploits
the only reason that range dampening is useless in close range engagements is because of the severity of the strength nerf if damps were as powerful on bonused ships as they used to be they this would not be a problemi dont see this being an improvement over the way that damps are theoretically supposed to worklianged and tritanius support support isnt a viable role if the damp ship is relying on ecm to break the locks then it is 100 useless just bring another rookfalcon or focus on your tank and warp scramblers
break locks in the order of distance then
what a novel idea what if it broke all locks outside of a specific distanceliang
damps are not locker breakersreducers they are rangeresolution reducers ecm breaks locks not damps liang is right that the nerf needs to be unnerfed but it needs to be scoped only at specialised shipsdont you think its a bit weird how t2 ecm ships get double the bonus of the t1 hulls theyre based on but t2 damp ships get exactly the same as their t1 hullsedit t2 ecm frigates get 150 more than their t1 t2 damp frigs get same as their t1just double the bonus on specialised damp ships for a start and then sort out the scan res damp figures to actually be useful
how is that even an argument you fully realize that it doesnt accomplish the same thing as range damps
yes and my contention is that i like the idea of how damps work now yes they need to be boosted a bit  but that doesnt mean that the mechanic itself was a bad one lianged for the sake of the op i also want to point out that sig amps give more targets as well
would be waaaay to op imagine what it would do to logistics chains would then have to be changed to chance based and also be countered by eccm or similar modulethumbs down o
signal amplifiers give you targeting range scan resolution and more target locks automated targeting systems give you more targets they are in game already is that the counter you thought wasnt in game the fact that a module that was designed as a counter to rsds also has the ability to increase max number of targets locked maybe even suggests that perhaps ccp had this in mind from the start but dropped it for some reason i can see what the op was trying to suggest and maybe it makes sense but i think its not the fix that is required
my biggest beef with the ops suggestion is that its attempting to redefine the role that rsds were supposed to play theyre supposed to shape the battlefield  not control the pace of the battle a change of this magnitude would also preclude fixing the already broken mechanic as its now fixedliang
sun tzu the art of war  i prefer the eddition by james clavellshaping the battlefield is controlling the pace of battle as it stands sensor damps only poorly shape the battlefield in the way it naturally occours rather than redefining the situation to the betterment of the userbut a lot of good ideas all around the chew through currently its come up about which targets should be dropped in the event of new max locks  current locks for the most part under normal usage a ship is only going to loose 12 locks for the first module and 01 locks for the second module thrown at it with natural range dampening this just means that the ship will be unable to reaquire new locks without breaking old locks the problem of how to deal with closer range engagements needs to be addressed here are some thoughts on ita drop locks baised on random chance this would cause a mimicry of raw ecm which is not what sensor damps should do and could cause a great deal of unfair abuseb bais dropped locks on specific criteria  would create consistant behavior which is in line with the theme of sensor damps1 drop them baised on most recent locks first  would favor well planned locking grids target high priorities first ie core logistics spider tanks stay up but penalizes any recent target switching offensively or defencively2 drop oldest target locks first  would potentiaally instantly break existing spider tanking setups favors offensive target switching makes battlefield more chaotic as everyone scrambles to reaquire high priority targets op feels this is unbalanced3 base target drops on range furthest first  would double synergize with existing range dampening attribute and could be viewed as a double buff to to range dampening target range reduction is allready adressed and if that is the goal one should can allready load up range dampening scripts to the module viable but potentially abusive and overpowered as then you only need target lock reduction to kill any locks past a certain point on sniper ships despite the users actions to plan a propper primary4 drop the closest targets  i cant seem to justify this one5 maintain all current locks and no new locks can be made untill target locks drop below new existing number  would defeat the purpose of the synergizing effect of the mildmoderate target lock reduction rate op feels that this would make the change self defeating now i realize that bringing back the old t2 ship bonuses would be a viable solution but would make sensor dampening probably overpowered because it isnt chance baised and its a guarenteed shut down so far all other appeals to correct this sort of thing hasnt worked so i figured we could try thinking outside the box give sensor dampeners a mild boost that would help synergize and make it more effective without becomming overpowered
i think you have rather grossly misunderstood the concept of shaping the battlefield vs controlling the pace of the battle shaping the battlefield means that you deny targets to your enemy wholesale  and potentially attack with impunity yourself i recommend rereading section 6 on energy but really the whole thing seems to have been misunderstoodyou arent asking for a boost  youre asking to totally redefine the role that rsds play in a somewhat poor way no lessliang
langenergy is section vand it looks like your trolling near the personal level so this is you  x this is you in a box xand im going to ignore you nownow that thats out of the way anyone else have any constructive critisism going on semantics aside
vi weak points and strong 2 therefore the clever combatant imposes his will on the enemy but does not allow the enemys will to be imposed on him 7 you can be sure of succeeding in your attacks if you only attack places which are undefendedyou can ensure the safety of your defense if you only hold positions that cannot be attacked12 if we do not wish to fight we can prevent the enemy from engaging us even though the lines of our encampment be merely traced out on the ground all we need do is to throw something odd and unaccountable in his waythis speaks of controlling the pace of battle to you or does it speak of shaping the battlefield dont use an appeal to authority if you dont know the source material your failed appeal to authority is what is trolling in this thread ive already provided constructive criticism  that you have the wrong idea for what damps are supposed to do but i would like to point out that part of asking for constructive criticism is receiving itlianged and you were right  section 6 i imagine scrolled up to see which section i had been in and went too far up
if the proposed change violates some arbitrary rules that you constructed in your head then fine nothing i can say to change that
the proposal changes the role and usage of my favorite form of ewar this is somehow a hard concept to understand how do you think one would go about shaping the battlefield when all that really happens is they arent able to lock as many targets pvp in eve as a rule requires exactly one target to be locked anyway  even if you normally have multiple locked for convenienceliang
damps should shape the battlefield whatever that means is just a rule you constructed in your head it has no real basis in the game plus op is suggesting a script that changes the functionality of damps anyway so it wont affect you at all if you dont use that script just like it technically only requires 200 dps to kill an avatar right
and from this we garnish the great misunderstanding as liang has failed to understand the purpose of the change  of locked ship reduction is an additional attribute added to existing sensor dampener effects which is why the boost is so relatively mild with scripts you could make a sensor dampener specialize in reducing  of locks at the expense of the other attributes but its not the only thing the module could potentially do got a sniper fleet out use your range dampeners to take it out of the fight got a logistics ship cut down its number of available locks and reduce its lock time using 2 of the 3 available sensor damps on your arazu im not saying make it the only attribute that it accomplishesand this gives credence to my statement i believe lang is trying to troll at this point lack of understanding the above content and insistance that she is absolutely right without propper counter argument even after her one valiid counter solution was given accepted and considered and watch this she is gonna have to have the last word on itread the proposal im not changing or hurting the current sensor dampening mechanic other than giving it a mild additional effect to increase its viability and depth of stategic usage
you can use google or evesearch to see that this is a long standing understanding of how damps work and what they do its hardly some arbitrary rule i made up and tbh if you dont know what shaping the battlefield is i suggest you stop posting in threads relating to damps but for your edumacation i can go over a couple of the tactical aspects of shaping the battlefield indeed much of it actually is strategic destroy enemy key capabilities  freedom of action early preserve friendly freedom of actioncreate windows of capabilities overmatchsource us armyyes and my complaint with it is that it moves damps an entirely different direction different role  and an inferior one no less and will discourage a fix to the proper usage of damps no most people really do use one target at a time are you being deliberately densestupidobtuselianged formatting
lets be extremely clear i understand that this is an additive change unfortunately it pushes the role of damps away from shaping the battlefield this is not the same thing as controlling the pace of the battle it drastically decreases the likelihood of an appropriate boost to the ability to shape the battlefield it is a largely meaningless boost since most combat in eve sans logistics and ewar occasionally requires only 12 locked targets anywayfailed appeal to authority now some ad hominem to go with it spectacular lianged james i responded to you specifically on the previous page just to make sure you dont miss it
first of all the role of dampeners presently and in the past does not dictate what it ought to be in the future second of all just because i do not know a single military vocabulary does not render my opinion null and voidadding optional functionality can never make a module less inferior proper usage of damps is another personal tasteit doesnt matter if most people really do use one target at a time there is benefit for multiple locked targets even if you are just a dps grunt for example who do you think is going to win in this situation fleet a vs fleet b all identical ships ships of fleet a can lock a maximum of 6 targets at once and ships of fleet b can only lock one target at once you knew what i was talking about so were you being deliberately densestupidobtuse
you know whatlets face it troll has won thread has been hijacked and derailed but i hope we can get constructive people back in here after a day or twobut since were digressing so far ill bitecontrolling the pace of the battle and shapping the battlefield are nearly the exact same things why do we shape the battle field to channel and funnel agressive execution to desired locations which then removes aggressive execution from other areas pace of battle goes up in one spot while dropping down in the othertzu understood this which is why he pushed his emphasis on all things outside of military tactics the victory goes to those who take and maintain the inititive and the destruction of capability or functionality slows the enemys ability to utilize those things against you inititive is not necissarily those who go first but those that push the events that cause reactionary events in their opponent the more reactive an opponite has to be the slower their combative pace and the harder it is for them to regain the inititive thats the whole purpose of shaping a battle field to push a reactive event onto your opponit slowing them downyou quoted tzu and and army field manual outside of comprehensive context if your curious look into the german blitzkriege and the defense of stalingraid and how their emphasis on pacing inoder to shape the battlefield revolutionized 4th generation warfareand here is a hint when you reread tzu like the heinlines book starship troopers it is not meant to be taken at face value but rather read and contemplated as a whole pondering its implications and underlying tones
of course nothing is truly static and roles may be changed if ccp so desires however that doesnt mean that i cant squawk loudly when a player suggests a change of role that im not i favor ofi wouldnt normally think so but you also were are showing a deplorable lack of insight into the problem combined with an amazing unwillingness to examine the situation via google or even evesearchi would argue that theres quite a lot of attention focused on damps  eventually they will be boosted adding this optional functionality would almost certainly preclude fixing the already broken functionality and i would argue that one can in fact speak on proper usage of damps based on currently existing game mechanics its true  but its an extremely small benefit in reality the outcome will depend entirely on fcing but even theoretically and with any ship you care to name the outcome will be extremely close  and with some ships itll make absolutely no difference whatsoever such as the artillery tempestlianged formatting
your behavior goes far beyond simply voicing a dissenting opinion this is straight up troll territory unfortunately in your attempts to come accross as supperior and unflappable you have merely demonstrated a lack of respect to fellow playersim putting you back in the box james i suggest you do the same well try again in a few daysx

ive said it before in similar postst1 destroyers are very very good t1 ships but they are just that t1 ships interdictors have a nich role and are very good at that as wellthe problem is that there is no dedicated assult t2 destroyer hulls destroyers themselves dont need a boost but a t2 hull with an increase in survivability reduced active tank fittingusage or resistance bonuses would put these ships on par and make them viable for serious battlefield deployment
lots of good suggestions here  and honestly quite necessary ones unless we are all to loose our arms and hands to clicking extractors continuouslysupported especially suggestion a through e please dont let us wait a year to see this basic functionality implementedsuggestion f and g are also good ones but lower on my list of priorities add e i like the idea that you dont have to demolish everything to upgrade your command center but obviously you have to be in system and have the relevant cc in your cargo hold to do so add f i much prefer that the only way to connect the link networks of two or more players would be through a UFFFDcorporate logistics handling centerUFFFD UFFFDcorporate nexusUFFFD or whatever you might want to call it only one such center pr corporation may be build on a planet a player may only link to it through his own cc these limitations would make it a challenge for corp members to optimize their networks towards one another it would also add something to the command centers that makes it worthwile to actually connect them to your link network right now they are not used for anything once you have a landing pad apart from providing power and cpu obviouslyyou could introduce a skill that enables you to build the UFFFDcorporate nexusUFFFD where each skilllevel allows you to connect to the cc of one additional corpmate
yes on ae another way to solve the command center upgrade could be that whenever you build a new cc the box do you really want to do this your current cc will be destroyed pops up with the options upgrade  cancel or whatever
i was coming to this forum for the first time to also ask for an ability to stop extractors in their run i support a through e

id at least like an explanation as to if a session change timer cant be reduced why it can not be reducedsupported
oh god yeslog in wait 30 exit ship wait 30 jump clone wait 30 board ship wait 30 join fleet wait 30 move to correct spot in fleet wait 30 finally undocka reduction of the timer to 1520 seconds would be highly welcomeand while were at it can the session timer be completely removed for when your ship gets destroyed and you board your pod many pods where lost because of the current mechanic
supported hate those timers

that sounds very cool to me i mite give low sec a try then myself
to say i know nothing about fw missions is true to say i know nothing about low sec missions is bs there the same mission all of low sec and high sec runand to not support becouse you dont like fw missions is a good reson if thats how they are run but you should go back and reread the op i did not say just like fw i said more in line with pvp thats the main part you seam to miss out of that and hell no beckons on the missions its already to easy and fast to find a missioner
i may have been out of fw for a while now but if its still pretty much the same as how i left it then it needs a serious revamp asapsupported
lets say this becomes trueyou then have 1 corp load up on eccm and wardec another corp you as a neutral entity rush in and ecm burst the crap out of the wardecd corp meanwhile the corp that you are working for with all the eccms keeps firingyou and your corp are neutral and turning aggressed doesnt mean  if they cant lock and pop youso this is like neutral remote repping but even more of an offensive maneuver and you want it like this well done why is there no thumbs down checkbox for threads seriously
i like it
you could also have them need a cyno to move and make it so they can request concord to make a private cnyo for them only light carriers and it costs 10 mil or something so they lose something to move then give them less damage than a domi but logistics between normal carrier and a logistics ship you now have a high sec carrier that has to pay to move doesnt replace the domi and has a role

easiest way to fix destroyers is to add a t2 variant that would give a pgcpu grid reduction or cap usage to small armor repairerssmall shield boosters and a 35 bonus to small armorshield repair amount per level or resistance bonusesit would keep them from tanking cruisers but make them much more effective against frigst2 cruiserscurrent t1 destroyers are very good at being t1 ships the current t2 inderdictors have their role and their nich and dont need a boostall you need to do is add a hardier t2 combat version and you will bring them online and uptodate
really cool you guys making this all publicps if there is some rule i missed about this thread being csm guys only i apologize
the whole process is as open as we can make it and we welcome other players comments about the issues we raisedue to the short time between the first 3 meetings at8 preparing for the trip as well as getting ahead of things at work so i dont return to a mess  the edited minutes are still work in progress rest assured i will be working on them at the airport tomorrow as i wait for my flight
with the csm so closely scrutinized by the public when logsminutes are released consider the strategic implications of my responses to delegates behavior in meetings before judging too quickly

i agree with finnagain that quoting out of context is a poor form of argument may i suggest that he and his partisans on various threads stop doing so at the same time i appreciate venkul muls providing us the fuller textual context when quoting dierdra vaals spanking of sokratesz an example of what finnagain and others should aspire to if you read the various logs of this csm you will find some members of it either acknowledging andor cultivating an antiank bias mynxee provides us a small example by trading on this in the post above a shame really given the professionalism she has otherwise demonstrated in the csm meetings and still folks like finnagain say that anks commenting upon this bias constitutes an evidentiary claim for a melt down finnagain had you ever thought of placing that comment in the context which gives it a wider meaning sujanra had you bothered to read the substance of the whole meeting and its constructive interactions between ank and others no you cherrypicked a minor disagreement to created an excuse for more ank bashing why if finnagains post is indicative  and in the broader context of this debate it is  because she doesnt share a myopic focus on his kind of pvp add onto this the coded sexist language about women having hissyfits temper tantrums and the like frankly i wonder who is having the real hissy when i read your statement to me and quit your bull we heard enough of it during the campaign seems to me you folks have a special talent for digging yourselves in deeper and deeper localhorse and others have thoroughly debunked claims such as yours about ank and pvp in addition i have been advocated for winwin approaches to developing the game to benefit all eves citizens  high low and null sec may i gently suggest you contribute something constructive as well you might start by pressuring sokratesz and his kind to stop the trolling both on and off the csm and get down to work on improving eve ironically the day before this flareup i posted on sokratesz need to act in a more responsible manner i was quite surprised to see that need validated on the record shortly thereafter dierdra vaal did the right thing in calling him out on his poor behaviouryou inadvertently raise an issue however that i think ank should take to heart sokratesz has demonstrated his bad faith and it is now an official part of the csm meeting logs so are his partisans bad faith as recorded in this and other forum threads because of that ank should let this ank sentiment issue drop we all know about the bias giving it more emphasis is a distraction from other issues and provides fodder for trolling how she constructively deals with this trolling is a more pressing matter this brings us full circle to the broader meaning and advice of the original poster casiella truza with this in mind i want to encourage ank to help shift the terms of debate by continuing to urge those representing special interests on the csm to join together in winwin solutions this may mean graciously losing on certain issues of process or substance in this round of the csm yet i believe a proactive effort to build bridges and foster a larger consensus remains a more important goal it will set a proactive tone and professional expectations for future csms and i hope that over time those who continue to troll will be marginalized from the mainstream of constructive dialogue and action i dont know whether ank will take this advice it isnt easy it takes patience and discipline to deal with the truant behaviour of people like sokratesz and perhaps ank doesnt suffer fools gladly most strong women i know do not yet at the same time one must expect adapt and transcend such behaviour in any politicized circumstance delilah
read the quote sokratesz was scolded not threatened
i have read all these minutes and it is interesting you choose not to mention how many times ank complaining of antiank bias whenever people disagreed with her i didnt know it was now considered sexism to disagree with a females point of view you also neglect to mention the schoolyard whining that occurred because dierdra vaal had an issue supported while anks first issue was not i also notice that there was no claim of proank bias when her other issues were passed by everyone could it be that the csm are voting on a per issue basis and not on who raised them in that case why did ank vote against calling ccp to task for excellence it would appear it is because she wanted her name on it too i guess csm is now all about keeping score of how many issues you raise to justify your position scolded for a fairly minor off the cuff remark he claimed there was a threat in a private chat but as it was behind the scenes we cant tell for sure mynxee appears to not want to reprimand ank for such behaviour because she quite rightly assumes people reading the minutes will make up their own mindshere is the section from meeting 3 with both ank and soks comments in bold judge for yourself who is the more unprofessional 173400  ankhesentapemkah  oh yes and why are you passing dierdras issue and discuss unfinished expansions which is basically the same thing 173408  sokratesz  flerp 173440  dierdra vaal  i can see this debate going in circles already just vote on the issue its on the agenda so yes you dont need to pass it technically but voting on this now means everyone can move on to the next issue with minimal drama end 173533  ankhesentapemkah   173549  mynxee  ankh 173604  mynxee  after ankh we will vote then easiest way to move on 173609  ankhesentapemkah  dierdra has done the same thing with his unfinished expansion and his issue was passed even though i argued against that and now i do this thing and everyone is against me it seems i find this odd and would say this is antiankh crap again 173616  ankhesentapemkah  end 173653  sokratesz  in other news sky is blue 173738  teadaze  dvs issue specifically called them on the excellence issue this fw is a rehash of previously passed issues 173746  dierdra vaal  just vote guys 173807  mynxee  all in favor of fix factional warfare raised by ankh 173812  ankhesentapemkah  excellence is a rehash of the unfinished expansion issue which i raised 173812  dierdra vaal  aye 173819  ankhesentapemkah  aye 173903  mynxee  all opposed say nay 173909  trebor daehdoow  nay 173913  sokratesz  nay 173916  mynxee  nay 173927  alpha12125  nay 173935  teadaze  nay  already covered 173947  ankhesentapemkah  lol double standardssok is scolded like a naughty schoolboy for stating the sky is blue in reference to the 3rd meeting in a row where ank accused the rest of the csm of antiank bias whenever other delegates disagreed with her
no problem at all youve certainly earned the benefit of the doubt and ill leave the deeper political maneuverings to you until i get a crate of phone spiders its just a shame many of us pointed out during the elections that having an empty seat would be better than someone who would actively work against the smooth functioning of the csm hopefully itll be limited to these temper tantrums when a vote doesnt go a certain way but with all the damage ccp has done to the game need for speed eh try a 1400inlocal fleet fight these days the csm has some very real work ahead of it the quote that appears nowhere because it was in a private conversation and we dont know what it actually was yah i dont think i can read that and neither can you but we do know that when it was paraphrased and brought up in public that it constituted some sort of threat wasnt denied something like dont say something like that again or insert consequence is well within the realm of possibility no seriously please come up with some new trolling tactics we saw all this  during the campaign your game is getting old now anks own words that clearly say exactly what was claimed they can be handwaved away because of context context that just so happens exactly confirms what people are claiming but that is a useful troll tactic for you i guess ank works to  people off and the when anybody disagrees with her all you have to do is point out how many people ank has probably ed off and then claim that ank must be a martyr due to how much people dislike her seriously though get some brand new trolling tactics nobody has debunked any claims about ank and pvp she has something like 8 kills in her entire career in eve all those quotes of her from the campaign were shown to be 100 accurate and verified in context etc and yes anks proposals about fw largely show that she simply doesnt understand pvp at all the very idea that you need to do more to encourage pvp than give people targets and free war decs that never expire just shows that ank doesnt get it i mean seriously free war decs and plentiful targets and they need more encouragement to fight enough already yes ank is now three for three each meeting when shes voted down she pitches a little hissyfit and imagines an antiank conspiracy when theres nothing of the sort going on every single csm meeting so far has seen the exact same minor disagreement come up that minor disagreement is that ank is a paranoid and thinks that the other csms are out of get her if they dare to disagree with her on a vote ank is 3 for 3 lets hope she doesnt go 4 for 4 although i dont doubt youd defend her or more to the point attack anybody who doesnt like her behavior if she does
there is not much to respond to in finnagains post except simple reassertions of unsubstantiated claims willful misinterpretations and a juvenile attitude dee tearant you have a more interesting response one which i agree with in two respects first like you i agree that merely disagreeing with a female is not sexism i do not agree with people who unreasonably shield themselves against critique by claiming discrimination at the same time coded language used as a placeholder for sexism and other invidious isms is a well recognized phenomena the meltdowns we hear claims of are in reality small cherrypicked political dustups when placed alongside the overthetop personal aspersions and heated rhetoric against eva as a person i think it is reasonable to call to account some people for implicit or hidden sexism this doesnt mean of course that you are being sexist still i would respectfully ask that you and others explicitly reject such sexism when it occurs and call others to account for it when you hear it for a long time ive thought bigots speak poorly of our mature playerbase and it is little wonder that women shy away from eve they are certainly not people i or my mates want to be associated with and we have very strict rules about respecting diversity in our corps i hope this is true for you and your mates as well second i do not think there is anything wrong with ank standing up for herself sometimes calling attention to those who scapegoat us is one way to do that i think we have all experienced being the scapegoat at home or at work and felt the need to dig in our heels and say something is wrong or unfair that said as i hope i made clear in my last post it is time for ank to move beyond this concern to stick with it will be counterproductive egg on trolls and detract from more important issues so you have a sense of my intentions i intervened in this debate partly because ank represents an important element of eves citizens that deserves to be heard and partly because the smears and fictions swirling around her detract from real issues that the csm should be dealing with it was necessary to separate fact from fiction in order to move us along for instance one of the real issues is the inevitable  rebalancing of pvp between pirates and antipirates ank pushes strongly for this the potential loss of protections and privileges that pirates currently enjoy is a major source of vitriol against ank i realize that the need to rebalance pirateantipirate pvp is a point of view that some may not agree with but i would rather have it debated on the merits that through a personal politics of slurs finally i appreciate you taking the time to quote a substantive extract from the record you are not trying to misquote by leaving out the immediate context nonetheless may i ask you to please consider the larger context of dierdra vaals scolding hes not scolding sokratesz for that one remark per se but responding to a particular remark representative of a larger pattern of truant behaviour there is a wider context than just those raw logs to consider here now we can argue the merits of whether sokratesz or ank is worse i dont want to do that id rather we push all the members of the csm to act in a professional and productive manner so ive publically called upon ank to set her concerns with scapegoating to one side perhaps you can join me in asking sokratesz to stop trolling and in the future we should call to account any of them who engages in behaviour that detracts from improving eve for all of us delilahfriendsofevewordpresscom
seriously just stop lying and stop trolling its not hard and youll feel better nothing was unsubstantiated or misinterpreted youre a bootlick for ank and if you could catch me in a mistake you would have instead you just make stuff up in order to troll enough lies enough of your sadly predictable behavior enough nonsense about how the truth about ank is a smear if you dont like it you are entitled to your own opinions not your own reality can you post honestly finally
ankh is thoroughly unqualified to be a csm member as her actions have demonstrated she has shown repeatedly that her primary concern is not the csm or eve but herself and furthermore whenever others disagree with an idea of hers she accuses them of antiankh sentiment frankly there is one person and one person only at fault for any antiankh sentiment on the csm and that is ankh her insulting statements and petulant childish behavior are more than enough to explain the existence of antiankh sentimentas for sexism please she would be just as awful and unqualified if she were evan jobse instead of eva jobse and i would be just as outspoken in my belief that she is incompetent and unsuitable for the csm i am quite certain that finn would as well seeing as hes my alt after all furthermore while i do not know your gender delilah i am entirely prepared to state based on the contents of your blog and your statements on this forum that you do not understand eve do not understand the concept of play possess an entirely unjustifiable and arrogant sense of moral superiority and quite frankly that you are a moron albeit one capable of stringing lots of words together as far as i am concerned these statements would all hold true regardless of whether you are male or femaleperhaps if ankh were willing to behave like an adult and accept defeat gracefully instead of engaging in passiveaggressive behavior insulting other members as she did to teadaze and blaming antiankh sentiment for every time a vote fails to go her way then that antiankh sentiment might go away instead however she has behaved in a manner similar to that of a temperamental child throwing tantrums whenever she fails to get her way such behavior harms the constituencies ankh was elected to represent and ironically harms her own reputation and political position evidently she lacks the maturity to recognize this so sadly do you
my my gentlemen thank you for demonstrating what a real hissy fit looks like delilahfriendsofevewordpresscom
of course although delilah is just trolling as the very first thing it says about sok in its blog post is that sok had a hissy fit evidently the troll is only against such comments when theyre applied to ank or maybe well see the earlier troll that was trotted out during the campaign that if you respond to an insult with a similar insult the second doesnt count and context totally eliminates it no doovers and no backsies edit evidently i was in too late and its now trolling some more here too hissy fit is totally code for sexist beliefs except when i use it and big surprise still no examples of anything i got wrong or misrepresented because its lying about it
i hope this is one of many tactical overlay upgrades at the moment i dont use it at all and it could be so useful as a tool for fcs
i agree mabe i would accauly fly my redeemer if it was more epic
i like the premise to thisto reduce the uber blob events you could push the idea of arena style capture points each fw side only gets so many ships within a particular compound but that could lead to alt abuse and other implicationsbut if there was some way to emphasize small well formed squads inside of complexes duking it out you could remove the npcs and let the factions honestly go at iti mean youll still have the massive combat in the systems exteiror to the compound those are allways fun but once inside it would become more tactics specific rather than shear numbers specific
allright lets face it eve is well over half a decade old and is still going toe to toe with current generation mmosstar treck online in and of itself has many similar features that eveonline is trying to catch up to planetary exploration walk on stations and ships pets etc the difference between us and them is content we have a much stronger history and player base than the newer mmos but ccp does need to compete with the newer games that are being releasedeve online was so successfull that it has become the model of spaceship mmos out there they follow us as a model and add new features for the health and survivability of this game they are pushing features to match current generation games and racing to add new content that will superseed their competitors as a result a several existing features are being neglectedi say we change this up a bit and ask ccp when they will dedicate an entire expansion to game balance  issue fixes and ask for a fixed interval such as once every year or year and a half where that is the goal of such a development cycle lets face it eve needs to be able to commercially compete with whats out there inorder to be able to keep this game world alive and healthyas players lets keep that in mind before we chomp at the bit and scream bloody murderthough sensor dampeners and blasters do need some serious love

even more if not all posters support it since some people simply missed to set the chechbox for support its quite a sign i think that theres next to no trolling or offtopic stuffs in here i hope ccp takes it to heartnot checking support again because i already did 
definitely behind this but i also want to be able to save multiple custom distances for the orbit and keep at distance buttons and to be able to switch between them quickly
thanks for your support if there is room for simple upgrades that improve the game by a lot this got to be one of these binding a keyboard shortcut to a command cant be hard please spread the word among all your friendsvherr arkhar came forward with a clever way of achieving this in post 12 of this thread quoted here for convenience
pretty happy with pi overall but would really like to see a group start option for starting extractors allowing you to start all extractors of the same type on one planet doing all that clicking everyday got tedious fast

be careful what you wish fordespite my avowed love of drones being a gallente weenie i see some major problems with this proposal1 its a massive buff to drones2 it makes missioning in a droneboat even more fireandforget than it already is3 the compute requirements of implementing this dronecontrol algorithm in a large fleet fight where there may be hundreds of drones on the field may be a wee bit onerousfrom a practical standpoint you are much more likely to get a proposal through csm and implemented by ccp if it is concise targeted and easy to implementan example is the proposal to let people see the status of drones in the dronebay this is a leftover from csm4 but it will get attention in csm5 after iceland i personally would also like an option to launch damagedundamaged drones first but thats another story
not supported drone tactical inferfacing  we dont need another skill to train up i know technically this allows the drones to target stuff like targetingmultitasking but ultimate this just boils down to a skill train that allows me to use an uii dont want to train this just like i wouldnt train windows net forms to level 5 just to fit my shipmining drones this idea just gives the macrominers more power it makes an easily macroable task more macroable orca  mining drones  9 or 10 system walk away come back in a few hours you have 10 roids of ore in your cargohold thats not even using a macro engage ewar vessels no there are already plenty of ways to counter ewar ewar ships are paper thin and this will make flying any ewar ship a guaranteed lossmail for example i warp in on a battle in a falcon decloak and jam something instantly 30 or so warrior iis race towards me i need to either warp or i will die way too overpoweredi dont think these suggestions will make drones any easier it actually makes it worse gamebreaking suggestions aside all of this just makes it more complicated i will admit that the drone ui is a little clunky but honestly its not that hard right click  engage target i agree with the csm member a simple and easy to implement solution will work better you can arrange drones into groups what might be an simple solution is to have assignable hotkeys to these groups
yes 42 towels are definitely the ultimate answer i would even buy a faction towel from the eve store if they were available
idk noobs getting concorded is pretty funny
supportedthis keeps idiots from emorage quitting just long enough for them to wander into the wrong side of my gunsseriously concord is totally killmail whoring herenot actually support and yes this is a troll
you are bad a trolling 010
its a giant planck bubble
supportet ofc make it just as awesome looking as the nyx is
aeon is pretty fugly i think half finished bestower is accurate also all the assault carriers should be bigger
thats right i said iti want to run missions dammit this is a game not a ing job instead i have to turn down 9 out of 10 missions because the agent tries sending me to lowsecfix missions
hell ya i support them fixing their broken 
i agree send all missions into lowsec
at the moment it is possible to fetch only killmails using directors key where corp members laid the final blow the proposal is to grab every killmail where corp members interfered somehow including unknown shiptypes which usually happens when you shot target then left system and someone finished the jobthanks

yes its a pain nowsupported
sometimes its hard to find the killmail when multiple corpsalliances are involved including some citizen corps that dont care about killmails

overhaul the entire killmail system ffs
simple proposal dont fk up sisi during the tournament it is used by teams for practice by fking it up you are resulting in teams not practicing and thus lots of frustration and lame predictable setups in the tourney alternatively have some other testground for practicingthis is in direct response to the screwup happening for at8 where we cant assemble ships on sisi this is particularly unfair to smaller alliances who dont have a mass of people with every possible ship sitting assembled in the hanger
corp logos personal nose art that you could upload into your api or something maybe definitely supporting this

completely agree that at a minimum the aggression timer should be visible and updated id be satisfied with only this changebut i also think its extremely odd that the time period where i am allowed to shoot you is made longer by me shooting your stuffany nullsec application of this shooting ratters wrecks to increase the aggression timer is also wacky and shouldnt be used as a reason to keep this funky mechanic
since youre obviously new here let help you remake your post into something that might garner something other than the more obvious trolls1 present an actual argument do this nao is not an argument2 present reasons unless youre talking to a small child because i said so is not a reason3 try not to rehash ideas that were discussed to death and dismissed six months agoas a side note ccp already reduced the scan timer once i believe from 2 seconds to slightly over 1 it seems extraordinarily unlikely theyll remove it since if they were going to that would have been the time to do it
look how silly and stupid you are you will probably never understand why makes it even more amusing

yes it has time and time again na dgot zillions of support  what did ccp do  absolutley jack this is how influential assembly hall is and csmtotal waste of time
actually i remember the threads being rather divided on the issue and now with a fair amount of time passed i see almost no complaints about it except for this thread im sure that this tells me not being able to mash the scan button is a huge game breaking faultalso bringing player issues to the attention of ccp does not mean ccp has to do anything about them its their game and if they say i dont care we like it the only thing you can do is unsub so if it bothers you that much unsubscribe and move on

yes because everyone that disagrees with you is a troll well this is almost correct  it seems like your implication direction is incorrect though you say that the goal is to funnel violence to a desired location which removes it from somewhere else however i would argue that the goal is actually to limit your enemys options for attack as much as possible to the point of outright elimination if its at all possible  but certainly away from your vulnerableweak aspects sun tzu agrees and goes on at much length to praise victory without lossi understand what youre saying but its a very tenuous argument that slowing their combat pace is equivalent to eliminating and restricting their choice of targetsure i was trying to stay under the character limitwell familiar actuallyyes and i think you might want to reread itliang
yes because disagreement is trolling but feel free to try again in a few days  im sure youll find me on the forums waiting for you as i have been for the last four yearsso who is being disrespectful  the guy that says oh you dont agree you must be trolling look how smart i am referencing sun tzu oh you are so dumb or the guy that says um hey guys this is really quite a change in game mechanics the role of this particular ewar and really wouldnt do much to affect anything outside of rr blobs anywayliang
lang its not that you dissagreed with me if you noticed i was completely civil untill you started crossing a line and becoming disrespectfull in pushing your opinion i acknowledge that a boost to the t2 specialized hulls would correct the sensor dampening mechanic however that change has not been made and doesnt look like it is trying to be made this is an alternative i stated both without mallace and you continued to choose to insinuate that it was the only viable alternative and that my idea was bad insinuating that i was an idiotthere just isnt any point in it also wtf is up with not having everything on the battlefield locked anywaythat i was a poor playeri dont see this being especially useful stop flying in blobsand that i my idea to change the way sensor dampining fuction was fundamentally wrongi dont see this being an improvement over the way that damps are theoretically supposed to workand then we got into the semantics argument over pace of battle and shapping the battlefieldi was quite polite and constructive with the disscussion up to this point you made an honestly ignorant statement and i tried to point that out to help in your understanding of what i was saying as i felt there was a disconnectthat ignorance still persistsand your fixation on the term violence when i used the term aggressive execution shows me that you googled those quotes and tried haphazardly to make them fit your argument and have not made any serious attempts to study warfare outside of a casual passing intrest but its a very tenuous argument that slowing their combat pace is equivalent to eliminating and restricting their choice of target again failure to utilize comprehensive context of the aims of this proposal i am not looking to force target choice but increase the likelyhood that there will be some penalty some impact on player behavior with the use of sensor dampeners as the premis of my whole argument here is that as it currently stands sensor dampeners have the least impact on player behavior of all the ewar modulesand yes your a troll you cant let it go your making shot single phrase arguments and waiting for reactionsand you have to have the last word just watch
the point at which you became uncivil was when i challenged your understanding of sun tzu seriously  shaping the battlefield and controlling the pace of the battle are entirely different and have different goals to boot controlling the pace of the battle does not at all control where the battle occurs simply the pace at which it proceeds obviously if you slow the enemy down and you are similarly unphased then you will trivially win however that doesnt mean that you will deny importantjuicy targets to the enemy as it would if you had shaped the battlefieldthey are differentwait whati do understand your goals and aims  i just vehemently disagree with your proposal for a variety of reasons comments rsds are not in fact the least impacting ewar tds are utterly useless against more than half the ships in space while tps simply dont affect the enemys behavior at all your suggested change is not in line with the current idea behind what damps do role change your suggested change would almost certainly preclude a boost to already existing functionality your suggested change ignores the fact that damps would remain largely useless in the majority of fights in eve since having 12 targets isnt that big of a detriment unless youre in a logisticsrecon or in a massive rr blobif i were trolling you id be responding in kind by pointing out your terrible grammarspelling and returning your ad hominem attacks unfortunately all im trying to do is pound some sense into your headlianged you did some editing to your post but im not really going to go try to figure out what all you changed between when i read your post the first time and second this is one of the reasons i settled on this ed  thing so long ago
obvious troll is obvious final word denied
im confused  are you admitting you were trolling this entire thread liang
again obvious troll is obviousgive it up i already gave you victory as a troll for hijacking this threadfinal word denied
how about you try refuting some of my specific complaintslets start with if this is an additive boost why should we add functionality to an ewar system before fixing the already broken parts especially in light of ccps tendency to boost something and then leave it alone for years at a go if this is not an additive boost why should we abandon an almost working mechanic instead of fixing it why should we change the role of damps in combat are you planning on adding a targets locked script for sensor boosters and are you aware of the difference between sensor boosters and signal amplifiers and what role they would have in your proposed scheme why should we add a mechanic to the game that specifically nerfs logistics recons and rr bs gangs and leaves the majority of combat roles overwhelmingly unaffected do you feel that logistics ships in small gangs are somehow overpowered and in need of being specifically nerfed you claim that this will slow down fleet combat and provide an optimal way in which it will  yet you seem to have put no thought into how this ewar can be almost totally mitigated even without fitting a counterlianged btw damn sad when the troll has to convince the op to continue being on topic with the thread instead of devolving into name calling
wow reallyfinal word denied
although i agree with pat that liang can be fairly agressive with her arguments and sometimes obtuse she is in many situations including this one correct im not saying that everything she says is wise and wonderful and we should all bow down to the wisdom of liang  far from it in fact i encourage civilised argumentsbut she is correct in this instance 1st fix the damps bonus on t2 hulls2nd add additional features
fiar enough any other ideas floating around out there
well i put a big list of things id like answered up presuming youre willing to have a civilized discussion you could try to answer themliang
how about this make a script for the dampeners that cuts a hole in the targeting from 0 to a range based on some numbersshipspace it cant targetspace it can target that would also make sense as blaster ships are close range the only bad thing about this is that if you had 2 ships one with that script and one with the range reduction you could lock a target completely
your talking about a reverse distance dampening script that would be a novel idea just how could you find a technical explination on how it could workit would cause issues for toe to toe fighters and favor distance shipsor are you more of thinking of between x3 and x4  no targeting
tbh as long as the currently existing damp mechanic is fixed first i dont have a major objection to additional functionality but youve never answered my query as to how you believe this is going to affect normal people in eve most combatants will be little more than annoyed by having their number of targets lowered since at most you really care about the primary and maybe secondary targets and really  even if you are annoyed it wont be much more than that it would require no more effort on your part to alleviate than targeting the offending ship and sending your drones after it continue with your business afterwardsno the nerf almost specifically targets people that need large numbers of locks to do their job  like rr bs gangs certain recon pilots and all logistics ships i might be able to see arguments for wanting to nerf rr bs gangs though i disagree that we should be nerfing teamwork so heavily what i dont see is that recon and small gang logistics pilots need specifically nerfedlianged final sentences of first paragraph
im thinking about dampening the targeting from 0 onwards from the affected ship but not that far maybe 15 km at max with a rigged recon and fleet bonuses and maybe 5km on a normal ship and i also havent yet got an idea how to explain itor maybe i just havehow about that it generates signals around the targeted shipa that get reflected and shipb within a certain distance of shipa bounces those signals of again an confuses shipas targetingand why dont the signals confuse the sensors of shipa with the first hit
fortunately you dont have to make an rp explanation for why your suggested game mechanic works it just has to be balanced gameplay  and on that note it would be so much more powerful to damp their minimum lock range than their maximum  because theres so much more power available to close range ships nosneutswebsclose range weaponsetcim not sure it could be balanced  especially as long as both styles of range dampening existedliang
oh sticky particles like quickly decaying radio isotope that sticks to the targeted hull projecting a prevailing cloud of interfearence particles would have to be continuously applied inorder to maintain sufficient cloud density to interfear with the locking mechanism though we might still have issues explaining why you get a nearby refractory or overwhelming background environemnt but still achive distance or long range energy wave integrity perhaps it does something with the wavelengths ability to alter direction while within the field that could give plausibility would need to be fudged in the name of sci fi but could be doablesounds like it would almost need a seperate module to be scripted as the current sensor dampener mechanics work off percentages and what your suggesting would work best with a mathmatical equation perhaps the module starts with a range of 15km t1 and is affected by skills 500m per skill level and then altered by ship bonuses 10 per level or so up to a maximum of 57 kmt2 with bonuses or so do you want this device to mimic web or dampener rangesbut yes it does feel mechanically it would be overpowered especially against frigs and close range gank ships but it might go somewhere interesting
keep the current way rsds work by simply reducing rangeresolution just boost its effectiveness when fitted to specialised ships the lachesis is currently best fitted as a shield tanked gallente hac not as the rsd king it should be once this is fixed then maybe just maybe we can talk about additional features like max target locks effected by rsdsoh and the reason why rsds seem to be the wrong ewar for gallente ships is because you are looking at it from the wrong perspectivemy enemy wants to engage me at this range where they know my very powerful weapons are useless and their weak weapons can still reach out and touch me so i will force them to fight on my terms at extreme close range where i have all the advantagesa picture to illustrate the pointx  gallante shipy  enemy caldari shipz  the target of either  effective range of weaponsxzyzhowever if i remove the ability of my enemy to even target me at ranges beyond my effectiveness i force them into my engagement zone and out of thiers to be blasted to bit by my super powerful blastersxzyzi know what you are trying to achieve by making the enemy useless at the range that blasters want to operate to essentially be used as a defence but then the enemy will just want to be in the other medium bracket instead of the blaster short bracketthis is what liang was trying to show you this is how rsds shape the battlefield unfortunately resolution dampening is ineffective on its own it is however very very effective when coupled with ecm
spug no arguments here forcing close ranged engagements with blasterstyle ships is the fundamental purpose of sensor dampeners im just entertaining the idea on how it could otherwise work i would never seriously propose a change like reverse range dampening but its fun to give conjecture but as far as the target locking reduction currently sensor dampeners are not working the t2 ewar ship fix would fix the problem and issue of poor specialized sensor dampening suffers from its just that change has not happened and in my opinion is not going to happen so i am trying to explore and propose a possible change in the sensor dampening mechanic that might adress the issue and make them viable without becoming broken
those that trade know that this window could use a few small adjustments that would drastically increase the player experience1 filters  let me filter the data in the window so i can narrow it by region or any of the other columns 2 order adjustment status  if i can change the order why not change its color or add an icon or something to let me know its in my power to change with my current skills3 multiselect let me select multiple items and have the stats at the bottom apply to those items then i can see my projected return based on the items ive selected or have it based on the filter idea above

i suggest the removal of the scan resolution penalty on black ops this would free up a mid from the need of a sensor booster while youre at it maybe a rework of the black ops bonus a 5 agility bonus to the gallente blops wtf
imo black ops should could fit covert cloaking device
no they shouldnt
something needs to change with those ships the fact that they are weaker than all other battleships is a problemi almost wonder that the whole black ops jump portal making nocovopscloaking thing might work better as a black ops command ship a battleship should have some firepower behind it otherwise its just more expensive for no real benefit
giving them command bonuses to their respective recons does sound like something but recon gangs are already pretty solidhow about giving them bomb launchers and a special cloak that gives them away on the overview but not targetable if x amount of people are on grid
the blackops is not a solo ship and with its niche of covert ops behind the lines it is pretty good alreadybombers as its associated dps 400dps each  recons for the ewar part make a pretty deadly gang if you ask mea little buff on range for the covert portal might be nice
not supported because of the subject line oh right and the completely garbage presentation of whatever this proposal is supposed to be
even with a portaljump range buff the actual combat side needs some looking atliang
imo it needs some more jump range and preferably a huge increase in capacity for fuel bridge and jumping as for combat abilities their dps is good enough 700 on lowest 11k on best but their ehp sucks some proper resists or better base hps would help

if what youre asking for is a report card on how well ccp handles support then supported should be easyi dont really care about trying to improve it because im sure about 90 of petitions are user error and even then response times can be pretty quick within minutes for some petition typeswhat id also like to add is that support needs some watchdog mechanisms because a lot of times the responding gms can be total s or at least inconsistent compared to the mass volume of petitions they usually handle things quickly and efficiently but when a petition takes some thought more than unstick pilot or reset mission there is the opportunity for gms to be unpleasant and leaves the customer with a feeling of being screwed over

i am not opposed to being able to attack pi stuff but i do think it should be as difficult as attacking a death star large pos otherwise no there needs to be an afk defense for assets that are always in game
well since anomalies generated by the pda respawn immediately after completion defining them as either good or bad based on the total amount of isk in them isnt a good way to go instead define them in terms of the amount of bounties gained per tick judging by my experience and the ratio of battleships to frigates and cruisers in the sanctums if you ran the bad sanctum all day id bet that youd make more isk than if you ran the good sanctum in the same amount of time plus youd have more opportunities to pick up the escalationas for altering the distribution the lowends below hub are mostly pointless i wouldnt alter the quantity of havens or sanctums but sacing most of the low ends and throwing another forlorn or forsaken hub into the mix would be welcomeas long as we have to put up with bugged anomalies at leastso support taking another look at the distribution
we already have insane amounts of isk generated on a daily base because these anomalies never cease to respawn havens sanctums and hubs are already enough to support up to seven or eight pilots at a time and we arent even talking belt ratters or miners you should consider talking to your alliance leadership to install these upgrades in more systems so that there is more opportunity to continue your isk grinding
however it was ccps stated intention that between ratting and industry upgrades to cram as much as 20 people or more in a single system so that alliances could run themselves at a profit to all in a single constellation or less to encourage smaller alliances to encourage more people in 00currently as everything less than a hub is basically ignored its now 10 in a non mining system and until ccp lets us build the upgrades no idea how the freighter move of the last upgrades is prohibitive even with jb networks its still a pain at least now we can get the bits for ihubs and move them in jump ships without a freighter per ihub
one can actually run the complexes in pairs to increase their spawn rate that would actually be the objective of the game cooperation it is very easy to hit the 20 mark and remain profitable if you abolish the thought that you have to be alone to make isk

i certainly could have filled the roster to overflowing with proposals i support but there are factors at play which affected why i did not raise the issues you linked the time it takes to prep an issue for presentation in a csm meeting some take longer than others some are likely to be more controversial and need more research to be able to champion them in an informed way the goal of keeping csm meetings to about 2 hours the potential amount of time needed for the summit agenda discussion related to negotiations with ccp about what was important to csm and needed time the fact that 8 other people were entitled to raise issues for the meeting and might do so at the last minute and historic precedent suggesting that a max of 810 issues per meeting even when there is no summit agenda discussion is a realistic goal i know youre scathingly skeptical about the csm process tbh i welcome thisits good to know that players care enough to hold us to task i hope we can demonstrate some accomplishments over the next several months that will chip away at that skepticism bear in mind we were just seated 13 days ago and required to be ready for a summit a mere 17 days after taking our csm seats also remember this is a volunteer activity all of us have rl obligationssome of them considerable especially so given they must be managed to permit us to extract ourselves from them to go to iceland for essentially a week without pay in my case i might add since i dont have sufficient paid time off on the books to use for the trip on a side note the amount of time required for csm activities is significant even at half my normal consulting rates the free trip to iceland doesnt come close to compensating for the hours ive put in not complaining i was aware of the time it took even if you did a half assed job just stating factsgive us a chance we will have 10 meetings between the june and december summits i can pretty much guarantee youll see the issues you linkedand many moreraised in csm meetings and submitted for consideration at the december summit
what can we do to give you what you need in terms of information and research towards an informed presentationyoure in noir you already know everything i know therefore about how those folders were used because its entirely likely we use them for exactly the same thing keeping track of members of dozens of entities of interest im hearing that certain industrial and trader types used them to keep track of entities of entirely different interestas the folders were stored on our pcs it seems to me that ccp would not be easily able to make themselves aware of just how many people used those folders thus making them a low priority in terms of functionality to be lostas yes im throroughly skeptical about the csm being in a position to rectify this issue even to the point that even if it did raise it and ccp did fix it thats not even proof that it was the csm that prompted the remedial action in so much that ccp developed eve and corrected errors long before the csm existedbut since its here and since its rammed down our throats once a year and since ccp like to pretend they listen to it and since it pretends it listens to us lets see how that works out assuming that csm5 doesnt implode and ragequit no judgement i certainly would have by nowi appreciate it takes a lot of your time its a shame that time is effectively being wasted by a ccp that takes your ideas under advisement and files them under b when theyre talking to the csm which internal ccp budget do you think they book the hours to
you keep using that word i dont think it means what you think it means
sexism means the same thing as smear distortion debunked claim etc something thats true and is unfavorable about ank
you dont really have much room to talk after the essays you wrotethank you for your unfounded accusations i actually read the raw logs from all the meetings thanks in fact i agreed with most of ankhs proposals the only one i didnt was the one the csm voted down ive also supported a proposal or two of hers on the assembly hall between that and the fact that i voted for myxnee i find your accusations of sexism hilariousit worries me that you are completely unable to find a middle ground here ankh must be right all the time and everybody out to get her is a troll or an idiot i dont think shes a good delegate but shes had some good proposals and i and the csm will support them as they come up it is however ridiculous to gripe about bias every time your proposals get voted downon the other hand yes i do think that sokrateszs behavior in regards to the whole ankh situation has been unprofessional i think that after theyve both been elected they can manage to coexist on the same council without the backbiting and childishness that both have exhibited its an internet spaceship council for christs sake lighten upalso i completely reject the criticism of myxnee ive seen here i think shes done an admirable job of staying above the drama and keeping the csm on task
at least ankh makes things interesting i for one am looking forward to the next meeting log
yeah since we cant enjoy huge fleet fight drama any more csm drama will keep us going
thanks for your reply sujanra acoma actually i dont think you and i are that far apart we both agree that ank should drop the complaint about scapegoating and sokratesz is behaving unprofessionally we also agree that sokratesz and ank and the rest of the csm should be expected to work cooperatively and productively togetherplease note however that there are multiple themes to this thread its not simply about whether ank is justified in griping or not for that reason i cannot simply blame both sides equally or fail to place the dispute in the context needed to understand it fully simply blaming both sides wouldnt be a middleground position it would be a false balance im not saying this is what you were trying to do rather im explaining why i push back hard on the misleading claims of those who want to make this all about ank it is more complex than that my preference is to see this discussion move towards professional expectations of the csm if im interpreting you correctly you are so inclined as well as for mynxee i too think she has done a good job of chairing the csm her wink and nod on this thread was a departure from that and one that i hope wont happen again delilahfriendsofevewordpresscom
 yeah the context is that ank had a hissyfit each and every single meeting so far because people dared to disagree with her and sok made a joke about how yet again ank was having a hissyfit because people were disagreeing with her the reason is youre a partisan shill and youre willing to lie and troll to support your chosen candidate there were no misleading claims thats just one of your trolling tactics something is true and you dont like it so rather than debunking it you just call it false lots and lots and lots and hope you can trick people and of course its all about ank nobody else has had three hissyfits over the course of three meetings when they get voted down your partisan shilling must be a bit easier and youre rubbing your hands in glee once sok made an off the cuff joke so you can try to divert attention from anks repeated pattern of temper tantrums what luck conspiracy really comes naturally to you eh now mynxee is out to get ank too go figure
just 2 thingsi expect the csm members act mature whichever side it comes fromremember one thing and one thing only csm delegates you are chosen to represent the playerbase nothing more and certainly nothing lessas for finnnotagainyou must be one bored gamer or you just have a personal grudge versus ank because checking back reveals that in the passt few weeks most of your posts are regarding ank in some way or anotherjust for your information regardless if you agree as how she got voted or that she got voted is of null concern your acting like don quichotte and ank is your personal windmill its way passt amusing and its more closing into the point of patheticso my dear csm delegates do that what you are voted for and make this game more enjoyable in general for the carebears and the hardcore pvpers and for the griefers and scammers

my pi wishlist1 interplayer trading on a planetprobably by allowing materials in a customs office to be contracted to another playeran alternative would be to permit interplayer links on planets with a new contract type to define a type of product quantity and price this would then permit the player accepting the contract to route materials along that link till the contract was fulfilled at which point the isk would be released to him2 pi apilet us monitor our pi setups externally to the game3 offlining structureslet us construct more pins than a cc can support providing that no more than the ccs support limit are operational at once  similar to pos module onlining4 abort operationslet us stop extractors and rescan5 action queuelet us queue up 1 action on an extractor up to 12 hours in advance eg set a 23 hour cycle going at 6am one morning then rescan anytime from 6pm the previous day to have it start at 5am the following morning6 upgrade ccs without destroying the whole network7 improve the scanning systemrather than just letting us see the coloured bands let us also sample a site to see what the extraction there will be  within skill moderated accuracy limits8 quadruple storage silo storage and halve powergrid
pi is abysmal yeah it can produce the stuff you need but its a mindless chore suitable only for macrosquoted from my other thread on the same issue here
either fix the rockets or remove them it is just distracting and confusing to have weapons in the game that are uselessi miss my hawksupport
looks good except for the new skill requirement supported otherwiseit would be even better if there were a zero transversal option for nonsentries tells drones to match speed and direction with the target once in optimal range as opposed to trying to orbit the target this would increase the drones dps at the risk of the drone being shot dead if the target decides to fire back
thats all thats really needed imo the rest of the suggesitons is way too much power and would break the concept of the game youre not supposed to not have to do anything

not a big drones user but this is good

i will support this but its a wast of time ccp wants a pvp game there claim its a sandbox is bs its only a sandbox if you pvp as everything in eve out side of high sec has pvp taged to it thats what 75 of the game so if you have landed on eve and like space ships and pve you got a shelf life of mybe 12years if you have hit that shelf life its time to start pvping or move on to a better pve gamesorry thats just eve and ccp will not be happy till high sec is as empty as low sec o welledit as a result i have a friends list from 3years of playing that has over 100 pilots in it that i have pved with in now dead corps all redlighted well not all from the people i know mybe 1015 are still green but they have moved on to pvp or gave there accounts to someone that dos my accounts will go red at the end of this billing cycle now too
so if are running missions for the fun of spending hour after hour killing the same ai mob over and over again then you can simply pick any of the hundreds of agents that dont put you into harms way instead of whining up the forums with more drivel the rest of us are playing something a little more involved than a predictable arcade shooter
that is most likely why he made this topic only people with iq below 10 do missions in low sec border systemsto op just move to mission hub that is what ccp is trying to achieve with lolloadbalancing just give freaking dynamic agent quality of they want real load balancing
this is a pvp game quit crying htfu and learn how to deal with it or gtfo
furb killer  i think you meant to say that people who mission in low sec are generally of an iq far greater than this particular idiot of op as they obviously know whats at risk8
boo hoo life is so hard isnt it
since the test server is meant to be used for bug squashing and not for testing new fitsalliance set ups be glad you could use it at all
customization is always fun and if it can be done without adding much more work on the servers then yea why not
there is a larger issue that many stupid countdowns are not visible at all they should fix all timers and make them visible it is seriously ed that timers continue to be broken after many yearsactually there should be a way to figure out a way to live without dumb timers also remove hi sec
supported i dont think your aggression timer being extended from someone shooting your wrecks makes sense but at the bare minimum it shouldnt be possible to use this to extend your timer without you knowing about it
didnt know about this the timer extension is all well and good but when the extension is invisible supported
i thought this was deemed an exploit years ago and fixed im disappointed to see that that is not the case ccp please fix the aggression counter to at least display the correct time left on the aggression
by your horrendously misspelled logic i mean seriously dont you guys at least have spell checkers on your web browsers christ the missions should be in 00 since that is where the most risk is
it was actually one of the most supported topics to ever be posted in assembly hall the old topic is locked and it is still a major issue that negatively effects the game and is universally hated
its really not that bad
seems to me the op is talking about what ecm should be not damps i think they both need to be looked at frankly but i agree that bonuses for ships would go a long way to fixing damps in the meantime
ecm works perfectly fine now the reason ecm got the fix it required is because it was very overpowered and the ing and whining on the forums was epic mostly because of ze falconit seems when something is underpowered just a little like rsds are people have a little moan about it a post with a small following then it eventually dies and gets forgotten about because everyone accepts that its weak if you want rsds to be useful you need to really ramp the whining up into overdrive and get enough people to support you with a very good proposal increase rsd effectiveness bonus from 5 to 75 on keres and 10 on lachesisarazu
i really wonder about that last statement suggest you take a look at efts lock time calculations if its the question of taking another rook or lachesis in your gang i know what id prefercan we get some numbers on old and current rsd strength  and the proposed 75 and 10  lvl on rsd platforms  that would be enlightening
thats why you want fast lock speed when you have sensor damps on your ship to hit enemiescan it really be so hard to graspyou sensor damp long range ships so they are ineffectiveyou sensor damp ships to make them shoot at the ships that are closer these are the ones with tanks if youre smart imagine thatyou sensor damp ships to make them come closer to youits the same with tracking disruptorsyou td ships to make them have to use longer range ammo that hurts a lot less or they have to get really close to you into your range all of the sudden you turn the td off and now theyre losing effectiveness in the fight because theyre using a low power charge at close range while youve turned off the td to preserve cap not only that but you can switch charge to tracking for the td and flip it back on now the other person is fighting with lol damage ammo at short range with almost half of his tracking neutered so hes doing lolwut damagethats how amarrs fight anway superior guns and armor and modules to force the enemy to do what you want them to do ie get closer and die facemelt style
i just wondered about this i imagine the way it works now is done for a reason or it might not let me show youas far as im aware currently in game its thisyou  targetlocking target  they see nothingtarget locked  flashy yellow bracketsfiring on target  flashy red bracketshow i sort of expected it to worklocking target  flashy yellow bracketstarget locked  nonblinking yellow bracketsfiring on target  flashy red brackets or you could have nonblinking red bracket but maybe yellow is better because yellow is still somewhat in realm of nonaggressive act and keeps things clearer in fact lets add something else just actually thought of this if someone is firing a hostile module at you ie weapons ewar etc keep it flashy red but maybe it could be changed to flashy green brackets or flashy blue for a supporting module like tracking links remote rep etc however it would get complicated if you got someone firing a hostile and nonhostile module on you why they would be doing that i dont know  but its still a possibility that could happen and would need to be consideredanyway the main point was that i thought it might be more interesting if you could see when someone is locking onto you i realise you would lose the element of surprise so perhaps no one would want it changed  and thats fine but right now for example a battleship could be taking 20s to lock onto a smaller target and they wouldnt know about it until pretty much the instant the battleship fires thoughts oim aware of passive targeters and how they show nothing even when you engage a module on target  i just tested that on myself but this is nothing to do with them
everything in this proposal would be a nice change good to know whether that battleship is targeting you to remote rep you or to kill yousigned
wouldnt it be nice to be able to watch the alliance tournament from ingamesince igb doesnt support flash we cant do thiswhy not add an evetv module to our ui and broadcast all or at least a lot of events
given the igb is based on chromium they could html5 video support in the long run
a surprising level of support for such a tiny proposal 3
and have the deliveries hangars sortable like our own personal hangars because they have tons more crap in deliveries than personal hangars by fari kicked the last csm until they brought this up it was almost unanimously supported and died like 99 of anything else brought up by the csm
very much supported
im not really sure tbh heres the workflow that i follow yes i love making flow charts this one was hastily done to respond to this thread however so it probably needs some refinement i would like to document other csm processes this way as an aid to help players understand what we do behind the scenes and future delegates work in consistent waysthe two research tasks involve considerable effort because finding information in forum and wiki formats that are inconsistently worded not tagged with keywords etc is very tedious we unfortunately lack of a good tool for tracking proposal status assigning keywords sortingfiltering by various criteria etc teadazes csm database is a great tool that helps but is limited in scope and features although im sure he intends to continually evolve it and even with a tool the discussions for proposals posted in ah is vital but from the perspective of researching aggregating and managing the mountain of data contained both here and in the wiki were crippled thats a whole other rant though  i suppose the best help players could give is to assist with the research for proposals they post or support and post relevant links to related threads or wiki pages some do this now but as it involves effort and people are often unwilling to invest more than a minimal amount of it i am unsure how to inspire folks to do morein my dream world proposals are submitted tracked crosslinked etc in a csmmanaged database with a nice web interface i do have a vivid imagination considering this is only the year 2010
i am not skeptical about the csm rather i am quite optimistic about it i think the idea is a good one ccp has real incentives to make this work including past troubles with trust and transparency the growing possibility of direct competition and the recognition that player insight can help them develop an even better cosmos that ccp made the csm a stakeholder in the development process not only speaks to these incentives but speaks well of ccp moreover if we look at the work output and overall professionalism of the csm itself it is fair to say the csm is doing its best one may disagree with something or another but that is not a reason to decide that the initiative will derail before it is barely out of the station lets not let perfection be the enemy of the good i also appreciate the transparency with which the csm is conducting its business  flowcharts databases wikis i hope the notion of a csm portal comes to fruition in the near future thanks to all of you eg mynxee teadaze ank for your work on these tools delilahfriendsofevewordpresscom
eh elaborate on the protection and privileges that pirates enjoy since from what i can see any neutral fighting vs a pirate outlaw will have a very big advantage on their side i would say that neutrals have too much protection in lowsecand if i need to refresh your memory this is a list of disadvantages pirates have in lowsec we can be killed  podded without any penalty when fighting on station or gates we will have 300dps against us from the guns we cannot assist any corp mates on station or gates without getting gun aggro unless neutral players who can assist their corp mates on a station or gate above reasons 2 will kill anything below a bc if there for more then a few seconds when killing a pirate usually 50 of the damage will be from gate or station guns so yes they hurt alota nonpirate fighting a pirate will not suffer any of these penalties and will be at a decent advantage so tell me what is this real issue of pirates having too much privileges
eyepatches and parrots
i am glad your responce excelled in pure genious but i actually didnt expect more than thatthank you for confirming my thoughts about you though
hello killer gandry thanks for writing i think the vast majority of us reading these threads couldnt agree with your views on the csm and other matters more delilah
see its smug crap like this that annoys me youre just as bad
no seriously youre not even good at trolling youve not upsetting or even really annoying youre just embarrassing yourself by farting angrily at metroll better
black ops certianly need looking at i would say probably more than any other ship in game currently
unlike titan pilots black ops pilot arent prisoners of their ship so this comparison is pretty moot the qen numbers would be a lot more useful if they gave the number of chars owning a black ops but the the qen is mostly about delivering irrelevant numbers

agreed i want real carriers and supper carriers not the little toys the children play with
both carriers and supercarriers need to be larger i was messing about with a friends chimera in my machariel and couldnt help thinking how the hell can it possibly fit a machariel inside that puny thing
10
i just stick to calling them motherships and yes they should be larger
obviously reading the tldr didnt give you enough info and id advice you to read the whole proposalbeing able to not repair your weapons while in a safe environment is unique only to carriersi must disagree here because i have thought of these problems1 this can be solved by an easy equation the total in drone repair  drone bay should never exceed drone maximum drone space2 this is why the repair rate will be very slow if you wish to do something close to pop inpop out then you will have to activate triage with all its side effects3 if it were a slot based module it would have to be a high slot one to not penalize one race on slots however i feel that this should be a baked in feature into the carrier class

couple of this i would look forward too 1 links allowing interaction with other players to the same planet2 ability to flow items from spaceport into storage if you have an import sensitivity setup the spaceport gets cluttered and expedited transfer is too limited in volume storage is only 5k and in timeregardsnodles
good plan batman
i think youre right about space port to storage since launch pads have the ability to send stuff to orbit why should that make them the only structures able to have returns youre sending stuff down to a planet so you should be able to send it anywhere logically speaking rightanother thing about pi that doesnt make sense to me is command centers as it is now i can plop one down anywhere and set up my whole operation elsewhere as long as i have it on the ground i can some how magically use its powergrid and cpu to power my industries thats kinda weird i suggest making it mandatory to have it connected by link also get rid of cpu theres no reason for it practically or imaginitively think about it why do you need one localized cpu to run numeral facilities stretched over hundreds to thousands of kilometers that wouldnt happen every facility would have their own computersit doesnt follow logic and its intended limiting factor is non existent get rid of cpu altogether pleasei am also a proponent of making command centers movable you should either be able to move them or place a new one without disturbing your other structures i saysupportthe 500 m3 storage at cc is useless too just get rid of it
totally agree im now struggling how to upgrade cc with preserving my current structure impossible i think ill do screenshots and just put pins in same places lolstorage should take half of the pg of launchpad imoi agree1 for thisyup 1id also like to list some stuff but i guess ill put it into new topic
from wikipediawe can already import and export several levels of settings in eve but something that in my opinion would enhance the game experience is an option to store them ccp side this would make it a lot easier for people like me that run several accounts on several different locations quite regularly but it would of course benefit anyone who occasionally logs into eve on a different computerthings it should include  graphics  performance settings overview  broadcast settings chat channels location of ui elements chat windows overview at a given screen resolution ability to store several profiles ability to exportimport to xml filesall this convenience can be had at the mere cost of a few kilobytes of data per character which with the current eve population would all fit on a single 1tb disk with enough room to spare in case the entire population of earth suddenly decides to subscribe to eveas you can see i have also come up with a terribly unoriginal name but the voices told me that clouds do not usually form in space sokevelopedia page soon

thanks everyone but if you post in support you need to tick the button 
there is no way to fix blobs have you people not goten it yet blobs are what keeps the servers on in iceland and keeps eveonline goinghere is why eve is a pvp game mainly but it was well basicly failing at geting the needed numbers of players though pvp so they did great promo on sandbox and you can do anything you all remeaber that right and numbers started rising rapidly you see this numbers were not people that like pvp this were people that like pve the pvp people that played eve were not going to keep the servers on so they had to get pve players into there game and make both pvp and pve players think there geting what they wantedso this is how you keep pve players in a game they like doing pve content they love in a pvp game its the only real deturent pve players have to combat pvp players its the blobif your a pve player you dont realy like pvp so you blob the crap out of the people that jack with your pve content now its fair and  becouse pve players dont like to pvp they only blob to get to the new cool pve content placed in pvp zones and it works becouse pvp players hate blobs there no fun for any pvp player ether so both sides hate the blob just as much for differnt reasons and that makes it all work out becouse the blob keeps pvp players away from pve players for the most part if pve players did not have this blob they would have no real deturent against pvp players why is that you say all they need to is pvp back well thats the problem if pve players did not have a way to make pvp unfun for pvp players with the blob pvp players would never leave the pve players be becouse remeaber this are pvp players and pvp is want they want and would pvp the pve players till the pve left game and then you dont have the numbers to keep the servers on again there for ccp has to keep the blobas a side note it was a smart real life bussness move by ccp
for real come on we all know eve is a pvp game not a pve game thats why the pve sucks why spend time on devleping pve when the pve in this game never mixs well with the pvpedit i only say this becouse if they do put good pve in and not fix the pve v pvp problems its just going to make pve cry post of the past look soft as it is right now the pve is not worth realy fighing for thats why the omg there sending me to low sec for level 4 and the wtf i have to go to low sec now for all level 5 post small and omost nothing right nowput realy pve in the game and the cry post about having to pvp when trying to get to good pve content will go way beyond the paleso be carefull what you ask for is all im realy sayingedit as a side point alot of pvp players post on the boards much like they like kill boards becouse pvp players need to know what other players think or feel pve players will not flood this boards but they will in mass flood ccp mail boxs pve players when they have something to say aobut a game go right to the top becouse they dont give a damn about pvp players or what 2 cents they have to place in it all
i fully support this concept think if you could take sides of a npc corp that takes incursions in the null sec in a pve event on the other side ppl would take the side of the enemy corp this way solo players could engage in pvp and pve at the same time to avoid bringing massive ships you would have frigates stealth bombers restriction etc pve should replace some of the pvp issues you dont encounter massive battles every week

make the bonus to range and lower the bonus to rep amountthats it no big block of text the 75km range is completely unacceptable when even a bad bump from quarter speed can push you out of rep range
 this awesome idea makes those systems actually useful
also we want covert cynos damnit
t3 remoterep subsystems really could use a bonus to range 75km is very short
yes and i want a subsystem for the hictors bubble modand all 4 races should get a mod for their secondary ewar painers damps tracking disruptorand revisit the other mods that are not used much like the one that gives bonus to overheat i think that one should get a 20 bonus per level
hm i havent checked on this in awhile unfortunately the previous csm did not agree with me but i have received a lot of support both here and ingame so i am definitely going to bring it to the attention of ccp in iceland and if necessary will write a new proposal and raise it again
this whole mechanic is kinda lame especially on the capital and super capital level where you would have to wait four hours to get your shield fully recharged after a session change

the shadows are awesome because it shows me the plane the planets are on
in my personl opnion is that rorquals should be able to make a jump bridge for other industrial ships like exhumers and orcas my reasoning behind this it that the titan is the largests combat ship and it can take other combat ships with it in a jump bridge the black ops ship is the largest of its type can trasport other covert ops ships with it so why cant the rorqual transport other mining ships with it because it only seems fair that the roqual is capable of that it states in the description that its the center peice for a deep space mining operation so dosent it only make sense that the center of a deep space minning operation should be able to bring through a jump bridge the ships its meant to supportplease feel free to leave feedback it would really be appreciated
ill support for the t2 miners but nay to the orca
the rorqual already has a 1 million m3 ship maintenance bay enough for 5 hulksit also has the ability to field a clone vat bay meaning you can jump 5 hulks to destination the pilots can jump clone to the ship unload their hulks and mine all day
im a bit surprised that this is not getting more support guess not everyone reads these threadstell your friends to post in this thread and support if the agree
one of the core ideas of eve is risk vs reward right now that doesnt apply to trading often taking a lowsec alternative between two trade hubs gives almost no improvement in time saved while greatly increasing risk and effortmany hubs actually do have good routes  specifically all the routes coming out of rens have long hisec routes to the other 3 largest hubs and short lowsec routesjitaamarr is obviously the worst with 9 jumps for the hisec route and 24  for the nextshortest lowsec routewhat made me create this topic however is jitadodixie right now you can go through the uedama pipe for 15 jumps save 3 jumps by going through tama lol or save just one jump by going through oletteirs none of these are big improvements for the risk they add and i as a trader would like to see a combination of an increase in  of hisec jumps and decrease in  of lowsec jumps so that i actually have a decision to make when choosing which route to take this would improve the riskreward curve increase the number of ship blowing up and bring jitadodixie in line with most other routes between trade hubs in terms of availability of lowsec shortcuts
they could instead make the highsec routes even longer eve already is way too small and easily traversable
eve needs to be more dangerous not safer
what happens when a trade hub stops being popular in favor of another one its happened before jita wasnt always the big or even significant trade hub in eve in fact as far as i know the only thing ccp has done to support specific trade hub systems has been node reinforcement not world shaping how would you make sure that changing the travel time between hubs will leave the hubs intact
i would just let it be and see maybe we would then get more smaller hub which i think would even help the server and would be more fun as the universe would get bigger and so onactually i would like it a lot that all 4 empires get split by low sec and even null sec yes null sec but there should be much more low sec pipes and only a few null sec ones wich should a hell of a lot faster though  exept for a few looooooooong high sec routes that would bring a lot more live into low sec and it would support traders hiring mercs for secure passage or even paying the pirates
well if they would know they wouldnt be doing missions in low sec border systemsif you want to do missions in low sec you take an agent at least a few jumps into low sec no one with an iq above 10 takes a combat mission into low sec from a high sec border agent it is just suicidal with no gain
enable them please i want to be able to launch a bomb near a gate to destroy this cute blobim seriousfrom a faction warfare point of view this makes sense to me one of the main complaints from all sides are the blobs huge number of ships from both sides attack each other constantly lots of people dont like it but not all the timelots of people would like to avoid the blobs of course but it doesnt work all the time using bombs would level the play field in this area how if the bombs are enabled in low sec then it would be sure that blobs would still form up but it would influence them to be either smaller or big fleets would form up rarely this time theres also the fact that logi ships would appear more often i believefor those of you who dont know you can still get away from a bombs radius if your fast enough you can also withstand a bombs damage if you got enough hp usually cruisers and up so you have a couple of choice with this if you want to survive a bomb either jump or warp awaystargates  if you hit a stargate then you get hit by the guns and you get a gcc disable gcc when the bomb hits the gate but not neutral ships of coursewell no change here except that when a bomb hits a gate then you wont get a gccunless it hits a ship like low sec rules applies heream i madprobably lol
how about nolow sec outside of fw is mostly solosmall gang combat and bombs are just another option to  people up with little effortsince bombers are close to untouchable for most ships that work under sentry agroi see your point but blobbing is mostly a fw problem and should be sloved by changing fw somehow not by allowing very powerful aoe weapons in a environment where they would do more harm than good
perhaps sentry guns and security effects need to be looked at lord knows the low sec needs some serious helpi too would like to be able to field bombs in low sec but it presents a lot of problems that arent dealt with in the proposal and those would need to be tied to it inorder for me to support it
there is nothing wrong with sentrysyou might remove them in 02 and 01 to make pvp more interesting in the deeper systems they actually promote small gangsolo stuffsince you need a ship that can be tackeled without bubbles to fight at gatesthe problem is that you can kill any solo shipsmall groups that can fight under sentrys with 23 bombersor at least do enough damage to finish it up easy keep in mind that is with ships that field a cov ops cloak and have the full control over the engagementread unkillable if you not screw up and most ships that can solo under sentry fire cant do  against cov ops cloaked frigsif they are not totaly ed in a bc or bs
i like that 00 and low sec are different bombs  00liang
how about er noalso sentries are fine if you want to gatecamp in something like two dramiels two stealth bombers and a falcon go to 00
seems to me the gate guns would pop the sbs as soon as their bombs went off furthermore any amount of sbs needed to actually destroy large ships like that would be pretty obvious coming in even if they were all in bcs or bss they prove a problem to a gatecamp as you describe it it seems to me your problem with bringing bombs to low sec is that you think bombs are unbalanced and they are not simple as that
that and the fact that technically in low ssc your suppose to get protection from the gate guns if your attacked but did anyone did have protection  i mean why is there guns at the gate in the first place  when theres a bunch of bs at the gate and red your screwed if they catch youbombs on the other bomb better in a group would allow to retaliate on that bs gatecampexcept for a no as an answer please give more details as to why this is not supported maybe a ccp dev will look at the answer and actually do something  yes its a wet dream for me that ccp will actually listen to me or us and actually do something about a problem and find a fix to it
the gate guns would kill the bomber after the bomb explodes just killing the ship for launching the bomb would be stupid i could launch it into free space just to show my friends how it looks so if i dont hit the gate guns wouldnt have anything to say and if sentries only fire after my bomb hit i am mostlikely warped out already and sit cloaked on my safespot together with my other bomber friends and enjoy the tears in localthough i have to say no aswell bombs are a 00 tool
maybe a change to the gcc would apply here then once you launch a bomb and let say you hit a neutral i would assume your already cloaked back and in warp somewhere sousually when you attack someone with a bomb the reaction is when the bomb hits rightthus giving time to cloak andor warp out  so when you attack someone at a gate in low sec or high sec you immediately have a warning because the gate guns knows who your hitting right missile or turret  why the hell is it different with bombs  a simple change to this mechanic and when you launch a bomb or when a pirate launch a bomb the guns lock you downif they do you cant cloak make sure you have time to warp out because you will die since a sb is really weak in hpit would make sense since the gate guns knows who your targeting if not it should know that would put some balance to this idea you still could get away but not cloaked that way the gate guns and your survived victim could attack you back
just curious  have you ever worked with bombs so fara normal bombing run look like this warp in align towards the target and the warp out spot decloak drop bomb hit warpunlike missiles you dont have to be on the grid fo the explosionso how would the sentries know that my bomb will hit and how would they stop me from insta warp

i find kinda annoying that when i enter to planet view mode i cant switch between planets colonised by me id love to see some kind of maybe drop down menu with list of colonised planets so i could switch without leaving planetary view mode of course there have to be a mechanism that wont allow you to switch to planets out of your command range located maybe above buildscan buttons where current planet name isanother thing that i would like to see much more automatised is surveying for materials it would be cool if one could shiftclick same type of extractor select few of them and choose same deposit range its boring clicking like 5 times same buttons to get same effect
to change view from planet to planet yes that would be cool but admit it you click exit then you go back to your planet tab and you choose another planetfor your second idea now this i like a lot automated commands i would also add the addition of another feature that would survey and choose your select time 5h or 23h for example automatically without any action from mesupported simple yet very useful
as everyone who competes in mediumlarge fleet warfare is aware lag and node deaths cripple these type of fights most of the time currently one solution ccp has implemented is node reinforcement where you can petition for a node reinforcement 24 hours in advance and they will reinforce the system for you and hopefully it will help to take the stress off the serverthis works up to a point when for example when you have a starcase structure coming out of reinforced status and you want to attackdefend it plus expect a response from the other side however it does not account for the many other suituations when you do not know when or where the fight is going to occur so for this what i propose is simply a common sense resolution instead of having to petition 24 hours in advance for ccp assistance in making the game work as intended have automatic node reinforcement using computer data such as pilots in system ship types grid load etc to dynamically judge when it is neccesary for extra relif on the server note this would only apply to 00lowsec and not high sec as large battles hardly ever occur therealso it should be pointed out that will not completely solve lag from what i hear there are other issues serverclient side issues that need to be resolved before we can celebrate the lagmonster being defeatedto make this issue work we need some feedback from smart techy minded guys on how viable this proposal is and how it could possibly be accomplished so please if you can add anything relating to it go ahead as i personally am no good in that areacombating the lag monster should absolutely be ccps number 1 priority right now before adding any new content to the game people are unsubscribing to the game or going inactive because the type of game they want to play is not fun and in a lot of cases not even playable ccp i ask you to think of all the free pr amd marketing you would get from players waxing lyrical of the fleet combat in eve right now the only comments you are getting from those people is dont play eve it must be fixedi hope this post is a small seed that can grow into something much biggergo
supporting my own topic smug
nodes can only be reinforced at downtime to reinforce it automatically would mean locking all the characters who are in the system shutting down the node moving it to a more powerful node rebooting the system and hope nobody petitions because the other side was able to log back in first and then repeat every time that large fleet jumps through a gatealternatively the core code could get a rewrite making it multithread capable but to do so would slow down everything else in eve thats not a large fleet fight
from my understanding though somewhat technically limited i believe the only chance of eliminating lag would be to code an entirely new client as well as the server end software that supports the clienti doubt this will ever happenedit to add the obvious even if you eliminated lag now soon more ppl would be involved in standard fights which would reset the bar and in the end we would still have lag
too latetheyre already working on itread the latest hamsterpowered devblog and comments

omg run people its the spelling police hehe no but realy thats the right ideal but they have better in 00 already dont they i mean dont the pirate fractions have level 5s sorry i have never ran missions for them been to 00 to mine and run plexs but never to mission for the fractions thereand if they dont ask ccp to add them in at least the pirate fraction ships there are worth something
no pirate missions are only level 14
no pirate missions are only level 14wow that sucks i realy did not know that yes they should add level 5s to pirat fractions yet one more thing ccp could have spent time doing to make some place other then high sec look more appeling i keep saying buff low sec stop frelling over high sec but the same gos with 00 too
suggestion make a corp get some pilots who have some balls go into low sec with two fleets a mission fleet and a pvp fleet have capitals on the standby in case of capital hot drop if you do this low sec mission running is a ok
universally hated nope i dont hate it must not be universal also i live part time in a wormhole so its not like i dont use it the 2 seconds between scans wont kill you and getting 10 updates a second by spamming the button is useless
the timer massively reduces the stress put on servers by a fleet of 50 spamming the dscan button in a way that doesnt negatively affect anybody but whiny douchebags heres a solution so you dont have to tire out your poor index finger click the button once then press and hold enternot supported
which is why you linked it right btw i see lots of support on this thread too
yes becouse what we all need is better faster scaning right
after having read your move level 5s to high sec thread and given your response in this thread im going to hazard a guess that you have no idea what the op is about
dont you know the blob is there for pve players to make pvp as unenjoyable for pvp players as it is for pve that are forced into pvp to get to better and newer pve contentwithout this ablitys you would be left with just the hardcore pvp players like yourself im guessing but that would end up giving ccp a game they cant afford to keep onlineedit its ccps basic htfu for everyone but everyone dislikes it the same and so pvp players stay away from massive blobs of pve players making everything work out right some how
yes pleaseand its worse if you use nonlatin alphabets to boot
ya funny as it is with the graphics updates and all i have been forced into geting a new pc finaly and now i got an alienware and flatscreen runing in the standered 1680x1050 native i to have to get a magnifing glass to read even print lmao wtf i would not think this would be a hard fixhell ripoff windows fonts everyone alse and there brother dos so you dont even have to do all the programing yourselfs
i hope also that a csm member will help us i use a lcd with 32 zoll and iam only 15 meters away its real hard to read the overwiev please we need bigger fonts
i dont think there is a single csm that would be against improving the fontas a csm candidate the font was the first thing on my mind it is not a complex fix and it causes issues with many people it is a major issue since it can cause physical pain i suffered from eye strain myself to to the crappy font and the inablity to change it it took me a while to figure out that eve was the problem i am able to compensate for it by not wearing my glasses strange but true of course that means i cant really see a lot of text very well and it brings up other issues within eve then there is the added bonus of free aa and bloom without having to take the hit to the graphics cardthe eve font as good a s a poke in the eye
ingaddressbookraise the damn issue i see nothing with as much support in assembly hall and there is the issue with not letting them get away with removing features people like and use while adding crap no one gives a  about let the paying customer be heardplease do not go around the profanity filter  adida
you couldnt have lost all credibility in much less words gj
i could not have worded it in a better way thank you for that siri have used a grand total of seven words in statements of questionable seriousness to denounce ankh during the csm meetings i was honestly going to make the effort but i lost count in the 200s but ankh has used entire paragraphs at a time on more than a dozen occasions to denounce not only the entire csm but also teadaze who probably put more honest time into this than the rest of us pooled together baseless criticism an unwillingness to accommodate and cooperate in order to aid improvement repeated statements of paranoia an tinfoil hattery now you tell me who is throwing a fit against whom and with what purpose serious business i mean super serious business i mean stop using such difficult words in an attempt to justify your crusade for the defense of ankh
and when dierdra feels that he should reprimand me in a personal conversation for those seven words in a way that leaves me wondering whether he actually feels that way and should be ridiculed for it or whether he somehow got the idea that he has the right to police the meetings at his own judgment and should be ridiculed for thatif you expect me to take internet politics super serious at all times and to let stupid  happen because i need to wear silk gloves all the time then im very glad you didnt shame me by voting on me
itt radical feminism
hello dograzor i think you raise an important set of talking points whatever side of the issue one may come down on the details of balancing piracy and antipiracy are complex and i think the topic deserves its own discussion it is something i plan to post for discussion in jita park i hope youll be happy to discuss it there where we can give it the full and focused attention it deserves if you want to start the discussion up in a separate thread by all means do so if possible i would like to sidestep the usual trolls and instead brainstorm ways to make life in low sec better for everyone pirates and nonpirates alike i would first like to finish up this issue of professional expectations for the csm there is still alot of work to do here delilahfriendsofevewordpresscom
the problem is of course that you are a usual trollyoure also a committed liar as pointed out to you pirates are already at a severe disadvantage in lowsec and a massive one in highsec and yet instead of your real agenda nerfing pirates you pretend that youre really interested in improving eve for everybody or balancing the game between pirates and antipirates or some such nonsense if you wanted it balanced then thered be a 50 chance that gate guns would fire on outlaws or those with a high sec status and a 50 chance that concord would gank pirates or their targets and a 50 chance that pirates wouldnt give out universal kill rights when theyre red flashy and instead those with 501 sec status would go flashy andbut youre not honest youre just looking for a back door method to nerf pirates and trying to distort your intentions dishonestly you want to find a way to make life in lowsec better except what you really mean is neuter pirates so that people can be ever safer in lowsec because you simply dont understand the game of eve and you want even more places where you can carebear and now lowsec too has to be extremely hostile to pirates so that you can run your lvl 5s there or whatever youre just part of the church of victim youve adopted a narrative of powerlessness its the mean pirates its the mean 00 pilots its the mean pvpers its the mean people who dont like ank whoever youre powerless and cant learn to deal with the game with the tools the game already has given you you need even more protection and youre prepared to cry about it
oh how i love this poor ank props people of csmthe fact that mynxee got chair is so immensely awesome or ank would be abusing her position to end this dreadful antiankbias
the reason i said ank winning isnt all that bad emerges threads like this it has ank showing her natural paranoia along with a decreasing patience threshold of her fellow csm members also the standard issue fanboigurl making blanket statements about sexism and the like which with out a doubt will increase in fervor and tenor as ank continues to think that people having different opinions means that a conspiracy is in action against her this is going to make some great forum 
let me give you there answer so you dont have to wait for it ccp it was a bug to begin with sorry it just takes us x amount of years to fix are bugs now htfuthere that should about cover it at least in spirt

im glad you like the idea the plexes themselves do not limit the actual number of ships that can go in but they do limit the types of hulls that can go in this can very helpful for breaking up blobs because if there is a large bs blob you can simply take medium or minor plexes the side that has fewer pilots can still work toward occupancy by trying to get equal numbers for 1 of 4 different plex sizes they go something like destroyerfaction frig and down for minors cruiser and down for medium bc and down for major and finally open plexes allow anything so even if you only have 10 active pilots and the other side has 20 you may still be able to put everyone in cruisers and hold a medium plex before the other side can get everyone in cruisers your ability to coordinate your attacks becomes more important than just blobbing around this would be an important addition to eve pvp as a whole as currently every pvp mechanic in eve lacks any real strategic component other than form blob and attack
your suggestion still changes nothing plex timer  hide and seek pvpers get bored chasing afk plexing alts and move on to do something else afk plexing alt returns and caps plexif one side wants fight  nothing happens fw is fail fw is for losersif both sides want fight  something happens plexes rule awesome fights love all aroundthere is no substantial figure of merit that can be implemented that will change thisassume one side wants to win occupancy war or perhaps make some isk off of lps for plexes another suggested proposal  not get into fights if figure of merit is  of kills in plex  never enter plex pvper boredif figure of merit is timer  bail do something else and return when pvp threat leaves pvper boredif figure of merit is killing all npcs  bail do something else and return when pvp threat leaves pvper boredetc

i support this
supported in fact i would much rather see one expansion dedicated entirely to fixing old content than to introducing new
firstly didnt star trek online epic failstill born birthand wasnt that just because it was wow in space with less contentok its a space mmo but its a carnival ride style mmo from what i read which is why they have to have so much content once youve been round all the rides it gets boring and you leaveeve is different because its a sandbox thats what we need to focus on we dont need new features and new content we need fixs for current flaws as the content is created mostly by the playersthose that are crying that the mission running is boring well done it is and you know what more missions walking in stations etc wont solve thatpersonally i dont like pi its dull and only surves to remove npc seeded items by seeding new npc items but as a concept it standsgiving the userbase tools to play with rather than rides to go onthe only problem is alot of the current tools are somewhat faulty
1fixing current things is always a good idea id be quite happy if ccp kept the 2 releases per year schedule but committed to having at least one of those releases dedicated to improvingfixingreworking existing content rather than adding new stuff
supported as a relatively new player its more noticeable for me not in the big stuff like faction warfare but also in the user interface there are lots of tiny things that could be fixed very quickly and easily to make the game easier to understand and faster to use for example letting skills that have prerequisites be placed in the queue after the prerequisite many new players coming into the game are overwhelmed by the complex interface while a complex interface is needed for a complex game much of the interface seems simply overcomplicated and abounds with cryptic icons tiny text and unintuitive behavior the overview settings are a prime example of whats wrong with eves ui in my opinion a dedicated ui team could fix many of these issues rather quickly
the ui has been a sticking point with me for the 3 years ive been playing this game ive never understood why the developers wont just socket the information my made up term for providing naked information to the client and let the talented modders in our community develop beautiful uis for them a la wow why cant i hide all that ty solar system text in top left when im fighting and then spring it up associated with the map when i want to move again why cant i modify the overview completely why does it have to be a list why cant it be tags associated with ships in space so all the huginns on the battlefield have a nice little huginn label next to them or whateverlet the community do the work itd save you money and youd probably get a nicer product in the end come on ccpccp controls ui balance issues by controlling what information is provided to the client to be honest it probably requires an engine rewrite of some sort but its probably about time that  happened anywaytldr ccp the ui is and has always been garbage fix please
realy want to see ccp develop faction warfare

i have been calling for this change for years and have always been ignoredi suggest we en mass write petitions and spam forums until ccp get tired and change blastersas an avid blaster pilot i suggest more range over more dps i dont care about this nonsense that blasters will encroach on autocannons because lasers outdamage and outreach all guns anyway ridiculous stupid and time for this to changeif this thread is forgotten i will simply create another one as im tired of this bull
you should not have a lot of issues in a blaster fitted ibis if you want more range you can always fly another race or use another weapon
supported though i doubt ccp will do anything about the lopsided turret balance pretty much have given up on hybrids ever being fixed and am now training for lasers
the main issue we have with these ships is that nobody can really agree on a role for themwhen they were originally released they functioned as more of a heavy assault battlecruiser when compared to the tier 1 bcs this role more or less dried up when the tier 2 bcs were releasedt2 bcs and t2 bss are pretty much the only ship classes in the game where people who can fly the t2 variant still fly the t1 ship in preference for one reason or another either they need to see a price cut via reducing production cost or they need to be bumped up to a level of usefulness similar to the jump between cruiserhacits pretty much that simple either give them better dps or give them a viable role in boosting without either of those theyre just a slow expensive bc with little or no benefit over a ship that requires a a lot less investment in skills and isk to fly

i just want my addressbook folders backany chance the csm could raise the issues that have already been highlighted before pipedreaming some other stuffyou know in accordance with your role like we were expected to vote foranything stored server side has to be transmitted to client side pro tip that costs
i appreciate your interest in the csm process but nothing is keeping you from writing your own proposal to fix what you think needs fixing meanwhile i would like to ask you to stay ontopic and take the discussion as to what we are supposed to do in your opinion elsewhere as a pro space councillor you can be sure that i have considered the ups and downs of the proposal and infact already have included this in the first post had you taken the time to actually read through the topic athand you would be aware of this
or just use the existing proposal
yes steam cloud is an awesome feature something similar for eve would be perfect and make life so much easier
i just read your reply too and i have no idea what as a pro space councillor you can be sure that i have considered the ups and downs of the proposal and infact already have included this in the first post had you taken the time to actually read through the topic athand you would be aware of this is even referring toi read your topic i read lots of topics since theres already a topic for the addressbooks issue yet you think i should create one its clear youre not refering to that and since its in 8 pages of mostly supports and still nothing from the csm how many times would you suggest we raise it while csm members just sit around raising well things like this one increasing network traffic database access yes i can see the benefits kind of as in not really but anyway id like to end this message on the not even veiled charge that you havent read anything i put
the voices in my head told me to vote yes i would however like this to be optional no its not paranoia its more of a troubleshooting idea i could upload my local settings then turn off the upload feature and muck about with my settings to my hearts content knowing that i can always simply reimport the settings from the server if i screw them up so badly the game becomes unplayable while remaining functionaledit you could even add a button the login screen import server side settings
sure why notedit  forgot to click the support box 
yes its always the missioner that has the blob as backup and never the ninja salvager explain why those pve players gate camp busy low sec systems like amamake or hagilur surely they would pick a less busy system to operate in when the pvp players could counterblob lmfao ive actually found a way to have your quotes actually make more sense which isnt saying much to begin with rdy switch pve player with pvp player and vice versa whenever it comes up try it
good idea not sure if its really an incentive for small gang warfare though but its a good idea will add more dynamics and fun to the game which ccp is completely against so it probably wont get passed
supported this should be what logistic is about range not power atm its useless 
yeah id buy a t3 for doing logistics but the bonuses are far far too weak to justify it medium reps even bonused at short range  wtfm8liang
is there another thrread that discusses this or anyway pi takes up way too much tme and not enough rewardthis needs to be a bit better balanced
i totally agree with everything you pointed out and in such a great detail without a wall of text thumbs up
luckily nobodys forced to do it oo
truebut i still go for this it is an interesting ideait does limit you to only 5 hulks though
and wi lacks titans and jump bridges
for instance move the modify and cancel trade options away from each other and while youre at it make it so that the default for canceling trades requires your authorization are you sure you want to theres nothing quite so frustrating as misclicking on cancel instead of modify and having your order instantly removed from the market and then having to pay to relist it also for titans the jump and bridge to commands should be moved for jump bridges unanchor and jumpfix these bits of crappy uips suggest more in the thread and ill update the op
supported in principle though i can see there being serious practical problems
the player have created the trade hubs not ccpso now you want ccp to change the environment that created those trade routes for your convenienceno
ccp has historically intervened with trade hubs pretty frequently yulai was destroyed with malice aforethought by changes to the gates leading in and out  it was before i was playing but basically my understanding is that ccp took a meat cleaver to every important route in highsec specifically to make yulai stop breaking their servers jita took its place at which point ccp ripped everything of value out of jita  agents belts even a stargate this would hardly be a new thing besides its lowsec making shorter lowsec routes between hubs is not going to destroy the hubs frankly most players wont notice 90 of the effect of this change will be to destroy people with bad autopilot settings still it should happen
yeah im not talking about adding 10 more jumps between every trade hub except maybe jitaamarr im talking about adding 23 and changing gates around to save 12 jumps from current by going through a lowsec or three for jitadodixie that would be a 46 jump improvement for lowsec over hisec which is enough for people to actually decide its worth the riskone other thing if the jitaamarr pipe is significantly lengthened add at least 4 jumps then well need a hisec route from gallente to amarr space or well be looking at 20 jumps when most others will only have 15
i agree the distance between enemy capital systems should be increased with a low secsmuggler short cutthe distance between allies should be decreased even by highsecoursulaert increased jita and consequently dodixieoursulaert decreased hekrensjita  stays same  domainoursulaert  longish high sec route needed domain low sec short cut needed edited in consideration of ihcn comment below it would probably be best for the high sec link between enemy factions go via the less antagonistic parties so gallente  caldari goes via minmataramarr  minmatar via gallente
to me it is really irritating that we are unable to post killboard linksi honestly do not understand why they are not allowed even the crime  punishment subforum states warn others of the latest scam hire a mercenary to seek revenge or brag about your killsso what would unblocking killboard links do1 posters on caod would actually be able to link the killboard about the battle they are describing2 you can actually post links to your kills when trying to brag about them on the crime  punishment section3 stops people getting very irritated when their link is removed so yeah thumbs up if you agree with unblocking killboard links in the eveo forums
il agree but i think they do this because its never 100 trustworthy

that and when he said or brag about your kills he didnt write exactly

as a wormhole resident i was distinctly displeased to discover that pos modules and towers can only be produced in npc stations and nullsec outposts accordingly i propose that pos modules and structures be added to either one or more ship assembly arrays or the component assembly arrayspros wormhole residents and nullsec corps without the resources for an outpost can participate in planetary interaction fullycons uhnot seeing any
the only problem i can think of is capacity limits on the arrays but thats actually skirted nicely  capital ship assembly arraysthe biggest pos structure take 489km3 of mats and an equipment array holds 500k it does tie ccps hands if they ever want to rebalance material reqs but the current numbers work and it does make sense so yeah supported   for those of you who havent tried the fact that the csaa is 850km3 is irrelevant an array can hold any amount of stuff from delivered jobs you just have to empty them before it lets you put anything new inside
works for me
it is logical supported
aaargh drove me nuts the other day when i was trying to find out which assembly array to chuck the materials into when we found out the answer was none of them sucks to be you i was quite stunned accordingly supported
equipment array surecsaa in a wormhole no way in edit while i do not partake in wormhole stuff i see no reason this shouldnt be brought into the game
just to clarify he was speaking with regards to the material requirements to produce a csaa in a wormhole not the ability to anchor a csaa in one
i think its pretty likely that this will cause a significant amount of lag in major battles and thus ccp will refuse to do it however its worth asking for because i could well be wrong
i would like this
obvious troll tq is clearly the test server
so here i was doing worlds collide with my corpies and somebody enters my mission okay i know this is allowed so no problem here however he proceeds to loot the quest item hes already looted my wrecks so hes red to me im not going to shoot him over scrap metal not only does he steal the item i need to turn in the mission but he even had the nerve to offer to sell it to us we petitioned a gm about this and this is allowed even though its clearly a griefing mechanici understand eve is a sandbox but other players shouldnt be allowed to urinate in it can we lock cargo containers containing mission items so that only the players owning the mission or players in their fleet can loot them maybe they can be small secure containers so it woulndt take much new coding to implement
10 million isk says a griefer corp decs vaginas corp
yeah i do this when i bust someones mission incredibly hilarious that he stole your item after already being flashy i also try to contract the corpses back to people i pod liang
i suggest you quit eve and start playing a game you actually enjoy
it would make for a rather interesting social study to see why i and so many like me hate people who concede to a fight before it even begins people who are scared to death of challenging themselves against other people and why i enjoy so much of doing rotten things to these peoplecome one science give us an answerbtw you are not going to get anywhere with this request
actually the answer is pretty simple you dont do it in real life because you actually care about the potential consequences arrest imprisonment lawsuits etc but in a pixel world even eve there are no permanent consequences worst case you just start a new characteraccounttldr because you canalso not supporting the op if he was already flashy red and you and your group didnt blast the crap out of him thats your own fault
to decline a trap is not conceding a fight it is good strategy you hate them because theyve seen through your transparency and beaten your gambiti suggest about sacrifice declined in chess
tldr  refining arrays seem out of scope for the endgame after all these years and havent been touched ever since introduced introduce new arrays or rather revise existing ones taking character skills into account fit with a reasonable storage capacity and change the way they work to the way reactors work maybe even with new structures for inputoutput streaming theyre old no development no advancement like other technologies hell we even have technology level iii hulls and system available for the general public now you would think that at least outer ring excavations or some caldari nerd corp pun intended would have done some research on thistheyre relatively inexpensive thoughthey take forver to anchor online and to unanchor whythey use up most of your towers cpu and powergridthey have a flat yield percentage 35 or 75 for mineral ore 100 for ice but whyno skills affect the yieldthey can only be anchored in null or low security systems so pointless but they will only really be anchored when you have no other means to refine ore and thats in a galaxy far far awaytheir capacity is like a humvee with a 10 litres gas tank or 3 us gallons i believe which was plenty though when cars used only like 1 litre on 100 kilometres or mining vessels extracted only 20000m3 a dayi can keep a medium intensive busy with a mining frigate that is 20000mUFFFD every 90 minutes the big one refines eight times as much in twice the time thats four frigatesone intensive array cannot even cope with a small gang of three people dont mention you actually have more than that or it will shut down and refuse to come online because of fearthey can only ever refine one type of item even if its an ore subtype eg can refine veldspar or dense veldspar but not both at a timei can see several improvements that could be made and should be consideredintroduce a skill that rises the mineral yield requiring some annoying skill at 5 like anchoring and refinery efficiency just like starbase defense managementmake it work like a reactor instead using input and output structures to make this feasible the cpu requirement would need to be reduced in my opinion if both input and output structure would require 500tf each like silos do toning it down from 4000tf to 3000tf may be a good call which makes it on par with the complex reactor array overall using 4000tf againalso the input structure would need to hold enough ore to make this actually be useful and an improvement to begin with the big intensive holds 200000mUFFFD for 180 minutes thats about 1111mUFFFDmin refined but i would rather target something in the 500k area reactions can easily run for weeks with less tf and mwthe output structure would need to be able to hold different types of items ie minerals in which regard the silos are poorly designed imho since they can only hold one type at a time pi does a good job herei could also see this work like the scienceindustry interface using special structures or even corporate hangar arrays as input andor output like you do with copying blueprints using corporate hangars would make the need of new structures obsolete and provide a satisfying capacity then you can dedicate one division purely as refining input and remove the one type of item only barriernow i dont consider those numbers imbalanced or over the top control towers lost signifant amounts of importance and only remain as invaluable tools in deep space and prerequisite for supercapital productionwhere you are really dependent on a control tower its most likely an untertakement of a corporation and not a solo project three people can easily mine 200000mUFFFD in half an hour or less and thats already 180 minutes worth of refining time 900 minutes even in a medium intensiveshare your thoughts 
hello fellow playersone thing i have noticed about the npe new player experience is that you need the industry skill to start manufacturing for two of the story arcs yet they dont give it to you nor the skillbook i propose that all new players should start with this skill at level 1 in much the same way as the mining skill is done this would make the whole npe a lot less of a headache buny
i suggest they drop the learning skills and go back to a character creation that actually meant something besides a pretty picture
drop learning but character should matter except picture
newbies should be able to complete the tutorial without reference to things outside of the tutorial whether that means putting a skill book drop into the tutorial putting a go to the market and buy the skill book segment into the tutorial or just creating characters with the skill i dont care i suggest that youre goddamned crazy the old system of putting the most important decision youll ever make into the hands of the least knowledgeable folks in eve was madness and learning skills are fine if you dont go all ocd about them
ok
learning skills dont add anything are stupid and should be removedcharacter creation shouldnt matter only favours alts if it does matter since rookies cant know what is handy to havethat is best solution since rookies often dont know how to get skill books would immediatly fix that
i guess i should clarify im not talking about attribute gains those should remain as they are now with the remapping that was a really good move on ccps part and im not even specifically talking about 800 k sp worth of skills either although i liked that better then the double speed but as it stands now choosing this or that is entirely pointless except for the portrait it takes away a huge part of the game for many people for instance i am often perfectly happy playing around with character generators for hours simply because its fun perhaps takes isnt the right word but it leaves an area of the game that could be huge undeveloped and sadim not sure why they are unwilling to bonus actual gameplay assuming they spent the time to balance ita farfetched assumption i know then choosing the various careers and race would have actual impact nothing large stuff like 2 more structure here 2 more speed there or 2 faster research times for industry chars stuff like that maybe maybe not but i just kind of want to have character creation mean something not the attributes though that was ing stupidthat said its probably something theyll have to go into with incarna and im perfectly happy to wait and see what happens
i agree free industry for everybody
im not talking about options during character creation or learning skills but just this proposal if you dont like my proposal be sure to tell me so however dont derail this proposal with other unassociated ideasand as always be sure to check the support option if you agree with it  buny
fair enough
even for a newbie this is a very good skill to have at least to level 1 its also a x1 time multiplier this one is very quick to learnnot that long either besides its a requirement for production efficiency which in my opinion even a pvper should get everyone knows that producing is cheaper and even a pvper shouldcould produce ammo pvper use a lotquit being lazy and train itnot supported
the point flying above  333 0  you llll  
agreed for obvious reasons
i disagree with all of this yes lets take away the learning skills and let those who spend millions of sp in them and months of game time just be out of luck so they quit the game lets also give new players a skill they can get day one anyway this is whole thread is basicly asking for a new system that gives the players asking for it the long side of the stick many players get screwed when they switched to the remap system just to help the newest of players i for one ended up throwing a toon that was about 1 12 months old with all level 5 implants right in the trash as it was a max learning toon and with new players getting a remap i was able to start over and pass up my orginal max sp toon purely due to second remap for all new toons thanks ccp you really helped me throw a good 60 in the trashnow we got people wanting to get rid of a system that people have invest in they spent the time to work on long term goals instead of short term goals now that the are seeing the pay off of the patiance lets take the reward away who cares if they already got stuck in only a destroyer for 6 monthsthe current system already gives new players far more sp then it use to before remaps and that makes the  gap smaller then ever plus a 2x multiplier that can be used on the learning skills right off the bat makes that gap even bigger just leave it alone and stop the crying over nothingif you want to do industry just train day 1 and get your industrial ship just like missionpvp people do for thier destroyers also the industrial ships are given out just like the destroyers if you do the tutorial agents
you fail at reading comprehension like no person i have ever seen before
i think your original premise that he read any of the previous posts may be flawedsupport for having it be added a tutorial unto itself buying the skill book i cant tell you how many times i have seen that question in the help channel
support the principle i think it would be better to give the skillbook as the reward for a previous mission in the industry tutorial rather as a free start skill

how about also opening up the ingame chat channels to irc
no to the chat channels but yes to the forwarding of ingame maili know it would be easier to send and receive the ingame mail if for example i could access the games mail system on my cell phone in something other than the cumbersome evegate site cumbersome on a mobile device at least
ccp has already responded with a rather simple no to this idea
then wed see nothing but stealth bomber blobs replacing afcruiser blobs with bomber blobs isnt a good trade however if you insist firing a bomb should result in instant gcc it need not even explode sentry guns should also wtfbbq any bombs within their range before detonation it might be kinda sorta balanced then
yes i know how they work thats the point with this change i think its fair to say that bombs should need a target to shootyou need to lock them i mean that way you would get the warning when you get that warning gate guns can insta lockwhich means no more cloak that should give the fair advantage for people to target the sb and shoot itor just try to kill itwell a chance to get destroyed
how about no
lowsec is unique in the part where you need a heavier ship which can get tackled normally without bubblesetc to do anything under sentrieshint hint if you make it so you can kill stuff on gates with small very slippery ships then you need to add bubbles to balance it out and then youve just made lowsec into a worse version of npc 00
i see no problems with bombs in low sec they take up a large amount of cargo space 2 or 3 bombs in a single bomber are more expensive than most ammunition and bombers will not be able to stand up to sentry gun aggro theres no bubbles allowed in low sec to keep ships in place so theres a chance that fast ships can warp offif smartbomb battleships can be used next to gates why not bombs
because you can catch the smartbomb bs and it can do next to nothing vs ships that are bigger than frigs or haulers
pretty much at this point
theres four combat recons twocurse rook are effective and commonly used  they combine strong ew with a capable method of dealing dps two are crap because theyre basically the same as the force recon but without the covops cloak id like to see the huginn and lachesis be as good as the curse and the rook five weapons with 12 bonuses seems fairly reasonable id probably give the lach 5 launchers and a missile damage or thermal damage if you want to perpetuate that rather odd system bonus in place of the hybrid bonus and then id give the huginn 5 turrets and 5 web strength in place of the missile bonus gives the gallente another nonterrible missile ship on top of just the bomberand then boost the eris similarly to make it 3 total and turns two of the leastused t2 cruisers into popular capable ships it also makes the forcecombat line nice and bright  force recons do cloaky stuff and bad damage combat recons are significantly more powerful ships in toetotoe fights but with no subtlety potential
first the lach is not useless used properly it is in fact an absolutely brutal ship and in my opinion a vital component to hac gangs the huginn on the other hand seems pretty sadheres the problem with giving the lach five launchers smart pilots dont fit sensor damps on their lachesis they fit a disruptor a scrambler and an mwd the remainder of their mid and rig slots go to a shield tank giving you 44k ehp minimum with 40 m3 of drones and five bonused launchers the lach will outdps the rook have a shield tank better than that of most hacs be able to shut off mwds at 18km and be able to warp disrupt at 60km maybe this is balanced compared to the rook but i frankly think itd be overpowered
i never said the lach is useless  i own one and i fly it occasionally thing is the only times i fly it are times when im trying to save money compared to an arazu its 30 mil or so cheaper because the bpos produce enough to supply demand unlike with arazus where more expensive invention is required to feed the higher demand compare that to a rook or a curse  you dont save money with those in fact the curse is reliably more valuable than the pilgrim thats because theres demand for them in their own right not just as cheaper versions of other better ships i want the other two combat recons to be in the same place and yes theres a chance that my lach numbers are too strong i mean them as a basis of discussion not as a this is balanced you can implement it tomorrow change but they dont seem crazy sure it has more ehp than a rook but its ew is going to be a lot weaker still thats something that can be figured out in balancing  use my numbers or ones like them as a first draft and go from there
i petitioned this once so as a gallentean missile user this gets my automatic support
actually the typical reason ive seen a lach used or at least the reason i use it is that it is considerably more survivable in a hilowsec environment than an arazu that extra midslot really makes a huge difference in terms of tanking ability and general flexibility i am therefore much more comfortable putting pimp faction points on it i would suggest that giving the huginn an extra mid would go a long way towards balancing it as well still split weapons systems are generally a pain so i wouldnt be opposed to perhaps giving the lach a boost in that regard
why not use the planets tab under science and industry you can double click on any of your planets to jump straight to planet viewtotally agree on the second part  supported
automated rescanning will never happen  look at the design of this system its pure effort  reward the guy in a mental institution for ocd gets to mine 3x as much as you because he runs 30minute timers 237 and the sane person has to make do with 23h timers if it autorepeated theyd never need anything but 30m timers now personally i wish it worked more like moon miningsurely the first time that phrase has ever been uttered but it doesnt and it wont dont bother hoping for it
im aware of that it is possible to quite easy switch from planet to planet view by using industry tabs but it would be easier to just switch without leaving the current planet going to industry tab and choosing next planet thats why i called it an improvement nothing big autorepeated extraction process is imo not a good idea why there would be no point in different deposit ranges if you can have so much minerals extracted with 5min cycle and make it autorepeat why anyone would ever use the 30min cycleand to be more specific on my second idea because i suck at english grammar it could be similar to multiunit production in incoming starcraft 2 where you can select few same buildings click unit production and all selected buildings will start to produce chosen unitso i think it would be pretty cool if you could just shiftselect multiple extractors of same type and choose extraction cycle for selected extractors then

no there would be no more hide and seek plexing every time you entered a plex your presence will be announced to everyone in all the militias there would be a separate channel maybe 2 1 for each front like the current militia channel but it would only give broadcasts if i entered a minor plex in ammamake in my merlin it would broadcast something likeammamake minor amarrcearain frigateeveryone in fw would get this message you can call entering a plex whatever you want but it wont be hiding it will be the opposite it will be announcing where you are for the next 1020 minutes if anyone wants to come fightin the scenario above once you chase the first guy off you can close the plex all the while you will be announcing where you are for the next few minutes so if you are looking for good pvp that will be the way to do it if no one wants to pvp then maybe no one will come but i think thats unlikely if this announcement mechanic is implemented you will get company if you enter a plex this will make fw the best small gang pvp in eve
this would be very nice to see  for csm participants bringing this idea forward to the attention of ccp
supported but not for any lengthened expansion schedule to hell with expansion schedules entirely new features should be decided on and they should be released when theyre ready period if it takes two years to institute a cool change then it takes two years like blizzard always says itll be ready when its ready and in the meantime fix what dominion broke

already supported but the more i think about this the more important it seemsthis needs to be something that really does start to change the culture of the whole of ccp months after they broke the pirate epic arcs the gms are implying that it might be worth people hanging around these systems when there is no evidence ccp are even trying to fix theseit is also even more ridiculous considering they spawn heavily demanded items that were being balanced by the greater supply the pirate arcs createdobviously we can forget ever seeing any more pirate arcs as well despite promises they would be out soonwhen people in ccp promise to do something they should be held accountable whenever they do not since currently any player over 6 months knows nothing ccp say can be trusted which completely destroys ccps ability to communicate meaningfully with their playersthe crazy thing is most people showing their support in this thread care deeply about the game but are made to feel that their loyalty is going to be abused rather than rewarded
supported
hell even a release schedule of once a year would be enough if it means much higher quality with more features and more postlaunch supportalso this a hundred times
dont be a fool into thinking this will ever happen that is not an expansion also if there is no new content then there is no new subscripers those who have never played eve beforemy question is thisis it too much to ask for boththat is content and fixes
bumping this thread to first page
posting in a thread full of people refusing to use anything else but blasters and cn antimatter on their shipsmajority of blaster setups i know put out more dps than their acpulse counterparts and considering that you need to think about whole picture with warp scramblerswebs ability to field drones and optimal etcin fleet again youre supposed to fit railguns in your hybrid ships blasters are like are you like mentally challenged even with railguns gallente ships are generally better choice over caldari equivalentsits not excuse to boost all guns if some certain ships like deimos maybe could use some kind of role oomph even deimos is decent ship but ishtar able to field battleship class weapon systems in hac hull is just too lucrative over deimosbut alright its irc post just noticed p

supported
as usual people who are not supporting didnt even read topicwe dont discuss should they be removed or do you like thembut when they are removed would this solution be fine or not
signed sounds like a great idea
supported they dont add anything to the game but an extra slog and i know they put off new players especially when you get idiots telling them to buy the game and do nothing but sit in a station and train learning skills for the first couple weeks although to be fair thats more the idiots fault than the learning skills but still
seems like a reasonable way to remove a pointless mechanic
to be honest when i was a new player i had no issue with learning skills what so ever i did not know anyone playing the game and i didnt compare myself to others i thought the decision process between training a learning skill to the next level or something that would benefit me immediately was pretty interesting i cherish the first month in the game i thought it was great to explore the game in my own pace whether it i was ratting in low sec with a tristan or mining omber in a navitas i dont think the game gets more fun just because i can fly fancier stuff or make more iskhour to me it is all about setting up a goal and pursue that goal its the journey there thats fun sound cliche i know but its trueif a new player have friends who are prancing around with gigatrillions of isk and an attitude of lul im making 2b iskhour doing this and that in my superduper pwnmobile and this is what you have to do to become as awesome as i am of course new players will feel inadequateif your approach is that its all about getting the largest epeen in shortest possible time and you are constantly comparing yourself to those that have played the game for several years then i can see why learning skills is a problemrant
yes
then remove the attributes that the learning skills enhance too not supported
i seriously disagree with changing the learning skillslearning skills are an option not a requirement you can train anything fly anything and do anything in eve without them unlike say spaceship commandlearning skills are an option they are not requiredyes they provide an advantage to players who choose to train them so what using a 10km warp scrambler provides an advantage to a player who tries to tackle someone whos fit a warp core stabilizer none of those things are required to play the gameregardless of whether ccp actually wants to get rid of them and i dont think they should do anything its not broken this proposal is not worthy of anyones time in the csm or at ccpremovingchanging the learning skills is yet another example of modern society being so selfcentered they feel that they should be entitled to something because someone else has ithowever if ccp actually is going to do something about learning skills then they should just remove them and the bonuses they provide period then it can take even longer for everyone to train anything that will make the game a whole lot more fun dont you think
i do not agree with removing themthey are not a required skillall the time i spent learning learning skills what happens to thatwill i be reimbursed for the monthly subscription fee nothey are not a requirement  dont add more  dont get rid of anyif you chose not to skill them up  so you learn slower  big dealif you chose to skill them up  you are not skilling up in something else so maybe one day you can skill up fasteri do not support this change
yes support the idea lets stop talking bout it and do it already
why is there so much bitterness in this thread the idea is simply to allow you to reallocate the sp you put into learning elsewhere
why should you reallocate the sp if you trained the skills you got the benefit of having them period end of sentence if you didnt train them you didnt when you have already had the benefit of the skill why do you deserve additional benefits
because gewrixlera you spent a month learning guns while i spent a month learning logicat the end of the month if they just take it away  i have nothing and you have guns that is why i say leave them be  dont add more skill em up if u want or dont stop complaining about them taking a long time to skill up if you dont like it  then dont skill them
learning skills were never a good idea
most definitely supported im well on my way to finishing the learning grind to 54 at least and its been a trying experience to put it lightly id much rather see new players and accounts training at full speed excluding implant variables from the start than have them work learning and thus months of essentially nonprogressed idle time which puts off actual gameplay skillsreally hope this topic gets some attention it is very much worth changing for the continued growth and retention of the player base
excellent idea ccp already has the tech in place to give increased lp gain
i remember we had this feature before when i lost my drones once because i warped out and forgot my drones i could see them in another tab in my drone windowanyway its supported
this
i want them drones back please
supported losing drones to a dc is very irratating to say the least
to correct reconnect rangesupported  with conditions1 the option is available if the player warps away from the drones for any reason player must be within drone control range to reconnect2 during the reconnect term drones are still considered active thus more drones cannot be deployed unless the active drones are recovered to cargodronebay or abandoned current ship must have drone bandwidth to connect to drones or number of reconnected drones limited to available bandwidth3 due to signal decay the drones are effectively abandoned if they are not recovered within 15 minutes use standard aggro timer4 jumping systems or docking automatically abandons the drones5 it is not possible to reconnect to abandoned drones abandoned drones can be scooped to cargo or drone bay as per current methods still in addition abandoned drones can be collected by any player that encounters them disconnected drones cannot be scooped to cargo by a different player until abandoned6 npcs should continue to shoot drones  disconnects suck but your drones are still shooting them so response should be expected7 it would be nice to be able to warp to drones like warp to fleet member although this introduces interesting tactical implications of disconnected drones
i like this you dont abandon your fighters if your a carrier that dcs they will actually warp to your ewarp point and board with your carrier half the time it took me a couple of times when i thought one or two died to find it was back in my drone bay taking a napto the poster above me i think what would be better and what ccp would do is have you be able to reconnect inside drone range being able to send out 45 km with my rokh but able to reconnect and recall at 150 seems a bit broken
yes  you are correct  i will edit to correct that
what bugs me especially about this is that i have a really fast lan connection but for some reason itll blink off line an average of 12 times per 2 hours of play time now this is okay for games like fpss a little lag spike and thats all for this game it makes the whole program close and it is beyond frustating 35 mil of drones is the price tag thats not a lot of money for me but its the process of getting back in the seat that irritates me this should have been fixed a long time ago ill throw a couple of ideas that i havent thought of yet into the firetwo more modes for drone settingsswarm upon disconnection with operator drone will continue to attack targets stealth upon disconnection with operator drone will shutdown and go into cloak drone will uncloak after and set amount of time lets say 2 hours after which drone will start standard decay original operator will be able to see cloaked drones whereabouts upon warping back in

currently we have 3 major powerblocs in 00 nc sc and dcnow vs 20072005  2007  2010 i dont have anything on the sovereignty from 2005 but it made 2007 look bad in 5 years 00 has turned into blobby napsnc control all the north sc control all the south and dc control the drone regions sometimes referred to as the russians theres some independent alliances  powerblocs however they have a strong connection  standing to major alliances within the nc  sc so dont really get classed as independentthis wasnt what 00 was like several years ago these powerblocs if anything have increased to the point where life in 00 has been reduced to generic warfare south vs north  macro ratting  plexing  roamingthere simply isnt enough conflict and despite the changes made through dominion smaller alliances dont have a chance in 00 without branding themselves as petsnaps were made during the time when everyone was raging and wanted everyone else dead for reasons people cant remember i remember a time when razor were neutral to rawr and when pl  daisho fought over fountainstuff like this doesnt happen anymore simply because you arent attacking one alliance you are attacking all its pets its allies and its allies pets until eventually having 3000 in local is classed as skill and the only strategy is node crashing and super cap hotdropslooking at events over the past 5 years i have noticed ego and fear play a very important role in these napsi personally dont have a major solution in fixing this but i would strongly advise ccp  csm to have this as one of the major things to be looked at i understand certain csm are in 00 alliances and would hate to remove blob warfare but i am certain with a reduction in naps and increase in war 00 will become fun again and not limited to nap trains and roamstldr  00 is split into 3 power blocs and isnt fun fix it
cool story bro
emergent behaviour is emergent you dont have to like it but if forming powerblocks is what people in 00 want to do who are you to say that ccp should step in and tell people that theyre building the wrong kind of sandcastlesthe players have built their empires in player sovereignty 00 thats what its there for the nature of the space dictates the politics sov space is for mighty empires clashing with huge fleetsif you want rapidly changing splintered smallgang paradise space thats what npc 00 is for by all means ask ccp for more of that ill support you every step of the way or ask for more space like wspace or more space which is a combination of both a thousand or so systems with probable abandoned ministations that can be captured by a few dozen battleships only a few permanent gates that wont admit any hull bigger than a battlecruiser and lots of wormholes add good rats poor static resources no moons or agents delayed local and so forth plus some local unobtanium that makes the place worth visiting and you have the perfect recipe for space dominated by small fastmoving gangsbut your op is no different from missionbears who whine to make missions instanced because they dont like the way other people play sandbox get over it
nice spin but lets be real over the past few years independent wars have stopped it is simply sc vs nc vs pl  co and has stopped at this no other types of wars happennow that 00 is calm it is knwon that activity in 00 is limited to roams  macro ratting correct me if im wrong but wasnt the whole max mk ii war to end powerblocs for goodi know this is a sandbox i get that but look at what its become any alliance that wishes to invade now another has no chance as you will get 30k within different alliances joining to help in at first it will be fun and play but once a side is losing it will bring more people until it is eventually battle of the blobs a node crash being the third partyeverything within 40 jumps blue vs independent pvp  activity within 00you sure you picked the right type of gameplay
i agree that player null is quite boring but also agree with reply 1 players made it like this and this is apparently how most of they want to have it i think the simple solution is expanding npc stations via some kind of npc faction offensive npc null is a lot of fun for small gangs and even a lot of solo pilots ive been solo exploring ratting and ganking for about a year myself so i do consider my opinion biased and i would like to see a larger number of freeports out there for those who dont want to engage in the politics and grind of the current nap regimes
theres several csms that were focusing on ending nap  blob warfare forgot who they were but i would actually like to see them showing some ideas on how to achieve this
no this is your thread come up with an actual idea instead of just whining about things i dont see why others would have to do the work for you
so you dont like it that alliances are shaping their borders through politics and diplomacy which are very valid game tactics
politics  diplomacy is all fine but when you have 00 split in 3 sections its a joke i made this perfectly clear in my initial post p
up the costs of owning space considerably have it increase exponentially after a certain number of systems are controlled to compensate up the benefits and number of pilots each system can support considerably 00 plexing should be considerably more profitable than l4 missioningi think a minimum of twice as good that would encourage alliances to hold less territory which i believe was one of the points of tyrannis and should help break up the power blocs somewhat
you should totally send your suggestion to your local member of parliamentsenatewhatever how dare they want to live in peace instead of constant warfare i think you need to face it 00 is all about player control politics if you want to avoid it you need to stick to empire 00 pirate controlled space or wormholes
i keep forgetting eve is rl
if you remove peoples abilities to nap via game mechanics they will just do it in the meta anyways you cannot stop people from banding together its in our nature its part of the reason mmos are so popular if you dont like it find a way to fight it
ok so say i invaded nc or we goons hold now whats to guarantee i wont get 30k players blobbing my arsethis isnt about stopping naps its about making their size smaller to the point where powerbloc numbers arent edly higher than the average players onlineif an alliance keen on 00 decides to invade any 00 space by default it will get mass blobbed over and over by the enemy doesnt seem like diplomacy is the issue here but freedom to nap everything within 40 jumpsi strongly feel the mechanics and current situation get looked at theres alot of low sec  empire alliances that are keen on 00 but whats the point since its either being branded pets or fighting at 1300 odds p
if you invaded somebody elses space then yeah expect a retaliation and if they have lots of friends expect that retaliation to be large in numbers there is however a lot of claimable 00 space that remains unclaimed if youre small enough to not be noticed or warrant destroying think bespin then you might be able to make a footholdthere are plenty of examples of alliances holding space near unfriendly power blocs there are also many different ways to solve any single problem and the sandbox allows even requires you to use your brain a bit to solve them if its really what you want come up with an idea of how to take 00 sov and give it a go if it doesnt work maybe its your solution to the problem thats at fault and needs modification rather than the natural conditions that exist
i got some ideas while reading this but they will probably need some more thinking overmake tcus and ihs require fuel just like pos towers part of it ice and the other part form planets planet mining would need some work before that tough it would make it harder to manage big clusters of systems yes i know that would cause more server load and more lagg too probably add another 2000 or so 00 sectors some of them could be small islands with only a few connections to other 00 right now we already have a some islands like that and they are mostly occupied by smaller alliances make systems deplete so alliances have to move around to get new resources and ppl need to fight about resource rich space
people defending their homes and working together to do so in an mmo oh no we must change the game so they cannot do thisseriously if you want to take space you need to work towards it this isnt wow where you can just walk into a zone and declare an inn your bind spot if you encroach on space people own and fight to keep you should expect to find them defending it from you your scream of blobbing is just a complaint of players working together in a game that was created so people could work together maybe the problem is you and your methods
well the problem is that the only way to counter people working together you need to bring more people so circle ends you are very well aware of that but your just a carebear scared of a little of competition
if you don nap you die its that simpleyou turn table around its not people doing naps becuase they want to they do it becuase they have to
you do realize that if ccp puts in a mechanic to allow smaller numbers to counter large numbers people will just form meta alliances that arent enforced in game and come in many smaller groups so they still retain the advantage right if you think the smaller group of people working together should triumph over the larger maybe you should try to find something out of the box to accomplish this like people have in eves pastop do you realize the 2007 map you provided has one alliance and their allies controlling 23rds of the map while the other third is a group of 34 blocs right

you can safely ignore that ability its unusablerorquals are currently only used as player controlled pos mods on alt characters and for fueling  setting up posthe entire industry side of eve badly needs a complete revamp so im giving my thumbs
nice ideai believe when you need a deep mining op 5 hulks is not enoughjump bridge for industrial ships will be great
rorqual already has a ghetto jump bridge capability not really supported there are ways and means to use its capabilities above and beyond its original purpose
they can use gates jump bridges and and titan bridges what more do you want you can clone jump to the rorqual then board a hulk from the rorqual
why do we have 6 different command centres why not just have the elite command centre with the maximum amount of power grid and cpu that a person can have the basic costs 100000 and the elite costs about 6 million more which in eve someone can get easilyreally in terms of pi all we need is the basic command centre for people without skills and the elite command centre for those that do is this really ccp making things more complicated than they need to be havnt they heard of kiss keep it simple stupid
i propose an automatic scanning feature on the directional scanner check an autoscan box click scan and it will refresh the scanner every 12 seconds or whatever the cool down timer is now it could also have a longer cool down say 2 seconds instead of 12 on autoscan to handicap it a bit also a max autoscan time could be attached to it of 15 minutes to avoid abuse anything would be a big improvement over repetitiously clicking scan while trying not to do it so fast that the horrid scanner is recalibrating message comes up in the middle of my screen and stays there for 3 scan cyclesalso this could be a very valuable tool if we can ever get local nerfed please
supporting my own super awesome idea
this is a terrible idea that probably only will be supported by carebears
god no this would only help macroers
leave it to the biggest carebears to propose something like this
because macroers would really benefit from not having to smash a button every 2 seconds since it would be impossible to add that to a macro that is sarcasmstill would probably kill the server everyone having it on auto refresh dir scan needs complete overhaul combined with removal of local
ccp has specifically stated that this wont happen
and i will specifically state that something will have to happen to the scannermaybe ccp should finally iterate on some of their designs
completely agree ccp stated that this wont happen to the current scanner so the current scanner needs to be changedand local needs to be changed to delayed
its not about the current scanner its about doing distance checks between you and every object in the solar system every time you rescan it apparently causes significant lag and i dont see any good way of eliminating that problem hence wont happen sucks to be you
t3 was sold to the populace as a modular ship with you able to pick and choose what subsystems you wanted for maximum effect however despite their uses in some situations they have turned out to be a bit of a damp squib each race only has a couple of really viable combinations at the end of the day you know that when you face a proteus it will be equipped with blasters and be hardened against kineticthermal you know that if youre fighting a tengu hes going to have a shield tanksuggestionallow a t3 hull to be equipped with any racial subsystem as long as the skills are presentimagine it laser tengus heavy missile spamming neuting proteus a loki vulnerable to gallente jammers real unpredictability when you are fighting these vesselsperhaps certain racial characteristics should be imbibed within the hulls ie racial resists and sensor strength to not throw things too much off balancereference cosmetics every sub has a racial counterpart so its simply a case of using the same model for the three other races when applied to the ship ie a loki would look the same with whatever races command module fittedin order to ofset the benefits perhaps bigger penalties are required if using an off racial module perhaps the loss of two levels of a skill if it is the randomly determined one for the chop
i like the idea and i hoped that t3 would be like that but i wouldnt want to chance t3 that way anymore rather use that idea for a t4 ship only one hull and loads of subsystems for all races which even can change the class of the ship from bc to bs and so on
i honestly cant believe i am going to do thisi support the idea if not larks actual implementation this would make t3 ships even more unpredictable than they areshould be now it would offer small roaming gangs the chance to really surprise opponents with unusual arrangements something that is sadly lacking at presenti would rather than monkeying with the skills loss apply less of a bonus if mounting the module to a nonracially matching hull say by 25 or 50 percent this would also allow for an additional high rank skill that would lessen those penalties by say 2 per level call it subsystem compatibiilty or somethingsupporting the theory at any rate
im not really knowledgeable about t3 but let me throw this concern outthis change just seems to make calling primary a complete crap shoot you go up against 10 t3 ships just primary the closest to the extent t3 becomes more and more widespread this seems to mitigate any advantages you have of being knowledgeable about how ships can be fit i would be concerned that this would make them too unpredictable if you have no way to predict what the ships have on them you have no way to strategize
hilarious idea
yeah i hear that a lot i like the idea of a cut to efficiency the devil is in the details and the actual penalty would be up to people with far more knowledge than me to decidewith regards to increasing the unpredictability surely thats the point t3s tricked out for a role are in most cases sub par to their t2 counterparts and considering the investment that is put into them in terms of isk and risk i think its a p cool and balanced ideaand in the scenario suggested whereby you come across a group of t3 ships well it might foster a bit more on the fly tactical thinking and communication within your gang keep in mind you will still be able to view the nature of the subsystems fitted and if racial resists are decoupled from subs and applied to hulls youll still know what damage types to apply and which jammers to use do you know immeadiately who to primary first if you encounter a group entirely consisting of lol legions
balancing this will be evil but if it can be done it would be a fantastic idea
i like the idea it would be fun to see t3 being what they really are supposed to be fully costumizable ships
omfg actually logged into these ty forums to support this awesome ideaedit i forgot to support it lolllool
as long as racial cruiser 5 becomes prereq for the subs as well
fantastic ideasomebody gief me iskies for a t3 to proof ops point
the details of implementing this would be utter murder not just game design either  im pretty sure the art department will make firebombing your house a group excursion if theyre asked to make this work but the idea is cool and id like to see what can be done with it
as i suggested there shouldnt really need to be a change to artwork maybe adding a turret hardpoint here or there perhaps a slightly different colour scheme for fitting an off race sub no real need for frakenstein like monstrosities
very nice idea wtb lazooooor loki
lasers on a tengu blasphemy but also a cool ideasupport
1 legion  the tengu missile subsystem  rock the road
bad ideaif you want to fly different ships then train for them just like for all other shipsyou might as well introduce a hide the type of ship i fly cloak for all hacsreconsi like if if a hull has 2 or 3 reasonable fittings but this would make them all too similar
the problem is theres no single t3 hull design you could try to equate them and say that an legion defensive resist module on a tengu looks like a tengus resist module but gold but frankly that would look ugly as sin so i dont see it happening youd need huge amounts of art work or to dramatically lower your standards neither of which i expect to appeal like i said i like the idea but i dont think ccp will think it worthwhile
ohh a laser tengu or a maybe a blaster lokii would love to see this
i definitely agree with the premise but jitaamarr doesnt need to be decreased if were going with your plan then its good how it is
how about this for ccp to disburden the servers and generate more traffic between the hubsgallente and minmatar  caldari and amarr have a close relatioship already see standings gainhow about that jita and amarr are bound together via a transwarp gate star trek term i know likewise dodixie and rens but  the big con would be the equalization of prices in those twofour hubs if that is what you wantabout the shortening via low sec  eve travelling is already dangerous enough in high sec as you have many many ganks on the way from dixi to jita putting low secs in between only makes this worse

1 ure a little late on that bump but nice try on that epeen boost attempt were u just inactive for so long to reflect your proposals weight or did u just spend the entire time looking for this thread to win forum pvp because we all know2 your real intention along with so many other crybabies was to stop suicide ganking altogether without getting flamed for suggesting to remove it completely guess what nothing has changed cause we adapt and nothing has changed because u still refuse to in case u havent figured it out yet suicide ganking didnt stop nor did it slow downit sure as hell didnt slow me down but plz bump it up some more so everyone can see how little u really accomplished mr epeen
this could be the stupidest idea ever proposedthe reason no one goes to lowsec is because of yarrtards that are always there usually camping a gate or station exit doing this would ruin trade routes and honestly screw up alot of the games economy dodixie would probally die as a trade hub rens shortly afterjita and amarr would be the only empires that are populated
dont understand why this wasnt in from the start not like rebuilding the infrastructure is a big isk sink it just ends up being plain annoying to dosupported
this
not supported wspace isnt deisgned for permanent colonization and making people more and more self sufficient doesnt help that
more so i was speaking with regard to pos production in general i do enough of it  and not in wormholes  that i consider it an important ability to have in game it has its own set of annoyances but 25 build time forgives many sins for the record though i do not want to see csaas get anchored in wormholes supercaps being barred from wormholes is nice and not something i wish to see changed
as most will agree fw needs a revamp to make it more beneficial and appealing to all those involved as such i propose the following changes be made to fw as a whole1 systems are captured by systematically capturing 4 control pointsa control point 1 only allows  destroyer sized vessels and takes 10 minutes to capture 0 lp for capture  10 lp for defendingb control point 2 only allows  battlecruiser sized vessels and takes 15 minutes to capture0 lp for capture  25 lp for defendingc control point 3 allows all ship sizes and takes 20 minutes to capture 0 lp for capture  50 lp for defendingd control point 4 allows all ship sizes takes 30 minutes to capture and posts to the respective militia fw channel the  are currently capturing  from you you have 30 minutes to defend our sovereign space 250 lp for capture 02 faction gain 02 opposing faction loss  100 lp for defending 01 faction gainthe control points require the subsequent point to be captured before the next one will open ie control point 1 must be captured to open control point 2 for capture there are no npcs in these control points the control points reset back to the previous level if the defending militia captures the control point ie minmatar is attacking an amarr cp 3 the amarr amass a fleet to defend the system and fight the minmatar back the amarr capture cp 3 and it closes reopening cp 22 capturing a system for your militia will reward members of your militia with the following1 5 reduced repair costs in the system2 5 increased lp  isk  standings increase from missions in the system3 5 increased pi  pos productivitysubsequently losing a system will result in1 5 increased repair costs in the system2 5 reduced lp  isk  standings increase from missions in the system3 5 decreased pi  pos productivity3 systems are locked out from being recaptured for 8 hours timer visible to all in system at which time the system is reopen for capture but does not automatically revert back to the original militia sovereignty4 overall militia gains based on sovereigntya 50 of available systems captured  no gainb 60 of available systems captured  5 lp store discountc 70 of available systems captured  5 lp store discount  5 lp gaind 80 of available systems captured  5 lp store discount 5 lp gain and 5 isk gaine 90 of available systems captured  5 lp store discount 5 lp gain 5 isk gain 5 discount on repairs market fees and commissions from npcsi believe making the aforementioned changes will do the following1 encourage a need and necessity for your militia to actively participate in system capturing2 provide a risk and reward for taking and losing systems to the opposing militia3 prevent exploitation of fw lp gain and rewards due to the 8 hour timer preventing people from trading off sovereignties4 these changes do not force people to participate in pvp however it does encourage them to do so for the rewards it offersconclusionfw is based on a war with your opposing militia as such it should benefit and encourage the fighting of that war on all fronts and at all times by offering rewards to the capturing of the enemies systems it provides a reward for all members to be active and does their part for their militia as the rewards benefit everyone whether they want to pvp or pve
acid sniper nice work on that proposal let me ask some questions about it before i give support thoughim assuming there would be plexes for your control point 1 2 and 3 so you can only bring the designated ship type or lower in is that correct  minor point you have bc and down for level 2 why not t1 cruiser and down level 3 bc and down and level 4 open this is how the gangs are usually divided in fwwould one of these 4 control point levels be open in every system except for those in a 8 hour cool down i have to say that sounds awesome to me but it may be a bit too many maybe half the systems until the numbers in fw start growing i wonder though if we should have information about every plexcontrol point being enteredeven 13 if we dont know when and where people are taking plexes even control points 13 we may have the same hide and go seek problems we currently have it should also be a rule that if you get chased out of range of the control point the timer restarts for you back at zero that way people wont go in there warp off wait until you leave then immediately go back in it would be nice if the fw map showed what types of control points were open in each system so if you wanted to take a frigate gang cruiser and down bc and down etc out you could find the systems with those openas far as your awards they are a nice balance not so overwhelming people will run alarm clock ops but still something decent to fight for consider the possibilities with people who have alts in both militias would they have the alt start the timer than the other alt come to defend it if who entered what control points was announced in an intel channel this wouldnt be a problem
thats correct only those ship types would be allowed into the respective control points ie no bss in cp 1si didnt want to stipulate based on tier of ship as i dont feel its really necessary you could technically capture all 4 cps with a frigate if you want however since cruisers and bcs are typically used in groups together i didnt want to differentiate between them correct every system not currently on the 8 hour countdown would have open cps all based on what has  hasnt been captured i thought about that but my delima came into the implemenation of that into the world map which already can take a while to load up and could generate greater server load or to have messages sent to the militias chat which i also opted against due to it potentially creating a lot of spam thats why i resorted to only a message being sent for cp4 being captured as that is the longest point to capture as well as unrestrictive in ship types there is a possibility of adding a tab to the militia page potentially but i was trying to keep things as easy development wise as i couldthat is a great suggestion i was thinking something along the lines of if no one is in range of the cp for 2 minutes it resets back to 0 this would prevent it from resetting automatically by accidently traveling outside of the cp but also prevent warp out  ins solo thoughtsagreed could be implemented into what i recommended above regarding a tab on the militia pane which could be accessible anywhere so as to not overload the world map thanks my intentions were to prevent people from getting a buddy from an opposing militia and just trading control points off but to also allow the controlling militia enough time in the system to make use of the rewards that was one of my concerns however thats why i eliminated a lp gain for the attacking militia i think if the above changes were in effect regarding the map on the militia tab or something to that effect it could help prevent that as well as 10 minutes for only 10 lp would take a long time for it to truly be benefitial to trade it back and forth for instance
this is great except for the lp gain from capturing a plex 0 lp for attacking and 25 for defending 25 lp is worthless even 250 is worthless most people would rather do missions even with all the other benefits
i have an additional feature that i believe should be in fw its simple promotes pvp lots of enjoyment an is already happening elsewhere in gamelive fw eventsthese events would be similar to the sansha incursions faction a bridges a naval fleet into faction bs space maybe above a planet and attempts to raiddamage or destroy faction bs assets on grid these assets could be anything from a spawned naval shipyards naval logistics convoys planetary assets or a destructable station faction a will be a large fleet of npc navy vessels led by a actor capsuleer faction b could even spawn a actor capsuleer led npc fleet and the two fleets could duke it out militia would then run to support their factions navy either through logistical support or brute force the npcs should have the infamous sleeper ai and similar rr fits but within empire technologies npcs will not pod kill but may smartbomb so you need to be carefulwatcha thinkotherwise i really like your proposal1
i fear that if we are not notified of the other cps 13 being taken this will not change things for the better all the lower level cps will be taken by hide and seek plexers in frigates with warp core stabs and ecm bursts and then the highest cp will be taken by a blob if we are going to ask ccp to fix this lets make sure it gets done right if they want to say its too much work to do it right well at least we asked but if you dont ask they wont do it even if its easy to do the only way to make sure we dont have hide and seek plexing is to make sure the militias know when and where a plex is being taken i do not think it would be hard for ccp to have a notification system there would be 2 chat tabs completely separate from militia chat one tab for the caldarigallente regions and one for the minmatar amarr regions you can close the tab for the region you are not in it would simply post messages like no one could post in these tabs it would just contain intel about the plexescps eg2203kamela cp1 amarrcearain destroyer people could choose to defend if they want 10 minutes is plenty long for people to arrive if they want a fight but if people think they may be able to sneak plexes whithout others knowing they will run them in frigates with ecm bursts and warp core stabsi would strongly urge you to include the notifications for cps 13 in your proposal i think thats a great idea
i agree in principle only if there is a warning message sent somewhere to all militia players also i would add that only the current front line systems should have active control points ie the systems either side of a gate which connects a gallente held system and a caldari held system
nice although calling it a fix in the title is little disingenuous revamp as you have in your proposal is much more suitedanyways fw doesnt need a fix because that would imply that the only problem with fw would be the faulty mechanics involved when really its the fact that those mechanics are crappy in the first place even if they worked 100 correctly
so having read the forums recently this has reared its ugly head again corps dropping alliances to protect their poses or players dropping corps and reformingheres an ideathe cooldown on role removals and dropping from an alliance is increased to 48 hours if your corpalliance has a pending or active wardec against itsimples
i find it hard to believe that the intricate details behind invulnerable poss and the even more intricate process of abusing the same mechanic differently to make them no longer invulnerable was an integral part of ccps original plan for the wardec systemcautious support given knowing full well that if ccp were to look at wardecs they would more than likely  them up completely rather than fix anything in particular
i have my doubts ccps original plan for wardecs was wardeccing rookie corporations for easy kills with station camping slaved clones supported by neutral guardiansthere are no consequences to starting wardec and none to evading them seems fine to me
should be a week for corpsalliances tbh
i totally support this idea i see this happen way too often
why have a wardec mechanic if it is easily avoidablenpc corps are there for those that want risk free playsupported
well seeing as its been stated multiple times by staff that evading wardecs is naughty i find your argument absurd sir
make it longer k
yes
not supported it takes long enough to switch corporations you might for instance find that the wardec corp you just entered does not fit your style and want to leave it again
dont ask for roles when you first join
better solution  the war continues for anyone who ditches corpalliance and not just for 24h but for the whole week
would their new corp be in the war or just them keep in mind sometimes people change corps for legitimate reasons
no sorry no
just them basically the war applies to the people who were in the target group as of the time the war went live for that week plus whoever chooses to join them if you leave you get out after a week unless they choose to dec your new group or something
tldr waawaaa pi is a clickfest i quit but seriously change the extract mechanic from a highpull short duration vs slowpull long duration to a highpull low efficiency vs slowpull high efficiency system ok to begin with here are my thoughts on the whole extractor system imo there is no strategy in choosing an extractor pull type aside from trying to predict when youll log in the next day there is no brainsweat involved and just rewards poopsockers some might argue that if you are willing to work out your index finger then you deserve more planet goo but i call shenanigans i would prefer having a system that rewarded a good strategy instead how would such a system work  uh im actually not sure but i can throw out a suggestionsince we know that extractors deplete resource areas and that hotspots drift around we could use that mechanic say a certain hotspot has 1 million units of resources available if you have your extractor plant set to the maximum pull rate it will deplete the pocket at a rate of 2000 units per cycle but gives you only 500 units per cycle however if you set your extractors at the minimum rate you pull only 150 units per cycle but work more efficiently and deplete the resource pocket at a rate of 160 units per cycle as the pocket is depleted have nearby areas develop spawn new hotspots so once you finish pillaging the local lands youll have to tear down and relocate your extractors to the new hotspots with the new system you would have to choose between sucking a pocket dry in a few days and losing 75 of your potential yield or slowly sipping away over the course of a week and getting a juicy 90 yield of course any variation in between would also be available since hotspots get depleted you would have to pay isk for new extractors which add a new variable to the profitability of your current strategy you would have to determine if the higher pull rate is worth the extra cost of needing to replace your extractors more frequently now why do i think this is a good idea well personally i have a blast setting up the colony but once thats done it becomes a case of now what for me there is not much left to do aside from the tedious clickfest of refreshing your extractors with the proposed changes pi will a bit be more about the fun part building and improving the infrastructurefinally while were at it some random bitstwo players on the same hotspot would have a much greater effect since the hotspot is essentially halved in its resource amount the extraction rates are still dependent on the quality of the hotspot instead of tearing down extractors maybe have them be mobile and move them at a cost then you can crushinate all the peons that stand in the way between you and the next juicy pocketfor some added strategy increase the export tax for cc and launchpads the further away they are from the equator andor add a space elevator pin that can be placed only on the equator and has no taxalso your standard pi complaints make command centers upgradable make command centers useful make storage useful more informative pins etc etcimo even my suggestion does not completely mitigate the reward grind vs strategy problem but its a start by replacing the clickfest with a rebuildyourinfrastructurefest so any suggestions complaints and trolls welcomeps it must be really windy on those planets cause those clouds are zooming across the landscape and by windy im talking on the order of supersonic speeds
more like tlpoorly formated and impossible to readalso quiting isnt really a proposal i mean what the response you were looking for yay maor for me
pi is a great little gamelots of choices lots of strategic directions to takeall of these strategic choice and the gameplay that comes with it is 100 completely brokenwackamole is not a game of intelligence or creativityfor those that enjoy playing wackamole maybe keep the extractorshowever the 36h cycle should be renamed continuous so that those that enjoy the strategy but not the clicking can still enjoy pimy hand is not worth the iskhr i will not swap the health of my hand for 150 coolanti will however continue to enjoy pi if i dont have to refresh extractors
hii came across a topic which was about buying training speed
i do not think 00 needs a boost not supported
i am curious  why do you think that 00 doesnt need more people are you a high sec player only
im not against the idea myself though i believe 5 might be too high stick 13 would be less of an overwhelming advantage i just dont think it would be possiblenotice how you have to pause the training queue whenever you imput a new implant or jump clones i suspect this might be because the training queue cant refresh itself on the fly if things effecting it change learning skill s work but these are applied between skills when you finish your learning skill so there must be a refresh point thentherefore i believe it wouldnt work as the training queue wouldnt be able to handle jumping from a upgraded system to a nonupgraded one its possible ccp could make the queue refresh when you zone between systems but if it were already possible we wouldnt need to pause training when using jump clones as we would get that refresh then
not to mention adding this refresh could potentially shove skills at the very end of the queue off if it lengthened enough i dont want to have to check my queue everytime i change systems thanks
its way too powerful and it makes no sense whatsoever this is not the boost 00 needs lag fix plox
yet another post by someone who doesnt like the fact that training take real time working on mining barge v are you htfu if anything should be done to learning and i think nothing should be done then the skills removed along with their bonusesthen it can take everyone longer to train skills and have new toyseveryone starts the game from the same basic place choices you make  yes choices you make  affect how long it takes you to do anything in the gamenow that ive ranted lets get real  how exactly is this a realistic mechanic is there some sort of subspace field that enhances your skills while sitting in a single system do you have special implants that can tie into that field can you provide any supporting physics or engineering sciene to enable this kind of ideadidnt think so
no i am not as a matter of fact i am ok with the learnings as they are now having heard of the wish to learn faster i had the idea and wanted to contributeglad to see that its not only ranting you do you just did name the idea you do know the sticker which are on a computer games etc when you buy them originally they where for distinguishing friend  foes during the 2nd world war in airplanes the same idea became the first theft tags which cause alert when you leave the shop the same system but with subspace could be applied in game say you have all 4 implants with the upgrade 3 you could source out brain calculation time into a computer and therefore enhance learning by 3 like the upgrade has if the upgrade would be a 5 you still could do max 4 as you have that kind of implants in the current implants would work as well as transmitter and receiver
no empty quoting herschel 
but i wasnt empty quoting herschel i was empty quoting malcanis
empty quoting herschel empty quoting malcanis
i am not i just do not feel that the powerhouses that do have sovereignity need a boost now giving a boost in systems that you are red to might be more interesting but would lead to afk cloak schooling
you sir are an idiot
absolutely
i think we all would like to have more reasons not to fight in large blobs and i would like ccp to keep looking into objectives that avoid the need for blobbingin order the avoid the problems with time zones the game encourages scheduled fights at fixed infrastructure where it only makes sense to bring the biggest blob possiblegiven the number of players in the game and the application architecture there will always be a limit to what the servers can handle and a reason for alliances to blob past those numbersi thus propose a solution like this or something similarthe server monitors the performance of a system and when it detects it is getting close to overloading it will warp random pilots to a special cpp safespotwhile at the safespot a pilot will get minimal game state updates and is not able to do anything but wait or logoffwhen people die and leave local more players are allowed back into the fight when the game releases players from the safespotyou could have bad luck and have your fc or a key ship go inactive but that really is not any worse than what currently happens when a node lags outexamplealliance 1 10 titans 100 bs 300 bcalliance 2 5 titans 300 bs 50 hacssystem overloaded so random 30 goes inactive to the safespot active in the fight with no lagalliance 1 7 titans 65 bs 220 bcalliance 2 3 titans 210 bs 35 hacsas ships get killed and pilots leave the system the two fleets get reinforced with reactivated pilotsagain i am not saying this is the one and only solution but that ccp should design a solution like this where the fight can go on somewhat fairly even once way more ships attempt to join than the system can handle
you are trying to fix a broken player mentality with a gamemechanici disagree with this out of the simple reason that the game should not dictate where i warp or where i go to nor prevent me from going where id like
but it already does that right now when you dc or look at a black screen or get minutes of activation lagthis proposal is just to keep it fair and playable for the people actually in the fight when the server runs out of hamsters
i think a big problem is going to be choosing what 30 to take out of the battle namely losing fcs logi titans etc maybe letting people volunteer to be moved to the safespot with a special checkbox so that titans and such arent removed
i think having control over what ships are removed from the fight would get abused you could brings 10 capitals with the do not deactivate flag together with 300 noob ships to force some of the enemy ships off the field while not having significant losses yourselfbut in the end i see that as an implementation detail the real proposal is that blobs will exceed server capacity and that the system should deal with that gracefully and fairly support this petition in you agree with that
i get the impression this is going to fix many of the giant headaches we currently have the networking bit might be the most important part of that entire dev blog well find out tomorrow or the next day depending on how long this takes
i hope so but i fear that in the big wars alliances will just bring more ships before they lag out again i just want to get rid of the whole the alliance who loads grid first wins gameplay
instead of fighting the symptoms we should rathera help ccp finding the bugs that cause the current lagb finding ways that encourage smaller gangsmaybe look at this proposal it tries to give small gangs something to do and also make them influence the whole sov warfare schemerandomly warping ships out of the fight is definitely not supported
i like new ways to do damage to an opponent that does not require a big blob but even with these added you would still have situations where you want to concentrate all the firepower you can find wanting to bubble camp the main station of an enemy system wanting to kill a titan building in an enemy posas was seen during the north vs south war these kind of fights do happen but currently suck because of lag which also randomly messes up your gameplay what would your prefer randomly lose your ship current situation or randomly get sidelined for a while new proposalalso the new proposal would spread the problem evenly over all the parties in the system instead of giving a huge advantage to the first ones there the fact that the server could not keep up should not have a great impact on which party wins eventually
as both are random neither of thosei would like ccp to reduce the hp of all the sov relevant stuff so that you dont have to bring 100 people to efficiently kill some structureatm i think the way of capturing systems in faction warfare is better than the 00 hitpoint grind the proposed solution in the thread of making upgrades easily destroyable by small gangs and progressively bringing the system closer to being taken might make the whole sov thingie more fun then we might only see 2 meat grinding fights 1 to bring the tcu into rf and another to kill itthe rest of the time will be small gangs nuking the sov upgrades less people to bring to the fights less people needed to defend a system even if you wont achieve your goal of destroying the upgrade you might get a fight from the locals

whats sisi the hardcore testers play on multi its like an orgy of nodes compared to sisi
can someone explain what the reasoning behind the lp store required items pricing isi mean im curious why nearly every module needs so many captain 3 insignias it seems like they dont actually want people to use them any thoughts
um perhaps its because faction gear is supposed to be expensive

game balance has no bearing on a player driven economy aside from making sure no one person or group can exploit the mechanics at the expensive of othersin short people charge what the market will bear for items obviously people are for whatever reason wiling to pay more for the modules than they are for the ships

youre really talking about two things hereone is the balance of used tags to unused tags the other is the pricing of objectsi can name at least one module that doesnt use any of the insignias you have in your used list  the republic fleet gyroscope it uses general and coloneol insignias so it may be that the insignias are used just not for the objects yourre looking atdont forget that different corporations have different lp stores and that doesnt include the faction warfare ones also faction warfare lp purcahsses tend to cost less than comprable nonfw ones which may account for part of the price discrepancies youre observing ie it cost me less to make so i can afford to sell if for less and retain the same profit marginalso why isnt this in gd or markets
i would like to se as well as my corpmates a way to upgrade our collonies without having to rebuild everything again as when you have a good layout it is hard to get it put back the same exact way you had it before also it would be nice if there was a way to link corpmates colonies if we are on the same planet would allow for easier trading of supplies between corp mates
i was looking through the market for initiated ion field ecm i in 3 different regions including jita and couldnt find a single item also the table shows almost no sales for the last month think about 4 of them in the last month so im sure there is an issue with the loot tables in tyrannis unless ccp really wanted this item to be more rare then a tournament prizei think this needs a fix
here we go with that other players shouldnt be allowed to do things that hurt me garbage yet again what makes you so freaking special that you should be protected from interference in this multiplayer pvp game you already have multiple ways of dealing with thieves you can get to the mission item first you can warp out and hope the rats chase him off or you can shoot him because he voluntarily gave you kill rights on him all of these options have their pros and cons if you arent willing to take any of these actions in favor of begging for the developers to hand you everything you want on a silver platter prepare to be ridiculed and disappointed
clearly you donthe offered to sell it back to you i presume you said no that was smart hell remember you next time and he wont waste his time trying to steal your item to sell it back to you see how you wonyou lost the battle but won the war imagine how he feelsi bet he petitioned the gm because you griefed him by him wasting his time stealing your stuff and then you you you didnt buy it back off himdid you also notice that cancelling off your mission didnt have any negative effects at all i mean yes you lost a little tiny teensy weensy amount of standing but not enough to affect anything at allwell guess what that thief lost he lost face he gets to go back to his corpmates and tell them how he completely failed to secure a lucrative extortion deal he has to work a lot harder to regain his lost standing with his own corpmates than you ever will to regain your standing with whatever npc corp that wasi know who i would rather be and its you because you superpwned that guy

effect on gamemining botmacro removalmore than changing loot drops this change will likely drastically affect oremineral prices initially people who took the time to learn the mining skills and actually put the effort into piloting there ships in real time will be rewarded for their effort quantity on the oreminerals on the market will drop prices will rise the hulk will likely stop being the most piloted ship in eve due to the fact that a percentage of the pilots are actually alt botmacro accounts used to suck iskore from the system for other characters purposes nulllowsec corps will likely have to recruit more industrial players thus drawing industrial players from empire spacetrading botmacro removalthe spectacle of a trader botmacro lowering prices on an object to at or below the cost of actually making the object will hopefully cease to be an occurrence traders will not need to be superhuman to be able to trade and make a livingprofit at it overall market stability and the increased interaction and satisfaction by real time players will likely be the result i do not consider myself an expert on this category just an informed noviceratting botmacro removalwhether for sec standing or isk players will have to work like the rest of us to make their moneystandingsuggestionsto be truthful im not sure how to tackle this one ive seen a lot of people suggesting different options
so your proposal is basically to acknowledge that macros are bad and ccp should ban people who use them i mean i agree with that of course but im not really sure what you think this thread will accomplish in that regard they already do this a lot
after reading the stickies this is how i understand the process to befor the csm to bring up a topic debate it internally and then bring it up to ccp a topic has to come up here in this forum firstso this is me bringing up the topic so that players can support it so that the csm can debate it and then bring it to ccp as a priority hopefully thats cleari left off all the personal opinions on how to fix it because i dont have a good one and its not really my job other then to state it should be fixed and ask for support for my statementim hoping people will support the idea csm picks up the idea and debates the effect of macrobot accounts determine it of consequence and adds it to their agenda as a thing they would like ccp to address
that goes hand in hand with evels pos overhaul and will probably be done at the same timenever
id like to point out a small error in my statement about keeping a refining array busy with one mining frigate i admittedly didnt do the math correctlybecause actually with one mining frigate extracting 40753mUFFFD in 90 minutes navitas 2x miner ii 1x mining laser upgrade i mining foreman mindlink from the hauler you can keep two medium intensive arrays busy or with 3 frigates ca 244518mUFFFD in 180 minutes a big intensive frigates
oh god how did i get here i not very good with computer
i approve of this product or service
i support and fully approve authenticator keyfob style units for evethey arent perfect but they do reduce the window of opportunity someone has down to a few min at most
sure i support either giving them the skill they need to complete the tutorial or telling them how to get it what kind of newplayer tutorial requires you to know something beyond the tutorial itself in order to finish it
the aggro system in this game is more arcane and convoluted than american tax law i support any attempt to fix it or at least make it more visible who has aggro to who
its funny how the russian localized client already has a way better font than the english client
too often i see people throwing npc starter corps characters into systems ahead of themselves to scout their actual more important characters through areas that they already know are dangerous the major problem with this is that as the altscout is inevitably killed several dozen times it just keeps moving its medical clone to the nearest medbay facility so it can go back to being thrown in front of the real character to reveal anything unpleasant i propose that npc starter corp characters be confined to only having clonebay access to stations that belong to their npc corp if you want a freebie scout to scout your dumb ass through choppy waters your going to have to fly him from empire space each time it dies

ive said it beforei will say it againank is a deeply unstable person who thinks that pvp is somehow morally wrong in the real world senseshe does not need a csm position she needs psychiatric assistance and i do not mean that jokingly eitherher presence and consistent paranoid delusional behaviour should be taken seriously and she should be removed from the council of stellar management in favor of someone with a similar agenda but less obvious mental traumaleaving her as she is puts a person that is obviously mentally distressed under pressures she is quite obviously not capable of dealing with and is both irresponsible and potentially hazardous to her healthend
i would like to know which one of the following csms focus is 00 specifically the nap train abuse and blobardmentthis isnt a flame at any powerbloc since all powerblocs equally abuse diplomacy thanks to ego and fear however one of things that caught my eye when the 00 elections were going on was that certain people would focus on ending blob warfare sadly i forgot who these people wereplease note i have read up on sov history as well as been in several alliances who strangely enough hate nap trains yet certain replies i have gotten have been in favour of itthis isnt a discussion about that though i would just like to know the names of the elected csm that will be focusing in 00 and in these areasthanks in advance 
i concur

support for blaster rebalance infact support for a overall balance passlook at gallente in general lets keep this thread going
no they are not they already get bbqd faster than a witch in salem by cruisers they need more slots because if their hps and sig radius dont change at least they can tank a little better or actually put on some different useful modules to make them more useful as a ship with higher versatility they lack versatility which is their main problem their bonuses are flawed which is their second their fittings arent right which their tertiary flaw and the final flaw is that their sig radius makes them instapop from cruisers you know how easy acs rip up frigs a cruiser is twice the sig radius of a frig slower and has only about 30 more hp than a frigthe coercer only has 1 mid try doing anything useful with that ship its like having to choose between speed to avoid damage and catch up to targets or cap boosters to keep moving at a snail pace without running out of cappersonally id like to see a 4 bonus per level to afterburner speed with a 1 increase in cap use for afterburneryou know whats funny is that this ship could have all kinds of different bonuses set on it to make it better but each bonus if its related to a module would effectively fitting out the other moduleslike if it had an ab bonus and a tracking computer bonus and a cap battery bonus and a web bonus on ships with only 1 or 2 midslots you can only choose two at most and if the bonuses werent to op then a particular fight would favor switching out a bonused mod for an unbonused one that would be more helpful in a particular fighttheres tons of ways to improve ships not just with buffs to stats but also with new bonuses that if taken advantage of take a slot away from being able to use another bonusbattlecruisers are solo pvp lowsec ships in droves that doesnt compare to a ship relegated to salvaging for everyone
i got something to say put in two of the small rigs that increase fire rate 10 dps is huge then these rigs also tend to be pretty cheap i think the only answer is to tank destroyers because otherwise the frigs theyre supposed to kill take them out instead

i agree more dps same fragility at least i could use my cormy with 7 150mm without pen
please please had to add some more people to the contact list again and its a frigging painnot only that you cant tell who is who anymore without custom folders the adding process itself is driving me insanewas only 50 names but instead of being able to dragdrop them into the standing folders you have to rightclick every single name set standing for every single name toggle add to watchlist for every single name  instead of being able to make the settings for the folder then dragdrop names into itwhyim serious when im saying that this is taking the enjoyment out of the game for me never felt the need to come to the forums and complain about an expansion before but this is just badif you cant get it to work with eve gate freeze the project and give us a working watchlist again with a proper ui that wont give your customers suicidal tendencies over adding a handful of names
to the op you should add that ccp should bring back the old contact limitwhich was near endless now its 300 contacts top for a mmo like eve a sandbox game where anyday you can meet a new person you want to keep contact with when you thnk about it 300 is a pretty low limit ccp stated that less than 1  of the game would be effected what they dident state was if it was 1 of all accounts exsisting alts isk sellers inactives etc or if the 1 was just a made up number to get us of their backs which ever way you look at it there was no justifyed reason for removing the endless contact limit unless it was the sole cause of lag or something like this which they stated it was not

yes i was trying to look for a 2005 one tbh 2007 wasnt really a great example and i know i shouldnt dwell in the past but considering how many smaller powerblocs were there then not to mention more conflictlets be real here this was a more of a trend from the start than anything diplomatic there was far more global warfare none of this north vs south bull surely even someone who spent time killing off the southern naptrain for years could understand thisthis again isnt about removing diplomacy but making it in such a way to make 00 less about blobbing and more about strategy node crashing isnt what i would call strategy or would you prefer to spend the next 7 years being part of the same depressing sc vs nc warfarei dont want smaller alliances to have an advantage i just want them to have a chance my strategy doesnt even include 00 anymore thats like asking some small island to take on nato lol but even if i wanted to go in 00 out of npc world it would require something of a similar size in order to achieve anything which is funny since eve isnt rl diplomacy shouldnt be so squareoptions now are for any alliance  corpbecome a petroam only because its going to be impossible getting space in anything less than 30k members within your whole naptreebe part of one of the three depressing coalitions who resort to the same tricks blobbing  naping as each other
heres an idea for youinstead of posting ed idiot ideas like this onego out and shoot your napd buddiesyou wanted excitement go get itdont like blues shoot them no ones stopping you
after 3 years of doing that it kindda becomes more of a chore than anything but thanks for assuming i never did this
its only human nature to seek the extremes of everything and manage to make it the worst possible situation for everyone involved no arbitrary limitations will help avoid this
this
pardon what not sure if i fell into some kind of time warp and landed in five years ago but right now theres absolutely no way of going into null without joining the nearest coalition youre either so small that your supply line will draw attention or big enough to field jump freight logistics in which case your op will be noticed going in in both situations you can expect to be blown off the map within a few days of setting up campi see no problem allowing big naps to exist if peopel are so inclined but to suggest everyone has the chance to break out and start playing to the beat of their own drum or set up elsewhere unnoticed is lunacy
this i must admit has to be one of my more interesting threads i have made to a point where i was rather curious about the comments anyway it brought about alot of in game activity tooanyway after spending last few hours talking to people and getting interrupted by many people i am led to believe that there is a strong  that dislikes naping and blobbing but for those who have achieved what they have through naping and blobbing do not wish for it to be taken awayi would like to remind everyone of a pre dominion thread where a huge  based in 00 were annoyed by the fact that they would have to pay for sov i dont think i have to remind you which one ed  the characteristics of these types of replies are much similar to the people in this threadagain i am not against diplomacy or cap warfare or hotdropping but i do find and i am certain many others do too having 00 split into 3 naps and 3 categories makes it a very ugly placemany alliances complain over and over they want smaller alliances to come in 00 they want people to leave empire so it confuses me why people wouldnt consider a diplomacy  warfare revampoh and i found out which csms wanted to change blob warfare and was actually very surprised to find vuk lau of morsus mihi had it as one of his point of interests or so i am lead to believeso theres a strong inconsistency even within 00 on how people feel about this some people dont like transitions dominion alone proved this if anything some dont want their hard work ruined by changesedit  naping everything within 40  60 jumps nice to see people complaining about not having anything todo in 00 contradict much
power blocks is what works plain and simple why be independent and risk getting absolutely decimated when you can be part of a power block and be saferbottom line is risk free pvpppppppppppppppp is the current way of this game you just dont get eveall of the player base likes it this way or they would not do it you are simply an alt who tried to do things without ultra napping and was kicked in the teeth hard so now you come to the forums and try to convince everyone that bringing 1000 friends is the reason for lag and such thingswe like the entire north being best friends forever we get to live in peace do mining mission running anamolies etc and not have to worry about some losers who live a few jumps away deciding to stop by and mess it upi for one enjoy carebearing in complete safety and no one coming close to me and me knowing about it for 30 jumps so i have plenty of time to get safe we create intel channels cyno jamm systems mass bubble the gates to create an environment that we like it is a sandbox why should i not have it my wayagain when you learn how to make friends like we have then you can come up and claim a little bit of space that is if we dont bring all of our friends to keep you from doing it so just give up and try and strike a deal as a pet and stop trying to doing something by yourself with what patheic alliance mates you have this is 00 you need a lot of people and i mean a lot if you want to do something and not be a pet or have your sandcastle quickly annihilatednothing more to see here people just some sore loser who does not understand what mmorp stands for here is a hit massive multiplayer learn it buddy
priceless postanyhow yea its like i said in your other thread fist the only ones who can do anything about it politically like the easy street they find themselves in now they have absolutely nothing to gain but more agressive neighbors and fewer pets so why would they support breaking napscome to think of it youre pretty spot on in assuming it would take an act of ccp to end this that being said i wouldnt look for any csm candidate from the nc to suggest it
why would we push for anything that would hurt our current situation we like being a power block and a power block is how it is going to stay ccp will not be for breaking up power blocks either so you might as well put forth your effort into other things that really do need fixed like some regions anomalies being broken or something
i read what you said and i am so glad we are on the same level i am sorry you got got confused though eitherway you agreed with me in the end you just assumed i was talking about something else hehedit  for the sake of this thread much like my predecessor i will right this in big bolded caps for those mentally ed players1 00 is split into 3 naps2 most naps have everything blue within 40  60 jumps3 most alliances do this because they are worried that 4 xxx will kill them therefore blobbing is the only skill required5 however most alliances want empire to leave and come to 006 00 people dont like empire and feel 00 is underpopulated7 empire dont like huge naps where 00 to them is either being a pet or a peon8 newer alliances have no chance  sov stuff in 00 and are limited to roams only thanks to napsthen again what am i saying people cant understand a simple thread how can they understand how to play an mmo which includes pvp you know looks like theres more of that in empire than in 00 until the next max campaign i guess
nice quote and then delete everything he said and put my own words in there bro
i completely support making systems more expensive exponentially so smaller alliances can move in dirt free this however will only make larger alliances drop their visible in game holdings they will still lay a claim to the systems around them even without sov a lot of systems in 00 are unclaimed but if you move into many of them you will find yourself dogpiled by all your new neighbors who are none to happy about your little incursion the real trick is to make each 00 system potentially very profitable for the alliance so they do not need vast tracts of space but at the same time make the scale enough that 10 people cannot get the same profit out of a system that 5000 can as it stands each system can support maybe four or five people actively npcing assuming none of them use caps supercaps or dual box or a mechanic that makes it beneficial to have unaffiliated entities nearbyyour base reasons are not flawed just your methodology

have not had so many problems with this specific issue lately but yes easier on the eyes would be niceglitches like the solar system map station dropdown interface showing whenever you open close and reopen the probing interface without closing the scanner panel need to be fixed as well
yes my main disappointment with t3 cruisers was that they basically do exactly the same as other ships of that race i want ecm legions and long range webbing tengus etc it would be awesome
okay
there are so many issues like this with eve ui and they put new ones in with each expansion seriously ccp its not funny anymore ok its a little bit funny
what you smocking cos i really need to get some of thathi anna i missed you so your random incoherent and very poorly constructed arguments bring a tear to the eyesganking is more expesnive particularly tempests and typhoons sure it is still done but the threshold value for people to successfully gank someone and still profit has risen i agree more people have adapted and moved to the approach of multiple suicide thrashers instead this is a good tactic because you are not losing much isk but still getting bang for your buck this however increases the number of characters needed to successfully gank and as a result decreases the amount of profit per person or per character depending which overall leads to the increased barrier to entry and resulting costs of a successful suicide gank increasing hardly any freighters are getting touched these days and the only suicide wrecks i have seen lately are elite frigates i presume buzzards with bpos
very true furb sorry i just glanced over your commentit is true ship prices will just keep going down until they adjust to the new insurance pricesbut this trend is not sustainable there will eventually come a time when the supply of ships will actually equal the demand ccps goal in my opinion its just that the supply is so saturated compared to demand that ships and resulting mineral prices are falling out of their ass eventually an equilibrium will be reached where prices have stabilised at this point the price of suiganking will be equal to the insurance cover cost of the ship and nolessif ship prices do get so low as to enable ier to return ccp is gonna hit the i win button and reset prices to fall even lower
so you want more wardec more pirate destroy the market i could go on but thats the consequences i see plus the ones youve told on top of that security status hasnt changed so you get a gcc with what you told i blame you cause of your wall of text if im wrongthats why most carebears and people that live in highsec wont pvp in low sec btwalso they are more and better things to do to change the current market situationif all or most of market transactions happens in jita is a problem to you for example increase the taxes of sell orders and buy orders in jita well a system that has more traffic in transactions up to a point that you lose isk if you make a transaction in a high traffic systemthats itfor low sec and more pvp thing you said well thats a bit more complicated but your situation would increase pirates blobs and most pvpers from what they told me dont like blobs at allno not supported at all you just told the major deficiencies in your own idea at least
where do i start  pardon me if if this may appear rude no offense is meant but i can only repeat myself so many times before losing my cool main points1 you are deliberately putting the geographically challenged factions at a massive disadvantage2 you are deliberately putting the smaller factions at a massive disadvantage3 you are not addressing the problem of solofrigates taking everything in sight with a blob as backup4 you are rewarding timezone warfare even more than what the broken dt spawn mechanic doesexplanations1 some areas have bottlenecks that are downright godsends compared to rival territories and not all militias have the same base number of systems2 one frig in all first tier plexes with blob lingering nearby move to tier 2 etc  war over in a single downtime tops blob  bad nuff said3 see two basing the system on a reporting system will not help this if you have ever been in 00 and seen the ludicrous spam you get when the space you live in is invaded you would find another solution the initial swarm of frigs will spam system so hard that the defending side will ignore it in short order  numbers  all  bad mechanic4 i just need one timezone with a blob and a handful of hardliners during the day to perform delaying operations and i can hold all space permanently with your rules postdt mechanic is bad but replacing it with something worse does not helpfor fw to have a chance the plexing mechanic itself has to be revised pvp engagements of all sizes must have an impact on occupancy missions must be included in occupancy and made harder so solobombersfarmers are excluded and rewards must benefit participants primarily and not the horde of alts that is dragged along for the rideno support
this is more a features and ideas discussion than an assembly hall issueid suggest to move it to fi where the devs will see it csm doesnt have the role of telling ccp how to fix things just that things are brokenfaction warfare is already on the agenda for the imminent meetings in iceland30 minutes is not really enough time to mobilize forces the proposed system ensures that folks running alarm clock ops have a strategic if not tactical advantagei do like the basic idea though and i personally would like to see it expanded to sovereignty in general with faction warfare being focussed on npc sovereignty claims while null sec faction warfare serves to spread null sec sov fights over multiple simultaneous targets thus giving fcs a reason to split fleets up
yes
withdrawing from a wardecced alliance in order to protect a pos is on the same scale of foolishness as waging a hisec wardec with neutral rrwardec mechanism needs to be fixed in order to give the declaring party some goal to meet after which the wardec is retracted the goal could be remove pos at system iv moon 3 or simply inflict 1b isk damage there should be penalties for not achieving the goal such as a wardec collateral being required which is not refunded if the wardec failsto date ive only seen wardecs used by people looking for easy kills usually folks who will not log in until their neutral rr is online and have intel on how many wts are logged inflag rr so they cant dock after repping or simply resort to concord intervention when a neutral party reps any target involved in a wardecpreventing pos holders from leaving a wardec has to have a trade off that impacts on the wardeccing party
the tldr was a joke i hope you actually read what i had to say now with improved formatting for 50 less headache
what it says on the box sometimes i want to view the info box for an item or see the preview for a ship thats not available in the market or contracts typing a name in the chat box and autolinking it is very cumbersome especially if you do not know the exact spelling and even then it does not always work try last years alliance tournament prize ships for example
ccp should rather fix the stupid inconsistency with the linking of items i already reported a few bugs eg about items that were shown as variation for an item in the show info dialog but you couldnt search for contracts on thosethen all those items might show up in the item database on the eve wiki aswell and given we got a decent in game browser you could use that database instead of creating a new ui just for that just a thought
not a bad idea despite the tears i sense lurking just under the surface
thats not an argument against frigs per se more an argument against poddingrisky pvp in general i could say the same about 500 million implants
so wait if ank is so hated how did she get elected
trolls trolls everywhere
a lot of folks talked from high atop the soap box about ending nap and blobs thereby alleviating lag and increasing enjoyable pvp in null space sadly this has given way to well im not going to be the first ceo to break the nap think of it realistically the nap essentially cements borders as they stand nobody who could potentially loose space is going to want to break it and nobody who would remain in the same space wants to break it either unless they just enjoy wars of attrition  some do that really just leaves those who could gain territory from broken naps which is a really small segment of the null population given the fact that most of the highlow sec population have no feelings either way and would probably suggest their issues were more important youre looking at a rather large establishment to tumble with minimal supportunless you get serious defection from the naps north and south nothing is going to change since the first to drop will probably just get dogpiled essentially every established alliance is scared to death that it might loose and isnt willing to risk it
page 7 is simply not acceptable for an idea of this quality

a redesign of an old mechanic to something new and shiny and engaging would be totally marketablesay for example mining or missioning for me both systems are boring and oldfashioned if theyd just totally redesigned those with coop in mind that would be really easily marketed and it would be new content and a fix in one in general i support this drive for excellence especially when it comes to the ui which was for me personally the biggest thing to overcome to play eve i tried this game before like years ago and ran away screaming because of the ui
i dont know if we got thisnew in this expansion1 bounty hunting as a usable profession on behalf of the vengeful and rich track down the most dangerous prey in the far corners of space2 t3 frigates open up the field for all kinds of new tactics as you create exactly the ship you need3 new epic arcs expand the possibilities in blood raider sansha or serpentis space4 a fully revamped ui makes space combat as smooth as the click of a mouse5 total pve reworking face smart dynamic npcs and missions that adapt to your strengths and never give you the same challenge twice6 epic fleet fights become more practical with fixes to lagnone of those would attract new players all of this is simply finishing existing content
id like to see less quality features then more half or unfinished features on the one side its cool that ccp is adding new content over and over but on the other if its bugged or feels unfinished  whats the pointpersonally i really wont mind half less frequency of expansion releases but twice more wellrounded expansion yes we can say that eve wont be growing up that fast but isnt it good enough game already to not recklessly add halffeatures
5th quarter checkin thread was on the first page of the assembly hall before i posted this driveland oh hey not a single acknowledgment from ccp that theyve seen this thread after 15 months of bouncing around this forum

as a cross trainer from caldari ships to gallente ships i was forced to train blasters and railguns as welleverything was nice and sweet but when i reached the marauder type class kronos i started to pvp with the kronos on the test serverthe fitting was good looking and with potential on the fitting screenbut out on the field things changedencoutering an autocannon user which shoots aprox 6000 damage per salvo at every range he was and i barely hitted him for aprox 1500 damage per salvo at over 10km made me think it was something wrong with my fittingbut i see it was notso please fix blasters losing ships on tranquility just because the blasters its not pvp its slaughterthank you
definitely supported the field commands are lagging behind quite badly these days
catalyst does not have enough powergrid to fit fullrack of 150 mm rails now if i add two rigs that boots their power useage by 10 each and it stacks and put a couple plates and an mwd on i wonder what will happen
in my corp we have run acrost issues where we have had to move ships in between poss and as were a multy race corp can have some issues especally sence you cant repackage ships in a posit would be great if their was atleast 2 diffrent ships 1 say with the same compacity as an orcas maintnence bay but no corporate hangers and 1 that can carry up to 2 small battleshipsand like with the freighter none of the ships can be removed or managed unless in a station or near a pos comand tower
10 million m3 is the size of a titans sma isnt that a bit excessive
not supportedif you eliminate one skill that is fundamental then you open the debate to eliminate other skills there is nothing wrong with learning skills whats wrong is that people who lack patience and want to speed up everything to an unreasonable point that is dangerous because it does approach the instant gratification vs hard workpatience equation
skills for a new player is already annoying every shiny toy you see requires ages to trainadding more salt to the injury with these learning skills is just giving extra reasons to quit this game the only thing it does is create a 45m sp timesink 10k faster is too fast 200 or 400 would do just fine as well signed
not supportedthe only thing worse than this idea would be if ccp decided to let people buy sp
well ccp is putting in a function that allows you to take your tasty tasty stem cell sp that they are introducing and spending it on whatever come this coming tuesdaythread
im strongly against them removing learning skills as much as it sucks im playing by thoses rules im like 3 months old i spent almost all my game time learning learning skills because i know im going to play this game for a long time im alrdy penalizing myself willingly and i dont complain about it for doing that i would get penalized even more why should i pay twice the price for taking that decision because some of you guys decided not to learn thoses skills and regret it  and the other kind of people are thoses that are so old that just dont careeven if they were to redistribute the points its still stupid and im still behind because while you got thoses skills alrdy and used them to make tons of isk or survive in pvp or whatever you did with them i didnt have them so returning me thoses points is totally pointless to me totally how are you gonna give me back thoses 2 months were i didnt have thoses improved skills to make  loads of isk  you wonti decided to learn learning skills because they give me an edge at some point i do not want it to be taken away and be penalized so not only people had an edge on me during all that time but they get back at equal footing so in short i put an insane effort to learn almost only learning skills for 3 months for nothingso i hope this new system is just for downtime points gift and not to remove learnings or if they do remove learning even if they give me back thoses sp that will not be enought to pay my loss back my character spent hours and hours injecting learning datas in his brain he is supposed to be more advanced to learn things you cant tell me that never took placeagain i understand how painful the learning system skill is for new players i do but if you do remove them you penalize some of us especially me who basicly never beneificed a single day of having thoses level 5 somebody who got thoses level 5 for years years made loads of spim totally against this i hope this is just a rumor im all about not having learning skills but only if this is done without penazling anyone and this cant be donei certainly did not spend 2month and half in learning skill to have an edge in my learning curve for 2 days that doesnt make any sensewho would do that  you would have to be out of your mind
totally supported the learning skills are just time sink which only benefit older players expensive implants give vets a decent enough sphour advantage over newbies i started an alt last year with power of 2 and reexperiencing the learning grind was the most hideous thing ive ever done not even worth undocking for over a month tangfastic also i dont see why anyone would argue against getting a a stat boost since so few people have all 5s this system means everyone will be training faster than before and b being able to sink over a million t1 to 5 t2 to 4 sp wherever we want who ever was ing about ccp not giving game time back needs to stfu you get the sp back with interest tbh the benefit of having free sp would be great for everyone and in fact even more so for vets because we know which skills are the most subjectively valuable to us noone looses with this system everyone retains the same total sp and the suggested loss of game time is a total nonissue yes if you have all learning to 5 then you might have lost some gametime but only if you are still waiting to break even on them in which case you will be no more behind than you are now if you only took t2 skills to 4 more than maybe 90 days ago you are gaining time tldrpros everyone trains everything faster good for newbs good for vets everyone who had trained any learning keeps the sp and can put it anywhere is there anyone who wouldnt like an extra mil sp in something  cons  the all 5 chars gain least but only if they havent broken even on sp yet and even then it only matters if you are very narrow minded the benefits they got by being the first people to build or invent or fly a new whatever wont have vanished
its not all about how many sp you have obviously no one loosing in skill pointsbut my character is totally screwedi spent 2 months and half with not a single usefull skill because i learned a lot of level 5 this whole skill thing is all about planning why do you think remap is 12months  because it is a tight and long planning process a slight changement in how things works change everythinghow do you expect me to break even  im 3 month old im years away to break evenso no i dont qualify to thoses no onei remain the same sp yes but as of today my game plan is based over years knowing ill be slightly ahead 95 of the people in sp grinding and grinding until finally i break even and get ahead thats thoses points that im loosing and thats how i mentally hold on 3months having  skillsyou are obviously quite far from a correct reasoning there
thisand i love that message that eve will wrench your heart if youre a minmaxer eve is fraught with conflict and the internal conflict is part of itnewbies need to quickly get over the warped concept that this game is about leveling up or that bigger ships are betterits not about how you stack up to others but what you can contribute and unlike most mmos where a new player is worthless not even worth 110th a person here if employed correctly youre worth well over 50 of a max skilled person quickly scouttackle prober basic electronic warfare in a blackbird  you can be an important help to a corp at war in a t1frigate that you can fly ok in about a week true its harder to get involved in 00 with low sp but there is lots else to the gameid feel a bit bad for the noobs but the accelerated first 16 million get you up quicklyas do the way skills are construed with the first 80 percent taking 20 of the learning time if they wanted to further ease the burden for new players they could allow the training of the second tier learning skills with the first at lvl 3 not 4
it was your choice to train only learning what most people do is train the skills they need as they appear and fill in with learning in the mean time your first day in a new game and you decided to sit in station and do nothing for a month s  thats your problem buddymost everyone gets their learning skills slowly not maxing them until its worth doing so you can get 8 points for each attribute from learning in just over a week with the 100 training speed imagine you are playing another popular mmo involving bringing doom to elves and goblins and you decide to go and pick herbs for two months would you be complaining at the end that you didnt have any nonherb skills  if you want balanced skills then you have to train them in a balanced manner if you have this massive skill plan why didnt you just hit up evemon toss in the skills you want and ask it to tell you which learning skills were worth training ie would pay in the duration of the plan
i have to agree with thiseve isnt really about skill points its about the ship you fly have a good ship and fitting before you leave the dock and youll be fine sure you have to learn the skills in some or many cases but what you bring to the table at the time of a fight is what mattersnoobs forgive the word are still going to be ok this change isnt a big deal i still believe there can be more to offer for noobs but ccp already provided you with a lot more than i ever had when i first started back in 2006 im still learning the game myself i dont beleve there is a person who 100 knows eve and well baby steps take the game a bit at a time before you go out to fight besides i cant blame anyone who wants to make this change its getting people high level mining faster and high level fighting faster etcvets your more than ok here gives you more people to shoot chuckles
katarlia simov who is whinning  learning skills are too hard they sucks they are useless plz remove them whine whine who is whining there its ppl who request that learning skills are removed for years and years that are the whinners your comparison doesnt even make any sense plz get some sense in what you are saying go back to wow you are not on the right forumanyway i dont care to what they are gonna do they have probably taken their decision if its even true just dont insult me by telling nobody will be penalized thats a lie and is a totally poor and wrong reasoning now they do what they have to do and i know what will be the consequences to my character and many others if you think i spent 3months doing that without a tiny little bit of inner will and that im gonna start crying because you flame me you are surely mistaken im out of here
ive spent over 2 billion isk on improved learning implants 5s for many altshow will ccp deal with people who now have learning implants that will soon train nothing
ccp say they want to remove learning skills did you even read the op  you sir are the one whining basically you are saying that you didnt get much mileage out of your first couple of months because you maxed learning but you didnt have to train it and certainly you didnt need to put it to 5 the comparison is to illustrate that maxing one skill group always comes at the expense of another yes they are useful in their own ways but they wont let you actually go kill stuff ie playing the main content of the gamealso ive been in eve since just before exodus never played wow although i did spend some time playing tabras and cov just fyi really edit  im not insulting you im telling you that on a factual level you will not be penalized in the sense that you will be in the same or better position after the changes than before it was your choice to waste your first few months in eve doing nothing and equally you could have neglected learning to put all you frigate skills to level 5 and it would be equally wasted noone forced you to sit in station and do nothing you chose to you can run the rookie missions in an ibis then the level 1s without actually training any further skills than you get at generation the only way that game time is wasted in eve is if you choose to do nothing also loling at your inner will stomping off when you dont win an argument is a wonderful way to demonstrate that
the implants are attribute enchancers so they improve your sttributes and not the learning skills
i would support any measure to remove learning skills they are nothing more than a barrier to new players joining
not supportedthere is no problem to require a solution learning skills have brought many people into the game and i have never once seen anyone one put off by them quite to the contrary i wont support any dumbing down of eve online
fitz please tell me that was a trolland for you people that are saying not supported once again let me reiterate this is going to happen ccp said it is going to once they can figure out how to do it properly its not a we want something to happen thread its a we know you are doing it and this is how we want you to do it thread you saying not supported and then ing about how it does x or y ccp doesnt care that it does those things and tbh they need to be taken out my main started with mining five and industry five and cald frigate three when i made him a miner 25 years back my alt started with 1s everywhere and a whole 5k sp or whatever was worthless pile of crap for first two months or whatever until he got to the rank one level five rank 3 level four like i bet 70 percent or more of the game has them trained to ccp doesnt want people going this is  and quitting after a month of not being able to do  and if you are going to call stuff dumbing down the game taking out learning skills isnt where i would start start at something like the time it took to use bombs a couple of patches ago vs now 10 day or so difference
it is not going to happen ccp were considering it but now consider it impossible due to the fact most people want to keep them
i support this purely because learning skills are pointless and act as a time sink
i think that learning skills should be removed as well but with a few differences from the op instead of just a permanent 10 and 10 to all attributes it should be a 89 that is redistributable through remapshow it would work is all players would be given a boost to there attributes and the next time they remap their attributes those new point would be redistributable this would mean that the max attribute allowed when remapping would have to be raised so that final attribute levels are the same as nowcurrently the max any character can get is 33 15 base  10 skills  5 implant  10 on a primary attribute and 2449 base  10 skills  5 implant  10 on a secondary my idea is to change the max allowed level of one attribute to be 28 28  5 implant  33 and the max for the rest be 20 20  5 implant  25this would result in the being able to maintain the highest sp gain currently available while also allowing for remapping to target more than one skill group even with adding 8 to all attributes and pushing two to the max 28 and 20 there would still be 16 points left over to distribute this means you could have assuming all 5 implants 33 in one attribute 25 in two others and the last two have 6 and 5also to all the people who say that nobody is forced to train learning skills and all those arguments it doesnt matter the simple fact is that a large enough percentage of newer players are not staying with eve because of things like learning skills they are also unnecessary skills are a secondary effect for the game they add to a players ability to play the game to their liking by increasing their ability to make things explodebuild thingsmine things etc learning skills are a tertiary effect they increase a players ability to increase their ability to play the game to their liking they are not necessary to play the game so why have them
do not supporttraining them is not that big of a deal and i for one did not wait to have them trained to have fun
do not supporti love the learning skillsalways remember caps lock is the cruise control for cool
yes please can we have folders back
summaryallow an option governed by a role that when creating a bookmark it can be made for corp and thereby accessible by all members of a corporationintroductionover the past few months ccp has been implementing a number of welcome changes which improve ingame corp communication however there is one area which to this point has not received much attention despite being an item used everyday this item is bookmarks the problemwhenever a bookmark is created it is limited to the creator of that bookmark unless transferred to someone else while this is generally not a problem for a small group of players when this expands to a corporate level its a nightmare for example on any given day in my wh based corporation we can have between 4 and 40 bookmarks that must be distributed amongst all members the click and drag process falls flat here as bookmarks can only be returned 5 at a time and human error means that bookmarks occasionally get missed something that can be catastrophic to any operation this also means because every player must do this separately a great strain on the eve servers as it is repeated amongst every corporation operating in a similar mannerin more known space based corps the main use of bookmarks seems to be tactical ones this presents an issue as all new members must individually make there own bookmarks or go through a similar process to wormholes of transferring the bookmarks to their people and places then moving them back for the next new recruitif bookmarks are to be transferred via copies this relies fairly heavily on the owner of those bookmarks getting somewhere to hand them out this can be prevented by disconnects crashes other players or real life and can be extremely detrimental to the corp operationsthe solutionthe easiest way to fix this is to create an option for bookmarking that allows it to be accessed by all corporation members a folder like the default agents folder titled corporation bookmarks would be added to people and places bookmarks could either be dragged here or when created a checkbox make available for corp would be checked and accomplish the same thing to avoid abuse both access to and creation of said bookmarks would be governed by a role benefitsno more handing out bookmarks individuallyevery corp member has the same set of bookmarksless server load due to not having to load a hangar full of bookmarksstreamlining of corp operationsconclusionthis is a simple and easy fix to an issue thats plagued eve since players decided they wanted to coordinate their movements to things not immediately rightclickable
yes please
love the ideaof course spies would love it even better 
i suport
oh please gawd yes
most definitelyi included this in my list of top problems with wormhole life would make a huge positive difference in the day to day life of all wormhole dwellers
bookmarks needs redesigning
great idea if implemented well
the thing about huge naps is everyone can agree in principle that theyre kind of dull but the first alliance to drop theirs will be crushed by the ones that dont people do this because it is necessary the only way to get smaller groups is for game mechanics to reward them
most of the problems are becuase you can cross enitire galaxy with entire fleet in no time no cost and no risk to your teritory this is blob and nap firendly and it is how you ending with the current 00 affairs
three powerblocks give enough room for interesting wars what is needed is more fluid warfare between the blocks so no blob vs blob anymore to achieve this eve needs to give space between a and b more meaning so if you as a fleet know where the enemy is you go around them and strike them where their defenses are light what this also should mean is that these fleets should also be able to do meaningful damage behind the lines if it takes 24hours to take something down it gives the enemy blob enough time to respond resulting in blob vs blob againright now going around an enemy is impossible since there are enough gameplay mechanics to let you travel large distances as a group as long as this is easy to do there will be blob vs blob fight simple answer why people blob is because the can if they are forced to guard their territory over a wider front where distance actually matters it will become a different game
firstly the client has little problem updating several parameters for hundreds of objects that are firing at each other in real time granted the current state of performance is considerably worse than what we know the game to be capable of ive seen lagless fights with hundreds in local and mostly on gridsecondly to reduce server strain the auto scanner only has to look for a subset of objects within the star system say piloted ships or anything with a warp drive that is player controlled theres simply no need for it to look at anything elseccp devs rejected simple automation of the current directional scanner while talking of the need for some replacement mechanic for a delayed local please come up with a new reason to diss these ideas your current one doesnt work

do want
i like my idea of medieval corpse launcher better tbh
this
assuming this is an easyquick fix theres no reason not to support very frustrating to lose a 100 million isk order to this would gladly settle for just the warning since i almost never cancel orders
this maybe battleclinic will stop requiring accounts and passwords they already prevent bots from scanning their killmails by limiting views by an ipday
you do realize that there are many 05 systems that are not on the border also 05 is highsec  get over ityour gameplay should adapt to the game not the game to your gameplay
man you people get really upset over this idea its kind of cute to watch the alt posters coming out of the wood works to defend their precious carebear empires i want to point out that since insurance prices are now directly related to mineral prices bs have been plummeting and for the cost of one pre tyrranis bs i can now buy 23 depending on the bs happy suicide ganking for all 
well seems my yesterdays post disappeared but im stubborn and i will write it again and again if i will have towhy dont make upgradeable ccs via isk for example you buy basic cc place it on planet then if you got skill high enough you can use upgrade button with isk cost equal to next one cc lvl and you can upgrade such basic cc up to max lvl since ccs are seeded by npcs they wont protest that less people buy one cc and upgrade than buying standard and later on improved advanced and elite
saved fittings is sweet delicious cake i absolutely love it but come on lets put that cherry on top  it couldnt be too difficult to implement could itallow saved fits to also save groupedweapons mode it quickly gets annoying having to regroup after changing a fit please edit grammar and clarity
what is the issue with making wh space a viable part of the gameseveral issues that have been raised in the past seem to be over lookedeg sov wh space still can not be sovdthe t3 market is ccp manipulating the marketim a t3 ship builder and its insanethe cost of melted nano ribbons with the c320 and c540 is damned near the cost of what a t3 ship sells for on the market not to mention all the the materials and time invested in the extremly compicated process to build a t3 shipi find it hard to believe that t3 ship builders areselling the ship hulls for less than they can sell the materials used to build the shipsthe skill needed and the time invested in building these ships is insurmountableplease can we address this issuei understand why ccp would be supplying the market as the skills required to be a t3 ship builder scared virtually everyone away and not to mention wh space has been glossed overand any player who actually trained the t3 ship skills would have to have been a long term player in game and would realize that they were not making a profitmaybe ccp could make the materials to build the ships more accessablethanks for your time
after reading that i think its unlikely we will not be able to find any common ground i think many people in fw are falling into one of two camps those who want more npcs so frigates cant take larger plexes and those who want to do away with the npcs and make occupancy a soley pvp activity the more i see this split the more i think we may want to make 2 faction wars one in high sec where you can do plexes like they are currently set up and missions and other pve activities for occupancy the other could be in low sec where occupancy is based on pvp the current occupancy system where pvp and pve are supposed to go hand in hand is a failure blame the players if you want but very few people want to do that if players dont want to play the occupancy game then its a failure and its time to redo itas far as your critique of the ops proposal i think either you or i do not understand the proposal because as i see it none of the negatives you give the plan apply  blobs if an enemy blob sits in one corner of the map doing plexes thats fine you can just go to all the other parts of the fw map and run plexes all the systems will have cps to run unless they are in the 8 hour cool down there are like 70 systems per front the side that chooses to split up will get more plexes than the side that chooses to blob blobbing would definitely not be the way to win this war instead this war would be won by strategically placing the minimum amount of pilots at key locations in order to secure them just like in real wars if you commit resources to one battlearea you may regret not having them for a battle somewhere else also if we include the resetting counter idea then the side that chooses to stay and fight will get more than the side that runs every time someone comes in hence neither blobbing nor hide and seek plexing will be the optimal way to plex here alarm clock ops first i dont see the rewards justifying this if people want to wake up in the middle of the night to gain an extra 5 lp bonus well what can i say give it to them i will continue to play casually and not sweat itsecond the war is constant there will be constant cps popping up though out the day after the cooldown so no time zone will have any advantage if by some very slight chance all of them do tend to pop up at the same times then they can make adjustments to fix this easily for example they could say no cp1 will spawn within UFFFD hour of another spawning again here one thing you should keep in mind is this war does not end until one side stops fighting one side may have all the systems but that just means the other side will be able to run control points in all of the systems until they get one back  intel channel spam the intel of the cpsplexes being taken will not be posted in militia they will be posted in a different channel entirely there will be one channel for the cald gallente front and one for the amarr minmatar front that way if you are in one of the front you can just close the intel channel for the other front but the short information 1207 kamela major amarrcearain battle cruiser should only take about one line even with the window is pretty narrow so you can have about 30 of these on one page with a narrow window if you widen the window you can likely have about 500 of these messages on one page lets face it if we get that many people running plexes at one time on one front this will be a huge success if it ends up like that it will indeed be time for ccp to expand the fw idea into other fronts like pirate factions but for now the occupancy mechanism is a complete failure so why expand a failed idea
heres my proposal and the problem it is meant to partially addressproposal given its history of futility ccp should stop introducing surprise features that nobody asked for and that are completely atodds with the harsh essence of eve like the ezmode buying sp or perhaps swappingout sp option they are now threatening us with the development pipeline must include a mandatory consultation with players before new gamebreaking changes are decided uponproblemccp has demonstrated time and again that they arent very good to put it mildly at developing or maintaining an internet spaceships game built on a sandboxphilosophy they lack both the wisdom to differentiate between good changes and gamebreaking changes and the competence to properly implement whatever changes they end up seemingly arbitrarily deciding on think fw or an economy that for months was built entirely around selfdestructing battleships for profit or the npc pi market debacle or the significant increase in lag that recent expansions have brought with them or the unpunished pl not in local haxx or the rampant macrominers and macroratters or the deepsafe nerf that is alleged to have succeeded at nothing but breaking the ability to safely log in any safe or the recent downtimeeve is a sandbox game its harshness complexity steep learning curve and the time sink required to gain proficiency in it are what make the game great ccps recent expansions and future plans seem at odds with each of these virtues instead of focusing on fixing the myriad of bugs banning the bots and avoiding colossal blunders that give players riskfree windfall profits running to the tens of billions of isk they seem determined to make new eden friendlier easier and more appealing to the masses who they imagine clamor for ez mode farmville and spacebookccp we love eve because its hard not because its easy we wish youd stop breaking it yes this game has a huge tank but its a buffer tank and your dps is unrelenting if you keep trying to attract the wow hordes at the risk of alienating your player base by introducing broken fluff after broken fluff while letting bugs fester for years you will ultimately succeed only in the latter
the inference being that you enjoy poorly developed and maintained games built on a sandboxphilosophy enough to maintain an account honestly leading a proposal off with ccp sucks at their collective job is a lack of appreciation for the anthropic principle that brought you to post but i digress i am more than willing to be wrong on this one  wheres the buy sp page i dont think there is one and instrumenting sp grants which might be an excellent way to appologize for blown downtime estimates in the future does not an ez mode make in short what the frak are you talking aboutm
what the hell is the op going on about
tldri cant kill anyone and people sit in highsec where i cant just kill everything that moves for free
youll have to wait for it its a surprise
can i haz your stuffyour proposal is not accepted here they do put out stuff on sisi to experiment with and generally they are quite open about what is about to happen more open than most other mmos i have been playing this is a hard game yes and it continues to be a hard game dont limit yourself to what you think thats fun to play there are others in this game and there are also other developers that want to make their contribution to eve let them tharill
it would be helpful to know when someone is headed out the door
directors dont get leaving notice so they probably shouldnt get abouttoleave notice either still not a bad idea
okay as we all know bringing a new player into a l4 mission only serves to entice them to join your corp or to keep them interested in the game with something to look forward to i suggest that we make it more rewarding for a new player by making bounties increased for players that put a warp scrambler 2x extra or disruptor 15x extra on a ratthis would teach new players how to tackle and fit for tackling how to maintain transversal for pvp and maybe desensitize them to losing ships by having target switching when rats get scrambled who knows maybe they might enjoy tackling and be able and willing at the next roami doubt it would be abused by solo mission runners since mid slots couldnt really be sacrificed for tackle multiboxers wouldnt gain much either since it would be kinda difficult to manage aggro dps and your tacklingthoughts
i dont think its a good idea for a lot of ships it is not exactly difficult to sacrifice a cap recharger for a scrambler you just lose a small amount of tank for what effectively is doubled income l4 missions already pays great and this effective uberbuff is not necessary plus one cannot learn pvp from turning on a scrambler on a rat bs
youve seriously never thought people triple boxed pvp i do not see how this would be any harder no way this wont do anything but assure mission runners fit points also if a person wants to learn to tackle why not just have them actually tackle something useful like a hostile ship funny thing about players vs npc players dont just burn at you and orbit
i dont know why ccp is making peoples life difficult when it comes to this but used crystals when fitted on a ship prevents people from contracting said ship to other peoplethis includes lasers and mining lasersat the very least ccp allow people to remove crystals without having to be at the ship physically
or at the very least just allow a these crystals are damaged do you still want to accept the contract yn dialogue
the ability to fit lasers is not restricted to amarr nor is the ability to fit crystals to t2 strips on mining barges and exhumersaside from that the idea is sound and i support it in general we be able to unload ammo and cargo from ships remotelysigned
forgot about mining crystals ill fix it 
how about this the process period of a pilotcorporation leaving a corpalliance in the following equationpilotcorp time spent with corpalliance is tfactor of 10 is called kwhen leaving a corpalliance the cooldown is ll  tkexception the corpalliance votes on kicking the said pilotcorporation then this process defaults to 24 or 48 hours the longer you are in a corp the harder it is to just pack up and leave unless the said entity is kicking you for whatever reasons they deem fit
some people have been in my corp for two years it will take them two and a half months to leave where is sense in that
supported make it a week
i dont really see what the problem is if they drop an alliance to protect a tower then one must assume they will be joining one when the smoke has cleared  petition the corporation for alliance hopping and let the gms slap them around a bitor is it no longer considered circumventing the roe and an exploit by ccp
hoping this was serious postthis change would not help much anything just logoff your gatecamping toon and put alt scout in neighbouring is that a word english plox system and log your real toon on only when target is jumping or something if it bothers you so much tbhbecause theres no real alternative for lame alt scouts we got to live with them as it is this belongs to category should have been made better 2003 but ccp cba to do it
im considering putting forth an actual proposal but wanted some feedback first the limitation of cargo type in assembled ships holds during storage in the maintenance bay seems inelegant and arbitrary to me while there are already mechanical inelegancies in eve do not put this box in that larger box you cant know what will happen this one actually gets on my nerves a bit if assembled ships cargoes were unrestricted what would the world look like and would we like it better1 how much of an actual cargo buff to the ship would it be to the best of my knowledge you cant get 2 assembled industrials into an orca that means an ittyv so 40km3 is this math right if so thats a what 25 increase2 with fully cargod ships available what game styles change does this help or hurt miners pirates industrialists3 is there some technical limitation that the current behavior is meant to mask and it needs to work as currently implemented4 is the limitation strictly for keeping overall m3 balance with other existing hullscommentary appreciatedperspective disclosure i own an orca can fly industrial v cant fly freighter cant fly rorqual
it might be an item database issue not 100 sure its just a logical stab in the dark
it was a nerf to carriers back in 2007 rorquals didnt exist jump freighters didnt exist and titans were extraordinarily rare so 00 logistics worked primarily through carriers and dreads cargofit dreads existed but the more common play was to stick haulers and barges filled with mineralcompression items into carriers smasback when small tractors compressed mins 961 and use that to haul multiple capitals worth of minerals per load they decided that carriers were too good so they proposed a suite of nerfs mineral compression items got nerfed ships in smas became unable to carry anything but ammo and there was a proposal to make it so that carriers could only run 5 drones themselves and would have to assign the rest to other ships though thankfully that one got overturned by player rage but yeah the restriction exists for a reason not a perfect reason and one thats somewhat obsolete nowadays but thats why might be worth revisiting it though
signed on the dead horse thread and gave it mouth to mouth a few times supported the support thread so i guess ill have to support this1 signed supported etc
oh a baitvote for you mister if you read  zhis  most resolved  not more then 30  mmhatm there is nothing excellence do you have future plans for eve ccp its not clear ps other vendors not sleeping  perpetuumonline is starting myb not so nice graphic but its not the only onecheck my site for updates 
yeah if ccp could do just 1 expansion with fully fixing the old bugs from the old ones fw etc would be cool supports deirdras proposal
marketing works thread supported
quality beats quantity allmost of the time ccp has given us a good product but what keeps it from being great i enjoy this game even if it has a list of bugs mileskms long i just wonder how much better of a target i would be if the bugs were gone maybe even look at some archival ideas to see if they would be applicable like removable hanger decks for nondrone carrying ships to the fun factor of eveall we can do is bring forth the issue and hopefully some one acts on it i support the proposal
is there any reason why anyone shouldnt support this editbtw ccp must not allow a modable ui it would allow macros and botso rly it just might allow them as if they are not already a significant portion of total account numbers and their bots deal with fugly ui quite well
ccp comit to exelence no feature left behind no more broken for unfinished features coughpicough ccp needs to devote the next expansion to going back and fixing thier mistakes eve millenium anyone soudns like a good name to me
interestingly i randomly came across this blog post today on twitter and it hit on almost everything in dvs proposal i found it to be a very interesting perspective from a new playerwhy i quite eve online after my first hoursome quotesi immediately noticed how tiny the text was leaning in and squinting a little i continued through the character creation process i admit i didnt read any of the text explaining the different races as it was a strain on my eyesi was a bit overwhelmed by the amount of menus and submenus to navigate just to perform simple tasks an array of buttons sit on the left side of the screen each button opens a series of menus tabbed windows and lists each window imitates microsoft windows with the little x and minimize functions i felt more like i was navigating an operating system with an animated wallpaper than i was playing a gamei searched for gameplay footage battles missions anything i could watch that would change my mind the only thing i saw was more of the same opening and closing windows selecting items from menus and switching tabs and viewing lists in text that was so small that it was unreadable on most videossomething thats been a personal annoyance of minemy ship left the space station and flew directly through it on its way out it flew through the space station not around it i couldnt believe the last redeeming quality of this game being the graphics was taken away from me
just gonna take a moment to interject heredestroyers are really good t1 ships i can take a catalyst and wipe the floor of any basic t1 frig and take on most faction level frigs no problem hell ive easily popped the unweary first assult stealth bomber and intercepter who thought that they were gettting froggyso as a t1 hull as they exist now are just fine and do a really really good job at what they are supposed to be doing but thats the problem its only a t1 hullnow the problem is everyone is trying to make them usable and viable in a world filled with assult ships and cruisers on the battle field interdictors are very niche and they do worse at handling frigs than their t1 counterpartsthe solution is not to make these great t1 hulls even stronger its to finally push over and make dedicated t2 combat hulls for them drop the sig radius and give them a bonus to small module repboost amount that would definately make them quite viable on todays battlefield
i would love to see something along this lines
the ship would need a small cargo bay for carrying ship mods and fuel if ship being carried uses a jump drive  black ops a 10000m3 cargo bay would be enuff
god damnit that can only do one battleship at a timewould ppl stop trying to push this off as an actual solution if u use nothing but couriers u end up using a bigger ship to move a smaller shipu want to make moving multiple rigged bses slower
freighters can already carry rigged shipscourier system boys and girls couriernot supported
no not supportedi cant find the source but the last time ccp said they were interested in removing learning skills it was a number of years ago sometime after another ccp representative said it was unlikely they would ever do so typically it is people who have a reason to complain who will do so on these forums and as far as i can tell most players i know are happy with learning skills i have found that new players are actually encouraged by themif learning skills were removed i would say that the remaining emphasise on skill points would shift towards implants that are currently quite costly this could well have the effect of making players less liable to move to 00 or low sec or engage in pvp since the only real benefit they have left from the implants could be lost and need to be replacedlooking at threads like this one i can see that there is real opposition to a change in learning skills in my opinion that while not unanimous players on the whole are happy with learning skills i have had many players over the years thank me for my time in teaching why they are so important and i have never had one person since late 2006 suggest they were a bad idea this makes me feel we are seeing the unhappy few complainingi really do hope that learning skills stay
oh look the conservatives in the its fine camp are out againfor gods sake how can you not support this with a strait face its a chore and theres no reason for it stop acting like training learning skills is somehow a thoughtful and strateigic thing to do its blatantly obvious training up learnin skills is beneficial in the long run theres no question about it the payoff might only be realised after a year or more but its there so anyone with half a clue will be training them as quickly as possibleive got learning 55 on three characters total and im apalled this is still an issue
it isnt a chore and it isnt an issue im apalled that anyone would think so
learning skills are not more of a chore than any other skill learning skills are just a part of a skillsystem with one basic trait getting sp takes time the whole skilltrainingsystem can be seen as a chorei mean why does skills have training time multipliers isnt it a chore to train skills that take months with training time multipliers of five or more the multipliers just have one purpose and that is to make sure that acquiring that skill take lots of timemaybe ccp should take away the multipliers or at least make it so that no skill have higher multiplier than 3 those that already have those skills will not lose anything how can you defend the chore of having to train skills with multipliers of 412 having learning skills can essentially be seen as the rest of the skills have a smaller timemultiplier learning skills put you in the awkward position of having to choose between a shorttime benefit and benefits that are far ahead in the future so there is the possibility to plan and also to make poor choices i took my time to get through the learning skills training lots of other skills in between sure i could have a few more sp now if i took a faster rout big dealif you are new in the game and want learning skills just like anybody else then you have to go through the same steps as anybody else
oh look its the entitlement crew out for a strollharden up learning skills are an option they provide depth to the game go play your fps on the xbox 360 if you want a shallow game some of us use our brains and hands when playing eve i realize that may be difficult for you i know  sue someone sure entitlement at its best i dont have to work for stuff i should just be given it because im specialhtfu or get off the ride
so ccp are implementing a system for distributing pools of skill pointsdid somebody say speculation
thats your definition of depth
the argument that by training learnings only for the first 2 months means you will lose out on a reimbursement is flawedfor each of those learning skills you have trained you have increased your sphour for the duration of those 2 months these increases allowed you get the next tier of learning faster which in turn allowed you more sphour the net effect of this is that over the 2 months where the hypothetical other character didnt train learnings and just trained for things that made isk is that you will have something that isk cant buy more spsif learning skills are removed you will still have received the benefit of training them through the bonus they gave you while you were training them when your sp are reimbursed you will end up in a better position that the other guy so how are you losing out
learning skills are bad game design this should have been done a long time ago supported
not supportedthe reasons are many and varied most of them eloquently outlined herethe only way i would even slightly consider supporting the removing of learning skills is if after it was all said and done reimbursementwise everyone had their attributes set back to their original low values with no way to raise themlearning skills wouldnt look so bad then would they
why not let every one roll a jedi right out of the gate why make them do any training at all its so unfair that every one cant fly a titan their first week in no waitthats stupid it makes games fail also veterans ing about having to train stuff on their alts is what i see here new players dont know anything about learning skills until some vet comes along and berates them for not having them all to level 5 people figure out the best balance on their own few ship few weapons few learning no one except vets sit and train learning skills for two weeks stop trying to dumb down the game
not supported and this is why
to all comparing potential removal of learning skills to swgnge go burn in hellwhen i started playing i spend more than half of time of first two months learning damn learning skills and it was annoying as hell if i learn someship level 4 skill i get to fly that ship better you spend tons of time learning learning skills without any immediate or direct benefits you only know that it will pay out over a long period of time there is harsh and cruel and there are needless timesinksas for learning to level 5 holy smoke i understand that people got basics to 5 when it was prequel to advanced learning but now a two year plan in evemon will give me a 5 day speedup with 3 basic learning skills to 5 i wonder how long skillplan would i have to make for all to 5 to give a 10 minute bonus
to train or not train learning skills is just another part of eve its like deciding to train for a hulk or for better mining lasers to training faster weapon cycle or longer range its a tactical decision that all players face if you dont like them dont train them im happy to pronounce that i got almost all of them to 5 and cruising along most skills
dear ccpthey need to be back as soon as humanly possibly i used them heavily it cannot be that hard for ccp to re add them it is unacceptable not to be able to sort people into custom folders when i sort people standings do not matter for example i have folders such as friends corp alts folders for my alts and each of my friends alts trade transportation missions kos wormholes production etc i had folders for about each reason there could be the 5 standing tabs do not do the job i need to be able to sort my contacts as i see fiti even had folders with just one person in them so i could find them real quick and not have to search through all my contactsthank you for the future reinstatement of contact folderszykrus
where did my folders go oh ccp deleted them good work guys if someone got a thread 8 pages long in just a month of ppl complaining about not having folders with a if not extremely close to 100 agreemeant that they should be back 2 words to you at ccp epic failps 1 supported and all that jazz
yes please
yes please
supported
me is supporting this
this is of basically zero use to me but hell a good idea is a good idea
support reinstalling eve is 25 the install process and 75 getting everything setup again
ty everyone for support bump from iceland
cloud computing is the future
1 no honestly asking for problems with people doing settings their monitorcomp doesnt support and there are barely graphics options anyway2 definately3 definately
if ccp wants to push every one to low and null sec which is apparent with the lvl 5 mission fix and all the high lvl 4 agents in low sec why not make the missions more like pvp if pvp is the end game then why doesnt the only combat related carebear activity not prepare you for actual combat pve would actually happen in lowsec maybe mission runners being fit for pvp may actually create some pirate tears or give them targets who actually might make them earn the killmissions need a revamp rats need to be smarter and use pvp tactics preparing players for what this game intendedshooting people in the face
so because the situation is terrible and broken we shouldnt fix it
this would be great
good idea
100 times yes
hmm i am pretty sure ccp stated that living in wormholes wasnt actually what they had in mind so seing this happen is hard for mebut i support it to the fullest
if you have spais they have access to the bookmarks that are shared to the corp already be it via a hanger or a canif my pod is capable of transfering my consiousness hundreds of lightyears in the instant before it explodes why then can my ship not transmit spatial coordinates to other shipslets not forget to bring up the lag that is generated when copying bookmarks or when opening a container that has bookmarks inside itand who in their right mind would limit the number of bookmarks that can be copied at one time to five
would love to see this change
two thumbs up from me
good idea
dont even have to read past the topic title to support this
give us corp bookmarks please
i approve of this change i think its a good first step in fixing some of the issues that the current bookmark system has
would make wh life much easiersupported
ccp already did it with corp fittings why not do it with bmsnot only people in whs use bms everyone does do it like the fittings setup limit the numbers of bookmarks a corp can have at any given time if its necessarie but please do it
as with every time this issue is raised i support this improvement
yes please
supported and hi wulf
10
hmmm why didnt anyone think of this before support
i agree
would be useful
yes please would be really great for residents of wspace makes sense to add it in
not really
you seriously made a character just to alt post in this thread with a 2nd altin all seriousness i do not think your 21 man 0  tax corp is going to hold sov regardless of mechanics
thats not my char i only keep 2 chars for the forums and that isnt one of them this char aside i have been sincere about everything i have said once again the issue isnt diplomacy its the ability to as you goons once said being able to blue all of 00 freelyanyway last few days i have been checking around talking etc and i have came up with the following1 alliance are  scared funny enough sc dont really care as they have been against the odds many times dr dont care either but nc were hugely offended by my comments s having diplomacy changes where bluing everything within 40 jumps was changed was a worrying factor for some 2 00 is pretty much a joke it really is a case of who can crash the node or blob first vs how active a person is interestingly a strategy less practiced by certain alliances and used as an only strategy by some3 everything else i stated a few posts ago00 whine all the time they want empire to move there and it isnt fair that xxx is allowed to get risk free isk etc but its ironic since 00 is comical and makes empire look goodyou want empire to have some interest in 00 you give them a reason players will never much like sov issues change their diplomatic ways unless ccp intervene and until that happens you can class 00 as uneventful and boring where 3 powerblocs continue to ermm do something in 00 while they macro ratlooking at historical events i can understand why you are so quick to be against this anyway but if ccp did change this i would hope for it to not be completely antinc but really i guess if ccp changed diplomacy making it difficult or inefficient to nap you guys would be the first effected shame
haha ok now i know youre trolling
you tell em edgive it up guys you want ccp to make changes to do the work for you and that is just not how this game is played
nothing you can do will actually change 00 without alienating players and ccp wont do thatif you say removed blue standings and naps etcwithin 24hours all corps in each bloc would reform into three new super alliances called northern coalition southern coalition and so onyou cant just tell the coalitions to break up because the label says player driven so if we form blocks well there you goif it bothers you form a great crusade call forth the corporations of empire to make a vast horde that shall darken the skies of nullsec and carve a new empire then pick a region and conquer it if you dont want to join one of the big three and feel there needs to be more variety dont just say this sux force the blocks to break up get some friends and make a new faction and do it yourselfthat said if ccp did double our income from anomalies and such living in smaller areas would begin to be more viable as it is a few people can earn isk roughly equivalent of l4 per system but its not many
confirming the bawwww is strong with this threadthe stench of entitlement to current holdings is rancid 9 of 10 wouldnt be able to retain their current borders if it wasnt bloody impossible to take anything these days and so the grabass continues unabatedi suppose you all think its good design to funnel players from npc empire into player empire halariously ive had fewer ship losses in 00 because of naping than in actual empire space and im sure that im not the only one both of which are propped up by game mechanics designed to promote border stability rather than actual dynamic playerdriven competitionno this isnt fist and no naps dont make for interesting warfare pull your head out of your collective naping asses and realize there hasnt been an interesting null conflict in ages its time for change
maybe your right but its not ccps buisness to make pvp conform to your expectations its up to you to change it by getting allies  pvp has a player on both sidesthough i for one will live in my npc empire as they are less demanding land lords but i look forward to your campaign going out to teach them nap blocks a lesson
you seriously made a character just to alt post in this thread
i feel your pain the ever increasing blobsnaps is why i went lowsec instead  00 fun is far to erratic ie few and far between to be of any use except as an isk printing machineas already stated the deevolution of gameplay cannot be stopped as it is tied to human nature nap trains are here to staywhat we can and should do is create ability for small entities to exist alone and make small scale warfare viable ie impact sovereign space without nodecrash fleets  with an option of actual fun to be had without waiting for the last 700 people to arrive the number of people wantingneeding to nap up will stagnatehuman nature can be challenging to influence but it is doable
until everything and i mean all things  skill books infrastructure upgrades bps the last npc seeded goods can be made locally in 00 alliances need reliable access to empire in order to sustain themselvesnow with regions like branhc period basis omist outer passage these are far and isolated from empire so access to empire becomes an issue of incredible military force or napsthe people next to them end up in similar grounds and next thing you know you have either a nap conga line to empire or one all powerful alliance its neighbours nap with it or nap together agains itand thus the situation is born
that ought to be right but as weve pointed out  in this very thread  the situation is such that some players cannot become involved and those who currently are involved cannot be motivated to change this fact allowing the status quo is a defacto statement that no new alliances or corps aside from those born out of present power blocks will be allowed in nullsec and that current alliances will not have the freedom to war as they see fit but rather must first consider their geographical block politic first and foremostthis isnt a purely player contruct changes to sov game mechanics in null and changes elsewhere have all come together to create this perfect storm of cowardice i dont think its realistic to say that naps can end hell they might even get larger without a major player or ccp taking initiative and since were already ruled out players taking that initiative out of selfinterest to the obvious dogpile
for the record ending naps wont have people bombard you for what i have gathered atlas dislike it as much as nc do but due to dominion mechanics wont invadei can see why nc has to continue to be naped its their only advantage to well getting attacked would explain why in the past 3 years node crashes have mainly occurred when nc are around in fact i am yet to find this not be the casei will spare the caod talk since i will be up against the whole of nc and dont wish to be blobbed as for sc it appears there is no longer a coalitionso theres nc same gang since 2005 more than 12 regions napped with blues reaching more than 50 jumps awayit coalition delve querious fountainaaa coalitionatlas coalitionprovidence ffa independent however aaa will intervene on sov warsatlas coalitiondrone region coalition size wise look big but relatively smaller than other coalitionssouthern independent alliances such as goonswarm mk iii pl which are part of the nc napfestsouthern independent alliances with and without sov such as ev0ke no doubt will get hotdropped once mh are close to dieonce again apologies to saying theres 3 nap fests currently theres only one major one judging by this thread you can see who
i dont think you understand 00 politics at all
i dont think you do either tbh
we cant always live in interesting times
grouping up is players choice personally i would like nul to be more chaotic and alittle less blobby make it deadly to blob like in the battle dust thread and people will stop it is impossible to stop major alliances forming alliances with eachother isnt the point of an alliance to group up for joint defence there is no reason to make the alliance stop all it does is make the wars 10x more epic when they do happen aka daily multinode crashing with 3000 ships
will obviously you have no room to speak in this topic seriously check you info noob rorquals have never been able to use gates they can use jump bridges you are right there but they take up massive amounts of fuel and further more you know a titan pilot that would bridge a rorqual 
the guy who thinks a rorq can use gates needs to recheck his facts
jump bridges on rorquals would encourage low sec and null sec mining i cant imagine anyone who would fly a hulk down through pirates and camps just to get to a mining op and no one brings out a rorqual and its maintenance bay with 5 ships just for 5 pilotsi support
signedthe idea of different command center levels is pretty odd
why would anyone bother trainig command centers past level 1 then it makes perfect sense
mmos should not be simple especially not eve
lol its not about easily being able to make that amount of isk its about people actually having to train for it wich you obviously cant be bothered to do but to be honest with you before this idea even gets considered wich it shouldnt be in any way shape or form by ccp you could have trained that skill to 5 numerous times  just train it and quit being lazy
because in eve skills have five levels
well obviously the skill would be changed if such an idea was to be implemented for example 15 grid and cpu per lvl of command centers whole idea is that a colony would be upgraded as the skill increased rather than just be liquidated
this would be more logical which of course is not allowed by ccp things must be arcane and a pain in the ass otherwise it is not eveimo 1 cc for each planet type and cpugrid expand like they do for our ships would be a better system
ok i am all for cloakies and covert ops and recons etc but its becoming a bit ridiculous that gangs of ships can camp systems for long periods of time and be pretty much invunerable and combined these gangs can be formiddable even when uncloakedso lets say you have a rapier pilgrim stealth bomber arazu all nice cloaked specialise ships but also have some serious teeth especially when used to together now again im not concerned about these ships the point is as mentioned abovenow something has to be done about being able to detect where these are im not saying make it easy but perhaps have another skill perhaps covert probing you need max probing skills also maybe and perhaps a specialised covertrecon probing shipbut damn do something this is not on that nothing can be done about gangs like this
so your idea is basically to make stealth ships notdo i even have to point out why this is a bad idea
i say no sure stealth bombers are strong but they do insta pop
let me translate im not saying make it easy but let it be done by a single skill with high prerequistes and a specialized shipare you serious how is that not easy how much more easy can it become if there ever were such a thing implemented which hopefully never ever happensfurthermore probing down cloaked ships is completely negating anything what the cloak is usefull for staying off the scanreports deal with it
dont fix what aint broken
lol thanks for the wall of comments from cloak ship pilotsfunnythis is why i love debates like this because no one puts there thinkinh head onso i guess its ok that a systems can be entirely locked down by quite a formiddable gang of ships as mentioned before and theres not a damn thing you can do about itseriously think about stuff before you postnow to the chap above it wouldnt be a single skill now would it1 skill for being able to probe cloaked ships1 skill for the actual ship which may have prereqsthen you must have all the other probing type skills astro etc to lvl 5 so please tell me how the hell is that easystop taking out of that bum holethats quite training you have to completeso like any specialised training each type of ship must have a counter in some way and this forces that counter but you have to specialise in iti think cloak ships should give off some sort of signature that can only be detectable by specialised probes and again combined with high skills and the right specialised shipdont start crying because i propose away for you to be probed out and you cant sit there cloaked and not actually work for your killsoh sorry you just want it easyforgive me sorrytsk
player a  id like ccp to give us a hisec doomsday deviceplayer b  that would be just rediculousplayer a  waaaaaaaaah 11 elevenone 11 ure not putting your thinkinh head on 11take that cicero
while you are at it please add some skills for getting people out of the stationoutposts when ever i want a kill disabling the pos shields when ever i want a killthen we dont have to cloak for so long until you finally grew some balls to undockleave the pos shieldif you are so afraid of cloaked people  ever thought to adapt your style of playing a bit to be a less easy prey rat in combat fit ships yes it really works rat in groups of 23 guard your mining ops but i guess it is easier to ask for a nerf of others before adaptingadapt or die  pick a sideps i wouldnt worry so much about afk cloaker i would worry about the guys who are not afk
youre going to get flamed to high hell diosas but just for you im actually going to try and work my way through your post and point out where the primary fallacies liewhat do cloaks have to do with ships locking you down what youre suggesting is a way to hunt out hiding cloaked ships the ships that hunt you are going to be constantly moving youre only going to be able to probe a ship thats sitting passively somewhere or other doing basically nothingim trying to picture the scenario in which probing would prevent a cloaked ship from getting cheap kills how exactly do you envision this workinga cloaked ship has two advantages one the ability to hide and two the element of surprise hiding is not an aggressive action its an evasive one so theres no real way to get cheap kills by hiding so lets concentrate on the element of surprisethe element of surprise comes from when youre doing something or other and suddenly a ship decloaks out of nowhere and locks you down before you know whats going on whatever you think of this probing wouldnt help if a ship is actively stalking you youre not going to have time to lock him down and probe the bastard out hes going to be right on top of you before you can even get a general idea of where he isadvicedont post an idea when youve just been killed theres a natural desire to want revenge but trying to get meta and change the system around your opponents is not the way to do itif youre looking for a mercenary corp i hear good things about the nintendo generation or some such
cloaks are fine dont break it
cloakies are supposed to have zero risk to themselves and provide all the risk to noncloakies mining ships pve ships etc its what this game is all about risk to pveers versus rewards for the cloakies so no
this was the part where your post started being wrong everything after that was autofail because it was based on your false initial hypothesiscloaked ships are fine
in before afk cloakeralso no
the only reason id ever want cloaked ships to be found with a probing system would be for people to stop making threads about itbut i dont think its worth it
so if anyone can find a cloaker why would you want to bother with cloaking then
i believe most people want it so that yes anyone can find a cloaker who has been sitting afk for the past hours eve is not a safe game what makes you think you can sit there in your cloak ship for five hours in spot and be safe
my cloak
as has been said to every person when they complain about getting blown up there are only two safe places in eve docked at an npc station and logged out
epic fail op
and cloaked
yeah but you know the old sayingas long as thy dont try to interact with anybody else nor with the environment the cloak will keep you safesun tzu art of war
cloaker ships the only ship class in eve that comes with a builtin pvp flag see a target you can overpower and take on switch that pvp flag on and gank at will cant take on the target easy just keep the pvp flag turned off ie stay cloakedeve a cruel and harsh universe except for cloakies
heres the thing once it becomes possible it will become common once it becomes common cloaked ships will become uselessim ok with the idea of some form of nerf to cloaking but making cloaks detectable is not it increase the decloak radius give cloaks an inertial penalty hell make it so you cant cloak with an aggression timer these ideas dont destroy cloaking but to varying degrees they increase the risks to cloakers while they are on the same grid with others
the scanner needs an overhaul along with local chat but i dont support your idea given the way the dscanner currently works it would kill the server
the scanner needs a change as in its current form it is heavily biased toward the predator style of play i will offer my support not necessarily limited to the ops idea but for a change overall the current scanner needs a serious rethink
just the warning is enough but i support
your order has been canceled  it  atleast warn us its going to happen all it will take to fix is click 3 things and copypaste from the you are about to enter low sec warning message
definetly seems stupid to rip out everything the command center isnt even linked to anything directly in my planet setups
signedbuilding entire networks can be a big chore but replacing an advanced network with an elite network is insane when you cant hit the upgrade button
better yet make is save all of your settings folders bookmarks  everything  to the serverif facebook can do it so can eve
excellent idea
also ammo
got my thumbs
the t3 market might seem impossible right now but something tells me theres more to it than meets the eye for one some people probably mine and undercut without worrying about the price of the stuff theyre mining  such as for the joy of manufacturingothers may have special connections to get the items cheaper or visit hardtoreach places like nullsec to pick up the items in either case this is a playerrun economy so if people have advantages over you theyre gonna take it htfu
the real problem with the t3 market is that the t3 market was broken from day 1 the way it is broken is that every racial variation of hull and subsystems use the exact same materials in the exact same quantities for every race that means one or two materials will always be a bottleneck and the rest will be practically worthless it means every single ship costs the exact same to build and profit margins get eaten up by a lack of diversity the material cost is set by the highest selling hull the profit margins by the lowest selling hullnow consider if each race focused on different materials the average income for a wher would go up the income of t3 producers would go up and the cost of t3 ships would go downanother thing to consider less than half the subsystems are useful enough to be profitable half of whats left is completely worthless if using re you get a worthless bpc you cant sell it youd be stupid to build with it only thing you can do is trash it not sure if that should be fixed but it seems to me that every bpc should at least be able to break even with production costs which could be done by changing the material costs in a way that balances competition between materialsin short yes wht3 needs to be balanced but op doesnt seem to understand the issues and apparently ccps economics phd doesnt seem to either supported because it needs a review not supporting ops suggestion to increase drop rates
suupporting mkmin hannah should get a tiii tinfoil hat
working as intendedwhats the issueps t3 market is fine skill requirements are fine as wellsave a few tweaks in drop rates t3 industry was implemented pretty well the one thing that would bring down prices is the ability to reprocess subsystems as of now a lot of people get bpcs they dont want manufacture before looking at prices and then realize no one wants that crap so they sell for less than the material cost to recoup some of their loss with the ability to buy these items and reprocess them materials would be recycled and prices would possibly drop for the subsystems in higher demandor people could stop building every bpc they get mkmin is right however more diverse material requirements would definitely help lower prices
well i have been in this 1 system for the past 2 days and i have noticed that there are a bunch of macro ice miners here 1 group in particular a 5 man ice mining team that runs 237 today however the hauler of the ice mining group got logged the other 4 are continuing to mine and dropping a load of jet cans in the belt auto reject invitation is on and they dont respond in local this leads me to believe that even after 15 people sent petitions about it ccp does not care if you macro mine personally i love to blow up macro miners however in this case they are in a 7 system and i cant solo suicide them  what do you guys think
the answer you are looking for is1 report them2 get a tempestmaelstrom and kill them 
what fit would you use for a tempest or maelstromand i have reported them no response
typhoon 8x smartbomb maybe a cheap mwd to get into position might as well minimize your losses
what system is this id join in d
systems name is kino
smarties work aswell but not sure he wants the sechit for the pod kill if you just want to get the message over your are not welcome the tempest and maelstrom are enough for the fitting question check the crime and punishment forum they are always helpful with fitting ships for blowing up macro miners
actually apocs are fine and cost as much as maelstroms but dont require lv 5 battleship skills to have as high of an alpha any ship with 8 turret slots works equally well but the apoc is the cheapest one that most players can use and still do max alpha strikefit them with 8 1400mm artillery in the highs target painters and tracking computers in the mids both scripts and gyrostabs in the lows plus maybe one tracking enhancer sentry drones too but theyre unnecessary sometimes you need to load some guns with emp and some with fusion but this makes killing them when concords in the belt trickydisco phoons dont work solo against hulks
he said that theyre ice miners so theyre in mackinaws you should be able to get off 10k damage or so before concord kills you depending on system security ive never tried but one would think thats enough
does anyone know if these are still there been unable to play recentlyor does anyone know if csm has even bothered to raise the issue with ccpor at the very least discussed with them about applying these changes to all other races
they have been reportedly removed
not supported
because i forgot to supportand to suck it carebears crowd all the cnr and golem masses running missions for caldari are 101 unaffected by this everyone not running missions for galante corps to be exact
fyi  if you let them decay without accepting or declining them they dont effect your standingsthat goes to everyone else who has been declining them
i was running some gallente missions for transtellar shipping in amarr space on my alt and the storyline tried to send me 32 jumps  i have no problem with going into lowsec but only having these storyline missions in a few selective systems is ed when you are can get given the mission from gallente storylines anywhere in the universe
all i see these days is whiners and people crying on the forums about everything and anything that may or maynot happenbring back the devs that just tell us to htfu rather than giving us free sp because the server was down for a dayoh noes a day how will i ever copeim sure i used to be just as bad but ive seen the error of my ways and realised that the harsh horrors of eve are what make it funplease stop sugar coating eve 
shut up and enjoy your free stuff
they are giving the sp because training time was actually lost as you are no doubt aware sp is still generally accumulated during downtimes i know this because i had a long skill up and now its going to finish about a day later in other words even if they didnt give the sp out everyone could petition to get their sp back happily they will probably err on the generous side and ill have a bit more then i otherwise would have but complaining about ccp trying to solve a problem proactively is a little bit stupid
solving a problem be creating a bad president and creating warped expectations is not solving a problem its defering a greater onehence my issueeditoh wait a whole day you day hold the phone i didnt realise that people had lost a whole day jesus the outrage over such thingsim going to go have a lay down
okay please state how long would the downtime has to extend before compensation should be considered two days a week
huh they are solving the problem by returning what was lost seems straightforward enough to me are you really that terrible at making analogies
i agree that this proposal further than the vast majority of proposals i doubt ccp would implement it in exactly as stated yet i do think this is much more helpful than simply saying fix faction war and then listing vague ideas or goals this proposal provides an example of how to achieve a pvp centered occupancy mechanic that is sufficiently spread out to eliminate blobiwin but instead creates a strategically not just tactically rich war environment not only would tactics on the battle grid be important who to primary etc but bigger picture strategies like assigning resources pilots to certain plexes and supplies to certain bases to different parts of the front would be important to perform well with this sort of large strategic front you would likely want some battlecruisers and battleships docked throughout the region so you can capture the different types of plexes logistics not the ships but the supplies would become very important do you have ships nearby to take this type of plex that battleship 20 jumps away will not be much help the problem is only 100 some players have even read this proposal and many probably just decided tldr as far as the imminent meeting i really dont know what they are going to do other than the bug fixes and some minor tweaks that really wont change much already on the back nothing has been endorsed by the players that would change the overwhelming apathy toward occupancy even if the current plexes spawn throughout the day its not like waves of people will start doing it it will still be the same pve hide and seek plexingi think ank will present the ideas i agree all of her ideas for fw occupancy have been good ones  that is they have or will improve fw occupancy if not all then pretty much all of them but those ideas are really like trying to polish a turd fw occupancy needs to make some large changes or at least some key changes to be greatim not sure the devs read the features and ideas threads i can almost guarantee this thread will just drop like a brick there its long and involves a game mechanic 999 of eve has given up on if you like this idea give it support
im sure that this has been brought up before and im sure it will be againccp wants people to get on sisi for the mass test they do to try and narrow down the problems with lagdesync so that they can solve that problem at least as close as you can get something ii think would drive people to take the time to create a seperate client essentially and log on for these test is giving characters all level 5 skillsthey have done this in the past during the cap ship  titan changes iirc so this is something they can do almost at will to be completely honest ive never even tried the singularity server out so im speaking from the side that im trying to convince to participate this would drive a number of new players over to the sisi server for these tests many people would love to shot the titan doomsday or fly a nyx super cap but will probably never have the chance to do such things on tqgive them the chance on sisi and i would be willing to bet that these test become largely more popular would bring a larger variety of players and would also give many people a reason to go through the work of getting on sisiccp regularly says they would like to have close to 500 or so people on sisi during these tests and while im not sure on the average amount of players they get i feel safe in assuming its not usually that high entice people to come and join these tests what better way to test server load then have 1000 people in a system in capsbst2t3 ships it would be as close to a true 00 blob fight as you could getend rant
whaccp gives all level 5 to the stuff they are actually interested in testing sisi is a bonus but its not part of the game as such it has nothing at all to do with csm
part of the point of sisi is to test tactics and stuff if you are forced to have max skills you wont have the same ranges tracking speeds capacitor resistances or hundreds of other factors also it would potentially hide skills related bugs now once they finish the skillpoint distribution tool id like to see it applied to sisi so i could spend skills on an alt so i could test things i think id like to train for without breaking my main
if a lag free enviroment isnt enough of a reward for you then you arent the group the tests are aimed at
the last time ccp gave everyone all lvl5s and supercaps the testing didnt really go well that said not supported
this is the first time ive heard of an ezmode let us pray its nothing more than a free slightyboosted starter skill pack for beginners across the board anything else would be an insult to players whove paid their dues ccp please dont give us an eve renaissanceit only took one expansion to break uo so lets hope the ops foreshadowing doesnt come to pass
i agree totally  100  the fonts should be bigger a way bigger my friends also said that and people that saw eve for the first time ccp please do something about it

sok and some others start troll campaign against ankh giving free publicity people realise ankh got good points people vote for ankh that and people just vote for ankh because they got bored of the amount of trolls and flames coming from sok and alts and maybe preferred someone who actually had an opinion see soks campaign thread nothing in it regarding his opinion about stuffpeople want fw fixed and looking at the voting results there were only two possibilities to vote on if you want thatwtf is it you smokesec status doesnt mean  outside high sec and for inside high sec they use alts if you suicide gank an empty jf it costs the target way more than it costs you new insurance helps a bit before this it was always profitable to stage a suicide gank even if it didnt drop anything now at least it needs to drop a tad before it is profitable but still the target will always lose more than the gankers even if emptyedit but serious if people would just look at what ankh actually proposes they wouldnt have to go emo about it look at her proposals in this csm is any of them a removal of pvp i would say for everyone of them the vast majority of the eve players is in favour and while i still dont get why other csm members voted in favour of bugged fw from what i understand they arent actually against a nonbugged fw
what she proposes and how she is an impossible paranoid beeatch to work with are two entirely separate thingsas it stands the rest of the csm are all puking all over her worthless behaviour and she will get precisely 0 doneid say it would be in the fluffy carebears favour at this point if they sack her and take one a rational human being without the personality of a screeching hag that way you may actually get some of what you want
ahhh the traditional ankpartisan nonsense anybody who disagrees with ank must be a troll anybody who raises valid objections pointing out why ank isnt suited for serving on the csm they must be a troll too and anybody who quotes anks own words showing that shes conceptually and perceptually incompatible with a pvp game on a single shard why the only possible thing they can be is a troll since after all it is impossible to disagree with ank unless youre somehow dishonest about it yahas for fixing fw it should of course be noted that most of anks suggestions for doing so are worse than useless and in fact display a marked ignorance about the mechanics involved this is most likely due to her stunning lack of participation in the actual mechanics of fw she has what 7 kills 8 the bears and beginning pvpers could have gotten an actual representative on the council rather than this creature ah so you have no clue how eve works why is that so common among ankpartisans sec status matters because if you can make it back to a highsec gate you can escape from a red flashy with pretty much 100 certainty pirates cant do the same and i notice you skipped over all the actual balance examples in order to whine about not balance but the fact that people can take down larger targets if they work in groups and if those targets arent defended gee you think your whine about cost also betrays ignorance pirates making a profit off ganking something with no loot no not ever and the ability to gank a jf is no way means that the system isnt balanced the situation is actually unbalanced in the direction of favoring nonpirates and that still isnt good enough for you if a noncombat ship can be destroyed by attackers well then call the waaaaaaaaambulance because youre about to cry and someone needs to deal with those pirates
by replying and debating on ankhs topic before the election both ankhs alts  allies  critics gave her visibility blame yourselvesshe also had an ok pr campaign and used the critics as a way to emerge as the champion of carebearing against evil trolling piratesi wish that next time a proper carebear candidate emerges with good pr and who doesnt feel more relevant in puzzle pirates than in eve coz seriously linked chatlogs were ranging between hilarious and seriously creepyelections do not show who is the most competent but certainly who is the most competent in selling his own image
i tried to point this out in other anti ahnk threads ahnk got dam near 3 times as many votes as sok and twice as many votes as others lots of people have tried to tell me that its all because of how she went about campaigning i have to believe that no small part of her success is because of two things1  she represents on some level ideas that someone agrees with2  all the negative press in fact and general had to get people who might not otherwise have voted motivated to vote since the negative press attack threads and editorials seemed to share a particular slant being from pvprs in general  this gave some significant portion of the voting base a symbol to rally around i dont think its stretching it to say we can all agree that symbols can be powerful motivators my personal opinion based on nothing more than my own experience is that 14 to 12 of her votes came from people who felt a vote for ahnk was pvping those they dislikedi do believe that the csm is better off with one ahnk than three other delegates with her ideas
unofficial reports have surfaced of a fourth screaming meltdown from ankh at the pve roundtable in iceland stay tuned laydeez n gennelmen  can this plucky contender keep up her 100 record over the months to come
im excitedwhos excitedim excited
you mean someone actually believes what sok tells come on if dierdra or something would tell something i would take it serious but sok he hasnt made a single post not flaming ankh the last yearsok prolly alone managed to get ankh half her votes i wonder if ankh is paying him tbh
we have an escalationnot content with simply raging at everyone around her ankh has flipped out ninjastyle and taken to flinging cutlery at her fellow council members some accuse her of being antipvp but they couldnt be more wrong this woman is a stonecold killer she just does it in rli am not joking
citation needed
i would very much love to know whose alt you are
i probably didnUFFFDt because i only made like 5 posts in any of the ankh hate threads and none of them was very comprehensive one thing that definitely did help me getting in again was a certain guy named UFFFDnatanaUFFFD going full  on the eve germany boards against me and proposing her as a better alternative making him the laughing stock of said forums and attracting a whole lot of attention to my campaign threadbut hey apparently there is a large audience that votes for her regardless of the lies and the incompetency and the shenanigans which is fine with me she doesnUFFFDt get anything done any way
this is what i was worried about however i would like to point out that the south doesnt look as naped as lets say the north so apologies to comparing all coalitionsfor more information on what the hell i am on about and why certain coalitions only are so angry by my proposal feel free to read up on history of all the major alliances nowi would personally start with the longest nap in edeni will be honest i left 00 about 2 months ago when it was 3 powerblocs and never really cared about 00 anymore however i have noticed within 2 months the south is pleasantly rejecting naps around aaabefore resetting have even said it is unhealthy to have things napped in 50 jumpsso i guess what it really boils down to is people having balls i guess since if ccp nerfed how naping works sadly the only coalition now that will be affected is nc which isnt really fair imocant wait to hear how vuk plans to end blob warfare
just start spreading rumors about the alliance leaders ing each others wives that ought to get things going
there is a problem with creating a new font the eve font supports a wide range of unicode characters and creating an allnew font would require a lot of workso i think the fixes should be1 edit those characters in the existing fonts that look too similar 1 i l  o 0 etc the eve fonts are sansserif fonts but that should not be an impediment to adding a few serifs to an otherwise sansserif font if it improves readability2 when creating a new larger font there is no need to create a new font from scratch just scale up an existing font instead the result may be a little blocky but it would do the job until a better font was created
htfu everyone do you want this game to become hello kitty onlinemore readable fonts plz no way veterans of this game succeeded with the fonts as they are and it is just a case of you not wanting to adapt silly spoiled carebears so what if you ruin your eyesight its a worthy sacrifice for ccp and eveon a serious note another of braindead obvious issues that must be fixed asap though depending on coding it might not be as simple as it could be expected
yes yes yes as screen resolutions get bigger fonts get smaller this is now a very serious issue with the mass use of high definition resolutions that makes it only the very lucky few to not get eye strain reading the current eve font size
supported as in the past this is long overdueedit apparently i already have why does this issue take so long to get looked at
players should not ever feel it is necessary to decrease screen resolution to make ingame text more readable

so the solution to making a t1 hull viable is to make them t2are t1 hulls supposed to be obselete didnt ccp see this coming that eventually the universe would be filled with the majority of pilots flying hacs and afs such that there is no room for the newbie in the t1 hullthats what happens when you make the next gen of ships more than 50 stronger than the previous gen you make gen 1 useless except in very narrow circumstances that happen 0001 of the time
think about what you just saidrifter is still used just as much as the wolft1 ew frigs are used just as much as their t2 counterparts destroyers are still being used all over the place head out to null or low sec and youll get a taste of some really good destroyer pilotsthe only problem were running into is that where people are trying to use a t1 ship in essentially t2 situations and they arnt doing so well
 the haters do this nowtiaalso that exciting new hey we can give out sp system that ccp are using for downtime compensation is perfect for this
completely ridiculous there is no way around it you have to train learning skills period that is the problem there is no choice they might as well be mandatory and the more you delay learning them the more time you lose
im pro learning skillsfor me learning skills are part of the whole skill training decision game and i like them because it makes you choose between short term and long term benefits which is a difficult decision to take any dayi personally like eve exactly because of all the tough decisions complexity and pitfalls that the game offers and i am against making eve all cuddly and smoothfor those that complain that learning skills are a time sink might consider the idea that a mmo is in general a welldesigned time sink trying to bait you to log in every through some kind of sketchy reward scheme
strongly opposed
i see little to no downside to this solutionhonestly i dont see why it hasnt been done already learning skills serve no good purpose anymore and havent for quite some time
just for fyi on you people saying that ohhh train all learning skills to five rabblerabblerabblehere are a few payouts from my own head which is currently 19 26 14 14 15 with no implantsiron will v when min gal and cald titan to five amarr bs 5 390d saves 12 hours 9 minclarity v when all four titans are to 5 472 days 1 17 20 savedempathy v 146d save 22 hourspresence v 372 days all of trade half of social save four hoursjust to have those four skills to pay off i need to spend 844 days the first two were clicked only selecting spaceship command and the second two were clicked selecting trade and social skills which save a couple are all charisma primary i think ill take the extra one point that ccp will bump from my current four to the proposed five now thank you
except if you train learning skills instead of mining barge v and exhumers ii you dont get to fly trade shoot steal mine or produce anything new you merely accellerate the process at which you eventually do those things in an era of eve when most new players are obsessed with playing catchup for good reason years of skilling go into core alone if you want to pilot more than a very narrow selection of ships you cannot ignore the must train factor in any longterm investment skills if they arent training and thus ing their entry into more advanced activities than suicide tackle cheapfit miner or station trader learning skills as far as they can from the getgo theyre loosing more timeno you dont need 55 to start skilling anything and no you dont see a full return on investment for years but for anyone who hasnt predetermined that theyll quit the game before a few years are out its a nondecision thats what makes learning skills bad

my alliances logo got turned down in the most recent expansion with no reason given at the time furthermore when the alliance leader petitioned it to ask why they pretty much told him it was their policy not to say why they turn down logosso we have to redesign our logo but we have absolutely no idea what is wrong with the logo in order to redesign itand we wont know if we got the redesign right until the next expansion and if we get it wrong we still wont know whydoes anyone else see something wrong with this picture
not supported giving logos to alliances just encourages them to nap more
everybody in here in some way or another is contributing to have ccp make real moneyever paid for your subscription i know you did thats why you have the opportunity to express your opinion in hereand heres another fun point for you to think about theres plenty of people out there whod happily pay some extra bucks to have this or that implemented if thered be an optionps im offering a sixpack of beer if the ccp folks manage to fix the mac client crash on exit bug within two weeks
edit this post has been altered to coincide with the release of the primae shipfor those who arent aware of its existence head over to the dev blog or click the link here and the individual thread can be located herein a nutshell the primae ship is one geared towards planetary interaction with the release of the ship on the 28th lets look at its important stats4x low slots150m signature radius  very small for its size 15 million kg1000 m3 cargo space for pi materials1600 m3 cargo space for command centers240 msec max velocityas we can see the primae is a great entrylevel hauler for newbies and vets alike who are just breaking into pi due to its modest cargo size and no skills necessary to fly according to a thread located here ccp devs believe and i quotegreyscale also goes on to say that it was deliberately not supposed to be better for common tasks than other ships due to the fact that its free and everyone is given one which is just fine but it still retains a very suitable useregrettably ccp has also said in several instances in the thread linked at the top of this post that this ship will not be seeded on the market they are a onetime gift in my opinion eve can certainly benefit from a ship like this on a fairly large scale with the efficient means of hauling a decent amount of products as well as a no sp barrier of entry i propose this is one ship that shouldnt remain as a simple gift this is an excellent ship for newbies and other players just breaking into pi sadly though in the current state the ship will most likely rot in station hangars as many pilots will be too afraid to take them out as we saw with the other ship gifts i propose that the blueprints should be seeded on the market or bpcs and the ship itself be placed on ores lp store if this is not possible at least have its model repurposed to be a dedicated salvage ship which is something players have been asking foryaynay
nay i think you are overestimating the use of the primae over a normal hauler or a blockade runner of course we dont know the stats yet so this is all speculation seeding it will also make it less special and make it just yet another shipedit also crossposting is bad mkay
no you have no idea what the ship will even do bonuses stats slots etc  and the sisi pics dont count and you are already asking for a bpo does that not seem a little premature to you
not necessarily the ship is coming in less than three days its a ship specifically designed to cater to the industrial side of eve one that lacks in shipspecific roles the other ships that were given away for free ill agree do not really need bpos as there were 4 other types of shuttles and a ton of other cruisers an industry ship on the other hand offers a plethora of uses and only offering it once makes little sense
why cant you take solace in the fact that the ship is a onetime gift when your family or friends give you a gift do you whine and say that you want more you ungrateful twit
a bp is the difference between never seeing these ships undock and people actually using them
i think i like the idea of the ship my magic 8ball says outcome unlikely but a ship capable of deepspace salvage as the original purpose lolrp indicated fro this ship was would be made of winhow many manhours went into the production of this anyway
low and null arent supposed to be newb friendlybut a salvage ship using the same model sure why not
i fully agreebesides all that work put into the excellent model would be wastedand looking at models like the blackbird hull throwing the model away to a station hugging ship is unnacceptable
well i dunno if its space worthy ie not a novelty gankme ship then there should be bpos on the market or at least some way to acquire more then the one each of us gets
supportedbecause i dont want to see that beautifull ship model go to waste as one time only gift that no one will ever use coz its unique
how about redeeming it outside of a market hubcrazy i know
the primae should be kept as it is no bpo of it should be necessarybut a salvaging ship based on its hull is an intriguing idea and i support the reuse of the work the art department has put on it for a variant on it
ore lp store is good enough for me
prior to knowing actual stats if the ships is a true industrialaka useful in some manner to industry other than gimmicks it needs to be replaceable industry has enough issues with keeping its stuff in one piecehighsec bot gankers who dont actually differentiate between players and bots hulkageddon 13 now w even more backing general lownull dbaggery without having to worry about novelty gankers blowing up their ships for the km in addition to the restso depending on actual layout it needs to be able to do one of the following fit a tank and cloak  haul fit w lp bpcs available to replace it or if its basically a defenseless wreckinwaiting it needs a bpo if it serves any actual functionality as has been stated numerous times any novelty ship that undocks is basically a floating gank target and no amount of defense will help it
signed and i want it as a salvage ship
do this please
this is a well thought through and presented suggestionwould make life in any player corp much easier be it good mining bookmarks salvage bookies for missions or wormhole coordinatesfully supported and i really hope this will be implemented in the future
yes this would be a great help and im not sure why it wasnt implemented already
signed
i support the original proposal in addition i am also in favor of having bookmarks be transmittable remotely drag a bookmark to chat and everyone in that same chat should be able to add the bookmark to their people  places ive been told secondhand that masscopying of bookmarks would cause lag for players in the same solar system as whoever was doing the copying and that this used to be used as a laggenerating technique to lag out an opponent in battle to prevent such lag from locking up other players ccp limited the number of bookmarks that may be copied in a single batch to fiveor so i have been told secondhand caveat emptor
yes please
supported
i support this wholeheartedly curse you bm thieves
the option for shared corporation bookmarks was raised by csm4 and passed on to ccp details in the wiki articleno idea when it might make it into game though
im vanillanasty and i approve this messagesupport
im bringing this up as an example issue to point to what might get perceived as major communication problem between ccp and the public effectively ruining paying user trust its an example of how things are beginning with an excellent idea and start  slipping into what seems to be a black hole with people obviously having lost track andor interest to properly communicate towards the endtoday i tried to find out which amount of money got donated to the red cross by ccp when i failedi asked in ingame help channel nobody could answer for those of you who dont remember

yeah grimmi should post an update
ending alliances  noending naps  noending powerblocs  noending huge napfests where everything is blue within 50 jumps  yesending huge powerblocs which have 100 more alliances blue  yesending huge empires where strategy involves blobbing  node crashing only  yesfor the sake of the next 5 alts that dont get it  and for the 5 above i guess
the current situation in 00 is fine just because systems and stations are not changing hands every day does not mean something is wrong
sorry dude all of my alts have very obvious name as can be seen here others includebobfrommarketingstanfromengineeringmarkfromadministrationand more  you ever notice how only you and your 2 alts support this and the rest of the community calls you ed may be a reason behind that it sounds something like youre wrong
if i got all my chars to post here i would have alot more supports than you think tbh i dont take this game as serious as you do and im definitely not sad enough to ohh i dont know create alot of alts stick them in an alliance to make it look bigger just for the sake of getting a reaction of an alliance i am obsessed about caod offthat aside it is understandable why you and your chars created purely for this thread only feel so threatened by this im sure when the nerf comes nc will just have to adapt and rely on strategies that dont involve blobbing  napingoh and for the record if majority ruled you would still be in delve p
so whats your solution weve heard your whine that people are playing in ways that you dont like what do you want the csm to ask ccp to do about it just saying i want space and cant get any fix it isnt good enough this folder isnt supposed to be for people to baw about things they dont like its supposed to be where people put forward proposalsas i said before the nature of the space dictates the politics there already exists space where you can do the no huge powerblocs thing its called curse its called stain its called outer ring its npc sov space where anyone can set up their little operation and go ahead and play the gameeven more its called wspace remember that when ccp added almost 2500 new systems that give you exactly what you say you ask for space thats impossible to powerblocso why arent you in those areas playing the way you want seems to me that this isnt about you playing the game the way you like  there are thousands of systems that could give you exactly what you claim to want its about stopping other people playing in ways you dont likeill repeat the question you evadedwhy should ccp tell people that theyve been building the wrong kind of sandcastles in sovereign space how is that a sandbox game
you finished sabotaging this most legitimate concern thread or do i memo deborahfromengineering the 120kg part time wrestling nerd with a mean streakhere is another reason why peace is unsavoury in eve it allows arms stockpilingi think we all agree that the one thing that makes even blobs seem reasonable is the heavier capital and supercapital blobs  guess what human trait supported by which mechanic or lack thereof allows for thosemusical fist ask a moderator to move your thread to features and ideas until you can couple the issue with a few potential solutions  makes for a much stronger case when presented here
well when 00 becomes one gigantic nap i will bump this thread and explain what the problem is again im sure the way things are going that this will happen within 90 daysoh and no this isnt a what if scenario anyone who has been playing this game long enough knows that eventually that will happen this time last year more than 70 of 00 was controlled by nc and naps honestly if bob never returned and if dominion never came out 00 would have been goons nc drones and providence by nowbutterfly effect is nice but at the end of the day this is a game not reality stop comparing 00 to rl just because i promote warfare in 00 doesnt mean i want someone to kill off nato edit  fyi dominion already changed how alliance built their sand castle almost every patch theres a change to how you do it p
why does 00 have to always be at war if he residents out there want to be friendly to each other and work together it is their sandbox and they should be allowed there does not always have to be war guys
answer the question whats your proposal what do you expect ccp to do
they have come up with a alternative 00 experience for people who dont want blobswormholes and worhole poss etcthe qen gave some stats on their growing useif wormholes are missing something 00 has other than blobs they could be tweaked or additional breeds of wormholes could be developed to meet that needmaybe a different type of wormhole that could accomadate a bit bigger corporation ways for players to get a bit more control of where or when entrances spawn ideas would take some parsing outthe deetails really matter but the first question would be  whats the goal
as i said in my first post a revamp on how diplomacy works in general right now theres no limits so 00 success is all about quantity trulyi also said i currently have no solution in fixing this without nerfing a amjor powerbloc but would like for ccp  csm to have this as one of the main focuses that was the whole pointhonestly malganis if you arent going to read the thread whats the point in replying no wonder you got betrayed by the lich king
new sovereignity mechanics failed horribly at making controlling tons of empty space less lucrativeat least make npc 00 more easily accessible now certain npc 00 areas are actually deep inside power block space making them less free space not to mention all bubblecamps and whatanot you need to pass first its not like its impossible to move there but compared to low sec leap in effort is bigger than would feel logicali see only one thing stopping hoarding the space and thati s making logistics over long distanceslarge areas require a lot of more effort
precisely and malcanis feel free to stop repeating the idea that this thread is useless youve managed to produce some of the least valuable posts in this thread sofar take some time to evaluate whats being said before you come to quip that nobody understands 00 as you do ive been a proud not so much recently member of the nc for a long time and i am quite familiar with the politics mechanics and issues that have created what were experiencing todaylaechyd has the crux of it in a nutshell sov mechanics need to change sov space should support more pilots sov holdings need to be scaled back via making them harder to maintain to allow more players to live in nullsec and new players coming in should have more options than the 1 or 2 npc regions that arent regularly blockaded by alliances wh space is not what people are looking for wh space is nullsec for hermits and people who want to play in a very small group or solo
how do you expect ccp to fix the way players work with each otherits malcanis i presume youre being funny and clever or something in your opinion with your wow reference whatever it means
are you just reading your own posts player relations isnt something ccp or the csm can do anything about obviously but thanks for the continued droning of that tired tangent obviously the problem lies with sov mechanics
doesnt matter how many ways you ask it the question has already been answered
good study and analyzefew possibilities still exist to reduce nap in game make the nap really expensive like a harsh rent price could be based on the pilots number and not paid by alliances but by members like a personal bill yes so you pay to have friends ig too if nap is revised so wardec must have to no ideas about this tho a system based on free wardec  whatever the solution it must be revisedo
im interested in this magical sov mechanic you have in mind that will stop players working together please give more detailsor you know any

yes agreed and points taken about ships moving about tnats common but seriously something needs to be done i wouldnt mind if they were quite harmless ships but they are quite decent pvp ships also having a specilised cloaked gang is as state formiddable arazu rapier stealh bomber covert ops etc all with specialities that in a gang is quite crazy ewar webs drones bombs and on top of that they can cloak sit in systems for hours and just pop up whenever also they are fast ships jesus what more do you want you got almost complete invulnerability and firepower and undetectableon their own fair enough they arent that much of a problem but a small gang as shown well your pretty screwed and there is nothing you can do about itawesome sandbox gamei believe everything should have some counter and cloakies have none at all
the moment they want to do something other than staying cloaked they become vulnerableyou cant do much within stations either  but youre not going to complain about ships in stations are youanother misconception wrongly associated to cloaking is to talk about situations where a gang of cloaked ships is the opponent of single ships you can not really blame getting outnumbered on cloaking getting outnumbered is always a strategic fail or mistake not really caused by the cloaked ships existenceknow your enemies or get killed its as easy as thatif youd compare opposing fleets with equal number of ships one side cloaking one not the cloaking ones might have the element of surprise but there might be one extra gun or launcher per ship on the other side how unfair is thaton top of all if you claim dominance in a system and dont manage to uncloak at least one opponent ship within a fleet of plenty of cloaking ships there goes your dominance space is not your space if you can not control it you always can train covert ops yourself btw you can spy on covert ships uncloaking here or there game rules should not support lazyness
theres some tactics you can use to kill them but you have to be experienced and have some luckone of them is the log on trap if you can scramble one or 2 just give the go to your log on buddies and have fun killing them you will see the river of tears flowing something like f u logon trapyour cheating blah blah blahhehe of course thats only the basics but you get the idea sometimes it works other times it doesnt in anycase if they dont want to fight move on

let me start by saying i dont spend that much time in 00 i do however pass through to do stuffs occasionally anywaysomething has always bugged me whenever i visit npc 00 the stations are wrong for example sanshas nation stations are amarr or caldari distinct lack of spikes is bad however there are models in game that could be utilisedfirst time i went to curse i hoped id see some stations a bit like the art from this chron i left disappointedheck there are even actual blood raider station models around amarr stations with a different texture but theyre there why are none of these usedi propose that ccp release and utilise some of the unused station models for pirate station would add to depthimmersionsexiness of the gamealso khanid stations 3
signed x10 times i ve been saying this for a while we have the damn models it cant be that hard to swap them out

extremely short let electronic assault ships use cov ops cloaks since theyre basically supposed to be mini recons i would love to let them use cov ops cloaks
awesome idea and while youre at it give freighters cov ops cloaks cause theyre supposed to be giant blockade runners
the solution to an underpowered class of ships is not always a covops cloak its worked for bombers and blockade runners but im reluctant to extend it far past that black ops maybe but thats the limit theyre too common and they ought to be rarer not thrown around on every class going
eas need a little ehp buff to bring them from flimsy to af level thats all they need covop cloak is not the solution for them as they still would pop too easily
they gave cov ops cloak for blockade runners and bombers wouldnt hurt much more to give them also for freighters and eas anyhow eas could use some kind of tanking bonus ie sig radius bonus for mwd or then more resists or whatsoever

yes also idk if this is the rite thread for itbut first assembly arrays should have a more specific text on what it can build exactlyimoand 2nd with eve becoming more player run why cant we build pos structures in our possi spent all kinds of isk and structures i dont need atm ne wayto try and build structures i need if that makes senseie i thought an assembly array mobile assembly facility where modules can be manufactured would be used to build a ship arraynopeso i go out and purchase a component assembly array which yea it saysa mobile assembly facility where construction components such as capital ship tech ii and hybrid tech iii components of all sorts can be manufacturedso come on csm lets get this done  btw i do votehopefully ccp will let us build our structures wo paying npcs anymore

what couldnt take the competition in your original thread and had to come make a second ccps already talked about adding another tier of fc skills anyways dunno where that went though
competition also you are posting on a main please dont it is much more convincing using an alt
just as the title says just a way to check the current load of whatever node you are currently running on kind of like the fps monitor or the all in one monitor ctrlshiftaltmonly one request on this though make it so you can see lets say the past week of whatever node you are onjust wondering how hard this would be to develop for players a tool to access such informationfor one to reduce petitions in general to latency issues and possibly to reimbursement due to node latencyedit maybe a possible popup warning for heavy load
and forgot to give support for my own idea 
because adding something else to the node that it has to query the database on continously is a good way to address lag mok
too exploitable it would inevitably be used as an intelmetagame tool and i dont think we need more of those
helloi have had it with the threads concerning the impending ability to buyredirect sp as shown by some quotes posted by both ccp navigator and ccp shadow it doesnt help that youre being incredibly cryptic and downright evasive when it comes to the actual matterwhat i wish for is a definitive standpoint by ccp a post a thread a dev blog stating their intentions with the new sp pool tool as revealed by both several ccp members and a new stat on singularity that seems to be verifying this tool something that will finally reveal your intentions and stop all these meaningless speculative threads that clutter our forums and irritate many readerswhos with me
maybe also the ability to thumbsup the first post of the thread but thats for another topic
ywthey are introducing a booster that will help people less than 35 days old its the equivalent of 3 implants and it increases damage and reduces rofforgot what its called but its on sisie sp
supporting this anyways
ccp already has a pretty clear stance on sp buying id say
um they already have
sounds like the craptastic political campaigns where a ludicrous allegation is made and taking the baffled silence of the other party as proof of its veracity stuff one can do with a sp pool tool track sp that should have been awarded if servers didnt barf thus preventing proper skill changing instate an sp swap out thing where xx amount is removed from one skill and placed into another will probably be hamstrung like neural remaps allow new characters who often have no idea what the hell is going on to correct mistakes made while under the influence of the shroud of noobness
ccp has already stated their stance on the matter by two different devs no less just because ccp has said it isnt going to happen doesnt mean trolls will stop posting threads about it because thats what trolls do supporting only because i want to see ccp lock all those stupid threads so we can get back to our usual forum whining
im glad atleast one person could get to the gist of what im trying to say
ccp have no plans whatsoever to introduce sp buyingplease read ccp shadows post
i find this totally agreeable and have nothing more to add
definitely
i feel since naps and blobs are the only two words that describe 00 anymore we should reward them i expect nc and nc alts to give me lots of thumbs uppowerblocks  alliances will now be allowed to join powerblocks these powerblocks work much like alliances however are a group of alliances instead of corpspacts  based on your political methods your powerblock will be given a titlefor exampleempire with bombs  bubbles  this 00 territory is the equivalent of empire with bombs  bubbles concord will be blues  pets any hostility here will get you blobbed by concord pets bluesthese pacts will be based on your play stylenow for the benefitsthere will now be an ingame political map much like verites where you can set your own tag  pin doing so will alert people who wish to visit like theres anything else people can do in 00for exampledont attack us or we will get our 30k friends on youorwe got here by only paying isk to that guythis will benefit anyone who wishes to pvp visitsince combat is something naptrains dont approve of because well they will lose space the second they reset everyone i figured we should allow gate guns and station gunsthis will in return prevent the roams which funny enough cause soo many problems too sin short 00 should be a place people go to macro rat only as there isnt going to be any sov wars anymore or generally anything else this in return will increase the population in 00
a nice little 1 to my evesearch post count before this lovely thread gets locked
why would this get locked s it is an idea i would have expected an ex panda to understand the benefits of giving the naps what they wantnow please edit your post and support
1 its not a solo job maybe thats why youre fining it insurmountable2 the skills are fine it takes a long time to build some t2 stuff so it should take longer for t33 no sov in wspace is a good thingthe one thing i have a problem with is the fact that there is absolutely no market for t3 components theres absolutely no reason to sell t3 components that you make when you can make a 15x profit by producing the blueprints that youre pretty much guaranteed to have anyways
i found one of those websites that sells the macro to these macro mining scumbags how do i report it to ccp as i imagine the sites that sell the macros are not legal
facepalmpeople really need to learn to distinguish between whats legal and whats against ccps eula
distributing materials that assist in the violation of the eula are illegal excuse me for showing concern
no theyre not because violating a eula isnt illegal
when i was starting to like the russians you bring this up
she really throw something at someone or are you just trying to be funny
more neutral council members will be able to verify that i am being very very mild regarding her so no i am not making things up in fact i have omitted a lot of stuff that might be funny but wouldnt help us in any way
oh it was just a spoon and here i had in my mind that she was throwing the pointy cutlery probably better this way but certainly less entertaining
there is no spoonalso to everyone who voted for ankh told you so smug
now when you say she threw a spoon do you mean she playfully lobbed it in humorous annoyance or she out and out hurled it like she was trying to knock somebody out
its up to her to justify her behavior but i daresay it wasnt playful
if ank threw something at someone in a public meeting out of anger ill be the first to call for her to step down if this does turn out to be true then ill also call for sokratesz to resign his continued pursuit of a personal vendetta while on the csm is immature unprofessional distracting and disturbing if a real problem like this arose then it should be dealt with in a professional manner spreading rumours is not acceptable behaviour delilahfriendsofevewordpresscom
lol personal vendetta i liked her a lot more than i had expected and i merely reported on what happened stop seeing things that arent there
backwalking already sokratesz liked her alot more merely reporting thats quite a change in both attitude and language good to see delilahfriendsofevewordpresscom
basically she shut up on most of the topics she knows nothing about and her fw presentation was pretty decentunnecessary comment removed zymurgist
yes ank threw a spoon no it did not appear to be done playfully in fact she seemed rather irritated so i would go as far as to say she was annoyed or even angryfor context there was a side discussion going on about the topic being presented but there was absolutely no call for a spoon to be thrown when a polite comment would have sufficed sok wasnt the spoons intended target and he wasnt doing anything to goad or inflame the situation all he has done so far is report the occurrence it isnt a rumour of course by stating the facts even including the context of a side discussion im now appearing to take sides and thus i expect more antisok sentiment to spill over to others on the csm
teadaze best daze
same old song and dancepoint out anks own words youre trolling point out anks own stated beliefs and behaviors youre smearing her if you post an accurate report of anks own actions why you have to step down from the csm the truth is a rumor stating the facts is a vendetta ayieeeeeinappropriate comment removed zymurgist
note to self i should stop blowing the cover on my nc alt
note to self i should stop blowing the cover on my csm alt
for a moment there i very nearly thought words had failed me it was frightening but it was also a false alarm allow me to simply state that if you cannot understand the difference between criticizing another member of the csm and throwing a spoon at one then you are simply beyond help sokratesz is well within his rights both as a player and as a member of the csm to criticize a colleague he considers to be incompetent ankh however is most certainly not within her rights to start throwing silverware that is behavior one would expect from a child having a temper tantrum not an elected official
lengthy explanation is after consideration unnecessary tldr i didnt get a spoon in the face a spoon was thrown at me across the table as an attention grabber no kitten were harmedi blame lack of sleep for bad judgement on long rantwill have a lengthy debate with myself tomorrow morning to see if rant is justified andor productive
here there be dragons
for what its worth this csm meeting was actually as far as im concerned the best csm so far will elaborate later
 rage post deleted update soi admit to having lost what little sense of humor i have in my original ragepost here while i realize the original post is quoted in all its glory elsewhere in this thread i decidedafter a few days consideration
theres nothing inherent in this that demonstrates that the csm cant function professionally in point of fact noting that a member behaves in a childish manner and throws temper tantrums complete with pitching silverware points out that members behavior only and her voters as well as the rest of eve have a right to know that this sort of stuff is going on its actually a bit disconcerting that your response is to be annoyed that people reported what went on dont you think that the eve playbase deserves to know whos on the csm and what its issues areif you chucked a spoon at someone would it be news maybe maybe not it probably would if you were developing a noticeable history of being difficult to work with and pulling childish stunts when you dont get your wayits also odd to call this a witch hunt that implies that the situation is baseless and anybody is just casting around for a scapegoat quite the contrary it seems that your objection is that the facts are 100 accurate and everything said has been truthful but you believe it paints the csm in a poor light it doesnt it paints one single csm member in a poor light based on that members verified actionsthe person who put you into an unpleasant situation is the one whose behavior has sparked this discussion not the people who mentioned that behavior the attitude dont talk about the systemic misbehavior of one of the csm members it makes us look bad will make the csm look bad forthright and honest discussion would be quite a different issueps look at your last statement if someone had done something defensible and understandable would there be any reason that youd have to instruct them not to respond at the point where a csm member becomes a liability it is odd that the focus is on those who discuss that rather than the person herself if an mp wore clown shoes to meetings and threw pies at people he didnt like it would make him look very bad if the reaction of the rest of parliment was to chastise people for talking about it rather than censuring him for his behavior then and only then would they look bad
you knowonce upon a time when the csm was introduced people saw it as a free trip to iceland others saw it as a way to get the inside scoop ahead of time and yet others saw it as ccp marketing which to players has a different meaning then what until this csm many ccp staff considered it to beover time that changed because of striking a balance between the entertainment of the elections and getting to work when those were over after all accountability is not something which solely applies to ccppersonally i dont give a  about preferences in game play political backgrounds or anything like that because the csm concept is pretty much the only thing that has a potential to have a solid impacti couldnt care less about personal differences or private petty emo i really have zero interest or feel for pve or anything related but for the process that does not matter one bitbut what i do hope is that people realise that until the next elections begin there is a lot of work to be done if the last resort of this csm concept is to have an impact on ccp on all levels especially those levels where the decisions are made yeah we all like the gossip the stories the entertainment but given the state of the game itself in being in shambles of half finished content and feature sets the future for the product shown by product marketing the abyssmal performance of the game and the enormous divide between players and those who make the calls and do not play themselves you would think that people would be able to think for a moment especially those who stepped up to get to work because they told their voters to care and safeguard their fun  comfort zonestbh as a player i would expect the csm members to work as a team to sort out balances and differences to keep finding best practices as well as compromises in order to keep their noses pointing the same wayi dont need to hear or read this kind of  regardless of actualy or factuality it is misplaced without useful focus and it diminishes the csm as a wholewhy because its the last straw to get through to ccp because you signed up to work for it because you committed yourself to be there for eve as a whole and the people who voted for youwhat do you want honestly next business monday the people at ccp who make the calls visit the forums because through a lot of concerted effort and work they have actually woken up they see stuff like this and wave the last week aside again k guyz was a tough week with those guys in iceland but lookie they cant keep it together alright so what else can we introduce for the winter expansion which lacks pvp content has tons of farmville in it and makes people stay less long in eveyou know us players we can fool around and do stuff csm members they have a responsability they themselves chose to take on
stop wasting time on ankh and work on real matters p all of csm members were elected there to represent certain groups of voters not  up with little matters like someone having wrong opinions or whatsoever
except this does not diminish the csm as a whole thats the whole point that most of the csm is working diligently at doing their assigned task there should be full transparency and honest reporting otherwise the csm looks bad saying that the csm looks bad for being open and honest about whats going on is nonsensical
im a what most around here would call a noob not having played that long i like this game but it really is broken in so many places that it just aint funny but damn it is worth it im not a game designer its all magic to me but one thing is really clear here when people differ in opinions but are required to work together for the sake of people behind them and all of them even if they differ in principles you always take care to tackle the differences and compromises internally to the outside you always operate as a united front if you dont want to get results because you dont care yourself then let it be every man for his own entertainment make room then for people who do
no you really dont always operate as a united frontthat sort of behavior makes you look really really bad when things screw up actively opposing transparency and accountability makes organizations look bad actively having a commitment to deal openly and honestly with issues and fix them quickly does not and it looks especially bad to actively campaign against honestly relating facts to the playbase why would it have made the csm look bad if we knew that each and every single member was diligently working to improve things except for one up until now we had a story where one csm member was unable to act like an adult now we have a statement which heavily suggests that the proper course of action would have been a coverup and for the voters to be none the wiser come the next election as to whats actually going on
no amount of trying to spin  as transparancy is going to make anything of it sound reasonable since these guys are the only ones ccp actually might listen totransparancy read the meeting minutes condensed or raw everything is in therei got to agree with one of the guys who posted earlier with this personal crap on monday the ccp ceo reads all this and draws his conclusions great a ton of work and effort wasted
sokratesz and meissa i hope you are proud that you dust undid everything you accomplishedthe only liability to the csm is you two with your unprofessional childish bull vendetta againt ankh please just resigntrolling removed zymurgist
are we back at the standard ankploy those who point out the facts about her that are unflattering are trolls i think most of us have had enough of that gamein any case transparency rather obviously means more than the simple minutes that are put out for meetings this is both obvious and very very basic there is more that goes on in an organization than what is recorded by a secretarydont call the facts spin an organization that conducts itself with honesty and openness doesnt seek to hide the fact that one of its members is unable to properly do their job simply because its not on the recordand you may hold ccp in such low regard that you think theyre morons who live by the fallacies of composition and division but if theyve got half a brain in their heads theyll judge the summit by what was actually accomplished and not by the misbehavior of one and only one member the entire reason that the csm was formed in the first place was that when faced with the misbehavior of one of its members instead of prompt and transparent action ccp tried to prevent a united front and lost almost all credibility for years the lesson to be learned is not that ccp shouldve just backed t20 even more or that kugu really was the badguy for pointing out the facts but that secrecy and bull solidarity is selfdefeating when obvious mistakes have been madethe lesson is not well you just need to be even more dedicated to closing ranks and being even more tightlipped when obvious problems come upthe story yesterday was one lone csm member repeatedly behaving badly the story today is some elements of the csm want to keep the playerbase in the dark about misbehavior going on in the csm so they can preserve their image rather than achieving transparency when dealing with the playerbasethis is not an improvement
you guys really are doing a good job of making this whole circus look like a jokewhat is it actually you guys are trying to achieveinappropriate comment removed zymurgist
vittorian you have a bit of a point the problem is theres no real way to shut ank up for better or worse a bunch of the playerbase elected someone to the csm who either can not or will not behave as an adult in a cooperative fashion to get things done its also important for the playerbase to know how and why the csm is working a certain way and if theres possible trouble getting things done because of one single member again and again then we deserve to be told and not have that covered up when you have an mp coming into parliament every session and throwing pies at people he doesnt like the correct reaction is to take him to task and not to try to hush it up because once it gets out now you dont have a rogue member of an assembly who looks like an idiot you have a systemic problem in the assembly and everybody looks culpable in the aftermath if not the commissiona lone individual doesnt make an organization look bad unless the organization condones that behaviornobody rational would have a problem if the csm doesnt try to hush up anks behavior and instead censured her andor reports the facts and then lets the record try to speak for itself while they get on with work the csm as a whole wouldnt look bad at all theyd look good and it would be clear that one bad element was unable to act properly but the rest were doing fine it wouldnt be a circus at all of course its getting close to it at this point especially if the csm cant even decide that they wont tolerate anks bull and will instead fight over whether or not they should try to keep anks bull quiet and of course the words i told you so are kinda cool but it sucks to know that this was so blindingly obvious and predicable ah well trollobvious alttroll is obviously alttrollingccp is not going to scrap all the csms proposals and input because ank cant behave like a grownup much less because someone else related the 100 true and accurate facts and you know it stop trollingthis ayieeeee now the csm is undone not because a member is behaving badly but because other people commented on it simply does not fly youre not fooling anybodyand seriously enough of your trolling enough of your trolling enough thats it no more of this the facts are trolling damn the facts damn them no more calling relating facts smears or a vendetta yes yes reality has a clear antiank bias damn reality right to hellthis is the same exact trolling weve seen since the campaign and its idiotic youre like a pack of scientologists you cant face the facts so when theyre pointed out you just go into rabid attack dog mode and angrily gum the ankles of those pointing out the facts no defense always attack if someone points out that ank is unbalanced and cannot behave like an adult why then they must not be behaving like adultswe all know you dont really believe it and youre not fooling anybody at all
finnystop trolling man if you like the game and want it to perform youll give a proper process like a csm that has a job to do room to do its job if you dont by all means continue as currentno now dont run off texting and trying to think of more things to throw in the cocktail theres no room for the drunk cocktail its business nowwhen the next elections come we can go ape sure right now like one of the other posts mentioned if you want csm to work they have to take it on professionally playing emo politics doesnt match with that
use a gank of cloaking ships problem solved
agreed plus if youve got that many skillpoints you should be more than experienced to get your pod out in low sec with the exception of lag when losing your frigate 00 i can understand especially with a bubble
there are alot of people who dont know how to use frigates properly and dont even bother looking at frigs it is somewhat the current mindset of a lot of starting eve player to get into bigger ships as fast as possible and they will usually neglect the frigate class after a week or two  hop into a cruiser this mindset still exists with alot seasoned eve players who will stick to bigger ships because they are more shineyhave more dps etc before i started my life of piracy i never really bothered about frigs since i was using cruisers  bc sized ships for whatever i needed doing and i never even bothered looking into frigates as a pvp ship once i joined a pirate corp i soon discovered that a well manually piloted  fitted frig can take on quite alot of things and in a larger group they can kill alot of things up to lone bss etc i love my ac punisher and i suggest that the op should try some more frig pvp since it is very fun and a cheap way of pvping and i can also ensure the op that frigates are absolutely not useless or on the verge of extinction and i really do not need to see anything changed to them and even that i consider most of your arguments to be quite invalidfor one  big guns vs frigate  learn to fly manually dont go straight at a bs or any ship ever you have the speed advantage in a frig use it and get under his gunsenergy nuets  fly ac fit frigs either ac punisher or rifter autocannons do not use cap and you can dedicate your cap to your ab or rep if timed correctly you can keep them running without issuedrones  thats gotta be a joke unless its ecm drones the one of the first things you ever learn when pvping is to have one overview tab dedicated to drones  drones die fast once you shoot them keep orbiting your enemy shoot his drones and then kill him if he uses ecm drones against you  is able to get jam cycles on you youll be screwed usually no matter what size ship you flyso mr op i suggest please rediscover the awesome ship class called a frigate
so what did the nonankh csm member accompolish 
this statement captures sokratesz problem he wants to egg on this dispute while sidestepping responsibility for it one of the features of leadership sokratesz is learning to take responsibility not only for your own actions but for the actions of others working in your name or on your behalf it is both a matter of honesty and maturity if you cannot take such responsibility then you should stop participating in these threads and ask your friends to move onto something more constructive the vast majority of us do not want to see this childish behaviour from you or anyone else on the csm please try to keep this in mind before you write your next post delilahfriendsofevewordpresscom
i wasnt chosen to be a leader and i will not adjust my behaviour based solely on your opinion i know very few of the other people that are antiankh which given my forum history is rather characteristic of the situation while the ones defending her are easily counted and classified i felt that the first csm 5 summit has been constructive although i remain skeptical towards ccps future projects more on that later
the sad thing about ankh is that her campaign of lies and spam pulled votes away from better but less ruthlessly selfpromoting candidates who might have genuinely promoted the issues she claims to representthe only issue she actually cares about is fluffing her cv
delilah is just a troll desperate to support andor draw attention away from ank any possible way even if its patently absurd sok we are to believe is now responsible for anks behavior and the mere act of reporting on what she does is a grave breach because of course the only professional thing to do is keep anks voters ignorant of her mental instability and manifest unsuitability for work on the csm and instead just shut up about it all deliliah isnt even a good troll more the pity as she might at least work to be amusing i guess
arent you the guy who takes offence to the idea that anyone antiankh is a troll if so youd do well to avoid saying the same thing in the other direction
indeed i would do well not to say that anybody who supports ank is a troll of course ive never said anything like that so im doing pretty well on that count i have pointed out that deliliahs pattern of habitual dishonesty deception and distortion marks her as a troll that she happens to be a rabid proank partisan is orthogonal to that
switching forums for such things is handy you claimed same thing on tweakers where an easy search on evesearch showed you made 10 ankh hate posts in a couple of days let alone the amount you made totallyankh made many good proposals deal with it which one of her proposals was bad why should i care if she plays puzzle pirates hello kitty or whatever other game she has made good proposals i support her you shot down fw improvements i dont support you
how many of those were in relevant threads on eveo how many were directly aimed at her and not at that raving lunatic natana evegerclaiming that her good proposals outweigh the numerous bad things only shows that you are willingly casting a blind eye to the latter
many of anks proposed fw improvements are simply foolish and progress from a potent lack of understanding of how eve works my favorite example is her suggestion that people need an incentive for pvping evidently somehow the entire rest of eve manages to pvp because its fun it generates killmails and ships drop loot but ank with her lifetime total of what a whole half dozen kills believes that the devs need to do something to encourage pvp in fw
i dont care she likes puzzle pirates or whatever i just look at what she did in the past as csm member and what she promised to do in the future and i liked that and from the topics she made it looks like she sticks to those promises she makes good proposals so i support her and i really dont care about all the smear crap arround iti did the same with you you had no promises for future and nothing in the past that was different from what every csm member didbtw and i just support her ideas it isnt like i think she is always right for example the other election she was in i thought her ideas were horrible pirate party for national elections but not for csm electionsthree people do it for loot and everyone who does it for kms is sad yeah i know roughly half the pvp population does it for thatstrange to see how someone who barely pvps i suppose you do everything in eve apparently understands it better than you do some incentive for fw pvp would make it much more fun which is why people would want to do it she just says she wants pvp in fw plexesmissions encouraged that can be done in many ways
boy do i have a surprise for youedit here it is
no thats the point its an opinion that shows someone simply does not understand the game the very fact that anybody think that fwers need even more of an incentive is loopy literally each and every single other pvper in all of eve finds enjoyment in pvping even without special rewards but thats not good enough for some folks riiiiightand not only do fwers not actually need anything special they already have many bonuses far and away more than what all other pvpers have to start with they get eternal free wardecs they can go hunting anywhere in new eden for 100 free they also can earn lps redeemable for valuable loot just by running basic missions the idea that on top of that fwers need to be held by the hand and patted gently on the head by ccp so that theyll pvp is the kind of thinking that shows folks simply dont get pvp
i disagree slightly there are a lot of bugs in fw atm if they were fixed there would be a lot less to cry about
certainly fw is buggy but fixing the structure of fw doesnt give folks more of an incentive to find ways to gank each other i played in fw for the first few weeks after it was released and i went out looking for fights as often as i could are there elements of fw which could use some work sure but is it ccps responsibility to ensure that players shoot at each other no
she threw a spoon to catch someones attention i am shocked and appaled this will be dealt with immediatly if people are going to make topics in oope then everytime i throw stuff at them to catch their attention it is going to be kinda crowdedfw missions have nothing to do with pvp what ankh wants to change afaik so i dont see how that is related to anythingthey cant go hunting everywhere free since faction police attacks them granted filled with bugs when they enter highsec space of another faction and that doesnt add more than rvb so isnt really that much of a bonus the reason why i always have not been against special pvp rewards for fw which granted are tough to balance and i think not that important more help to get relative even fights would do way more which would be much harder to make without ruining the open element of eve is that fw is the only thing where you dont get rewards for pvp besides funhigh sec wardeccers  pirates get loot from their targetsransoms that they blow everything up anyway and dont honor ransoms so no one pays them is their problem and before you say fwers get the same fwers get opponents in low sec who are almost always also pvp fitted unlike high sec wardeccers and pirates they get pvp fitted opponents granted crappy fitted often but usually not loot to write home about and unlike high sec wardeccers they dont do it with concord protection if they are in their normal habitat low secthen the other group pvpers are 00 people there we also got the pirating part killing their anomaly runners etc which is same as above really not that many fwers run anomalies in low sec besides that we got the sov fighting where the pvpers do get a bonus if they win sov or worse moon mining which means enormous incomes because they won fightstldr i dont think giving isk rewards or similar things for pvping is the way to go however right now they do get much less in return than the average pvper
i dont know about you but if i want to grab someones attention i say their name especially in a professional setting we may be players but were dealing with a company that kind of action is symptomatic and is being used as a funnyfacepalming anecdote describing the kind of attitude we have to put up with from her part
wrong theyre missions that place people who are wardecd within the sphere of influence of those who are at war with them wrong again highsec lowsec and nullsec fw people can go hunting and have many war targets to shoot wherever they wish and they dont have to pay a single isk for that fwers have more encouragement to pvp than anybody else in the entire game and their rewards are exactly the same the claim that fw is somehow underprivileged when it comes to pvp rewards makes no sense at all

back to the topblasters and hybrids in general need help
anyone look at the fitting requirements of medium blasters look at the percentage of dps that ion does over electron blasters then compare that to the power grid too same for neutron over ion the dps goes up a little but the power grid requirement goes up by over 50 on each levelhere is some info on medium blasters t2 i think the numbers are right correct me if im wronggun power grid damage modifierelectron 105 x070 5048 007ion 158 x075 3418 007neutron 212 x080sorry my graph failed but i hope you can see the power grid jump in comparison to damage outputto go from electron to ion blasters the power grid goes up by 5048 but the dps only goes up 7 from ion to electron it is another 3418 for another 7could someone help me explain this better
just to let you know amarr and minmatar can also use drones and some of them can use them just as well as a gallente blasterboat the ones with no drone bonus also the only time you outdamage those autopulse setups using faction close range is when you use neutrons with faction antimatter also rails just suck even more then blasterspshigh fitting requirmentslow rangecap useammo usefixed damage typessome tracking issues at optimal1015 more dpsnot worth it

supported i would love to see buffs to destroyers as a relatively new player i was quite sad to be told to completely skip the class i didnt because i loved the cormie hull and the ability to have some salvaging ability on board while doing level 1s and 2sin pvp destroyers should be something that frigates are afraid of not so much that they can destroy fleets of them solo but dangerous enough that they could kill frigates better than other frigates can
strongly support removing learning skillsthey add nothing positive to the game and add an unnecessary hurdle for new players to get into the game ill also say many of the people that want to keep features like learning skills represent a sickness in mmos clinging to the idea that doing mindless unfun monotonous pointless tasks should be rewarded im sure many developers love you since its not hard to add content that appeals to you whether it be pressing a button one million times killing a thousand sheep or training pointless skills for a few months youll love it well just so long as it promises to give you an edge over the other guy who isnt quite as lame as you to be wasting their time with such horrible gameplay personally i hope you guys stop playing mmos and take up counting sand or something as a new hobby that way developers will be compelled to actually make good games
not supported they arent broken as long as you use them when needed and not front load 55 if you just train learning then yeah that sucksdont do that

novel idea 
it is absolutly ridiculous how long the players have been waiting so fari understand that the old way to submit logos and put them into the game was pretty bad but at least keep it while youre getting the new one ready
i prefer a salv version but yes ccp please seed bpcs for ore lp stores
yay signed  at least release a bpo of a similar ship with the same hull nobody will use it if theres not even a rare chance of producing a bpo
maybe ccp hasnt realized this yet but salvage and the rigs are a large part of this game people have been asking for a salvaging ship for years because our alternatives are annoying to use and ive used all of them and am at the point of considering using a t3 rigged and subbed for salvaging to take some headache out of lootingworthless free gift i care not for i would have rather the time have been spent on a useful ship this ship looks nice and id like to see a salvage variant on the market
either a ship is rare under 1000 or very rare under 100 or it is everywhere bpoa ship that everybody gets once is just junk complete and utter garbage it is nothing really special because everyone gets one yet it is nothing truly useful since it cant be replaced reasonablywhy add a well designed and cool looking ship to the game and then cripple its usefulnessthen there is also the gank factor if ships cant be replaced there will be a lot of ganks targeting them and that will hurt new players most as older characters have the money to replace it if they want to simply by buying it insanely overpriced via contract market things that do more harm to the new player experience than the good they do to old player experience are not good for the gamewhy not add a bpc to the mining corps loyalty stores like with other faction ships
thisi would like a different skin for the seeded version maybe a mark ii model with slightly different stats but if the ship do what it is advertised for it would be interesting to have the bpo available or to have a bpc offer from the ore lp store
no i look forward to the millions upon millions of tears come july 29th and beyond
while the gift issue should be unique or as unique as it can be while gifted to any and every eve active player i dont see why they shouldnt seed market issue bpos with different colours and even the zephir could have its niche if its built in numbers and not an irreplaceable collecting toy
yes seed bpos  lp store bpcs and change the stats to something that is actually usefully 100m3 cargo is a joke
usefull ships should always be able to be built and not saved in an hangar somewhere
signedif this was simply a neat little shuttle or a pleasure yacht then making it a onetime gift makes sensehowever this appears to be a useful ship with a practical purpose having a truly useful ship that can never be undocked for fear of imminent death is a bit of a cruel joke  this ship needs to be replaceable if you actually expect people to use it
please seed as bpos in an lp store or similar otherwise nobody will be willing to risk flying their irreplaceable ship
indeed i would like to see a blueprint of this available somehow
supported additionally i also advocate a similar approach with the zephyrall the zephyrs i have i treat as collectors items they dont get undocked except in repackaged form in the cargohold of a welltanked battleship if there were bpos or loyalty point store bpcs then i might actually use them for something
yay for more industrial ships

hmm i checked the pending ccp action list under b but didnt bother under s so ah ego wins i did itmy thread was a success
100 support of this the 5 at a time rule is horible and the lag is sick
any newsdata on this topic from anybody
as i already stated if you remove the ability for large blue lists or give smaller gangs an in game advantage over small one all that will happen is diplomacy will go even more meta and people will just ignore standings in game instead having each member remember a blue list of alliances not to shoot and organizing the large gangs you see now into many smaller gangs to abuse those bonuses it will not stop people working together
you guys really must be skilled working offline everytime theres no major conflict you can almost guarantee more than 80 of activity dies and the 20 that remain are macrosi suppose it doesnt really matter anymore since no one would be stupid enough to go against 30k people overall careless of their size or skill we will just wait for you guys to quit the game from boredom againso i guess i dont really need a fix naps seeled their own fate which would explain why most alliances can only get 25 max of their total nap list in any given op nc  boring everyone to death in the north where activity is reduced to macro ratting
its worth remembering that at one time there was no such thing as blues and reds and why there are nowhint metagaming 3rd party software
sure this is true so make rules to regulate the workingnap should be fat bills for alliance corporations and members maybe some wont pay to be nap so less nap in gameand war declarations and endings should be revised
theres 2 ways to skin a cat and more than one way in fixing the nap issuebut i am glad you are starting to agree theres a problem only took you and ed three pages to agree
i am certainly willing to concede that you have a problem what im doing is questioning your assumptions that ccp are responsible for player decisions that there is no alternative to sov space that there is no way for a small alliance to have sov because of the current sovereignty mechanicsif ccp removed the entire sovereignty structure and the ability to set standings of any kind you still would have powerblocks and you still would not be able establish a new alliance without engaging in some diplomacy just because a name is not listed at the top left corner of the screen does not mean a large active and well equipped group of players aka powerblock will not claim it sov follows the power not the other way aroundps incidentally your political analysis of 00 is naive and oversimplified at best
im agreeing with the people who are saying this is very very hard to actually solve this issuepeople will tend to group up especially if all your neighbours have already got themselves loads of allies already its just human naturethe only possible solution is to make it that space becomes more expensive to hold with more of it destroyable by small gangs that would mean that a smaller entity could just drive a larger but less skilleddeterminedwhatever entity out by making it a waste of time and money to hold the spacehowever that runs into its own problems so im not sure what can actually be done about this
yes lets disperse people by increasing codependency im sure thatll workif you want to make it harder to accumulate large fleets youll have to look at making new eden larger again by limiting portals and bridges while simultaneously making it possible to supply remote regions with hostiles in between look at the logistical chokepoint that is tributevale for branchtenal it is downright impossible to live in tenal without controlling either trib or venal dito for regions like period basis which you can not hold without controlling at least querious
itt the op is very bitter
sov has nothing todo with this dominion proved that and in a way fixed sov i didnt even mention sov being an issuethis is once again repeating myself so for those who have read and understood what the problem is theres no point reading on malganis  the mechanics on how naping has gotten out of hand you seem to be fixated on players aligning but dont get that im not against diplomacyalso i never even made a suggestion in this whole thread so saying if ccp removed the entire sovereignty structure and the ability to set standings of any kind you still would have powerblocks doesnt even make sense you keep bringing sov into this thread when i have stated over and over i am not talking about sovbut its fine i found a nice lowsec constellation that gets more conflict than immensea has gotten in 4 years i understand the minority of 00 would prefer to hold hands and have everything peaceful blue for all and are continuously working hard on achieving thisi just feel sorry for the people who have to go inactive immediately after major conflicts are over due to pure boredom for 9  12 months guess if anyone ever wonders how can a nap coalition of 30k members only get 300 in fleet they now knowif anything this thread show shows how laughable 00 is nc were already branded carebears because they think much like ed  his alts in this thread but it seems no matter how far you move from the north you still have the same global naping goalsoh and sov follows those who have the most numbers and i guess those who can disband others the fastesttop 25 alliances by size you will notice 10 united front alliance for example who are part of nc too making it 11 facepalm are naped by the nc they are marked red as they are the biggest abusers of diplomacy theres obviously more naps but i figured i would pick 25 a nice number ivy league is the only alliance that isnt part of any coalitionnow because you are predictable i am well aware a coalition is required to defend space this isnt the first time i have screenshotted this list i did it about 3 months ago and the only colours i used were red blue and green i think its obvious whyin the past year more so when dominion was announced members including yourself have repeatedly commented on how you would like people to leave empire and come to 00 space to the point where majority agreed with their masters than 00 needed more peoplealso in the past year there has been countless amounts of complaints wars and drama which again you were even part of to stop naps and i guess revengebased on comments research and how 00 is general recruitment alliances recruit just to be fatter than the other guy more peons  more numbers generic military thinking ignoring the fact that this is a game you get members going inactive due to transitions and complete boredom and more people are recruited grunts and peons get ordered and treated like stats however unlike rl get ed and either go inactive and leave and alliance recruit moreyou now have a problem your recruitment is tighter invite only isnt bringing a lot in so the easiest cheap method is to nap everything in 50 jumps just to prevent any sov warfare which is why every major conflict in 00 has always ended assuming its a loss in allies aka pets leaving the coalition and either joining later defecting or just fail cascadingmy point is simple not that you are capable of reading change the way diplomacy works dont stop it just change it because right now all that alliances are capable of doing are mass recruiting and napingthe way things are going unless one coalition quits the game most likely due to boredom each coalition will grow and grow and grow not like an army but more like a fungus the whines about lag will continue and in 7 years we will have omg ccp fix lagg node cant handle 500k in local
wow you are literally the dumbest person ive ever seen on this forumcongrats you just outdumbed butter dog
the fear in this thread spells out one thing and one thing only the thought of not being able to blob if you take that away from any major alliance you will in effect make 00 all about skill something that naps have lackedi understand theres some great fcs and players who are incredibly skilled but for majority of people in 00 they are merely there to add to the already huge blob because theres no greater strategy than to bloboh and that link i gave above i singled out nc because they have the highest amount of napsso flame criticise and  in the end history and actions have proven time and time again that the key to 00 is to outblob the enemy which is funny since node crashing is really classed as meta gaming which is why newer alliances will never have a independent future in 00 unless this is changedsince this is the only strategy i guess i should just nap empirefacepalm to the people who still dont get this or rather defending their land with meta gaming
for the record myself and the ini guy are not agreeing with just pointing out the logical fallacy your entire argument is based upon that ccp should introduce game mechanics to punish large groups of people from working togetherface it it aint happening
you can take ed away from goonswarm but you cant take goonswarm away from eddude i like diplomacy i have done nothing but compliment it dont spin my  makes you look weak and patheticpunish good one large is an understatement dont you think
you can try to twist my words however you want doesnt make them any less trueedit the more you post the more your intentions show to be entirely politically based
as i said before due to sc no longer existing the ideas i was planning on suggesting would be completely anti nc i did mention that this is the reason i couldnt post any of my ideasif anything i have been against big lame naps all of them forever but sadly it seems theres only one coalition exercise mass naping so it is completely understandable why this thread went from anti naps to anti nc for in the end its the same thing no matter how anyone looks at it however it wasnt my intention to make this political
in what way could such a subject ever not be political its about the most political thing possibleso anyway basically your thread isnt really anything to do with ccp or csm but is just an impassioned plea for the members of the big alliances to cut it out please guys youre spoiling it for lots of people come on now be reasonable
so youre just crying that the nc survived the sc assault then you havent put forth any actual ideas beyond dont let massive powerblocs form or break them apart these arent really csm issues nor is this the forum for those failing to formulate even a basic concept of what they want to propose
issue make the naping abuse be a top priority for csm  ccp that was the purpose of this thread i never said i would give ideas what i wanted was a yaynay on prioritising this since as it is a major thing that imo affects everyone which has been spiralling out of control for several years nowi repeatedly stated this over and over the bolded part is what people are supporting or not supporting is it really that difficult to read and that was in my first postif you had read the rest of what i said i also stated that there was a 3 way nap issue which i later took back based on the changes in the south my edits in my posts are spelling only but its all there first one isnts even editedalso considering how i started this dont you think its more of aww bitter 00 vet wants 00 to be chaotic again so smaller alliances have a chance and theres more warfare if anything this is more in favour of those who are bored in 00 all sides might i add and those who wish to go from empire to 00this isnt the first time i have ed about this there a thread months ago during the fountain invasion that said the exact same thing while it wasnt todo with supporting etc i was in favour of pl because 00 warfare itself is a disasterwhich brings me to a new point dont you think its funny how you immediately think this has something todo with sc which just shows how limited 00 is in terms of naps assuming sc was a temp reset controlled in a way by 3 people diplomatic or ed upi have no personal issues with nc only the nap thing a simple screenshot showed how 1125 top alliances in size were part of nc and you think this is diplomacy hahaha
thanks for confirming you are posting in the wrong forum here you go
always one step ahead oh and thats how i found out that vuk lau out of all people had blob warfare as one of his priorities to stop ironic really isnt it the purpose of this thread fits best here and is here for a reason i still wish to see who and wouldnt with reason it is the best section to discuss i did consider sending this to fi but since assembly hall strictly deals with csm it was no doubt the best place to beif i wish to have my ideas reviewed etc although its difficult considering the nap situation atm i will reconsider fi until then this thread is perfect for this section much like the thread i linked you is best suited for jita talks section
yes but you miss the pointagain you are supposed to come here with formulated ideas that have already been put through the ringer and are ready to present to ccp this is not such an idea
my point was to outline or in this case point out in detail the problems with diplomacy and how it is abused changing such a major part of the game cant just happen over night it also doesnt have one magical idea that will fix allhowever ccp  csms arent focusing or at least havent stated it being a major priority on this right now which again brings me to the point of this threadsome of my own ideas would fix the situation in the short term and i guess long term but in the long run could make other things worse its a very important thing and right now my only aim is to have diplomacy get looked at more in depthi have outlined the areas which are getting abused and pointed out facts and screenshots on how diplomacy has spiralled out of control so this thread is fine as it is since the idea is to look at diplomacy and what i am proposing is for them to look at diplomacy and treat it as a major feature and give it a high priorityconsidering you have already agreed with me since i never gave any methods why people are convinced i did still confuses me unless you are proving a point of being inconsistent i dont really know what else there is to discussoh and really talking about the thread being in the right or wrong place seriously is that what we should be talking about 
oh and for the record in case you are convinced this is antinc it isnt lets assume nc was dead right now you dont think sc would control all the north or lets say the drones conquer you guys what thenthis isnt about nc sadly you guys just are easier to single out because you guys abuse this the most and have done for the longest time which is stated even on the wiki pages as i said in my first post it was a three way thing it was only during this time where i was corrected on sc no longer existing assuming it isnt a false  fake reset if they did exist both sc  ncs extreme abuse of naping would have continued to have been mentionedin all honesty i think riverini or we aka derek chu emo raging saying nc are the best indestructible and theres not a single thing i can ever do about it kindda made me mention your coalition a little more than i had anticipated saying that it isnt anything personal since its about diplomacy which affects even empire it just isnt abused as it is in 00
although sni ui really needs help i dont like the idea of a library system i think really the ability to add colortags to blueprints so that they are easily recognizable for whatever reason you choose is a better option
a ui that helps organize bpos  bpcs in to their categories vary nice think we need this level of organization

because people docked up in stations must leave through the undock point making them easy to detect and intercept when they become active compare with cloakers who can be anywhere in a system and become active without warningno its not as cloakers have a massive advantage when it comes to knowing what the opponent has cloakers can be active or afk without anyone knowing the difference cloakers can also use covertcynos instantly injecting an unknown quantity of reinforcementsutterly ridiculous as cloakers are the ones who dictate engagements get a force that can kill them and they wont engage thats a problem as it puts an undue burden on defenders who must be organized and alert 237 to counter them while cloakers can be in system and asleep with no penaltywho sends a fleet of cloakers through a gate anymore how does training cloaking counter cloaking seriously do you even play the game
cloaks needing fuel is a better idea
cloaks are fine the way they areas has previously been said make them probeable is that even a word or nerf them in any other way and all you have is another class of ship thats worthless and wont be used
omg no its the invasion of the invisible paper ships let me get my thinking cap to match wits with the pilot that lets himself be outnumbered by paper ships while ignoring the wealth of intel on the local communication linesince you already ignore local move to wspace where watching local is useless and ignoring your sensor data gets you killed anyway on second thought you could fit a cloak and beat them at their own game by cloaking every time someone pops up on local you won already
covert ops cloaks shouldnt be probable i do think ships fitting non cov ops cloaks should be probable through some sort of sov upgrade though but that isnt what you proposed here
why a sov upgrade
because you shouldnt be able to just go into any system and probe out that cloaking vagabond that keeps outrunning your gangs if he can make it out of your sov with this upgrade he should be ok if you put a mechanic usable in any system to detect improved and proto cloaks the items would become worthless a sov upgrade puts a monetary cost on it and makes the feature stationary you have to decide if its really worth the cost to find cloakers
many proposals over the year ccp laughing at the headache caused by cloakgotowerkbedscrewsuch as
so sov holders should be able to gank every cloaky vaga in their systems but roaming gangs should not sounds pretty unbalanced to me
for an afk cloaker there is an extremely elegant and non invasive nerf called afktimer that kicks you out from the game usually its 15mins but since eve is based on being afk while logged on we could have it longer like an hour or soofc there would be no end to whining from afkbombers once ccp implements such a timer
nah you could make it something like a grid based weapon you remotely fired through a cyno like the old remote dd by remote i simply mean offgrid from the pos or sov structure allowing you to do it you would have to know the grid the vaga is on if he is smart and safe spotting he will still be largely untouchable but the days of sitting 200km of a gate for days would be gone as for a roaming gang why give the players a module to completely nullify an entire series of items such a module would become mandatory for pretty much every op ever making improved proto faction and officer cloaks worthless those cloaks already have a downside during most other times its the scan res decreasespeed reduction and lock time delay
just as the title says currently there is only a short cut for drones toreturn and orbitreturn to drone bayengage targeti propose there be one for launch drones even break it down where you can pick which folder to launch

current situation when you have a character on your watch list and they log in or out you get a little greenred notification in the bottom right of your eve window with their name written on top of their portrait this is noninteractable and other than name and portrait you have no information about who the person is proposed changes 1 move the portrait above the name on top of the portrait add the icon indicating your relative standings towards that player the same as you get on their portrait in show info 2 make the notification interactable  rightclicking the notification should bring up the same menu youd get rightclicking on that players name anywhere else in game 3 when you finallynot soon enough give us back our ability to sort contacts presumably with a tag system make hovering over the notification pop up a tooltip showing the contacts tags benefits 1 and 3 give you more information about the character at a glance which is useful to people who have say both friendly business contacts and war targets on their watch list 2 makes it much easier to make use of the information that the notification is giving you drawbacks 1 would take up slightly more screen space though obviously this isnt going to last very long 2 and 3 have no drawbacks

there are a host of issues like this i think you should expand this topic as many very opposite options are next to eachother for titans the jump and bridge to commands for jump bridges unanchor and jump and many more theres really no reason for these beyond bad ui design
thumbs up
im strongly against any new capitals until ccp sits down and balances the existing capitals to be honestcapitals online is boring as hell
just give them something fun like strip off all special abilities other then say titan dd and supercarriers 3 drones per level then give them something like can not be interdicted
i think making them untacklable would actually be incredibly overpowered giving them something like a longer jump range less fuel use less triagesiege fuel use or a tracking bonus these things would make them uniquely useful but not make them overpowered
i duno if you actually read my responses before billowing out faecal matterthis whole proposal will make ganking and people dying more prominent so would you please stop with the adapt or gtfo you stupid nub comment because your talking to the wrong guyi want more ganking in the 05 zones more pirates more entry class pvp for newbies to join in on
its a bad idea miners wont go into 05 systems then because of no concord on belts and ratters wont bother because its still hisec quality rats any missioning systems would dry up too there are a lot of 05 systems too so you are just packing the remaining people into 06 and upyoud also make certain systems in the middle of hisec pirate bait niarja for one would turn into industrial ganking central and a lot of other systems that dont even border lowsec would suddenly become pvp zones anjedin is one so would a lot of deadend systems small corps use as home
1 i already read your sorry excuse of a proposal and i already addressed it a while ago in case u were too stupid to remember2 lemme refresh your memory seeing as how u cant even remember your own proposalall u want is to turn high sec into low sec and even more ez ganks as if the gank targets will still stay like mindless rats and your excuse is giving newbies something that already exists3 so once again u want more ganks adapt to work for them instead of getting ccp to spoonfeed them to u or gtfo
maybe its to think about iti have great ideadid you see sphere which probe makes while scanningi propose to make sameyour ship is this center and in this sphere your sensors automatically track targetsor maybe not a sphere but just sircleplease visit your user settings to reenable imagesps took img from google
i think that would be a good idea if combined with removal of local d
they already are i thought but if they arent then yeah drones too hell if they have a cargo list on the fittings screenfor ammocap boostersetc id be happy with that too all the incidental stuff that gets forgotten is what i want
oh my seriously seriously laughingi have run hundreds over hundreds of missions and i never had problems with agents sending me into lowsec except in the few cases where i was using an agent in a border system when i did that it did not escape my attention i knew what i was doing and simply rejected the missions that went into lowsec when i did not like the frequency of that happening i just moved elsewhere further away from lowsec it worked when i was tired when i was sick when i was drunk and hell it worked when nothing of that applied id have to literally take a shotgun and forcibly remove most of my brains to fail reducing the issue with lowsec missions to absolutely zerothis whine is as if you crap your pants and then flame the pants company with you suck why is it possible to crap in the pants you sold me cant you include a plug that seals off my colon you cant expect me to have any control over my own bowels can you this is all your fault and it really stinks guys
whats the problem people elected him if hes too blunt for you htfu
currently jumping through a gate lands you a short fixed distance from the destination gate i propose adding an option to jump to a different distance by choosing the distance from a menu similar to the warp to menuthis should cause several effectsgate camps are more vulnerable to counter attack if the camp does not control both sides of the gatetravel feels safer because you have more control scouts are less necessary to avoid dying in a firelag is reduced in 00 because defending a system requires camps in all adjacent systems not just packing 100s of defenders in the same systemthis proposal stands by itself but it would work well with changes to bubbles and gate guns in lowsec
this sounds suspiciously like an end lowsec gate camps thread
oh please itd end nullsec gate camps too
i agree lowsec camps have serious disadvantages with wtz and without bubbles gate guns should be removed from deep lowsec and have real tracking and resolution in other lowsec ship generated bubbles should be allowed in lowseccamps will be effective at stopping travel and will catch people who cant use the scanner or autopilot you wont get easy kills on unscouted jumpscurrent jump mechanics encourage blobbing on a single gate it would be better to spread out camps trap people in system and probe them down small roaming gangs would have more ship options its a shame that jump bridges and cynos have removed the strategic value of gates

finn youre being a bit too optimistic id say sure you distinguish between ankh and the others but do you really think the average eve player who doesnt pay close attention to the csm will remember the difference the story theyll remember is the csm throwing spoons and theyll completely forget about the effectiveness of the meetings the actual issues they brought forward and all the other good stuff thats not to say that we should keep everything under wraps  or that itd be possible even if you wanted to  but you have to remember how other people will see this stuff and not just how you see it also i think youd get a lot more people to take you opinions seriously if you stopped acting like a gargantuan prick towards everyone who disagrees with you mynx conversely i think youre going too far the other way yeah itll play badly yeah people will get bad impressions of the csm but seriously why are you blaming meissa for this it was reported to the world by an anonymous alt  perhaps you know who the main is but i sure dont  and from there we could hardly fail to get further information trickling out as people did their assorted wtfing so unless you track down their main responsibility for this rests solely on the shoulders of the person who actually did the action in question i get that youre ed but communications discipline is nearimpossible in real governments never mind ones composed of nine nerds volunteering to debate internet spaceships youre trying to close the barn door after the horsemule has escaped besides while what the players think about the csm matters what ccp thinks matters more i dont think ccp needs to be told what happened on the forums ultimately this whole situation is total horse yes when you put three people in a room you get politics thats human nature but it doesnt have to be the politics of a secondgrade schoolyard i wasnt in iceland i dont know who acted professionally and who made an ass of themselves id really like to think the count is 9 and 0 but we all know that wasnt the case the whole time the best way to prevent stuff like this from damaging the csms reputation is to make sure it doesnt happen in the first place those of you who acted in a subpar fashion  and im sure you know who you are  knock it the hell off
just to clarify the meeting minutes should be out in the next week at which time we can talk in more detail about what was discussed this is because when ccp staff are involved in a csm meeting the minutes have to be agreed by both csm and ccp some stuff will be under nda don tinfoil hatsspoongate was a few minutes during the second to last session out of around 26 hours of meetings people were tired and the issue under discussion was emotive i only confirmed the incident happened because delilah wild has some kind of antisok sentiment and called him a liar i can honestly say the majority of the meetings ended with constructive action points a couple of meetings did not but in those cases it was not due to csm members we hope some of these action points will lead to player requested changes in eve but that remains to be seenan example of the csm working together that i can talk about before the minutes are published dv and i were in iceland early and felt that the factional warfare presentation that ank had drafted needed some tweaking it did have all the relevant issues listed but by her admission hadnt yet been polished we spent about 4 hours on layout changes drawing diagrams and rewording to ensure it best supported the proposal when ank arrived in iceland dv and her spent another 3 hours on it which resulted in a high quality presentation which all three of us were happy with the csm are probably more united on most topics than ccp would like i spoke to ank earlier today and confirmed that if i disagree with a proposal of hers that it isnt a personal attack going forward i am hopeful that things will settle down on all sides  much to the dismay of the trolls wishing to see dramaz
indeed the very model of decorum ahhh the standard song and dance if someone honestly and logically doesnt agree with you they must be trolling of course you and i both know that giving a body room to do its job has nothing at all to do with pointing out when members of that body arent doing their jobs properly in fact the ability to point out when folks arent working properly within the group is essential to maintaining transparency and accountability
i find it hilarious that it is impossible to report negative facts about ankh in an objective manner without expressing an opinion without being labeled as an antiankh crusaderwe players need to know about it and sokratesz just said that it happened which is fine no need to go all emo about it
my dear finn if i didnt know better i would say it sounded like someone had just accused you of committing journalism i hear thats a capital offense in some parts
drama in the csm well i never
yes this has never happened before
well you know what they say if people would just stop talking about what elected officials do when theyre not making public statements theyd have a much easier time crafting a public image
i dont think this does anything to detract from my opinion of the csm as a functional and useful entity as a wholeit does cement my opinion that ankh is mentally unstablei do not feel melting down on the other csm members by mynxee is warranted even if she feels this makes her job harder and it doesmynxee you are not responsible for how others in the csm behave you are not responsible for threads about ankhs behaviour either do not draw these things to yourself there is no needi firmly believe that csm is a useful project and with people like mynxee on board even the completely flaked out behaviour of one delegate will not detract from its utilityjust use ankhs latent psychosis and drama as free publicity for a great initiative instead and call it a day 
that thread serves a useful purpose in reminding us that although ankh has her flaws at least shes not jade
i posted a wall of text report one phrase gets highlighted and everybody denounces the entirety of the csm for it and they accuse me of being obsessed with her the summit was in my book very productive and i enjoyed it greatly there were many fruitful discussions and brainstorms the only reason i didnt mention the content of that is the nda and as promised you will receive a lot more info and clarification after the minutes have beep publishedthis incident says nothing about our professional attitudes or the successfailure of the csm it was just an incident get over it and wait until the content of what was discussed is released
much ado about nothing tbh that ank is somewhat bonkers is hardly news so move a long nothing here to see for a capable csm this shouldnt be more than a bump in the roadoh and btw in rl when somebody throws something at someone else they get fired
quoting this because it neatly summarizes my thoughts on the matter
and it hasnt been anything else but it is being greatly exaggerated see above also
tbh i blame sok for posting this  on shc and german forums in pursuit of attracting more voters personally i think i am the one of the rare csm 235 delegates who dont particularly dislike eva but i am amazed with the need of certain people even delegates now and before elections to troll and smack her and giving her even more attentions slash votersjust for the record every csm lineup where she was on had at least one worse delegate then she isvuk laups free vuk lau
sophia lau best lau
it appears that ankh is completely unable to act in a dignified professional and sane manner she is clearly a disruptive influence on the group dynamic and appears to be fixated on her own narrow agenda having read the minutes from previous meetings and with this new revelation i wonder how long it will be before she has a complete hormone induced meltdownin the interests of the player base the csm as a whole and most importantly herself i think ankh has no option but to resign
ankh could figure that given the composition of the csm it does give an idea of the way the players that can be bothered to get involved in the management of the game feelshe could try to work as a member of the team to try to make the best of the situation or she can demonstrate why she is completely unfit to handle the responsibilities that have been placed on herthe interesting thing is that while claiming that others are sociopaths for fighting in a video game that focuses on conflict if you consider her inability to respect other human beings out of game if they fail to share her exact view points then one starts to have serious concerns about hermynxee id just say you have a hideous job but bear in mind that if all of the people in the csm are doing their best to work together yet one is incapable of behaving within civilised norms it isnt something should be swept under the carpet otherwise it just ends up continuing the cloak of secrecy that ccp enforces through ndas and means we cant actually judge whether the csm is worth anyones time and attention we already have to trust the csm on enough things so when you start choosing what we deserve to know on the basis protecting the self importance of the csm that trust will be rapidly pushed to breaking point
spoongate just showed that ankh is an ardent pvper after all she just dont know it yet
english only please zymurgist
heres the way i see itminers industrialists antigriefers etc are certainly entitled to representation on the csm the problem is you pick a completely inflexible and irrational individual to represent your interests i wouldnt expect to receive many concessions if i were youwhy do i feel like im talking about american politics here
shigs wins thread
anhk asidei think waiting for the minutes to be posted is most wisetrolling removed zymurgist
i hope those omg ankh for csm muppets finally see their folly
because someone is but hurt about a spoon
noalso when are you gonna start representing the eve community in the csm
imagine the situation being reversed there would be no end to the rage of individuals like you and delilah about someone daring to throw a spoon a potentially dangerous object it could have hit her in the eye after all at their beloved candidate
hell weve seen people demand the resignation of folks who simply reported on the fact that ank is a silverware flinger im not sure that many folks are fooled that those same folks would be just fine if it was a question of people chucking things at ank instead
tldri thought the summit was next week
everyone please remember to post constructively and with civility this doesnt mean you cant disagree just try not to be a troll while you do it
this video is definitely related to this thread
i think the question is more what are you trying to do if i understand you correctly you are upset because sok has got in the road of your ability to demonstrate that we can conduct ourselves even a little pro on the csm he told the truth right  but you dont think we can handle the truth   i think we all know that elected bodies like their constituancy to have the wool pulled over the head  im suprised you are so blatent about iti dunno mynxee but it is kinda hard to take you seriously now way to emoi have been through many long heated meetings in my life but i am yet to see the spoon thrown ankh is truly special
while we are waiting for the minutes feel free to read my report on the csms accomplishments in iceland
following this logic sovereignty system upgrades and moon goo should all be removed as they are simply incentives for people to fight in 00 an there is not need for them right everyone will do pvp the sameto make it simple your logic if flawed
no this is the same basic problem obviously people in 00 pvp all the time even when highend moons or turf isnt at stake and anybody who knows about combat in 00 knows this people dont go on roams in order to find some deathstars to reinforce more to the point moons are rewards and points of contention in the playercreated nullsec landscape that help differentiate one zone of control from another and moons happen to be present in lowsec too that there are more things that people can fight over in 00 does not mean that the pvpers in 00 require those things in order to fight nobody ever has declared lets go on a hac roam we might find a conquerable station or lets go bust up their gatecamp maybe the last ship that dies will drop a moon
this sounds like the kind of discussion that would be better continued in thaas for the spoon thing jesus it was just a spoon get over it
that is right  kids at preschool centers around the land are known to throw the spoon at lunchtime when they lose their temper sure they get in trouble but it is just childish exuberancefear the spoon
why are you guys still on about this you are all giving fuel to candidates to deliver a fire for the players to everybody who is taking part in this i would say let it go just let it go let the csm do their csm thing then lets discuss the things related to eve the csm is trying to accomplish for us
indeed ccp should get on with the business of introducing t2 spoon launchers

i wish i got one chance a year to say listen to me ccp this is important very much supported ditch the text overview its rubbish to echo a previous poster its time this game moved into the 21st century every ship should have a distinctive bracket and if thats not possible effort then brackets should be made race distinctive so i can tell amarr from min by just looking at brackets also bcs should be more distinct from bs hacs distinct from recon distinct from cruisersit would take so little effort to make that work and combined with vectors id finally be able to pvp in eve and not this crappy mud client substitute

its pretty lame that eve doesnt have a full selectable and resizable font interface with os font choices plus the ability for knowledgeable users to add their own fontsits really unbelievably embarrassing that this game came out in 2003 and 7 years have passed with no change to fonts other than removing the ability for users to use their own when that shouldve been a standard feature to start withif i was a ui developer on this game i would be completely and totally ashamed of this lack and it would be the 1 first thing i would fix you see it every time you login this is basic ui 101 baseline expectations stufftheres no need to build new custom fonts to fix this issue
not that i think itll make any difference at all as ccp is provably uninterested in ui improvement but supported

i disagree the learning skills add a learning curve to the game which is direclty representative of eve itself you dont just jump into a hulk go to 00 and profit like in other mmos where if you learn where the good e is you can just go there and take it no this is eve first you must learn how to get that ore get the cruiser then level up to get the mining barge finally the hulk after about a month of hard work boy does it feel good now that you have itsame goes with pvp those t2 guns are a painintheroyalarse to get but they are worth it especially in those ships that require them to be really effective i have nothing to lose from this and i still do not support it because it made me think about what i wanted to do and train those skills in the order in which best made my char i absolutely do not want an eve universe where character planning is any less valuable than planning for mass market takeovers or pos assaultsto all posters that think that this is pointless time sinking then you are wrong why not just remove the skill system all together then after all its just time sinking why not just buy skills after all why would you want to wait to get something important in the game to all of you i say join wow where you can go on endgame raids at the end of a week of game play tldllong story short this is eve thought  proficiency planning  profit work  reward risk  reward

imo there should definitely be a bpobpc available for the ship any dev that is short sighted enough to fight such a thing should be gone
i would have to agree it seems a shame that such a useful and good looking ship will rarely see the cold light of space due to it being irreplaceableore lp store for a bcp make it slightly different colour or model this preservers the uniqueness of the gift but makes it a very good addition to the eve universe
id like to see this ships model reused for something just so the art doesnt go to wastewithout knowing more about exactly what the primae itself will do and how well it will do it i cant say that putting out a bpo or bpc for it would be my preferred method of utilizing the artgiven that the primae is planned to essentially be a limited edition ship that wont have a lasting impact on the landscape of the game which of course is the very reason why a lot of players are greeting it as a wasted effort maybe not a lot of thought was put into gameplaybalance aspects of the ships design i kind of hope that this is the case or else it makes the ships nonreproducible nature and even bigger waste if thats the case then some tweaking would have to be done before the primae were to be released as a reproducible shipeven if that is the case i would hope that ccp would consider the idea of putting in a little more work so that a reproducible primae mk ii that doesnt have to be its name is available at some later date that way players could still have novelty of a free prototypelimited edition primae the gift ccp wanted to give us as well as a more common version of the vessel thats more likely to be used for actual industry to add a little bit of actual depth of to the gamethe art and background for this ship of course is also very wellsuited to the oftsuggested notion of a ship class devoted to salvaging wrecks ccp may have its reasons for not wanting a ship dedicated to that role perhaps to preserve some of the advantage of flying a marauder but if it does simply come down to a matter of dev resources it seems to me that a lot of the work has already been doneanyway i hope ccp considers the suggestions that have been made here and take the sentiment behind them to heart while having these ships as oneoff free giveaways may be a wellintentioned id like to see more thought devoted to the question of how dev resources should be allocated to improve the game most substantially in the mid to longterm this gift unfortunately serves as a reminder of ccps sometimes faulty sense of priority
signedid love to see a ship specifically suited for planetary interaction we need moar industrial ships
nayfor reasons that will be clear in not too long
signedwant zephyr as wellits one thing to give pvp and novelty shuttles as gifts since the are many other ships that fill those roles already the primae and zephyr are unique in their role but lack of supply negates any usefulness my zephyr has yet to leave the hanger it was redeemed in and the same will happen to my primae so thanks ccp for giving me another ship whose only use is to look good in my hanger i was right not to get my hopes up sigh
you are a short sighted moronif you look at the history and research dealing with gaming mmomuds you will find that mostlypure pvp games die a painful death it may be slow but they will die out games that focus on achievementsocial interactionexploration usually just continue to grow until the next better iteration of it comes alongso for a game to grow it needs more than just ha ha i am better than you to keep it going oh and eve is not even a pvp game it is now a very complex market simulator

proposal inclusion of im to eve gate platformsynopsis while evegate is now a productional social networking platform there are opportunities existing to leverage more from eve experience to facilitate continuity and strengthen social relationships in game the proposal to include an im feature would be a definite added value improvement to the existing platform im allows twoway realtime interaction that is currently missing from the social platform at presentas an it professional responsible for collaboration solutions daily in my work i personally see a real opportunity here to grasp the power of social networking to exploit the gains that can be achieved through faster realtime communication and heres how1 out of game situations ie at work allows corpalliance mates to continue interacting2 onthefly planning can be achieved easily3 faster reactions to in game situations ie decisions needed from ceo finance director etc etc4 makes global more local effects of timezones are reduced through more availability5 building friendships6 keeps the user in gameeven if only via chat or voice potentiallytechnically this cant be too hard to do since integration is already done at a character level and also there are plenty to solid open source im solutions apis to work with to make this a reality perhaps even the existing im used in game could work what about the idea of voice enabledwhy do thisthe sense of community would be boosted ccps goal to grow the game would be supported through such an addition and would certainly keep players minds in the game which essentially is good for the community and corpalliance commitment there are more benefits than drawbacks in my opinion as it gives the players more choice with the platform to communicate and interact with their fellow players and friends regardless of their rl responsibilities outside the game this feature will facilitate improved communication and provide a tighter sense of community for those that cant for whatever reason make it to the game but still take part in some of the experiences from where they arecrale damarwwwlostinevenet
what if it can be taken one step furtherstar trek online despite peoples opinions of the game itself added a very cool feature to their in game chat system they made a xmpp server the protocol behind jabber google talk and facebook chat which interfaces directly with the games chat system not only can a web interface be used to chat with people in game but people can be able to use 3rd party chat programs like pidgin or trillian to talk to people in game it could even be possible to chat in corp and alliance chat as well
your buzzwords are melting my brain but the proposal is a good one ideally give everyone access to all the ingame chat channels except the ones that care what system youre inlocalconstellation via an outofgame im client
whatever the method i would like to be able to chat with people ingame in normal channels like corp chat and alliance chat while not logged in and eve gate is the perfect start

youll notice that skills only affect either the ship youre currently flying or an instantaneous actionlike setting up a market order where it can check skills on the fly nowhere else in the game do skills have an effect places where you might think they do  like ceo skills  instead work around it like by having a button to set the ceo skills that apply to the corp and not updating them in real time so if we infer from that i think its actually a reasonable bet that what you ask for simply wouldnt work in the game code skills dont do what you want them to do reason 8472 why ccp needs to recode the game but we all know how likely that is so because they cant do it that way they use this terrible kludge instead
the proposal was just generic really ill change the title to get ppl to understandits really about doing something about cloaking gangs that can just cloak up in a system for weeks popping off ppl whenever they choise and be totally invunerable and again these ships arent just crappy ones rapiers arazu sbs pilgrims in the rigth setup are in a totally win win situation and they are fast so even with out a cloak they are crazy but with wellinvulnerable
honestly you wont get any support these are supposed hardcore pvpers that believe risk should only apply to their targets not themselves theyll spew crap like eves supposed to be harsh and with risk but leave out the risk they face when they cloakcamp a system 247 choosing and picking out their targets at willthe only way to pop them is to hope theyre stupid enough to fall for a trap
its been stated time and again that ccp wants to replace local etc with a better scanning system so why are we even discussing cloaking if we dont have any immediate balanced solutions on the table
no cloaked ships should not and will never become able to be probed
wow you sound really bitter
actually ccp have stated at the last two fan fests that they do in fact want non cov ops cloaks to be probable
and you sound like someone trying to divert from the issue 
ccp said this about the current implementation of dscanner the point here is to ask ccp to look into doing something about this neglected game feature ccp will then decide how to go about automating it and what changes need to be made
there is no need to automate it at all you have no chance if youre making an argument derived from a false premise

originally posted in features and ideas discussion camera mode follow shipnew camera mode follow shipother than the normal camera style where you can look at everything from every angle from any distance how about creating an extra camera setting can be done via a right click menu on the reset camera button that makes the camera follow the ship or to have a relative position rather than an absolute one so when the ship turns you see the ship stay still but the background moves when the ship goes up your camera will tilt as wellthe reason for this is1 fun and creating a sense of becoming the ship rather than looking at the universe through a 3rd persons view all the timelorewise your pod is supposed to put you into a perspective where you become the ship effectively and the current 3rd persons camera doesnt feel like it also it represents the camera drone being idle and stays in the same location near and relative to the ship because there just shouldnt be a universal up or down in space2 tactical usages the camera can be set to follow an enemy ship for example just like the old cameranotes1 the universe will be unflattened and might be harder to understand for new pilots in fact the game will look so much different when you perceive it like an aircombat game instead of the current submarinelike sensations also it will look like the upcoming spaceship game black prophecy2 you can keep turning your ship by just spamming clicks at one point on the screen but not really unrealistic for a pod pilot he is supposed to have a very high degree of control of the ship effectively a first person shooter without wasd while is not intuative but it is already an improvement over the current click click controlalternative solutionright clicking the reset camera button will bring up a message box with a tick box if you untick axis lock it becomes the new camera mode default is on so new players can still view the game in easymodeaxis lock because of how the current camera is locked to a fixed zaxistldrcamera follows your ship like a first person shooter no more your submarine is going upwards feelingplease tell me what you think of the idea please excuse my poor english if theres any mistake and thanks for reading

not supported in my experience faction warfare is so very far removed from pvp in any other area of the game that its almost its own unique environment thats why corporations and alliances that get wrapped up too heavily in it tend to excel at faction warfare but fail catastrophically at other methods of pvp they used to be good at star fractions epic failure in at8 being a prominent example fw is inherently disorganized focused on either small numbers of tiny ships or massive gigablobs with very little else in between and occurs in the most dangerous place in the game lowsec  not where you want to drop a new player fresh off his trial accounta new player in fw generally learns the following things1 they are cannon fodder they dont have the sp to fit anything half as good as someone thats been playing for even a few months they are a speed bump the enemy runs over to go after more experienced people2 lowsec is full of people who want to kill you considering this is where they go to get killed by enemy militias pirates and sometimes their own militias new players in fw tend to develop an even stronger bias against lowsec than players who never go there theres nothing in lowsec that you cant get in highsec without having to worry about everyone in local killing you3 fleets are just a bunch of people flying in a blob this is because lets be honest most fw fleet commanders are terrible even if they were good they have no control over what ships they get in their fleet and they cant coordinate anything beyond the most simple tactics because their pilots wont listen to them fw fleets tend to be like a hammer  they have no finesse they simply rely on hitting the other guy as hard as possible4 eve is too hard like it or not that time most new players spend in highsec without any pvp has a purpose  it helps them get the finances they need to afford things chucking them right into the giant isk hole that is faction warfare and saying good luck when they can only afford a handful of rifters will give them a false impression of how difficult eve is given how difficult it actually is this is quite a feat and will likely result in new players getting fed up and leaving moreso than they already doedit ive heard rumors that one of the advanced tutorial agents already nudges new players towards faction warfare and most people that ive mentioned this to almost all of them current or former fw participants think its a bad idea not even giving the player the choice as you suggest would be even worse
i only read what was here on this thread i didnt went in the link you provided and read that so heres my thoughts on your ideacurrent fw system and newbie system tutorial from which i know are you out of your ffff mind  sorry for outburstfrom the start the player is guided and ccp his holding is hands very thight from my knowledge we do get new people in faction warfare and this is what i see in chat ok im in fw and im new what do i do  thats it  they hit the brick wall and theyre stuck there if you want your idea to be at least good here are some things needs to be changed or fixed1 make a complete review fix current bugsexploits and make some improvements to fw2 make another tutorial for faction warfare specifically3 in faction warfare you have corporation under the faction unfortunately you cant dont know why but it would be nice to see those corpsjust like in an alliance this would be easier for new people to talk to the corps on the listif ccp can do those 3 things then yes it would be a good idea but current no its a very bad idea honestly think of a person we drop in a lions cage we give that man a butter knife and we say save your life to that manto saelie you sir either do not know about fw or are out of datei choose lack of knowledge1 they are cannon fodder they dont have the sp to fit anything half as good as someone thats been playing for even a few months they are a speed bump the enemy runs over to go after more experienced peoplelots of pilots know how to fit their ships most pilots fly faction ships by the way if case you dont know others fly tech 2 ship and lots of pilots i know are very very good at it if you want a good fit just ask in militia chatplain and simple2 lowsec is full of people who want to kill you considering this is where they go to get killed by enemy militias pirates and sometimes their own militias new players in fw tend to develop an even stronger bias against lowsec than players who never go there theres nothing in lowsec that you cant get in highsec without having to worry about everyone in local killing you00 also have blobs rr bs blobs too people killing their own corp mates all over new eden buddy imo its better to learn pvp in fw because it happens in low sec and as youve said we have pirates the neut dumb ass in a bs that wants to kill you on a gate and loads of enemies at your disposalno need to wait 3 hours to kill something3 fleets are just a bunch of people flying in a blob this is because lets be honest most fw fleet commanders are terrible even if they were good they have no control over what ships they get in their fleet and they cant coordinate anything beyond the most simple tactics because their pilots wont listen to them fw fleets tend to be like a hammer  they have no finesse they simply rely on hitting the other guy as hard as possibleagain lack of knowledge on your part i know some fcs that are good other terrible but thats the same all over the eve unisverse its not always blob meister in fw you got some pilots that hangs out in solo sometimes and other who wants small fleet nothing big we got everything here just as in any fleet you need ewar support logi and all of that and we have itnot just full alpha dps lol4 eve is too hard like it or not that time most new players spend in highsec without any pvp has a purpose  it helps them get the finances they need to afford things chucking them right into the giant isk hole that is faction warfare and saying good luck when they can only afford a handful of rifters will give them a false impression of how difficult eve is given how difficult it actually is this is quite a feat and will likely result in new players getting fed up and leaving moreso than they already dowith a full set of tech 1 ship frigates for example you can wreck havok while doing a low sec roaming event its been done before and its really fun nothing is more fun than hearing a bs pilot yell in local help or stop while you pound him with frigate dps  mwhaa just like everywhere else in eve you bring what you can afford to lose man honesly i find high sec more dificult only because of the high sec wardec griefers that exist there once they got you in their lock your dead for a long time buddy
i believe you missed the part where i said i was looking at it from a new players perspective your comments verify most of what i said in that light1 you claim most people fly faction or at least can fit t2 this i know however the new player shuttled into fw right off his free trial cannot and thus he becomes everyones victim thus his perception that he is cannon fodder because he is2 those things do happen all over eve but they happen a lot more in lowsec something you seem to agree with this runs counter to the ops idea that putting newbies into the militia will help them overcome their fear of lowsec  it wont itll just make it worse3 some fw fcs are good some are terrible however the good ones are generally less likely to accept a complete newbie into their fleet because that newbie knows nothing about fleet procedure or operations and thus becomes a hindrance thats part of what makes them a good fc knowing who not to accept so the new player is far more likely to experience the terrible fcs that dont care who they get4 yes you can do this if youre experienced a new player is unlikely to have the kind of experience or the connections required to get into one of those small roaming groups again because hes a newbie and doesnt know what to do something experienced fcs dont likeagain i think you simply argued my points without reading the note above them that indicated i was looking at it from the perspective of a new player foisted into faction warfare by the ops proposal
i find this utterly hilarious and stupid all at onceyes lets force the new players into faction war only to find out that they are completely and utterly alienated from half of the high sec world by ing off the opposing factionsthe rest has already been covered but i find it rather funny that everyone missed that pointjust frakking brilliantplease go back to school while you still have dignity leftps not to mention fw is utterly screwy as it is
most people who have a fear of low sec have it because they went in unprepared and got horribly killed by 10 pirates after the first jump guess what is going to happen when you send a rookie into low sec who barely knows how to warp manually and what that is going to do for his feelings about low sec
you cant revitalize a borked game mechanic doesnt matter how much blood you pump in if the heart stopped beating 2 years agonewbies do need help to get into pvp but giving experienced fwers more easy targets really isnt the way
i knew and i was you put all newbs in the same basket you think all newbs are s and smacking their heads on their keyboard dont do that again pleasewhy  because we got some training pvp roaming fleets from time to time especially for those people they get some kills tooyou know thinking about that i personally got more problems dealing with fw veterans on comms voice and orders because most of the time they dont listen to orders which gets them killed when you say shut up to a newbie 99 they listenwhich leads me to this old saying which could give the current state of fw from an experience fw pilot you cant teach an old dog new tricks i could give you horror stories in fw which only involves vetsgoing back to newbies not all of them are stupid believe mei still hold my ground if ccp can fix and tweak fw then yes this idea would be goodif not dont send them here please for the love of god
i think it will be very cool to add next features1 presets for orbitkeep at range buttons in selected item windowevery pilot with this feature can set his own orbitsranges it will be useful to fast changing of orbit due to combat situation for exapmle ive spotted hostile ship eg cruser class in grid and decided to attack him i use first preset button orbit at 5 km to stay near him in optimal range of my turrets and suddenly he starts to neutralise my capacitor then i click on button with preset orbit distance of 15 kilometers activate afterburner or mwd and reload my turret with longrang ammothe idea is to set buttons for fast orbit change2 optional add hotkeys shortcutsbuttons for express steplike change of current orbit distancehotkeys to raise and lower orbit distance for 10 km hotkeys to raise and lower orbit distance for 5 km hotkeys to raise and lower orbit distance for 1 km with regardsps sorry of my bad english  its not my native language
no more buttonsreplace the orbit and keep at range buttons with range slider insteado 125kmyou could drag the o to adjust orbit or click  to decreaseincrease orbit by 500m
a proposition about hotkeys is pretty good imho change orbit by slider in combat will be slowly than button clickingalso it would be correct for keeping range may be
shamelessly stolen also supporting my own topic
absolutely supported i might also addlock on  look at  annoys the hell out of meview market details  trash it  really why are these next to each other open my cargo  eject  ive never made this misclick but it bothers me having them next to each other when i am salvaging
goes to show that ccp really dont play eve as much as they say they do or these things would have been fixed i noticed these things as a problem as a noob years ago you mean to tell me if they really play they wouldnt have noticed thisthey either dont have the time to be bothered more time sink useless pi mining schtuff getting in the way but honestly with skills like omnipotence and flying around jovian ships you think they play the game like we do either way i dont see this being fixed soon ui stuff always takes forever it seems to be woven into the spacetime of eve or something and cant be disturbed or the whole thing will come crashing down
if there is any thing that is more obnoxious in highsecurity space fights it is neutral people intervening with remote repairing of any kind there is very little someone can do about this and it almost always ends up with the person who was getting the repairs winning the fight even if they were the lesser playerthe only realy thing a victim of this cheap tactic could do is shoot the person who is neutral repairing but the problem with this is the repairing can dock at any time they want so if they get shot they can immediately dock into safety and by this time the opponent was repaired enough so that they end up winning the fighti think that if im going to get killed by this then i should at least get a killmail on that enemy ship that is remote repairing so i propose that if someone repairs someone then they cannot dock or jump through a stargate for 1 minutes just like if you were to shoot someonethis would also bring down the amount of people using this tactic because they actually have to take a risk and it would increase the market for logistic ships because they will actually be dieing now

wtb true sanshas dreadnought kthxthis would actually be a clever thing to do right now plotwise with the current live event storyline having the sanshas suddenly flashing caps supercarriers and even titans maybe open them up in a pirate faction militia lp store
putting them in a pirate lp store is actually exactly what i suggested
a possible way to manage this through the lp store without requiring 23 years of grinding lp might be to break the capitals up into 45 items have the bpc available to buy there but make the bp require a number of other items only available off the same lp store in order to be built this would allow players within a corporation to effectively pool their lp in order to accquire one of these toys as the cost would be split maybe 46 ways
i really like that idea working on a revised op atm
i really dont like this idea as if the game isnt enough capitals online already
do you really think this would create more capitals and not just a wider variety capital proliferation will continue even without the option of new faction ships
thisnot supported
it isnt capitals that are boring it is having to pound on a structure that no one will defend that is boring even the reinforcement mechanic doesnt usually lead to fightsedit support more faction stuff
ccp did mention plans for faction capital modules and more capital sized modules at the last fanfest ie capital sized armour plating though no mention of plans for faction capitals although would be pretty cool so supported
first you must realize it takes six months to a year just to change a model say to add a turret mountnow i want you to read through that post very carefully note that faction models can take several more something somethings to do and capital ships have animations as well which requires even more things and stuff which then has to go back and redo something somethings and its all very technical we only have estimates and guesses as to what it takes to create an entire ship model for a faction capital ship but experts throughout the field have estimated it can take upwards of a decade minimum to produce a ship model a faction capital ship would be awesome but it just isnt possible ccp would likely have to divert the resources of their company entirely to produce it possibly bankrupting eve and destroying the gamei hope you understand these are just the facts we have to face it isnt possible
yet they produce a toy ship every few months for the playerbase take that team put them on this blam you have a long term project for those people to work on that is more than hey a shuttle with a probe launcher

this seems like an accurate assessment because the bonuses are still based on the module not the ship like the other races scarriers the bonuses do not scale up like those of the other races scarriers
ya this needs to be done

there are some small corps that do not have big variety of agents but you really need stuff from their lp store nobody sells it in contracts i choose agent in border zone i collected half lp needed pretty fast before tyrannis but now 9 from 10 missions are in low sec i dropped my plan and moved to deep high sec systemsit is just very strange if you want to work on high sec agents why they send you to low sec otherwise furb killer is right
perhaps ank is in crazysuperhero training
i have known many people that have bot bothered with eve due to the painfully small fonts a simple solution that will bring new playersplaying on 7021080p is terrible planning on getting a 32 tv to swap for my current monitor playing eve on on will be a nightmare
you know she is being very straight to the point about this issue and her message came over very clearlynow stop trying to troll mynx
i was reading ankhs report before and came across the followingin my opinion the current csm is the best and most productive so far and i look forward to working with the other council members the coming yearyou gotta admit in light of the spoon and other reports from the evil sok this comments meaning changes  you gotta wonder what went on at the last few  sure it would nice if we could just get along but when we cant at least be honest about it they are elected officials with conflicting agendas  we should have honest feedback to judge them byim not sure eve is ready for the csm to go slick pr on us as for the spoon it is hilarious i think it should become the word for extra special carebearsfear the spoon
ahhh disagreeing with your opinion is trolling classic it certainly was a bit odd that mynxs response was to get upset that the 100 accurate and correct facts were related to the playerbase if one of the csm members responds to frustration by not only constantly complaining about conspiracies against her and refusing to work with people who disagree with her but by actually throwing things at people she doesnt like well the playerbase deserves to know about it thats what transparency and accountability are all about and if nothing else the voters deserve to know whats going on now rather than waiting till the next election cycle to be bombarded with all this  at once mynxee is generally a quality player and seems to be a decent leader but getting upset in public when the truth was reported is always a bad tactic the best way to stop the playerbase learning of temper tantrums like the one that was reported is to make sure that csm members arent throwing temper tantrums and nobody is responsible for anybody elses behavior
nerf spoons buff forks
in terms of i cant help bitter trolls but if you be more specific i will give my best
odd to see you take the word troll in your responces a lot more than anyone elseanyone not agreeing with you is a troll i looked back quit some responces of yours and i keep finding the same responce over and over you calling the other party a trollyou only excell in taking a small portion of a statement which you can twist and turn but i actually never see a responce to a whole statementfact is that this kind of derailments you progessivly support actually benefit nobody else than your epeen in becomming the biggest troll and saboteur on the forumsthere hasnt been anything really constructive sprung from your fingers in responce to anythingi for one feel sorry for you that this is the only way you think you can get attention
holy mother of whatever deity you believe inyoure my hero abrazzar
good to see those male hormones you are so full of are kicking inover interpretation why that is what this thread is all aboutbtw the race is on to see who of ankh and sok manages to get themselves removed from the csm prematurely odds are looking equal
i know isnt it ironic dontcha think now gandry weve talked about your compulsion to lie in order to troll me and you really should stop now get back to trolling me by suggesting that unlike everybody else who isnt a csm and who posts on the forums somehow im supposed to be a csm that a boy
finnnotagainyour replies become more pathetic by the day is the little cesspoole you normally take your comments from running dry
thats very disconcerting  but completely in line with a lot of other things we get from ccp incomplete inaccurate inconsistent incomprehensiblemore transparency and updates are one of the constant requests you can find and every time the reply is that might be goodit just never happenskudos for continuing with something that appears to be pointless on so many levels
this reminds me on some eastern parliament with small brawl interims pthe csm is presenting itself pretty bad in the player community read the entire forum thread with the point of view of a 3rd party and tell me what you think after the readingto make a conclusion 1 person misbehaves several people plantig the facts in forums knowing it will heat a discussion showing no unity in forums lack of communicationyou do not need to like each other but stop drama drama consists of support antisupport facts nda using informations you gained as profit of some kind diskussions of any kind with 3rd party members quarrels in public
well written but i require some more details as soon as you have slept and have time 
fun things to read shineyty for the update  will read again when more awake edit do you guys have pictures of any kind any please
do you feel that you can demonstrate professionalism and the ability to bring issues to ccps attention best by throwing things at people who disagree with you overhand or sidearm perhaps you could express your professionalism better by kicking perhaps biting
trolls are slow today only in on the 4th postnow grow a pair  post with your main if you dare
so do you think that we can best help ankhes to reach her full potential by giving her darts or perhaps frisbees maybe paper airplanes
nice summary thanks for the info definitely looking forward to seeing the minutes
a good start to the csm5 kudos to mynxee and the comittee for the hard work on behalf of us lowly immortals and thanks to ankh for putting up this updatei look forward to more updates and eventual resolution of the issues raised
so basically nothing on eve will be worked on for another year or 2 while they finish dust and release some more eyecandy in the form of wissounds like the sociopaths have taken over
this is friggin unbelievable 6 months of petitions forum whines mass tests etc etc and ccp still didnt manage to actually become aware of all the symptoms players have been screaming aboutyep dynamic handover of players i called italso thanks for confirming my suspicion that nathan is a dork
excellent reportone obversation ccp always hammered that incarna and dust would be created in atlanta and shanghai respectively and would not take any resources away from evebig fat lie
an interesting read but a little depressinglooking forward to spooning up the minutes though
pretty much that was interesting but it pretty much says csm is being ignored nonshocker and ccp doesnt have any plans to fix stuff new ui would also be way bigger selling point then stuff like planetary interaction in an expansion
i wonder if this nonofficial report violates the nda
good informative report despite the circus however i just want to add that having fractured reports from different csm members is not what folks are looking for my impression at this point is that the csm reps are only putting more efforts towards selfinterest rather than dealing with the issues put forward your whole public front is fractured which no doubt is good drama food for the drama afficianadoslet me ask this question do you have a single website or information source where everything regarding csm can be perusedviewedreferredarchiveddiscussed the official eve forum eve wiki and various csm individual sites dont really fit into this picture let me give a rhetoric what would your response be if im an eve noob and complaning about pve missions get the idea now
i highly doubt that since when reading the previous meeting minutes ankh exactly knows what falls under the nda and such details are not published by her requests
ank thank you for the interesting report id also like to put my shoulder behind dograzors good natured request for photos and other shineys delilah
ccps reluctance and inability to respond to the csm isnt as bad as i had anticipated i was actually expecting an eddie murphy beverely hills cop style fingersinears la la la i cant hear you you think you are talking to me but i cannot hear you you might as well stop talking i cannot hear you
totally confirming ccp are still playing their own gameawesomeeditcould you explain what kind of stakeholder the csm represents when basically none of the issues get any commitment and how this is a major step forward
im almost angry and feel like weve become similar to the wow community in that our development team has been pulled away from an existing fruitful game to work on completely separate games i wouldnt mind if this game was more or less fixed and the previous expansions more or less completed but that isnt the case
where is the part where vuk yells at ccp to fix the lag and get some results like he said he would
i think even the tier three frigates need to be easier to fit
approvefear the spoon
finnagainif you are so wise and allknowing why didnt you try to run for csmwhy is it that anyone not agreeing with you gets the name troll is that the main responce in your vocabularyand looking how the rest of the csm is more involved in teaming up against one candidate they dont agree with instead of doing what they were elected for i seriously doubt this whole csm delegation is worth the votes they receivedas for the remark from malkanis that ankh pulled away votes from other more worthy candidates please show me whichsok is mainly doing his hatething versus ankh and as such is wasting his seat clearly for personal grudgesfinnagain is clearly a loudmouth who has nothing better to do then call other people trolls when they dont agree but when push comes to shove nothing really worthwhile comes from himi dont give a rats ass that people dont like eachother in the csm they werent voted in there to like eachother but to work as a group to help better the gamenow however it seems more and more its actually 2 camps who are more busy battling eachother than doing what they were elected fori want to congratulate them to bring real politics into eve and doing actually nothing else then receiving some minor perks without doing anything relevantso here finny now go on and call me a troll againabout fwmy personal idea about fw was always more concentrated about actual pvp over territory to increase the influence of your faction if you want to run missions you dont need fw make fw actually that what players expect from it one side battling the other side for dominance and make it worthwhile in some way to actually establish dominance and not by completing some missions or crap cloaky sitting at some spotdo something about the ui and also about the various docking ranges at stationsmake docking timers at stations also longer when initiating agression this mainly to make the undock and docking game less feasable and make docking a real risk if you want to pew someoneall that kind of crap they should work on not on stuff like  whaa i dont like you so you cant play with me
because youre lying and thats not true that was an easy question i agree but you need to step up your trolling ps if you dont want to be called out for trolling maybe stop trolling
a real reply like my 8 year old nephew would do you sir are certainly a gem in responces for 3rd grade i salute your extensive ways of looking superiorand just to be sure you understood what i saidi was being utterly and completely sarcastic in my first remark
in this thread you have addressed comments to ophelia ursus agreedelilah wild bull slander trolling etcvenkul mul densemynxee no open difference in opinionmiyamoto isoruku agreekiller gandry not even a good trollfurb killer youre about to cryherschel yamamoto no open difference in opinionso of the four people who youve had disagreements with youve called two trolls and spent much of your replies to the other two on personal insults pardon me if i think that youre stating your pointa touch too emphatically
so the usual 00 centric csm is upset that someone isnt in favour of bumping all 00 issues and suppressing all fw issuesbest csm member yetsick of csm being used as a complaints reduction machine while ccp goes off to develop other productslight a fire under themif the devs think were all idiots for wanting overhyped expansions to be finished within 5 years of release then they can live with us not paying their wages anymorefrom the very start its easier to keep existing customers then to acquire new oneskeep releasing expansions for the sole purpose of hype and promotion to new customers and you loseccp survive the gfc only to spend all their dev time on risky tangents smart good for us the existing paying customers of their existing longstanding subscription service
you have a very odd way of confirming that the quote shows that gandry was lying about me in order to troll me with metairony and that he objected to the fact that his trolling was being pointed out and of course now youve insulted me once and made an entire other post to discuss what you see as flaws in my posting style namely that you are upset that ive insulted people or criticized their posting styles
gandry made one statement about you that was intended to be truththat most of your recent posts are about ankh and its a true statement so how exactly was he lying about you or using those lies to troll youand the difference is that you just accuse people of things randomly i actually back my statements up also im willing to acknowledge the possibility of a genuine and reasonable disagreement whereas youre seemingly not because seriously aside from the linguistic errors gandry made in his first post what he said was pretty reasonable and your only response was youre not even a good troll thats not debate thats flinging poop
please dont derail from my comments because of not using propper english for a third language i think i do reasonably well in the english departmentthing is that finnagain has 2 sorts of responses towards people he doesnt agree witha insult them and call them trollsb copy and paste one small section and take that as a full quote to hammer alonga real discussion isnt possible with finnagain since he hides behind those 2 mechanicsi will wait a few more years till hes out of the diper phase and try again
no he made several the one that was just referenced was his lie that i call everybody who disagrees with me a troll the fact that it wasnt true he knew it wasnt true and you just showed again that it isnt true therefore he was saying something he knew not to be true in order to throw out flamebait interesting that youve not only somehow managed to miss context and the situation youve also ignored half of my post that youre talking about his substantive response was in response to a post of mine and rather than responding to a single point that i was making simply tossed empty insults what i actually said in addition to the only thing of youre not even a good troll was brilliant factual response because he wasnt actually responding to anything at all id said and was merely trolling me so ya know i said he was trolling because he was trolling and you are somehow imagining a reasonable anything he started with a throwaway insult that i must be bored then he decided that i must have a personal grudge against ank totally ignoring the substance of everything ive said then that her conduct once elected was no concern at all then that i was quixotic then another throwaway insult and yet while you insult me and talk about the quality of my posting and take me to task for insulting people and commenting about the quality of their posting now youre supporting a contentfree series of personal insults directed at me as very reasonable curiouser and curiouser i see you are engaging in some good debate yes
isnt that exactly what you are doing since the elections began
as noted you must take into account also other ships with ship maintenance arrays iteron v rigged and with gscs can take almost 50k several of those in a carrier would transform the carrier into a cheap jump freighter unable to enter hisec though
lol d ah the memories thanks for the love keep it coming
i support this idea fully but it doesnt seem to be ccps business model as they seek rushed but new and marketable aspects  dust will probably end up the same also
supported with all my heart its time to clear the backlog ccp
i support this
bit late now guys ccp totally ignored it at the csm usual lip service response
supporting as ccp need to commit to finishing what they start rather than losing interest whenever tasks start to get difficult projects lose momentum or they simply find something new thats more interesting to do
source please

i support this 100 as and eve player of almost 3 years now and still playing despite my gripes of actual content that fixes current game mechanics and pi to be honest was not really necessary i seemed like a joke feature put out to curb prices the game needs some work on core things dominion is a very good example of this of half hearted features and not fixing lag and things if they want the player base to pay for there game fix the ghost jumping lag ffs 2mins to jump into a system that does not have people in it work on the game and slow down on features
10
i support this
oh god please yes stop with the new shinies and fix the existing brokenhalf baked features
10
supportedas a long time player i have to say the mostly lag free months going up to dominion were the most enjoyable months for eve ever it showed a tantalizing glimpse of what eve could be sadly i am rapidly coming to the conclusion that that will have been the only glimpse of what eve could have been in the hands of a professional company the state of the servers since coming back from a break has shocked mego back and fix the bugs leave the shineys in your trousers i dont care about them and never have compared to a decent lag free and functional game
there are enough major problems bugs and promised yet unimplemented features in the backlog that ccp could spend one or two entire development cycles on them release them as the backlog expansions and they would feel like full expansionsat this point theres no excuse for ccp not to stop the wouldntitbecoolif development and get to work on improving the quality of the existing game

by the sounds of it this thread has failed to persuade ccp the csm minutes should be interesting

i do not believe that this is a broken mechanicif you are fighting on a station a logistics ship takes an entire 60 seconds to come back out of the station at minimum after being forced to dock when he undocks you know exactly where he will be and he has to either wait out his session timer a further 30 seconds or brave your damage right on top of him when he becomes lockable right away if he wants to come out in a fighting ship after gaining your aggro thats a full 90 secondsif you are fighting on a gate you can force a logistics ship through the gate into the arms of anyone waiting on the other side if they want to come back they will not only take 60 seconds minimum to do so but they will be off the gate and thus able to be tackled on their returni would support the change under one condition friendly assists must not always give you a 60 second gatedock timer there should only be a 60 second gatedock timer if an assisting action makes you aggressed to someone new such as a neutral logistics becoming blinky to the assistees war targets thus war target logistics should be able to remote rep corp or alliance mates all they want and jump at any time and thus if a neutral logistics began repping someone at war they would gain a 60 second gatedock timer at the first rep cycle but after 60 seconds they would be free to dock or jump at will even if they were still reppingtldr the current mechanic is ok a change would be ok too as long as repping does not always prevent you from jumpingdocking

gallent slow boatinexistent optimal rangefalloloffreal pwgcap eater for paper dpsho last thingsadvanced projectil ammo have a falloff modifier in range with the use of the weapon and gun advanced blaster ammo have too this bonus on falloff but 25 less than projectil why not an optimal bonus on advanced ammo to get in range with the way to play it do you think ccp can do it  yeas they did it but they nerf the tracking on this ammo 0 further the ammo that can gives the more dps in blaster voidhas the optimal the tracking and the falloff modifier in negative do i mentionned the 25 cap eater just for shooting with this lolammo note  hail medium has too the cap modif in negative but only 7 with a gun that not requires any cap for shooting and ships has base velocity higher than other ship so in short you have a gunammo config that be supposed to overpowered other when in range but you have a slow boat that will never get in range when in range you cant maintain this range when you may maintain this range you dont have the tracking needed  and when you have all above you dont have any cap to keep shooting target switching ammo takes 10sec you must admit ccp that hybrid is well balanced in game but for the 2005 eveonline not for the 2010 game when ships become more and more fast more and more powerfull gallent just stay the same and this is not because pilots dont have imagination in fitting themand plzplz dont tell me about droneslast fight i need to give the order attack 3 times during the fight drones are attacking then just sitting on their ass you have to give the order once more and more and more post fully supported
back to the topblasters and hybrids in general need a lot of loveas it is projectiles and lasers both out damage and out range blasters
im supporting the idea however this repairing should be an alternative to launching drone this will give you third fourth if you warp away from your drones tab in the drone menu drones in maintenance bay so now you could either launch 5 drones or repair 5 drones carrier and adc skill at 0 wtf are you doing in a carrier supported

ui improvements always supportedmy most favoritea complete overhaul of overheatingability to ctrlclick broadcasted target like from overview
would also be nice to move the view planet button to the back in the selected item menu next to show info would make life easier i think
yes lets revamp the ui things like leave fleet and quit corporation should not be near each other when i right click on my shiptime for the little things
supporting all the ideasexcept allow reactivation of modules accidentally deactivated before cycle endsbecause shield booster takes effect at the beginning of the cycle while an armor repairer takes effect at the end of the cycle its just one of the many example 
whats the problem there
being able to filter the starmap would help hugely show only selectedcurrent regionconstellationrouteview multiple selections to show home region and connected regions only or any arbitrary combination up to the full map of everything expand the star colorationstar icons to be able to overlay colors like on round aircraft flag insignia so we can have multiple sets of informaton like pilots in space last 30mins and kills in the last hour infact querying specific portions of the starmap instead of the whole thing would probably give performance gains aswell and 1 support to everying else that has been said so far
please point out and link where ccp say this im most intrestedthis should be good

fast forward to the 38 minute mark of this videopersonally i would prefer to see 12 in all attribute points and skip the 10 bonus the end result will be almost the same amount of spyear but we dont have to mess about with decimal points for the attributes removing even more confusion for new players reading their character sheets
learning skills do nothing for the great game that is eve im sure they were great when they were brought in giving everyone a chance to train quicker the only good thing about them is that chance to train quicker there is no other reason for them eve wouldnt lose anything from removing learning skills but it might get more people to playpeople say theres not enough people in low or nul sec removing learning skills might be a way to get more people to play eve more people playing eve means more people in low and nul sec more people to shoot atbut the people that do have them trained especilly 55 should be reimbursed those skill points as op said we also need the 11 attributes otherwise training will be to slow1 nice idea op
ive been staring at this thread for some time weighing out the pros and cons of ithonestly i hate learning skills i remember juggling between them and skills i actually needed when i started the game now a year later i look back at them and wonder whyi support the removal of learning skills and the proposed means to compensate for their loss
supported
supportedremove them it takes a long time anyway to train many of the skillsoption could be to remove the learning skills but keep the possibility to have implants
they are like cancer it hurts to remove them but youve gotta do it for the grater good youve got to remove the cancer to save then entire body
hisupported the intelligent choice is to remove them ops solution is simple but effectivewhen is a choice not a choice when its eve online learning skillsthe choice argument holds no waterresistance to this change is very similar to sepp blatters stance on goaline technologyage resists change sepp thinks this newfangled technology thing is dangerous for the sport  the rest of the world disagreeironically change has been forced upon himif an elderly gent like sepp can roll with the necessary changes then i think that those not supporting this can too and for the same reason it is a completely necessary change for the good of the game
supported
for those that learned the learning skills ccp should allow those players to redistribute the skill points in other fields and get compensated for the skill book cost also these pilots should retain a subtle speed bonus based upon how advanced they were with the whole tree thus those that had it maxed out should have this bonus for about two years slowly weakening over timeand then it is overno there should not be a freeforall attribute bonus for everyone people constantly demand the removal of this set of skills so ccp should remove them and call it a day let everyone train at the rate of those that never trained the learning skills people want their cake and eat it too  screw it let players train with attributes they setup through the neural remapping and implants they can affordyep this will harm me too but too many whiners demanding the removal and the bonus they entailed all on one silver platelets really make this a cold harsh game again
all the counter arguments say the same thing removes depth and planning of the gameremoves depth and planning in what way would it make the game more shallow if we remove them how so the hundreds of skill even without the learning skills already makes the game so deep that even 4yr vets cant obtain all this skills look at this dude here
simple and efficient way to suppress learning skillsand i wouldnt mind having 2m sp free to invest in something else
just because i dont want my newer friends to leave eve because they cant be bothered to train learning early on and then ragequit because they dont have their 100 bonus lolsupported
yes thats how the mining career path works only you left out the prerequisite learning skills which add nothing to the experience let me put it another way what would be the benefits of adding them to the game if they didnt exist alreadyand hard work please dont delude yourself patience is all it takesedit  also theres very little decisionmaking involved since evemon does all the calculations for you decide what skills you want it tells you what learning skills to add on to reduce the time taken ooh deep
thought of something reading other peoples posts  as i am apposed to getting rid of them  seems like the posts are moreso for newbie players so they play the game rather than skill up on learningwhy not do something like this if you got the skills in cue  thats fine keep em they stay as areotherwisethey are not available till you have an x amount of skill points 3 mill or somethingits a bonus for later on to speed up learningi would be upset if they got rid of them all together as i have skilled up significantly with them for the payoff down the road
as a four year old eve player i fully support the removal of all learning skills the reimbursement of all sp to be distributed as you please and the addition of 10 attributes 10 however id still like to see remapping unless ccp are going to show like in the old character creation screens how attributes are distributed if ccp dont allow remapping or the distribution of attributes as you wish i will not support thisso while im supporting what ops posted id like it to be done right and not the ccp way after all who wants to have the bloodlines with totally messed up stats eg 17 perception 11 willpower and 20 charisma as a pvp bloodline and before anyone here says ccp wont do that id like to point out all the other total ups ccp couldnt possibly have got wrong but did regardless
fully support this ideai hate having to train learning skills again and again you create an alt what do you do first train learning skills even for a simple alt with a few specific skills on the same account you need for a specific purpose hauling exploration trading evemon will suggest you train at least some learning skillsthey take time and keep you from training for the fun stuff in eve rather than train for training those thingswith the new sp feature it would be even easier to refund those sp people put into learning skillsas for the statement it is a solution looking for a problem new players get into the game if they have someone around giving them advice it usually also says train learning skills early new players cannot afford the advance learning skills they dont enjoy playing while they only have learning skill and thus lacking combatminingexploration skills in that time means they might quit soonerthey can off course choose not to do so but most people will regret it later because then they no longer have the double training speed which you get below 16m sp and those learning skills take even longer to train thus are even more anoying
i just made an account and learned learning skills are a wise investment early on also used evemon and made a plan for about 9 months quite a lot of learning skills were recommended but i dont feel like investing everything i earn into those expensive 45mil each skill books i could buy a nice cruiser for that for all of them id have enough for a battlecruiser almost at least i got a couple of attribute implants for free which was nice but im not suggesting i need to have that isk refunded for those expensive books if this goes through id be happy enough not having to train them so high and use that time on something else

like so many other things for clickageddon aka pi
not sore if anyone else thinks this but it is pain to set all the extractors on all my planets so what i was thinking was if you could multi select all the extractors that are lifting the same resource and set them all at the same time rather than one at a time what do you think
it is meant to be a pain you can choose between easy maintenance and maximum output if you want maximum output you need to babysit your facilities and invest time doing so also makes it harder for macros
what is a that videogame for dad to bring you pain
jesus what are you some sort of gaming masochisteve click slave whip whip click until your fingers bleedyou yes mistress eve make me make me click more
correction it encourages macrosrequiring several more clicks does not make it harder for macros i could sit down for half an hour or so and make one to cycle all my extractors if i chose to it really is just that easy and it would probably save me from contracting rsiedit please visit your user settings to reenable images
supportedeither get rid of multiple deposit choices and let extractors autocycle or allow us to issue massorders to all extractors simultaneously
i have 5 planets and 10 or so extractors on ea one its a pain in the ass to do it and i know other people that feel the same way it would be much easier to multi select them all and set them at the sane time so id definitely support your idea big thumbs up to it
please rsiits killing to many clicks
ill go one further in terms of csm dsicussion on this matterpi needsselect allroute alllink allextract allchoose cycle allinstall allplus ctrl clickshift click options to select multiplesi believe the outcome of not addressing these changes will be rampant devaluation of isk and in terms of keeping players or encouraging new players rampant isk devaluation is not good
mindless repetitive clicking is tedious boring and ultimately counter productive as the limiting factor it will just attract macros that squeeze out real playerseve is fundamentally a strategy game not some mindless twitch fest therefore the difficulty and challenge in pi should be in devising successful strategies of production and competing with other players and not some torturous ordeal by mouse i support attentionaction on this issue however im not keen on groupingi think a more dynamic approach that relies and thinking and less on mundane repetitive clickingi think the best option would be to change the way extractors work and make them much more like processors they are started and they automatically continue players attend them review and tune them on an on going but adhoc basis they start at the best extraction rate but over time their extraction rate deteriorates this would be in line with the current extraction cycles rates so for example they start at the top rate for 30 mins drop to the second rate for 5 hours then the 23 hour rate and finally the 96 hour rate a player can attend to them and resurvey at the top rate but that is entirely optionaltechnically this should be quite easy to implement especially compared to ui changes needed for groupingat a later stage the ability to vary the production up or down by running missions a little like with research points and entirely optional but necessary for the most efficient productionegforeman the machinery is worn out we need mechanical parts to fix it and get it back to 100 efficiency extractor efficiency reduced by 10 until until suppliedforeman the workers are unhappy at being on this forgotten forsake rock and production is suffering 10 etc if you supply tabaccospiritdancing girls im sure their moral will improvehave some missions that fix reduced efficiency and some that boost efficiencyforeman the machinery is badly designed we can modify it with x units of robotics and get it upto 110 efficiencyforeman if you can offer the working an incentive bonus consumer electronics for the rec room i sure i can get efficiency up to 110etc
to switch on the extractors manuallywe have cloak we have warp drives we live in space and must switch lots of extractors on manuelly  i think eve will lower the niveau to wow my opinion is an option to switch all extractors on per planet
supported with a provisothe original gift versions should retain their skillless prerequisites the manufactured version should have skill requirements to flythat way the gifted one still retains some unique features over the manufactured versionthis should be the case with the zephyr and the upcoming primae
yeha the above interests me too i believe that you could make the skillless primae the mk i as such with the iteron mk i through v thought the iterons have always been available so in this case the mk ii would be the same but with a few changes if you wish i do believe it says in the devblog that we are been given a gift to test out a new ship correct me if im wrong make this the mk i and then do a mk ii jobbie keeps the croud happythe art guys spend a lot of time on the ships in eve this ship should certainly join the orca and rorqual on the field as a permanent i love the ship design and im hoping the slots and stats hold their ownsinged seed this now
make it a bpc in an appropriate lp store and the idea might be going somewhere otherwise theres little idea to add more t1 ships
i am interested in your post kali i guess i will have to wait till tonightif you are suggesting that the gift is too hard to kill or too unballanced then would you oppose a suggestion to reballance a production version to be seeded into the game in one of the ways suggested in this thread
nopeyoure missing the point of a gift and most likely have distorted expectations of how good itll bewhen they say large cargo capacity think 500m3 possily 1000ive not seen the specs yet but if its anything more than that ill be surprised
would recommend bpcs or bpos be provided through ore even if it is a pain in the nuts to get lp for them with their position in 00 space its a shame to have a neat unique ship that i cant use because people will suicidegank it for lolzedit heres a more fleshedout proposalore distributes the primae now as a test prototype to see what capsuleers will make of it they let it go for a few months to study its usage and capabilitiesonce the test period is complete ore unveils the primae mk ii which will serve as an upgraded version of the original primae that can be purchased from ores lp store blueprint copies are also available originals may be restricted this primae mk ii will have an extra slot or two possibly adjusted hullarmorshield values and would require a notinsignificant skillset to fly the skills required would be split like a pirate faction ship as ore is a nonstandard faction and likely uses technology from multiple sources it would also have a different paintjob and minor cosmetic changesthis would keep the original primaes valuable collectibles while the primae mk ii takes over the functional end of things if only blueprint copies were available it would also keep the ship somewhat rare owing to how hard it is to get lps for ore this would keep the ship around and circulating which seems to be what people want
yes please make this not a one off bpos please
it can carry less than a basic t1 hauler and has no tank to speak of its free for a reason people
youre wrong
rather than release bpos for these ships why not just release bpcs obtainable from ores lp store
yes i believe new hulls should be permanent sure the zephyr is just another scanner but if primae is what i hope it is then itll be unique i also believe it could be a great tool for newer players again if its anything like the ship im hoping forsupported
i would have supported this but then i saw its stats just remove it from the game tbh its less useful than an interbus shuttle
post has been updated with new information coinciding with the primaes release
as it turns out when i was autolinking the primae to my corpmates i noticed that there is a primae blueprint in the database which can be linked and everything the bill of materials tab was missing from it but the fact that there is a blueprint for the primae in the items database is promising unfortunately its not seeded on the market even when i unchecked show only available there was no primae blueprint in the market

i was talking with some friends earlier and we all agreed that variations kill feeling when upgrading to a t2 ship they should be called variation i dont know about you but i feel that variation is the wrong word to use for t2 ships with the same hull just a new paintjob if the case is that ccp is running out of ideas then why not turn to the communitynow im not an artist i cant draw however im quite sure that there are quite a few talented artists flying around in new eden what im suggesting is ccp making a thread dedicated to posting concept art of new hulls where the rest of the community can vote approvedisapprove of certain hulls to sort out the best hulls which ccp could consider implementing into eve the result would be more variation and maybe some really neat shipsi know looks dont change anything in eve but in that case why dont we have capital sized bantams flying around instead of dreads if the animators have time then i believe this could be a way to them working again approvedisapprove
a simple request reallyi would like the ability as an owner of a pi colony to assign another character as an administrator for that colonythe designated character upon accepting the administrator job would have the ability to cycle silos and be able to collect  supply resources to the colony an administrator would not be able to change the layout of a colony or make structural changesthe owners access to the colony overrides the administrator access ie owner looking at the colony locks the administrator out and kicks the administrator out if he was looking firsttheir are 2 reasons for this requesta player might wish to dedicate only 1 char to hisher pi infrastructure and may not wish to lose control or leave it derelict if he goes on a campaign out of control rangea corp might wish to designate a corp administrator for pi and use this facility as a way of coordinating other corp mates to setup a colony and then hand it over to corp via administrator rights to designated membersplease note this is not being proposed as a corp role to be granted but a player privilege to be bestowed on another playerthe pi interface under industry might need to change slightly to show owner and administrator columns for this new ability
supporting myself 
no in that case you could control 18 colonies and 3 coloniesplanet with one account and still only use one character training the pi skills to level 4 takes a week and you could use your main to mark out good deposits for your alts saving even more timeedit with pi skills i mean command center upgrades and the other one which lets you drop more colonies with those at 4 you could have 15 colonies
why is that bad
because youd get the payout of three characters by using one youre in no way limited to using one 1 characteraccount but if you want to get the payout of multiple charsacc then you got to work for them all id say passive income is quite useful when you can get one on a inactive char
so logging in and out three times is your idea of game balance
now that they made a system for adding skillpoints it would be interesting to get a system where you could remove skill points from a skill you dont need fx if your a pvper and have alot of wasted sp in industryat the same time i think there should be a procent of skill points lost in this process anywhere between 2550 would be fairsay you pull away 1mil sp from some industry skills you would only get 500750k to respend on other skillsa cooldown could also be added such as 1 week to a month where you could only take away from 1 skill at a time and during so would add a cooldown before you could add them again
not supported we dont need instant fotm training with sp remapeve is about decisions and consequences you train those skills your decision live with the consequences and you dont know when those skills get useful again
i wholeheartedly endorse this proposal and it is in honesty  exactly what i thought t3 ships would be when ccp said modular
yes
no awful awful ideaeven if ccp fixed fw yeah thats going to happen  this would still be a terribad idea not because of the limitations of complete rookies fresh out of the trial period not because of facwar fcs whom i know nothing about but simply because eve should never force a player new or otherwise down any pathhave an optional faction warfare tutorial path thus granting new players and old players alts a straightin to fw without the tedious standings grind yes i know there are already methods that allow new players and new accounts straight in to fw but not everyone will follow that route this would offer people who want to go down that path the chance to do so while maintaining the freedoms of others to ignore fw as they see fit
not supportedthe freedom to choose your own path is fundamental to eve

sharp knives are good knives for the people who can use them properlyanything which requires an extra click for basic things is an unneccassary burden on user side do you love the submit button of pi hope not if you want to have things idiot safe make confirmation dialog windows optional depending on user configuration settingsi agree with you on that move opposing options apart issue but it doesnt even end at opposing options only eg set waypoint and set destination should be put apart as well in star map rightlick menues as set destination does erase your whole route set so far

the hail ammo for minmatar is broken since 5 years if you check the description of it it should enhance tracking but it reduces it as it is for barrage the long range ammo but for short range maxdamage variant this is completely useless of this reason is has the worst damage output of any ammunition you can feed for autocannons simply this is broken and needs urgently be fixed shouldnt be neither a problem nor a big deal i propose to do fix it asap wonder why nobody ever proposed to fix this please support
hail ammo is insane but its hardly the only t2 ammo with problems hell theres a whole ammo type thats borked and hasnt been touched for a while rocketsanyways given minmatar popularity the fact that they just got a boost and the fact that they are quite good and have many viable options in pvp fixing hail would be pretty far down on my list hybrids and rockets at the very least would come before that
all the t2 short range turret ammos are essentially worthless for similar reasons backbreaking penalties in return for the same damage as easily available empire faction short range ammo
fix hail and void we need adequate t2 ammo more tracking or more damage closerange ammunition should boot tracking if anything not nerf it maybe ccp got the signs wrong
instead of having a special thread for hail maybe just support this thread

in the interest of free enterprise how about toll gates available to cut some travel time but charging a toll based on ship size or total value of ship  cargo they could be run by a npc corp as a service to customers that are willing to pay for the extra safety and less time loss its a realistic use of gate technology and makes sense that someone would do it for profit

mynxees blog post after day 1 of the csm summit paints a slightly less acrominious picturelife in low secit has a group pix of csm5 members too d
ankhs report paints a pretty accurate picture of session discussion csm frustrations etc im very curious to see the draft minutes that ccp writes up i have requested csm review of those minutes to be sure they are accurate and accurately represent csm perspectiveopinionmy day 1 blog post was written when i was still optimistic because you knowglass half full and all that after 3 days of the same ccp song and dance the continued resistance to commit be accountable or open to more integrated communication with csm such as the insider stakeholders have my cap of skepticism is firmly in place blog post later today first day back home in 8 days means rl demands attention firstalso i think my photos on facebook are publicif not friend me and you can see them all summit and iceland
mynx 3ty for the pics
nice workoverview evax
i keep a close eye on the csm since you people represent me just as much as all the other eve playersi look at the forums on a regular basis and what i dont really like is that several csm are posting reports about the csm minutes and alli thought that was what the elected secretary was fori can understand the need to post them to show you are activly involved but i personally would prefer if people do the task they are there for and let others do their tasks so it doesnt get derailed and makes people respond in several threads and thus making it a tad harder to see how and whatso if we can keep the csm minute reports in one post and handled by the elected person this would make all a tad more clear and easier for people to followthank you for your time reading this request
ccp produces the minutes for the summit not the csm secretary unfortunately but this approach is done so that the secretary can participate fully in discussions rather than worry about having to document them the reports of others on csm are more personal opinions and observationssuch as i plan to make in a lengthy blog post later todaywhile ccp was fairly quick about producing csm4 summit minutes there is no guarantee of that happening this time especially because i intend to ask for a review by the csm before those minutes are publishedi took detailed notes as did others and i want the opportunity for us to question missing key points that we feel should be in those minutesfor that reason it seems wise for those of us who were there to document things while they are fresh in our minds rather than wait an undetermined amount of time that could roll into a couple of weeks or longerteadaze or myself can make a thread titled csm5 june 2010 summit reports  minutes that gathers all the relevant links once the minutes are published
you have to admit that would be pretty awesome though
still broken
jump range thats it
yes jump range 50 seem like a good figure more would be too much in my opinion its still a battleshipthe only issues i really have are 1 the missing t2 resists i dont undestand how those could be left out and the bad hp respectively and 2 the fuel use that is just ridiculous lets take a prorator with 11k cargohold as example 5 recons and 10 bombers will deplete all the fuel in about 5 long jumpsreducing the fuel use to a ridiculously low amount would even negate the lacking jump range for me

so very much yes slow the dev cycle to either 9 months with 13 of that time dedicated to features needing fixing or finishing or make each year have two types of expansion the new stuff expansion and the old stuff made awesome expansionadding more depth to pi and maybe removing some of the clickfrenzy for example would keep in the players that the pi expansion might bring here

supported learning skills add nothing to the game and are just a timesink that you need to get over for every new characterplus now that the infrastructure is there to give out sp the free 100k sp they gave everyone for the server move screwup it should be relatively easy to refund the sp used in training learning skills and allow us to spend it on whatever skill we wantthis would be a great move by ccp come on do it and show us that you are not so stubborn as to stand in the face of all reason
supported desperately needed
no not supportedif learning skills are deemed to be removed why not give everyone them and then give the players that have already learnt them some free sp
absolutely supported they are a terrible mechanic people who support them are only looking out for themselves
supportedthe sooner it will be done the better
100 support thiswhen friends start the game it is pretty lame to tell them that oh you have to train these skills firstthey want to be able to fly around a ship asap with you and whatnot  not just sit in station for 2 months
totally support this idea
no one should have to choose between spending a month doing nothing or having a crippled character
this is coming straight from a noob ill make that clear i can respect the veterans and hardcores desires to keep a mechanic that they themselves had to endure in the game and yes it does add another level of tough decision making for the player to consider or in other words added depth to becoming strongerhowever i think everyone can agree that sitting around for a month or staggering learning skills with necessary components to enjoy eve over the course of numerous months just isnt fun from a purely business and logical perspective giving noobs a monthlong timesink and saying do it or suffer not being efficient for the rest of your eve career doesnt make sense honestly i quit eve a few months ago note im back and enjoying myself obviously simply because i was bored being stuck with my noob shipsskills while training up learning skillsi love the rugged individualism and hardcore aspects of eve because it does make everything have that added sense of worth and value but that doesnt compensate for being bored for a whole month and statistically speaking quitting the game sheerly because of that hurdlewhen you think about it removing learning skills is a winwin noobs can focus on having fun and learning skills that they deem worthy spending time on griefers and pvpers will have new fodder to decimate and subsequently drink from the tankard of tears and ccp gets more moneyso just refund the sps everyone has spent on them and let all of the past players rejoice in knowing that they had a bonuslearning curve longer than anyone elsebut like i said im just a noob
no removing learning skills is definitely not a winwin scenario ccp themselves acknowledged the obvious truth that it will anger allot of people ccp said that one day they might pick the option that would anger the least amount of people as far as i am concerned the method that has been suggested that would probably anger the least amount of people would be to give everyone the learning skills and use the new sp allocation system we now have to give a sp renumeration to the players that have already trained them
do you really think veterans of eve would ragequit the game because suddenly the tedious months worth of learning skills are gone and noone has to deal with them anymore somehow i doubt that whereas noobs will and currently are leaving because of them and yes i agree issue a full refund and give everyone the equivalent of what maxed learning skills would give
is this your justification you dont think they will go as far as quit just get up and run around smashing things up but carry on paying their subscription perhaps do presume to think that they would see them as tediousi have never talked to anyone in game that has been discouraged by learning skills in my experience new players stay playing the game because of them
ok yesterday we got 100k sp because of the 1 day downtime and i find the idea of bonus sp quite nicemy idea is that characters that are low in sp compared to the number of monthsyears they have played can purchase back the time they lost off the gameexemple  a character made in mai of 2006 should have aprox 70mil sp but he took a break from the game of 7 months so he has only 53milbut roleplayinggame wise his character was still alive in the game at that time still existing so he could if he wanted pay the equivalent of 7 months of gametime and get back what he lostbut a character could never exceed the max amount set by ccp calculated as a maximum of sp that can be learned since the character was createdso for players that for whatever reason stoped playing could get back the sps they lost  it can be done only once per account to help those who realy need it that way it cant be farmed you can buy back up to 1 year worth of game time maximum so an old character woudnt be a possible monster the number of sp available is based on the average sp per month the character chosen has trained if an old toon just played 2 months the average sp he did in those 2 first months are quite low so even if he decide to buy a year back it wont mean alot of spand i could add a new rule  the process cant be done on a transfered character characters have to be created from scratch in the account to be eligiblewith all these rules and ccp could add even more it will target those who realy need it and with the features already available in eve this is just another one in the same leaguepoje
you want to be reimbursed for the time you spent not paying ccp for their services no
hehe noi want to be able to pay for the time i didnt pay in the past and regain what i lostex  a character made in mai of 2006 should have aprox 70mil sp but he took a break from the game of 7 months so he has only 53milso the guy can pay to have back up to 7 months of lost played time
no your saying you want to buy back the time that you didnt already pay for ccp already made a fix for this its called keep paying then you wouldnt have this problem in the first place  i took a 7 month break and im down a good bit of sp but know what tough luck deal with it you didnt pay then you cant pay now
if people dont play they dont get sp its as simple as that and its good this waynot supported at all
ive said it once and ill say it againabsolutely frakking noif you didnt pay for the game or play it you have no business attempting to turn the damn thing into some sort of wow
some of you dont understand i thinkif someone stoped playing for 6 months but he decide after to pay for those 6 months he didnt pay b4 he could have the equivalent of 6 month of sps addedsince eve is a game that u can learn skills and not play just pay and skill up it would be a logical choice for those who had to stop but now can pay those months they couldnt b4
we all understand just finewhat you dont seem to understand is that you were gone didnt pay for the game and ccp is not going to let you reverse the results of that decision even if you pay equivalent moneywell actually i could see them doing it cause  but its a terrible idea
why is it terrible it doesnt change anything except for the player who had to stop for x reasonif he never stoped playing his character would have the same age and name but he would have the right amount of spthats my point it give a chance to those who had to stop and they didnt want to they can reverse that errorbadluckwhatever
consequences for your actions is a core part of eve if you cant see this maybe you should find another game
more assembly hall nonsense
consequences for your actions is a core part of eve if you cant see this maybe you should find another gamewow and the guy who just stays in a station and pays per month just to learn skills has an impact on eve  loland those who train alts to sell them they have an impact those characters while they are learninggaining sps  lolits just about sps not the sandbox effect or whatever
when ccp announced the sp reimbursement i thought that will open a can of worms and here we arenot supported
i just dont understand you guysit has no direct effect on diplomacyit has no direct effect on economyit just helps those who stopped playing when they didnt want to and want to rectify thatthats it
if they didnt want to stop playing they should have bought more game time trying to compensate people for past screwups on their part is a slippery slope with no bottom
current implementation is absolutely dreadful bring back the folders in the name of sanity please
so you know of a way but its too complicated to explain and your against making that easier
a good idea in the assembly hall this does make a change
you guys really want this to become ice mining dont yall
i definitely support this i have 5 planets extracting and typically near 15 extractors per planet i also have a second account doing the same thing it takes me around 20 minutes per character to reset all my extractorsi could see the ability to go to planet mode and choose to reset all extractors either of a specific type or on the planet as a whole to the same cycle times in one set of clicks my reasoning is that this is supposed to be a passive income and when it takes me either 40 minutes every 5 hours or 40 minutes every 23 hours that is 40 minutes i am not being able to run missions mine asteroids interact with my manufacturing or shoot people in the face assuming i did thati dont want this to be set it and walk away for 3 weeks and it is still running i and my corp mates would like to be able to reset with many many less clicks
i would like a puppy seriously 40 minutes every 23 hours is passive youre not even the norm since you do it on 2 accounts with l0 planets and you think 40 minutes work is too much get a grip on reality mate
i agree with the idea of having a skillset requirement for a player built line of the primae and that it should look a little different and perhaps behave differently having seen the stats of the ship after redeeming mine the primae seems quite fragile if that is to remain the ships nature then i think a bpo seed would be better with the noted difficulty in acquiring lp for ore would it not be likely that ground out bpcs would be sold at too high a price for the ship to see practical use i suppose the lp price could be made cheaper but then why not just use a bpo and let the industry types have their fun with producing themeh well just a thought or two
wtb interbus shuttles
yes just to stop the gankers also a high slot or to would be nice
the recent free ship thank you has a rather attractive and unique model to ensure that ccp gets the most mileage from its introduction i suggest the same model be repurposed for additional skillbased utility shipssome of these ideas were gleaned off of forum discusions and i in no way take credit for themidea 1 salvage shipdespite the utility of salvagecanes and salvage catalysts there is a distinct lack of dedicated salvage shipsskillbased ability bonus to salvager  tractor beam length andor reduction in capacitor usagefitting large number of high slots decent speed and cargoidea 2 gasharvesting shipgas harvesting ships see widespread use in wspace nullsec and even in certain regions of empire space because there are no specialized gasharvesting ships most people tend to just repurpose cruisers and battlecruisers for the taskskillbased ability bonus to gas harvesting yield andor reduction in gas harvester fitting requirementsfittings enough high slots and cpu to carry 5 tech 2 gas harvestersidea 3 better primaea tech two version of this ship would have further reductions in sig radius further increases in plating and tank potential as well as a skillbased increase in planetary commodity holds
lets be honest hereyes thanks for the new shipa useless shipit has no bonuses its got too small of an overall cargo hold layout for the extreme pi hell my industrial ship would do better at least i could fit a cloak on it and do what i need to do for crying out loudseriously this ship screams in need of a major workover
yes ccp please make the primae better honstaly id say just make 3 variations 1 for each of these ideas the primae is to awsome looking to be a non replaceable ship
needs more cargo space max 1k yeah right not even close for pi
darn you beat me to the first primae boost thread i agree the ship is useless beyond being a newbie industrial i also think that a ship this pretty should not only be useful for newbies with low sp i think ccp missed a great opportunity with this shipmy proposalthis ship should have been similar to t3 cruisers obviously not t3 but have similar user reconfiguration through the use of subsystems ccp could have given everyone the suggested rank 5 skill ore industrial to redeem and train now the good bit the subsystemsi dont think that the ships appearance should change just the ships fitting and abilities also only 3 subsystems instead of 5 to force specialisation in certain fieldssubsystem suggestions ill post some later when i figure out realistic stats but that doesnt stop everyone else posting their subsystem ideasall these items and the ship it self should be seeded in the ore lp store as items and bpcs however i would also suggest that they are able to be sold on the market not just contracts
supported on both counts having a free hanger ornament is nice but salvaging all that dev time used in creating that amazing model into something the playerbase has been asking for would be superawesome
thathangar queen is gooda usefull ship that looks cool is even better
salvager and gas cloud harvester dont need a turret hardpoint of which the primae has none so that should definitely be doablenot sure on the last part t2 industrials are already perfect for pi in dangerous areas maybe a deployed mode where the primae acts as a customs office it already looks like a baby rorqual
every single one of these free ships makes me end up feeling sad not that im ungrateful for the free gift but each one could have been so much moremaking any of these into a real ship would be a much more fantastic gift to a players b the artists that designed itedit clicking support button this time
i like the idea of it being a good salvaging ship i think a ship that is dedicated for the role of salvaging is something eve would like to see good bonuses would be a role bonus increased tractor beam range and speed and also a salvager bonus based on skill level obviously i dont even think a large number of hislots is necessary four should do the trick bring two wrecks over and salvage them with the bonuses should still go faster than with a destroyer or salvage hurricane mid slots one would be enough propulsion modmaybe 3 low slots for cargo expanders or warp core stabsi love the ship model the best gift ship ever although in its current form i wont ever bring it outside of stationthe reason i would like to see it as a salvaging ship and not any of the other ideas is the ship kind of reminds me of the serenity from firefly tv show the scene i think of off the top of my head is the crew outside opening that wreck up for some goodies then getting nearly caught by the alliance edited for firefly comments
absolutely support on all counts especially one and three i dont know enough about gas harvesting for two but its probably a good ideapersonally id like a gas ship to use a modified model that looks more like a tanker though
modular design through the use of subsystems is the way forward
supported
the sure shot way to stop all bot players is to eliminate said option from the client since macroers are the only ones who have reason to use it a reason may i remind is against eulaalso to prevent a counter on this make to where the game closes if you access your desktopand have a built in function the automatically flags accounts active for a average period of time that is super human you mean to tell me you cant tell if someone is botting if they are active for 23 hours a day and log on at 1200 utc everyday on the dot
you really didnt think this through did younot supported without windowed mode i cant easily flip between my 2 running clients which arent macro and this wonderful forum
1 macros dont care if you are in windowed mode or not2 a lot of regular players play in windowed mode 3 removing the option to access desktop will make impossible to access ventteamspeak after entering the game and plenty of other useful tools4 removing the option to access desktop will make impossible to run 2 account at the same time something that plenty of players do that will give them reason to cancel the secondary accounts thus hurting ccpso your idea will cure nothing and damage ccp
alttab i play with 2 clients in fullscreen
210 too obvious
pretty muchobvious troll is stupid
even my 73 year old mother knows how to alttab between applications this really is a terrible idea the only reason to read posts in the assembly hall is to have a good laugh at them
lol awesome idea 110
yes
yup wreck should belong to the killer not the victim
not supported unless the original person wrecked is immune a problem is that suppose the guy who gets ganked wants to get his stuff back hes flagged for stealing from his own wreck since he doesnt own it while he may be wardecced he may also be in a 1v1 or lost his ship from a pirate
the current issue is that the original t2 bpos are essentially invention in god mode over the years the imbalance will only continue to become more profound supplying enough isk should never grant god mode the thing that makes t2 bpos a god mode scenario is that invention never progresses into an equal form i suggest we change thatkeep t2 bpos as isadding a new category the character sheet industrial expertise it is extremely irritating now that no matter how many times you invent something over several years you never get better at it if instead of continuing down this unbalanced path we made it so that every time you get a successful invention run you get a point in your industrial expertise category for what ever you have invented once you have gotten a shipammomodule up to 100 you and your character alone could build a t2 variation off of the applicable t1 blueprintpicturepicture with arrowsthe exact number of successful invention runs needs to be thought over by several qualified people however i think the images roughly illustrate the system
if we would follow your suggestions people will come up with if i shoot lots of rats i should get better gunnery skills or if i mine a lot i should get more yield i dont think opening that can of worms is worth itit would make more sense that input mepe would influence output mepebut then again  i dont see it was such a big issuenot support nonethelessdisclaimer i dont own any t2 bpos but i make a nice cut each month with invention
1 ive always been against the removal of t2 bpos this seems like a nice middle of the road approach that keeps t2 bpos with utility while not unfairly penalizing a mature inventorliang
if the forums had rep i would rep you for your photoshop abilities
pretty cool idea for a game that eve isnt one of the great things about eve is the lack of grinding and this would destroy thatnot to mention ruining t2 bpo values far worse than the make them a big bpc proposal would nifty but i cant support it
i like it fair to both sides down with god mode

this would rock but it would require more of the shortcut mapping system than we have today getting this working could open the possibilities for other great shortcut functionalities
this one was for ages now at least every month someone comes up with this genius idea d  and supported again
supported 
one tool that i would believe to be rather useful would be an in game timer in mining a timer could be set to count down the length of time it would take to fill your cargo hold so that you dont waste time or resources timers could also be of use to set any kind of reminder you happen to need like say check on your pi or pos runs all in all something that should be simple to implement and yet still rather useful
accesories  timer approved
not supported because ankhesentwhozawhatzis is simply taking other peoples ui threads and making it hers or also the fact that the moment the eve ui becomes anything like wow i will personally firebomb the server that stores my account info
confirming that it has been a while since ccp was painfully reminded that the eve client ui looks feels and acts like fvwm2 and emacs in linux distro from the middle of the ninetiesno wait i take that back and apolozige to fvwm2 diehards it is better than eve
supported but against mods there were like tons of ui fixes proposed up until now and what is interesting enough is that most of the players agreed to the most of those posts i think we should look at this topic as a call for ccp to finally get a glance at those excising proposals and start implementing rather then recreating iu as a whole i dont hate eve ui in fact i think that with the right tweaks it would be as good as newi hope you did understand what i meant 
hershel is absolutely right if you whant to make skills more intensive and harde to train do that rater then forcing people to do relogs
supportedwhy should other industry activities such as moon mining differ from pi you can launch a pos for a corp so why not establish a colony for the corp as well the idea coule be expanded to include a corp hangar in the customs office when exporting materials from a planet you could launch for corp which puts the minerals into the corp hangar or launch for self which sends them to your personal hangar if launcher for corp then the corp can pay the export tax slight thread hijack but you can see how the idea fits in with an already established corp structure
not supported only because this pi stuff is really about having a independent revenue stream for what other active tasks miningrattingetc if we allow for quick management for multiaccount holders this will just become supplemental income for the multiboxing miners and anyone doing it with just one account will get squat as far as income from it much like how mining gives squat unless you multibox 4 hulks yes look at the corp tag this is coming from a miner
first off id like to congratulate ccps art department the primae is a very very pretty shiphowever i do feel that it is a complete waste of time and resources to produce such an asset that is essentially hanger  never to be used in anger due to the fact that it is irriplaceble and for all intents and purposes useless beyond being a newbie industriali think ccp has missed an exceptional opportunity to deliver something that many many players have been begging forthe primae should of been a ship of great industrial flexibility like the t3 cruisers are through the use of subsystems to specialise its roleso my proposal would be a redesign of the primae to allow for the use of subsytems to specialise the ship these subsystems wouldnt make the primae the be all and end all industrial but it would allow it to slot into several roles that currently lack a dedicated shipthe primae would require a new skill to pilot ore industrial i think a rank 5 skill would suficethe proposal would also require the primae and the subsystems to become availible on the market or contracts i think the ore lp store maybe the best place to seed bpc of the ship and subsystems to be manufacturedso what subsystems would be availibleindustrial subsystemsthe primary subsystem which will offer bonuses to the selected rolethen the navigation electronics defensive and engineering subsystems 5 types in allthree of each type will be available subsystemsindustrial subsystemsplanetary operations subsystem command centre bay 1600m3 planetary commodities bay 5000m3 1000m3 per level ore industrial yes this is an initial boost to current ship but it is required cargo bay 50m3 a slight nerf to cargo capacity but this is specialisationasset recovery subsystem 8 high slots no weapon hardpoints cargo bay 1500m3 20 bonus to tractor beam range and speed per lvl ore industrialgas harvesting operations subsystem 3 hi slots and turret hardpoints required for gas harvesters 20 to gas havester yeild per lvl offers the rate of 6 havesters at lvl 5 skills role bonus 85 reduction in cpu requirement of gas harvesters gas bay 1500m3  300m3 per lvl cargo bay 50m3continued

ok that is the best idea ive heard for the primae yet ccp please do this before july 1st so its in the next patch the primae should have already had this
t3 industrial ship
brilliant although some numbers do of course need minor changes you have a possible combination that gives you 9 low slots oops 
i only count a maximum of 5 low slots although i didnt mention that this would be based zero slot base hull
honestly the best suggestion for the use of the primae model however it sounds extremely pricey
player driven market means supply and demand will dictate the cost obviously more sort after subsystems will be more expensive but also the materials required and lp to buy the bpcs or the items themselves will also dictate pricehow i would fit a salvagerprimae hull withasset recovery subsystemthruster efficiency subsystemadvanced evasive manuevaring thrusters subsytemaugmented scanners subsystemcapacitor efficiency relays subsystemgives me lvl 5 skills ship stats8 hi slots 4 salvager is and 4 small tractor beam is1 mid slots 10mn ab ii1 low slots expanded cargohold iiship statsfittingcpu  1875 available 185 usedpg  21875 available 87 usedcargo  19125m3 capacitywith 40km tractor beams and bonused salvagersquestion is how much would this be worth what would you be willing to pay for it

load balancing hasnt just affected high sec and low sec before tyrannis i could run level 4 nullsec agents and id get maybe 7080 missions in the same system now i think 1 mission in 20 has been in the same system there seems to be an aversion to having missions in the same system regardless of the absolute population of a system  if the neighbouring systems are quieter and its the difference between 2 people in system most of the time and 1 person next door then youre getting sent there regardless
yes plox
supported it would be so nice to get rid of those useless industry and missile skills and put them towards something useful
no
man this thread is so original
absolutely frakking no
its under the same concept as the attribute remap with limitations so you cant just move skillpoints and instantly get lvl 5s in all the skills you want at the same time i would say actually losing overall skill points would be even trade for focusing in on something you really neednow thats said what kind of limitations would you want before you think its a reasonable idea ps my own interrest in this is that i have a 70mil sp char with about 5mil sp in industry mining reprocesing researhing converting even those 5mil sp into say 23mil sp to be used in other skills seems like a fair tradeps i support my own thread
people like you are why we cant have nice things ccp give us a small apology gift for an unexpected dt and you want a thousand times more
no if you want a to be coddled and handheld in a cuddly forgiving environment i am sure wow runescape or hello kitty online would be far more accommodating to your tastes and desiresi have a few mil skill points wasted in various areas but i adapt and live with it and not be a glutton and demand more from ccp who have been generous enoughtldr not supporting da dead horse
its funny how people think i want a easier game it has nothing to do with thattry and think what conditions would you want if in your imagination they did add a feature where you could reallocate the skill points what limitations what down sides instead of assuming it will break the game think about what it would need to not break it but improve it
sp lost in the process will have to be higher you remap maxes out certain attributes train sp there at a fast rate then move the sp to other areas
not supported you cant hit yourself over a frying pan forget how to build toys with legos and instantly learn how to fly a abaddon
jesus no christ no
1 dump all attribute points to two attributes and train these learnings to max2 train skill3 reallocate4 5 go back to wow
no but seriously this is a very very bad idea
no a truly horrible ideadid you try this idea in the appropriate forum before posting here
dump alot of rank 1 skills into learning skills max them and retrain the rank 1 skills you dumped wait for next reallocation and repeat
thread
agree id like to get rid of my wasted mining skills
get ride of learning yes but whole sale reallocation is stupid
you do realize that they stated in the dt thread that they were planning on putting a sp allocation tool into the client right
there are no words strong enough to express how much i dislike this idea they simply do not exist fing hell no you ignorant moron doesnt even begin to assuage my overwhelming anger at seeing what is by far the most ridiculous proposal to ever decorate this forum compared to this emo tjs threads seem well considered and worthy of supportin short no i wont bother explaining why because if you could understand the reasons you wouldnt have posted it in the first place
they have already done so hence why you were able to allocate those 100k sp you got yesterday itll probably get used for gm reimbursement as well
a friend who just joined the game recently pointed this out to me i thought this was already taken care of but apparently these sites are still static and are camped constantlyexploration is a very fun part of eve but a bit lame when the sites intended for younger players are farmed to hell and backso remove these sites from the static system and make them cosmic signatures in 810 space
not supportedstatic 110 and 210 plexes in lowsec generate some of the most fun small ship pvp in game they can easily be run in pvp ships and the loot is enough for people to fight over
not supportedthe races are the way they are for a reason dont go fiddling with that if you dont like the way they are then train for another
it goes against what ccp might want out of their game but this would add a new dynamic to the game and would liven things up alot it would get alot more people into t3 cruisers who otherwise might not
i was playing about with t3 yesterday and looking over all of the subsystems i arrived at much the same conclusiont3 needs to break the mould of amarr nuets mimatar webs and even gun typesyou have to train up many more skills to have access to the other races anyway its not as if you are getting stuff for free here theres a heavy downpayment involved the payoff is weak when your strategy can be guessed so easily
its not a problem with one races ships its a problem that they said omg over 9000 combinations but in reality no one in their right mind would fit anything aside from the 6 or 7 proven setups per racein theory yes you can fit 47838232238 different ways but the modules are made in such a way where basically there are only a handful of acceptable setupsallowing for outofrace modulation would bring true variety to tech 3 fits and maybe even allow for the lesser used modules from one race to be paired with the lesser used modules from another to combine into something more than a joke fit
there are usefull rigs like the cc which gives 15 more capacitor with no penalty there are less usefull rigs that give you 30 resist bonus to a single paramiter with a rather large penalty i suggest tiher buffing those rigs or reducingremoving penalty for weapon and resist rigs there are utteraly useless rigs like warp core optimiser that slightly reduces the amount of capneeded for warp i believe that some rigs are unbalanced and need to be loocked at
no support i was intrigued by the concept but forcing new players into fw is bad news however having a set of faction warfare tutorial agents at the hubs who make clear in their dialogue what being in fw means half of empire will send police on you moving through lowsec etc and then upon final mission completion prompt the player to enroll in fw that would be great im in fw would love to see more well informed new players give fw a try  id love to see more players of all stripes in fw but this proposal would just railroad often unwitting players into ganks i wonder if the op is a noob system can baiter looking for expanded opportunities  
disclaimer ideas presented in here are not sensible or original ideas indepth coverage of the idea can be found here
fonts bigger i hope this is optional and not like a few things they changed with tyrannisi have a 1680x1050 screen as well i love the small font size but i can understand people who want bigger fontsstill hasnt the issue always been the bad font type like b and 8 0 and o s and 5 g and 6 and so on this is something that seriously needs fixing but something tells me some guy at ccp will have the awesome idea to just change all fonts to verdana with font size 12 if its optional cool i just dont want to have my overview over 50 of my screen the chat windows taking up the other half
btw excellent retrospective of the summit mynxee
thanks for that second article it confirms many of the predictions made before this comparison between two tennis players would indicate the csm and ccp are on some sort of equal level which of course they are not you dont have a racket a ball or are even present on the field the csm would be a linesman who calls out a foul time and time again only to be ignored by the umpire and players
if the csm calls enough fouls hopefully one of the players will eventually yell something along the lines of why dont you do it yourself then and then the csmees will cackle madly and renenact that scene from kung fu hustle where a short guy turns out to be a tall guy sitting on a stool
and then everyone will continue to do whatever they did immediately before that
thank you for that i was a little boggled by the last one
bandwagons full please catch another
ccp told us for the last 3 years that incarna was basically a side benefit of wod now theyre saying they cant fix gamebreaking bugs because of all the dev resources theyre pouring into it what changedwell those resources have been spent now but incarna had better be ing epic if theyve spent 3 years creating an avatar creator and spacebars while important  goes unfixed there will be hell to pay
well im not thrilled that they seem more interested in working on pi than fwbut at least they seemed somewhat committed to making fw plexes spawn more often throughout the day this is something at least a little bit bigger than just a bug fix was anything said about the fact that very few people in fw do what is supposed to be the main focus of fw  plex for occupancy did you or anyone get a sense of other specific low fruit they may pick off of the backlog when it comes to fw im interested in all things fw what did you guys present to them on fw and what sense did you get about what they thought
 jareck hunter  read his commentsin the csm public channel
this whole sok v ank drama would make a great icarly episode but can those 12 year old girls obsessed with this junior high drama please post the details in a seperate thread ank didnt mention it in her original post at least what i read of it so why must every thread regarding the csm be shat on ffs
she tactfully forgets to mention that after she stuttered her way through her fw warfare it was sok and vuk that saved her ass by summarizing the key points to ccp personnel present that said until the minutes are out there is no way to verify anyones contributions
christ its all getting a bit petty now
i rather enjoyed reading mynxees last update csm june 2010 summit retrospective a well written very professional piece  that it could almost be mistaken as an office correspondence for a multinational im impressed at amount of thought put into due process notwithstanding the observations noted on ccp internal workingswhat i found revealing if its true as per your update is ccp trying to design a csm tool when they dont know heads or tails on the internal csm workings that really strikes a chordyoull definitely get my votes if you decide to extend your csm tenure
why are you complimenting someone on a job well done when there are perfectly good drama grenades to be flung into the middle of the room im not sure you actually understand how jita park is supposed to work
in that case please ignore my previous postfeed those two the lions please if they continue the tantrums
good post ankh and glad to see it confirmed by mynxeecouple thoughtspoints of note this is craziness its literally exactly what you complained about used to justify itself come on now im glad to see that csm took a united front against this but hopefully it goes somewhere after that getting defensive seriously you should expect some criticism when csm comes knockin on your door buck up htfu dont get defensiveawesome very glad to hear it its fun right now but there is definite honing potential again youve got to be kidding me nathan is starting to sound very unreasonable and in fact the very cause for players to feel the csm has no worth sigh holy friggin crap no ish sherlock sorry guys but points at his own campaign really im extremely shocked that ccp would be so utterly brash as to respond this way theyre only giving fuel to the fire of the naysayers and are completely ignoring the calls for help of the players has anyone mentioned to them that by fixing these things things that so many have left this game for they will actually regain old subs theres so much emphasis on new subs new subs that theyre forgetting bring back old subs do not be so short sighted ccp good summary again i look forward to full minutes good job to the csm members that stepped up and fought hardrant
i dont think theyd started on anything it wasnt discussed but ccp does seem to enjoy springing surprise gifts on its players my instant thought was that i could see them thinking it would be really cool to offer tools to a suretobegrateful csm as a surprise for the next summit dont get me wrong we need some toolsdealing with proposals alone is a grind and a half and their hearts are in the right placebut in the moment i had this vision of the outoftouch uncle who shows up beaming and bearing gifts for a distant niece only to be confused and hurt at the look of pure disdain from a tattooed chainsmoking teenager in response to his offerings of frilly pink dresses because she was not at all the child he thought she was best to nip that possibility in the bud early and do what we can to ensure any effort expended would be aimed at producing something wed actually find usefulalso thanks for the promised support and your kind words about my post i do work for a multinational companyguess my writing style just autotransfers to csm efforts
good writeup while i disagree very strongly with essentially all of your ideas about the game im not at all sure that that matters for the purposes of the current csm there is a huge backlog of issues from the last csms very few of which have been implemented  for that matter we dont even know whether ccp have done anything at all with most of them the first and perhaps only objective of this csm has to be to try and push a change of culture and focus on ccp to persuade them to reengage with the playerbase to be more open about their plans and to prioritise the fixing of the old and busted over the halfassed implementation of the new hotness and on that you and the rest of the csm seem to speak as one
lag specific response i like this idea but i would like to seriously suggest a reverse thought process allow the newly loaded node to keep the large fleet but transfer the other less busy systems not within a 35 jump radius to adjacent less bus
so csm5 is now seen as nothing more than laying the groundwork for csm6 as csm1 laid the groundwork for csm2 which laid the groundwork for csm3  until csm6 lays the groundwork for csm7 ad infinitum at least until ccp pulls the pluginsanity is doing the same thing over and over again but expecting different resultsanyone who thinks the csm will ever accomplish anything meaningful is truly bat insane
bandwagons full please catch another
if you remember skynet ai that achieved sentience in terminator id say the da human thought it was bat impossible too and think its all a joke things can take a life of its own given enough weightim on the glass halffull side what the current csm imo should also focus on is to campaign themselves not only for issues often talked by the players but also to proactively look at themselves and ask how can they be more accessible to the players  with the same eyes that they used looking at ccp let me give a few examples to get a discussion rolling the ah is troll haven and they dont have a onestop eve survival page
