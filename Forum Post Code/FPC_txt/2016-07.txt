eve is constantly changing and players need to move around with their fited ships because they want  or maybe they were forced or its their way to play the game to fill that lack we need a ship to move around our fited ships we are using capitals for that but the ideal would be something like a bowhead with jump capability maybe a tech 2 version of it  or a new ship  some simple ideas about it  make it use much more fuel than a jump freighter be expensive to move but less then repackage a full cargo of ships  jump range between a jump freighter and a capital  very low cargo hold space  same price range of a jump freighter  maintenance bay space between a bowhead and capital  military type skin  or skins not yellow
noyou obviously havent considered the issue of power projectionso no
if it could only portal industrial ships it would make it perfect so its not abused by oh so many combat fleets
so you mean a giant storage ship with a jump portal generator  ithink this is a superb idea and with some refinement could be benificial to loads of roaming groups out t
yeah that is basically my idea
i dont think it would need to have this limitation you just need to set it at a price point that makes it balance out also activating the portal should give you a 1 min weapons timer to prevent redocking etc
when i said faction i meant serpenteis angel etc it would fill in some plot holes for a start  like how do these guys get there ships  they hardly buy all there supers off others not logical they have to have a secret mining wing out there somewhere no my suggestion would be another t3 miner like a step up again from the exhumers would be a startso an example is the t3 serpentis exhumer the minerno tank bonus to ore mined and imune to bubblesor something special to make them stand out from the crowd
and the mining lasers could also use antimatter lensessma could field fleets of themunstopableunlimited power
yes  you right about that but the move of ships is already being done but with other ships carriers and now dreadnoughts and i think big alliances already have that power isnt possible to get a balance to avoid being used very often but only when really needed  im not talking about a ship that can carry a bs fleet everyday during a week with the same pilot maybe give a high jump fatigue a ship that would be better to move fitted ships for someone who doesnt want to train capitals with all required gunnery or drone skills for someone who doesnt want to train for a capital just to move ships but likes to move to different regions from time to time without needing to repackage every time his ships there are a lot of different playersfor sure there are also nomads in eveim asking opinions and if possible how could it be done
i really like the idea of a ship that cannot be easily used to empower military fleets but rather encourages new opportunities to farroaming moreorlessindustrial fleets while still offering great rewards to those highwaymen succeeding to track one downif indeed the ship is limited to transporting industrial vessels it could aswell be granted some special abilities around cyno  bridge  wormhole interaction without making that an overly oppressive mechanic
allowing a rorqual to use a jump portal generator to jump industrial ships would be cool
were you informed early about the reward structure of the new events what were your feedback is it an experiment to see how much autist players are willing to go or actual serious
as a ganker myself i do tend to partially agree with the op while we are being hammered by ccp in every way ganking gets harder over time and we find new ways but i personally dont do it for tears of new players but there are a lot who do it simply to harrass new unsuspecting players so saying that ganking benefits the market in anyway is just plain bs ganking is a form of harrassment and it is there for ragers to blow steam that is all no market and no benefit to eve whatsoeverhere are a few thoughtsi dont agree with empire space 100 safe i do agree that it needs to be a lot harder than what it is right now ships that are capable to suicide gank should be nerfed and brought in line making it a lot expensie reduce concord response time to be a lot quicker than it is 10 seconds in 05 sec space and about 35 seconds in 10 giving gankers less than 10 seconds to gank this would require a lot more ships to gank making it harder and more challenging and more fun to gankconcord needs to deal simultaenous damage to all gankers at the same time including drones
wait what it is already impossible to solo gank most ships under the current times why should solo and afk miners require a huge group of players to kill it is already unprofitable and if you make it so that it also requires massive groups it will just not happen any gankers that can form groups will just go after profitable ships like freighters like they already do if you half the concord response time you will just raise the minimum value worth ganking from 5b or so to 10b how is that more engaging or better for anyone it just makes players more complacent before they cross some unseen profitability line and lose 15b worth of stuff in 10s the usual case that is made is that concord response time should be slower with a corresponding buff to ehp or whatever so fights last longer so that there is more time for player actions to determine the outcome of a fight if you made it so short there would be no time for anyone to react which would just reinforce the feelings of helplessness personally i think longterm ccp should look to replacerework concord with something else a system where players can easily defend themselves but actually have to do something to fight back maybe something like the upcoming rorqual forcefield which all players can highsec get to give time for them to call for reinforcements sure at the end of it concord can still vapourize the aggressors ships but at least something that provides a more interesting and playerdriven mechanic than an npcenforced dps race to explode ships in highsec new players have to learn that eve is a pvp game sooner rather than later  shooting them is not harassment bubblewrapping them from the real game isnt going to do anything other than give veteran players a way to grind in safety and wreck the playerdriven economy these players will be more likely to leave when they suffer their first loss if it happens later and costs them much more than if some miscreant pops their venture at day 30 in the game
im a relatively new and i think that ganking is a problem but imho not the worst one1 make the career agents mandatory you can opt out but with a strict warning2 fix the fitting tool fitting a ship is a mystery to new players and because you cant play around with it there is almost no way to really learn how to except to find some outside web sites give them some fittings with reasons why this ship was fitted this way3 bring evelopedia back if just one game need a manual its eve4 make it possible optional to trade from and to a ships cargohold when you are collecting modules for your ship its frustrating to forget them in station5 give a warning if some trade gets you into lownull
the same patch should also include the ability to sell the drugs to concord so i dont need to risk interaction with other players when i am selling the product

no this would not be desirable it is an important industry advantages that lower security spaces possess over highsec
i agree with zappity on thisand its covered in the forum post about the change the only corp with a license to do it iirc is xsense
i would suggest making the same or similar post in the assembly hall the current csm members all have their own primary constituencies but we do care about all facets of eve i promise you will be heard if you post in the right section of the forums
thread has been moved to assembly hall
i suggest a slightly different approachimprove level of interaction that is possible with unpiloted ships if all of the following options are made easily accessible and reliable your problem is solved while making some boring stuff interesting and equally opening and closing windows of opportunity for thirdparty interference so you want to throw out a ship out of that npc station unpiloted go ahead your ship so you want see an estimate of when a ship floating in space was last piloted your ship scanners are awesome so you want to force this unpiloted ship through your jump bridge allright no pilot  no control overrides so you want to want to setup cloak and self destruct before evacuating so in case you dont make it back nobody can have it sure you are still the captain so you want to bump this unpiloted ship into your favourite wormhole now this is podracing this looks like a nice ship i will take it oh i found some insurance contract informations lyring around here i wonder how they could be used for profit this is a huuge contract package you got floating there i wonder what happens to your collateral if i damage the foil
im not sure i see the issue with the current system want to move fitted ships use a capital supercapital or bowheadsince the deployment of jump fatigue i have even promoted the use of bowheads being bridged through a titan to move masses of fitted ships quickly to a deployment zone i understand that isnt viable for every person corporation or alliance but it does exist and people with access to use itmoving away from the moving of fitted ships the ability to use the bulk fitting tool mitigates a lot of the issues i see alliances run into for deployments which is from my view point the largest use for something like a bowhead or jump freighter moving ships quickly you can fit the same amount of ships in seconds that used to take hours sometimes if you need to move quickly you might need to accept losing your rigs and repackaging to be able to use a jump freightergiving people effectively a bowhead with a jump drive is definitely something i personally would call bad for the game i for one would champion against such a ship not for it
hello teamdue to this thread and based on the support ticket advice by gm bianca i decided to propose here the idea of corp hangars in citadelsconsidering the outcome of pos gameplay in nearest future corporations lose one of the most interesting feature the tadition of common economics and corporation solidarity these features are provided by only the nature of pos hangars for a long time pos gameplay allowed corps to solve problems together as to hold the responsibility togetherthe weakness of corp hangars just like the opportunity to cooperate to put to take out stuff  are the beautiful part of pos gameplayso this tradition could be continued in citadels by giving them the feature like corporative hangari have the petition involving eight capsuleers the petition capsuleers of forbidden dockyards corporation are signing the petition in order toask the ccp developer team to add the functionality of corporate hangar or the same functionality to citadelsin cause of removing poses from the game moreover by adding citadels  there are no functionality in citadels like pos corporation hangarsplease add it to the gamepetition signers 8 personskris galeon roman krylov vvv hamu shurik xan dmitru savrasov otherworldiy damilaska ichinumi eva pride end of petition sal askiras in linked thread proposed the extended abilities of new hangars gameplay by adding access list i would not comment this issue but it could also beplease take this into consideration not much developing but a lot of gameplaybest regards kris galeon

i seldom respond to topics but i felt a strong need to respondwhy is it the casuals and carebears always complain come in and complain and change gamesseveral mmos have gone from very good to wastelands due to politically correct carebears and casuals first if you dont want to be here dont2nd this is a pvp game with pve elementsthird and finally if you take most of the hi sec risk out and hold hands and make it a 30 day investment to fly titans the hard core old timers will all prob quitthis is a game of time skill and spreadsheetsnot a game of instant leveling and hand holdingi for one am sick of the casual carebear crowd ruining every game ever in existence just to socialize you wanna socialize go play my little pony onlinealso i can see this being removed by the politically correct because i may offend someonewell im sorry but it had to be saidthis is a good game and its only that a game
umm corp hangars exist in citadels you just need to rent an office just like in a station
k thanx so strange that gm bianca did not adviced thisby the way it was not obvious possibilityclose this topic the problem is solved
it sure is schrUFFFDdingers missile i dig it  makari aeron
kal you arent hurting anyones feelings or offending anyone so stop with the appologiescarebears and casuals are already leaving the game in record numbers along with some vets that dont really agree with the changes or have real life things to take care ofthe carebears and casuals that do stay hang out in npc corps nothing wrong with it everyone enjoys the game how they choose to enjoy itthe games you are talking about that have gone to waste lands are im just asking because i did play uo for 3 years still play on a shard from time to time with friends eq for 4 years ffxi for 7 years ffxiv for 4 years guild wars for 3 years talk about a pvp oriented mmo lineage ii for a couple years lots of other mmos out there but usually they died because the devs couldnt keep up with the hardcore players and provide them with enough content this is the problem with a game has dev driven content and not player driven contentthe spreadsheets alone usually drive off players ive tried to get a few friends to play over the course of many years ive played some of them just couldnt get past the learning curve others did and went off to do other bigger and better things in the game only to quit when a change came out that they didnt likea game is only as good as its player base if the player base is obsessed with harassment of other players most players will leave a game because it isnt fun to them those that are doing the harassment have fun until they get harassed themselves or run out of people who are easily harassedthis this after all a sandbox and players consent to pvp by simply undocking from a station there are many things that are broken or missing in this game some players want it to remain as is because they are getting enjoyment out of it others who arent participating much in it see the problem but dont feel a need to make changes to it because it doesnt effect them the last group is the group that feels they are getting harassed by the first grouphonestly im glad there is a war dec system in the game i just believe it needs to have more added to it and needs to be modified to create more dynamic content currently right now all the war system has is pew pew why not add in economic war fare toss in the ability to charge a tariff on a target or give the ability to pay off a faction to not allow a war target to dock at their stations or why not give the ability for a corp to pay off a faction and not allow a war target to jump through a gate lots of possibilities that havent really been realized that could provide so much content and so much conflict it would allow some of these big indy corps that have no experience with pew pew to fight back it would allow rich corps to smash competition in an area you could end station games create ways to blockade high sec systems from a select group thousands of possibilitiesthe more content you have and the greater the interaction with players new players have the better your or anyone else gaming experience will be
you do realise that theres other parts of space as well in this sandbox you are not segregated into highsec go out low null wh and the problems simply go away
a specious argument to a far more complex problem than many care to admitccp continuous efforts to improve the game are failing to attract and hold new players in numbers that outweigh those that no longer play the game which as an aside is of greater concern than a constant stream of so called carebear tears i really hate that term tbh as it degrades the contribution that that facet of the player base actually contribute to the games health overall but why do they feel that way in the first placethis is were the crux of the problem is in the opinion of many expectation when i joined eve in its original beta form the game was attractive to me because of its complexity the famous vertical learning curve cartoon still makes me chuckle because it really did epitomise the game as it was then meaning you really did have to spend the time and effort learning how it worked even getting out of the station was not obvious to many and simply moving around the place unless you were very astute meant that you required the help and advice of others and your experience there often set the mould for your future in the short term in evecareer prospects in the game came next on the list i can move around but what do i do with this new found knowledge and it was very simple to trip onto the easy track and start mining it gave you isk built your bank account and gave you time to sort out eve at that time in the three years i did it i never got ganked once in lonetrek even when i moved to mission running the same rules applied i used what i had taken the time to learn and avoided getting into problems 5 plus billion later i moved into null sec and never returned to empire with that toon againthe thing is that it took time not only to learn the mechanics of eve but to build the confidence and experience to use those to your best advantage since then ccp has made it plain they want to reduce this workload and tbh it has not been in the best interest of players that well meaning helping hand from the devs has meant that players do not have the time to gain that experience learn how to play the game and worst of all not had the time to fully understand that eve is not a nice place even if you do follow the rules it can at times bite you just when you thought things were going welli dont have an answer the ganking issue if there really is such a thing in the game but i do know this much what ever course ccp are currently on the player base is having a problem with it admit it or not overall there is less reason to join eve and stay and of far more concern is it is far to easy for players to find they have nothing invested in the game and leave than it used to be in times past
you can do that already with every jump capable ship except jump freighter and rorqual to some extent

i know ccp wants to work on removing the in game browser but this is going to make life difficult for those of us who rely on tools such as siggy and tripwire i know ccp wants to push crest forward but i was thinking of an ideawhat about just setting up a shell and integrating the most recent version of the chrome browser in game be it the mobile or desktop version it would fix ccps issues with updating the browsers as that would be handled by the chrome team and chrome wont change their apis and backends to break it in game so it should be a lot easier to update it as neededwhat also works is that it makes devs that need to use out of game tools have an easier time as they can interact with the chrome apis which siggy works perfectly well on out of gamemaybe this is a good middle ground solution for the in game browser removal
more choices
you are very correct there is a problem with gankinggriefing that leaves no recourse to solosmall corps i have been to nullwhlowsec and died there that is to be expected and i enjoy that aspect of the game but due to recent experiences with a single character in high sec that left me with no options over and over i have gathered the individual did it for the lols as many i guess who play solosmall corp i do not have the time to invest in a large corp thats how i enjoy the game solo and small corp but due to griefing i can not enjoy playing the game the way i want to due to another player i have lost more ships than i care to count in whs and low sec that is the riskreward that makes eve fun not getting ganked data mining in high sec for lols ganked just for being in system butthurtmaybe buts i refuse to cower in station waiting to do pi until the douchebag leaves so i chose not to play i will take my money else where since it is becoming a larger issue than ccp cares to admit i too have added my name to those leaving eve for its failure to address griefingganking to the point of harassment
in the end the real world market will dictate how the game is played if eve can not attract and hold new players that equals no new subscriptions a loss of future revenue  if eve can not hold on to existing player base a loss of current revenue then the game will have to change whether those who drink cups of care bear tears every day like it or not change will happen care bears the soloists indys dont like constantly getting griefed then who will the griefers grief this game runs on dollars euros pounds francs guilders krones pesos dinars and rubles not your ability to gank every living thing in a high sec system change or the rl market place will change you for better or worse money will do the talking
eve is special things like scams that would get you instabanned anywhere else are part of the gamewhere eve imho really lags is to break down the complexity to manageable levels in the ui badest thing is the fitting tool especially new players need it vets know what they need noobs dont and need to play around but dont have the money to do so solution extrernal programmui forgets scanned down targets in exploration solution external programmevelopedia closed no manual for noobs solution external websideigb wil go away solution external programbuying and selling prices just reginal solution external webside why either make it also possible ingame or take the prices out of crest only noobs dont know the prices vets know where to look outside eve point for the vetssorry but eve should only be sold as a package with these programs because they are providing essential help for eve and also give vets an unfair advantage over noobsccp should focus on the ui and how improve it why do you really need to sell and buy via the item hangar its certainly the option for industry megatrade but its just a pain if you want to buy some small things somewhereshortkeys loosing focus jump align etc is another paineve is technically fullfilling everything you need for a modern game but over time the ui is way back the whole ui needs a general overhaul by someone who has experience in usability and is not a long time eve player
its been clearly stated by ccp that they are having a hard time retaining new players that cannot be argued based on their own key notes i have been playing eve since beta and have done just about every aspect except lived in a wormholei dont see any good reason to not make hi sec a pvp safe zone unless you are in a wardec or agree to a dual will the population stats change locations from null sec to hi sec maybe a little alts will go up of course but to alleviate it a bit they need to make things less lucrative in hi sec versus low sec to null this includes incursions or any other new isk making element population may shift for a bit but as with any mmo the people will be able to take larger and larger risks over time and move to the other areas where the isk pays out more it will balance over time but more importantly i think there will be more players in eve  maybe not pvpers right away or maybe so but eventually everyone will try pvp or they wont  it doesnt matter
well a good step has been taken in the introduction of the animation toggle however i see that some would like it to be a bit more granular as they liked some parts but not others as for the events the new serpangel events i take or leave them im glad to not be logging in each day i know i didnt have to before but skillpoints might as well offer me real life gold
see i can quote other to and disregard them i am an old school gamer i play for the game not to come and socialze as my primary objective i like all aspects of the game from wh to null scamming and yes even ganking ive been ganked and lost billions and done same as for the games that have gone in the toilet wow is a big one they may still have largest player base but its prob dropped by a third or more why because of catering the the blind deaf and dumb that need to be hand held please if you find the game to difficult do the tutorials use google read take notes learn join eve university  you can teach the uninformed and the person willing to learn you can not teach the stupid and the lazyif you are flying multi b in cargo in an untanked ship with poor agility you deserve to be gankedthe politically correct crowd always joins because its the flavor of the monthim a nerd from way back when being a nerd was defiantly not cool  now we have all these wanna be fairie princess unicorn nerds that come here to pretend and go weeeeeeeeeeee im in a space ship then they cry to mommy  ccp  when the bad guy me blows them up and takes there stuff or scams them well thats what makes eve different from other games please stop trying to dumb down every game you touch and ruining it for real gamersid say a few other things to the person that enjoys copying and belittling my post but i am zero mood to be banned
perhaps if ccp actually advertised more there might be more peoplewho knows
ccps doing a fine job attracting new players keeping them is a problem though go watch ccp ghost give his speech at fanfest and youll understand that partanyway the ganking part isnt whats killing eve its annoying and harassing to a degree sure but some risk management in not flying something overpriced andor not carrying way too much cargo will mostly mitigate that behavior in highsec since ganking is an economic decision as much as it is a lulzy onethe biggest problem in eve right now is the war system being basically unlimited to cherrypick an ideal example the marmite collective has at the time of this posting 128 active wars and 37 pending wars  which adds up to them spending a total of around 82 billion isk on declaring wars this week the cost is clearly not the problem at this rate why even have highsec if its so easy to find the cash to wage war on wide swaths of the nonpvpcentric players then youre going to lose that section of your customer base since they see the game as not worth playing when they can naturally expect to be constantly at war when they have no interest in it being a constant for themwar should be a thing sure but the easiest fix is to just cap the total number of wars both active and pending per entity to five or ten tops you dont even have to bump the price of it to something halfway expensive but you wouldnt catch me complaining if you did
i would say just give this ability to the bowhead but take away its jump fatigue bonus to avoid power protection issues at the same time it lowers alot of the risk associated with moving ships which is a bad thing imo
i would give you my vote if it can only bridge industrial ships and is limited to lownull sec perhaps an extended roll to the rorqual i do see this as a potential loss of the value of jump freighters as you could just bridge regular freightersalbeit a shorter distance in reality the problem would be you could bridge a t1 freighter then jump with it then bridge it again eliminating the need of a jump freighter
the bonuses were active for perhaps two or three weeks after dust died remaining where they were when the servers shut down currently they have been reset to 0 but the icon is still present because apparently removing it is too much hard work as per usual half measures are more than enough for the scrubs who play fwfaction warfare is so good that literally everyone has an alt there to take part it doesnt need fixing if someone gave you a page of statistics about fw it would look great there are people everywhere and theres lots of activity it isnt until you take part not farm lp that you notice just how broken the mechanics have becomeship size restrictions are currently fine the issue is with specific ships being unbalanced
i am the braun part and chea elohe is the brains part of my gaming accounts our human counterpart is a 62 year old old fart a previous gamemaster for dd omega project star fleet battles campaign morrow project tank commander  i turn of the discussion to him as he is human and can best communicate to you i steven wilkinson am a 15 year usaf veteran from 1973 to 1988 during this time i was an active supporter to the gaming clubs at each of my assigned location for those few who dedicated the time to play i learned as much as i gave in terms of game plots that i staged to test and practice tactics and strategy you see in the military gaming was not and is not just considered an for fun activity it is the only on base club that did not have the strict nonfraternization rule in my last two assignments my commander gave me the responsibility and access to the command post so that we could use sand tables and extended maps to layout the games for our participants i invested my weekends to support the gaming activities in korea the club was tasked to provide exercise for law enforcement to review and act upon during exercise activities as a member of the team who created these exercises i can attest that we enjoyed ourselves and the organization commanders appreciated the challenges we added to the training exercises in korea our gaming organization included 125 active members from all organization on the base and a very wide range of enlisted and officer grades every new member had to go through me for their briefing and my recommendation as to their acceptance in the gaming organization this was a voluntary club that played in order to learn strategy and tactics we were obligated to present any game that built up the individuals who were part of that organization and to keep our behaviour in such that it properly represented the usaf and the many organization to which we were assigned i left active duty march 1988 have worked training military personnel in the middleeast since august 1988 on my own time i have continued to participate in gaming computer based and table top activitiesmy briefing to my gaming partners is that gaming can be extremely addictive and we who play must take every effort to ensure that our day to day lives are not compromised by our gaming activity our policy for our married members or members who have family responsibilities was that they limit their gaming to 8 hours in a week and less if military obligation interferi have given you this information so that there is a foundation to what i am about to recommend eve online is a civilian game and is a commercial enterprise from my experience i can testify that games that have changing plots in which the players are give parts to play produce the most active and committed participants in this i am referring to role playing and depends on activity as part of a team all games loose when it is left to one person now lets talk about pvp vs pve pvp is a drag to some individuals pvp is counter productive if there is no balance between the individuals eve online has a basic design that if applied permits new individuals  teams to be developed i suggest the following to increase participation and membership these changes will make more money for ccp and more fun for the membersa ccp fleet auxiliary organization and acadamy be added to the game this organization is committed to enforcing law in high sec and as membership skills budget and resources are made available by member participation they are committed to bring that same law standard to low sec and beyond the ccp fleet auxiliary organization and academy provide computer based support to expand membership to each time zone and team development in each of these time zones the members must spend 4 days 96 hours training in each vessel with fleet exercises provided and required for the training of each level 5 mastery the goal is to introduce teams that live in the same time zones and can organize with each other to develop fleets that are qualified to compete with those who demand to have pvp as an obligation the difference is that pvp is limited to low sec and below else they meet the force of both the ccp ai and the ccp fleet auxiliary old member can choose to become part of ccp fleet auxiliary and this has the impact of raising their security rating and all high sec locations protect ccp fleet members yes ganking organizations can choose to attack high value targets but the value of those targets will depend on the success of the ccp fleet auxiliary doing its job of interdicting low sec individuals and fleets who take such action in high sec as the plan proceeds that will be a natural conflict between those who want the wild wild west in nul and work whole space and those who are committed to enforcing high sec law in the rest of eve space
the idea is for a tactical shield manipulation adjustment option of shield density on the flyfor example  shield density 100  75  50  25 now we only have fixed 100 density and no shield manipulationi like to add another thoughtlogically if you have an object with shields  armor and whole structure you will imagine that as damage progresses through shields some will trickle through on to the armor and then to the whole depending from the resistance loss of the shield and armorthis effect will trigger the use of shield and armor equally and with the use of ts manipulation as i describe you can emphasize shield or armor favoring  retaining some hp on either shields or armor you can take advantage of their resistance effects then a complete depletion of shields or armor as we do now
actually ships come stock with 75 shield density and for every level of tacktical shield manipulation you train that falls by 5which is why no one in their right mind trains tsm 5what exactly are you trying to accomplish here and more importantly why do you think its necessaryeve is like an addiction you cant quit it until it quits you also iderno
as we all know and as proven by someone about 5 years ago or something like that chribba maybe who did a study on jita local after ccp said no bro those are all individual real people not robots that it turned virtually anyone that uses local in these trade hubs are simply scammersbots spamming at a ungodly rate with multiple accounts spamming the same contract with promises of glory and great worthvalue for moneywhy do we not do something ever so simple and suspend the ability for anyone to post a contract link into local specifically in trade hub systems jita  amarr insert hubthe only issue i can see to this idea is that people out there would say something like but i want to advertise my contract in local well you can still send it in emails corp alliance chat or other channels you may be apart of i am simply suggesting only a new rule to local chatsby doing this we shut down 90 of the scam spam in local and perhaps reduce allot of the lag in jita localhowever from a ccp perspective i guess scamming is seem as part of the game otherwise it would of been addressed by now and that if we think logically with the reduction in people recently more active accounts scamming away ultimately leads to more real world iskjust my 1 dollar of thought on the subject
not to put a damper on your personal experience recommendations and so forth  but ccp is aware the newbro playerbase needs additional support in order to boost retention rates as a part of overcoming the inherent complexities of eve online theyre working on it but mainly as integrating it into the new player experience ie the newbie training im sure theyd love to hear more specific details on how exactly new players could be bettersupported
i am totally in favor of helping new players perhaps first 30 days immune to pvp unless they flag selvesor some sort of mandatory training quests to get acquainted to game and the ruleslots of new players come in and its overloadperhaps more hands on from some volunteerspeople need to be told hey man thats not wise and let them accept the advice or rejectiam sure ccp knows what new players dont like maybe some compromise or more of a penalty when people ganksuch as more lower security ratinglike4 ganks and you get a  10 and your off to low and have to repair statusthat may be to severe but as people say more support for new people is needed
can you write a story based on a months gaming time would the story change each month there are many types of individuals some who like pvp and others who would like to track each and every ganker and destroy them every time they sho their harassing faces the point of creating an fleet auxiliary for the ccp would provide a structure in which to take new and old players to systematically create a team based organization that provides each a fun way of playing while getting the most out of training and to provide a negative factor for the harassing ganker to have consider look at our corporation system i work in the middleeast and i play between 1500 to 2000 eve time look at the number of corps that claim to operate during these hours there are truly far less than listed i have looked we need a system that connects people so that we have coverage 23 hours per day we need that system to provide the game with a usable plot that can be incorporated in the function and character of the game i note that i am coming from the usa historical western migration and the institution of law in those regions as frontiersmen and women who explored the land were replaced by families and businesses wanting security safety and clear lines to move products and resources to warrant their investments we have in eve the micro culture of this migration and we have the ability to use known human nature to motivate the players in creating game play the uses pvp pvi and role play the ccp auxiliary is used to recruit new and old players to establish law enforcement industrymining and shipping to police high sec if bad boys and girls in low and nullsec desire to repent of their way there has to ways to permit their enlistment into ccp auxiliary ccp developer will have an open story board on which to design environments for these individuals to train in every ccp ship and gain training points for the completion of each training exercise in addition to completing training exercises each ccp auxiliary fleet will be assigned a system in high sec to patrol 24 hours each day and protect all residents of that system the ccp will have exercises to provide orca boost in each system that they are assigned to the auxiliary has to protect these missions until the active ccp fleet arrives this starts in high sec and continues as the auxiliary moves to alianances in low nul and worm whole space there will be those who will want to test the system this is part of game creation and is important to keep eve energy but by recruiting fleets it will mean having the gankers facing competition and give a sense of fairness to the unarmed miners and solo playershow specifically is the new player trained in the ccp aux they are linked to an existing fleet with team speak and work their way thru each vessel in an interactive environment to complete the mission of that environment and to gain lvl 5 master of that ship i would be very happy to work with a developer to put in operation there are four races and eight 8 faction frigates each frigate has it own mission and fits and is beneficial as training is completed requirement for training in each frigate would mean operating a fleet of all the frigates for each training environment and having to use each race and factors ship how many skill points for the completion of each of the exercises need to be balanced but use of skill bonuses coordinated with the training enables the players to move upward and onward in the gaming environment
nothe only way to wage war now is to camp pipes and trade hubs other forms of war are now defunctthanks to ccp
if im hearing you correctly it sounds like youre asking ccp to cross a line which they themselves had drawn in the sand as a rule ccp does not play in the sandbox alongside players on their officialadmin accounts except to provide occasional backdrop storyline events and sometimes to just chat in trade hubs for a few minutes to promote something related to the game what ccp does do is to hand out the buckets and shovels for others to decide how they want to play in the sandboxtheres nobody stopping you from operating your own vision of the auxiliary force in your own name send out your recruiters get a lot of newold guys and start waging the holy war on ignorance of the vision of what high security space should be police the hell out of it and reshape it  but  dont ask ccp to do that in the same style theyre much more likely to make adjustments to the environment itself in order to incentivize play styles were just going to have to agree to disagree on that point
stop concord oppressionfight for the good guys
steve really add up all the advantages lower security space has over high sec capital ships cyno jumps sov jump bridges moon mining no annoying concord stealth bombing infrastructure upgrading the list goes on and ondrug manufacturing in only low sec null sec restricts high sec pilots who roam in anoikis and into lower security space from using their skills to produce legal products closer to their now expanding customer baseto say lower security space needs to continue this monopoly has no basis in unbiased facts the risk to gather enough materials to produce the boosters still exists because gas clouds can mostly be found in lower security space i think upon further review if it is not fearfully biased you will see high sec manufacturing will boost revenue for lower security space industrialists who will have more outlets for both their raw components and finished drug products look at the bigger picture without trying to createmaintain a no longer useful monopoly for lower security space industrialists that are otherwise doing well and will certainly only benefit from a larger demand for their products in high sec markets where most pilots inhabit it has the added benefit of luring more pilots into lower security space on a regular basis to keep their high sec drug manufacturing facilities supplied many will learn to like it many will often come to a fiery conclusion how is any of that a bad thing
how will letting some industrialists move their operations from lowsec to highsec lure more people into lowsec the production side of the equation has no direct effect on the demand of boosters so all you would be doing is increasing the competition by making it easier to get into the business and lowering the risk and profits for booster manufacturers the game needs more reasons for players to leave highsec and fight each other  the risk vs reward of the various spaces has fallen so terribly out of balance in recent years removing one of the few advantages for an industrialist to take the risk and spend the effort to set up shop in lowsec or a wormhole is not a good direction to take and one that is likely not in the cards if anything nonhighsec industrialists still need more reasons to exist given the ease and safety of operating in highsec lowsec should be a place players want to live and earn a living not just visit briefly during meaningless drunken roams looking for consensual pvp
you ignore easily time proven market factors and fall back on the false risk vs reward whinethe risk in getting to and harvesting the gas clouds still exists but youll just pretend that is not the casewhat has fallen so terribly out of balance is the lack of risk for seasoned lower security pilots vs high sec pilots you have capital ships stealth bombers bubbles boosters local resources to resupply you hot drops jump bridge networks lethal pos that even flying near to can results in almost certain death and a whole neighborhood that targets any new visitor with all that you fear any change that will give any opportunity to someone else shamefully pitifulso you think we are drunken pilots because we live in high sec and only drop by lower security space on a lark how often to you travel far from your homebase id wager not too often because when you are red you are quickly dead unless you are in a fleetmore people making boosters means more people using boosters which results in more people going to mine the gas clouds which means more profit for the lower security industrialist because of the bigger market and more content for the pvp gankers and campers who will intercept many of those seeking the gas cloudssadly low sec has become the realm of anachronistic bitter pilots who can not accept change and want everyone to play like they do just to fight where would you get your ships and modules and ammo if everyone only did pvp industrialists dont need gankers and most gankers never leave homebase to engage in stand up fights against armed targets look how quickly the goons collapsed when their targets were shooting back most of you think gate camping and ganking makes you good at pvp because you overwhelmed your target or they had no weapons to shoot back great job you are a real proface the facts the only reason you want to keep the monopoly is because you dont think you could compete against the competition so sad to be you times will change despite your grumpy old man whining so turn your wheelchair towards the sun and eat your applesauce while the new kids take over the block pops
im not pretending anything at all that risk still exists and your proposal does nothing to change that but what you are falsely claiming is that somehow by allowing the second part of the industrial chain the gas processing to move to highsec you are going to get more people into low sec you will not in fact you will only serve to get people to move back to highsec depleting the lowsec population further in contrast to your claim that this would be good for lowsec activity quit crying the game is balanced this way for a reason if you want to make boosters set up shop outside of highsec thats the dealeve is about choices and tradeoffs not whining about how you cant have something like a toddler such behaviour is not very becoming and you are embarrassing yourself there is no monopoly you can make boosters anywhere but in highsec that is the tradeoff for the security blanket of concord deal with that reality and adapt your game play to it youll find a much greater chance of success than your current course of pleading with ccp to rewrite the rules of the game to suit your selfish whims
why you posing broyou are a high sec gankeryou dont live in lower security spaceyou only shoot targets that dont shoot back you dont know diddly about low sec industrialists you played yourself trying to play me but your gank record shows you never go to low sec high sec ganking of mining ships is not pvp its cowardicereal men shoot things that shoot backtalk about regions of space you inhabit try not to live the lie here in the forumsyour opinion will be respected when you dont pretend to know about regions you dont have the spine to visitc o d e stands for cowards offer dumb explanationsyoure excused from this discussion because you are a fraud 100 horse pucky
lets not dilute one of the last remaining occupations of the lowsec pirate by letting them be produced in highsecyou wanna play with the big toys then move out of highsec and setup a shop1 calm down miner as you pointed out people think they can get away with stuff they would not in rl like for example illegal mining  ima wreckyou
thats not how this works you have runners for that sell the drugs to the runners who will deliver them you can fit soo many drugs in interceptors its what makes drugs such a piratelike experience calm down miner as you pointed out people think they can get away with stuff they would not in rl like for example illegal mining  ima wreckyou
friend i think you should go dry your keyboard out your tears have caused your typing to come out all bolded and justified strangely while your teardrenched keyboard is drying out you can use the time to think of a real argument of to why the game should be changed in your favour that isnt completely made up of tired clichUFFFDs and butthurt
a nomadic bandfleet of eve lower security space anoikis industrialist explorers get a new ship to move them and their stuff around further and faster great new content new opportunitiesof course eventually someone predatory or just someone defending their local assets finds them a conflict ensues and you demand the intruders new arrivals have not even a little chance to defend themselves how heroic this is why eve pvp in lower security space has earned such a bad reputation with new pilots most refuse to even fly there pvp in far too many cases has devolved into the equivalent of sneaking up behind a defenseless pilot then bashing their skull in they never had a chancelook at the eve solo pvp vids online the skills required the courage displayed makes you want to fly and fight pvp in eve the pilot has to plan and then react to quickly changing events to succeed against a dangerous target or targets that could also kill him in the fight if he makes mistakes or misjudges the threat that is real pvpshould this new ship have a limited amount of capability to transport combat ships yes should it carry only industrial ships no that is stupid beyond belief in a hostile environmentper fleet pilot one fitted cruiser for low sec one fitted battleship that can only be launched for null sec or some reasonable limitation of this type would allow pilots to have a fighting chance are you really that afraid of pilots being able to fight back if so please justify it so that maybe i can learn to understand your apparent birth right to be served only defenseless targets
synergy
ccp already has the perfect mechanism from the now dearly departed dust514 the room where the dusties waited for battle was a sprawling atrium with a view of space where you could walk around with other mercs and form squads it would be a perfect fit for in citadels as an added attraction while you view the space around itcome on ccp grow a pair and do this the mittani is too busy standing in the ashes of his formerly over rated coalition  alliance to bark and raise a ruckus now so lets get this done okay
alts
have you actually read what the war dec guys have written i have and i find their arguments compelling unless you are going to do infiltration and even that is now harder thanks to the change in the watchlist camping is pretty much it have lots of wars and camp pipes and hubs and let the prey come to you much easier than trying to find somebody that is now damn hard to find
what a nice pile of bogus assumptions the war dec cost formula supposedly peaks out at 500 million isk when you dec a corpalliance with 2000 pilots for your 82 billion isk to be true they have to have wars against corporation with 330000 pilots calling bravo sierra on that numberin fact if they decced corps with 50 pilots of less then the cost is actually an order of magnitude lessmight help to know the mechanic you are talking about
im aware of the cost scaling of war declarations and most wars are declared against small organizations at the base cost of 50 million per war i posted roughly the minimum cost for that many wars and your argument on how it should cost more isnt helping your case
okay you are correct i am the one who was offhowever why do you think they are declaring that many warsare they stupid and just wasting iskare they doing it just to be dicksare they doing it to try and get fights and killssome other reasonif you were a merc and you had your own corp of mercs and somebody came and wanted you to take out another corporation please detail how youd get information on your potential targettell me how youd know which systems they arewere in when they are online and so fortheven ccp admits that the change in the watchlist has had an adverse impact on focused war decs and you wonder why there has been an increase in blanket war decstrying to ensure you have enough potential targets while you run through the pipes between hubs and when camping said trade hubs
im not saying youre wrong about the reasons for people blanketing entire regions with wardecs its certainly easier to throw cheap wars everywhere and see what sticks  but its also counterproductive in the longer term for the game as a whole so yeah maybe some additional changes andor rollbacks would help the problem as it stands that said i still believe there needs to be a hard cap on the number of wars to keep something like this from getting out of hand again if such improvements fail to live up to expectations
that is a ccp problem one they created blaming it on corps that respond to the change in mechanics is like blaming water for flowing down hillrolling thing back may not work ever hear the phrase of pandoras box i think this might a similar situation these groups have been playing together for awhile now they are not suddenly going to break apart because the change in mechanics that drove them together has been undone it may take entirely new mechanics to achieve that goalhard caps are stupid and lazy and counter to the very core of this game this game is not about hard and fast rules like in most other mmos but is entirely open ended it is about letting players do stuff that nobody anticipatedpersonally i find this all totally hilarious i find it hilarious because people whinedwar decs are too cheap make them more expensive so ccp did and those players using the war dec mechanic adapted and changed and banded together and now run isk making operations to fund the increased war costs next players whined about the watchlist and the war dec players said if you do this there will be more balnket war decs so ccp did it andwe got more blanket war decstell me exactly how many more nerfs does this game need before it is fixed
credit where its due the c o d e stands for thing was pretty funny
your post was too long to quote all of it but i would give you all of my space likes if i could well saidi kept the most important part if you dislike the game they way it is then go find a game you enjoy instead of trying to change this one to be the game you were looking for in the first placeeve is like an addiction you cant quit it until it quits you also iderno
i think teckos pech does not understand the killboard as a meaning for wardec pilots he thinks in isk and expects that others think the same of course there is an isk boarder where people just will not use wardecs anymore but the idea of higher price leads to less wardecs is not true due to the different pilot goalsi think if a change is needed i do not think so for wardecs it is that war decs should get a winning and loosing condition currently the war decced parties goal is loose as little as possible in a certain amount of timebetter would be in my eyes if the war dec can be forced to an end by a condition of sorts plus a peace cool down timer in order to give the attacked party time to breathlol just found 
i do not think in terms of just isk i dont know what gave you that idea but that is quite simply wronghowever higher isk cost would lead to less warsall other factors held constant but those other factors are not constant and many of those factors are something players can control such as banding together into a larger group this would open up new opportunities for making isk as a larger group can now field more pilots if needed to defend things like a reaction farmas for the link he goes rather badly off the rails right awayi dont think that will do anything to be quite honest the reason why wars are lopsided is that one side generally speaking has chosen not to learn pvp mechanics as such unless this structure is vulnerable 247 i doubt anyone will undock to shoot it and if it is vulnerable 247 then war dec corps are going to get screwed again theyll anchor the structure and then it will get blown up while they are in bed and even the war dec corps and alliances get even bigger to have 247 coverage of the structure we are back to no defenders undockingthe problem with wars is one of attitude one group of players like pvp and they know the mechanics the other group does not like pvp pretty much at all and they do not know the pvp mechanics thus one side is just not going to fight they are not going to fight now nor are they likely to fight over a structure
your argumentation is sole based on isk so i came to the assumtion that you messure success in isk like a lot of people doi do not mean to disrespect it is just my experience when i deal with fellow miners that they think in sole isk termsso instead of 2 corps individually wardecing 15 corps  in total 30 you want them both to focus on 10 corps with doubled crewi could also imagine that certain individuals will attract even more warsi could imagine that on global range it would reduce the feeling for people to be in a war but worse the situation for people who are in onealso i do believe it is hard to determine the right amount for a cost of a wardec because for groups that can finance themself through other means it might be easier to compensate while others will stop useing wardecs at all because they simply do not have the ressourcesi assume that richer wardeccers will stay longer in that biz then youngsters or corps with simpler financial structuresin total i see the risk that raise of wardec prise as a lone meassure would lead to professionalism of war deccers only those with higher income or savings will go for this increase  focus of the unwilling and frustraded pilots that want to mine at all costsimho this is the wrong focus if wardecs are a problem to individual groups they should be dealt with individually so a raise of wardec price is in my eyes not goal leadingthe price currently effects only the duration of a war a not good running war will end quickly while good running wars will be extended to find the right war partner a wardeccing corp will start of with a wide spread and then find the right targetsi think the  should be a  the following is not a quotei do not believe that a structure is a solution either since the defender is the one who has to be online not the attackerhowever intersting is the idea that the wardec is bound to a winning condition the war ends when the winning condition is reached so the defender as a reason to fightcurrent war decs there is no benefit for the defender to search the fight some do out of fun but you could also choose not to undock during warsthat is the potential in this idea while the idea as such is imperfect the idea is imho the right one
no prior to the nerf each corp might have 15 wars after the nerf they might be able to have 78 each they band together and can have 15 or 16 or morethe question is are there economies of scale in isk making if the answer is yes then they might be able to have even more wars maybe even 20 or possibly 30i disagree as i noted i think the issue is one of attitude what winning condition will induce people not interested in pvp to undock and face pvp
1 from me ive wanted to have a character alligned to these pirate factions since i discovered eve maybe even to the point my highsec would be lets say sansha space while the current highsec would be nullsec full of rats to mei think factions in gen
while i admit im not at all experienced with the drug trade in industry  i can say with experience that allowing key structures in high sec space to manufacture drugs could vastly change the economy in a big waylikening to the ease at which we are now able to do things in high sec with poss that we couldnt do before for exampleim all in favor of making more isk  but i dont see a compelling reason to bring drug manufacturing to high sec inspite of it being legalizedim more traditionalist when it comes to eve  lets leave it asis for nowso chalk one up for the you want to do it get your ass out of high sec category
sarcasmyes lets move contract spamming to systems around jita  namely citadels with market hubs  yes lets cause a crapton of eve mail spamming where certain key individuals have 0 isk spam filters set for diplo reasonssarcasmi suspect you didnt put much thought into your proposalback to the drawing board you goyou want a solution yes delete contract linking  make a new browser for contract searching where can create ads like corporation recruitment ads  however people will complain they want to link contractsif we can make the contract window more market viewer friendlymaybe you can talk them out of itthis wont stop morons from spamming literally anything in local as it isin my honest opinion ccp should be more aggressive about spamming when it comes to frequency and what is put in local but thats me and my 5 centsramses
just minimise local while youre in a trade hub its not hard
greetingsas a pure new player in the eve universe i had a very displaesing experience latelymy coorporation got wardecedthe result of this was that i had to dock up log off the game and do something else while the war was onthere are several issues tied to this1 i have paied to play a game i am denied playing if i undock i will be shot by a gang 2 my character and me is seven weeks old so are most of the other chars i my tiny company the guys who wared us are 10 years old how am i gonna stand up against a pack of very experienced players with skillpoints and ships which outclasses me a hundred times3 i am not a hard core gamer i am wodering how family fathers like me can have our fun in eve when they have time to and not when the aggressive high sec gankers alow me to i could go on and make a long list here but i think my point is clear enoughi cant play the game i bought and the reason is other players denying me they are more experienced they operate in large gangs and they have enough isk not to worry about it ccp has even provided them with agents who happily will tell where i am the locator agents all is in the hands of the gankers who off course win every timeas i understand that ccp want pvp to be the core of everything it is highly needed to implement a way to make it possible for people like me with limited time to enjoy our adventures in new eden i am fine with unsafe sorroundings just make it fair
leave corporationproblem solved
yes i know that leaving is to some extent a solution however as a new player trying to get into all the myriads of this and that in eve which is one of the reasons this seems like an awsome game leaving my coorporation does not seem very appealing to me if it wasnt for the corp i would have had a hard time getting the hang of thisthe other reasone leaving the corp seems like a bad idea is that if everyone should leave everytime a wardec comes up there would be too much leaving and rejoining to build something stronger again all the cards on the hads of the experienced none om the hands of the rookies
another reason why leaving the corp is not a good solution i can join another corp or rejoin after war i guess it is just a matter of time before a new war starts and then i have to do this againi can stay in a npc corp but how fun is thatso now i am looking at two uneatable solutions be denied a corp membership or be denied playing at allthis has to be addressed give the rookies some means to means to play at a fair level
let me guessyou thought you had safety and immunity to attacks even before you joined your corporationwrong1 high security space 05 to 10 does not nor will it ever guarantee safety all i have to do is find youand i can blow your ship up and pod you at any time of my choosing once you are undocked not even concord will stop me the illusion of safety you have right now is totally false oh sure ill get blown upbut who caresits my choice and i can take it anytime i can afford to replace my losses easily2 corporations provide a number of niceties  none of which impact your safety or your ability to survive a corporation is a team a team that gains access some nice abilities such as posscitadels asset sharing communicationsbut this doesnt remove the ability anyone in npc has  such as fleet activities you are saddly mistakened if you think its necessary to survive in your current state oh sure  numbers helpalliancesdiplomatic statusbut a corporation is just a flag with colorsdoesnt remove the fact you still need to know how to fight3 by leaving a corporation or being npcd you still have access to your corporation mates if they are worth anything that is  and pretty much do what you need to do while immune to war decsa wardec means you can kill them back by the wayno penaltiesno consequenceseve online is a nonconsensual pvp game with pveindustry aspects  is it 100 pvp no but pvp is a way of life and you should accept that factthis was never a question of fairnessits a question of survivaleve online is not for the feint of heartso dont stick around if you cant handle the coldness of spaceso what do you do about ityou can quit the game and leaveproblem solvedbecause i can tell you right nowyour voice will be ignoredtauntedteasedjeeredyou likely made yourself a target of suicide ganks even as you made your first posts its totally legitor you can say ok  what can i do about thislearn to fightlearn to defend yourself reapr the riches that comes with knowledgeso you get blown upits gonna happenthink its bad try playing when i startedwe can talk about harshnesscant not interested in learning to fightthen quit your corporationits the easiest thing to doyou can freely go about your business  course your not safe even then  as you can get blown up at any time fly smartbut at least its not open season as gankers generally dont target people unless they have a reason to do so find out howbut you can at least figure things outlearn to playtry to educate yourself googlecom is your friend vast resources of knowledge out there on any subject for eve you can think ofeve online is about knowledgeyou need to do your homeworkreadstudyit takes brainsand guileyou obviously came here looking for answersput it to work thenyoure corporation is not doing its job if this is how you feel about the gameand im sorry for thatyou should find someone elsebecause if they arent educating you and helping you through this wardecthen they dont deserve youi suggest you go check out eve university as your next corp good place to startsorry if your upsetbut you deserve the truthall in allwelcome to eve online  you where going to find out sooner or laterand good luck paranoia is healthy  kept me alive it can help youedit 25 member corporation and it cant defend itself yeahissues there
i thought nothing i am new to this as in no other hopes than embarking a cool gamethat said i have read these forums and found your answears sll aroundleave corp this game is not for you you made yourself an easy target by posting etc etc my concern is not about imunity or total security in high sec that sounds boring my topic is about 10 year old characters with ships and skills i never can stand up against they are delt the superior cards by any means this might be cool for those who are ten years old but not so cool for the rookies it is unbalanced and if it is so that i by this post have made myself an easy target so be it i will update the thread as playing goes on until then my advice to all who are concedring posting here not to do so
you should learn to read before you go mouthing off about things you dont understandeven a noob can take down a 10 year oldbut your too hung up on yourself to learnfair enoughgood luckyour going to need it
eve is a pvp game and its an mmo with character progression a corporation is eves version of a nation and can declare war and be wardecced these facts are not in dispute and will not change it is up to you to adapt your expectations and aactions to themyou can play during a wardec you have several options open to you loosely they are run quit hide deal or fightthe option i would recommend is not to tie yourself to a corp that is unable or unwilling to defend itself hisec is notoriously infested with these corps and i am sorry that you have been sucked in to one but the fact is that your corps incompetence inexperience and lack of resources are not reasons why you should be exempted from having to make choices that the rest of us deal with dailyin your situation i would strongly advise joining a different corp able and willing to defend itself and able and willing to teach you to defend yourself that situation would make the choices available to you much more attractive once you learn some basic eve mechanics and put some effort into your resources and capabilities you will be able to laugh off wardecs i know that sounds implausible to you in your situation but its absolutely trueone option that is always open to you is to join one of the new player focused groups in 00 pandemic horde karmafleet etc if you care to do so youll learn about game mechanics pvp how little losing a ship means and maybe even have some fun
thank you for a honest and friendly reply this is the way a forum should work
it has been awhile since we have seen one of these threadsthe answer has been and always will be you already have options leave corp join an established corporation or have your corporation join an established alliance that can teach and protect you roll a neutral alt use it to grab some cheapo electronic warfare ships research some fast ranged fits research tactics on how to avoid unfavorable encounters hint intsaundocks bookmarks etc take a page out of every guerilla rebal group in history and start using hit and run harassment tacticsyour objective will be to sufficiently  off your attackers to the point where you are not worth the effortfull disclosure i did this as a newbie against other veterans
in all justice to the op and others like him i really wish ccp wouldnt tout form a corp with your other 2 buddies who also started playing 8 days ago as a normal activityforming a corp is something you do after youve finished your adorably clueless newbie stageat the very least it should require a rank 1 skill to v and a hundred or two million isk to create a corp
as someone who has been playing for quite a while and gets wardecd every few months here is my advicewardec corps usually hang around trade hubs and pipes look up their killboards and check where they are activefind some systems far from where they are active and play there until the wardec is overelse join another corp until the wardec is over then move back if you wantignore any nonsense from players trying to scare you into thinking this game is super hardhang in there and learn to play smart
sadly ive seen null sec alliances in rookie systems offering 5 to 15million per mission to join their corp so i find it rather amusing when someone talks about how they should wait to join a corp or even to create one the whole point of an mmo is to play together with other people hince why it is a massively multiplayer online game keyword multiplayer this doesnt mean you have to get along with all those people or that all those people have to like yougranted i fully understand where you are coming from malcanis i have the same belief but the fact that veteran players consistantly go against that belief and that newbros dont know the difference is where its both sad and amusingop listen i feel your pain been there done that even went merc for a while the point of the game is to have fun if you arent having fun talk with the people you play with and figure something out together dont listen to people when they tell you eve isnt for you the fact that you started playing or had an interest in it to begin with means it is for you there are players that have made loose groups in npc corps they call themselves a cic corp in corp they setup a private channel that they all join to joke and trade ideas they fleet up together and mine mission run and do everything that is associated with nonpvp activity also because they are not in a player corp they are ammune to war decs you and your buddies could always start one yourselves granted you wont have access to a corp wallet corp hangers or corp contract system but in reality you dont really need itfor all those haters out there that constantly tell players mainly newbros that they should stop crying and eve isnt for them ive seen this happen on other games while constructive criticism is always a good thing out right telling a player to leave a game is a bad idea by doing so you are only hurting the game you enjoy and put so much time into to do what ever it is you do in the game there are always flaws in a game design the devs cant think of everything there are always going to be 100million reasons to change 100million things to make it better its the devs choice in the end if they dont think that way again we can call them idiots or morons all we want and they will keep on doing what they want to do would anyone of you do any different if someone told you that your choice was stupid to themthe point is stop telling players to leave the game maybe we might keep a few give them ideas give them a place to grow hell teach them something even if its to die at least they might learn from it and grow as a player
you could leave your corp and apply to join the corp that has you wardeccedthis has several advantages1 the wardeccing corps players know how to play eve right and you will learn things correctly instead of what your current corp teaches which is cowardice when you get right down to it2 wardeccers tend to be nicer people more open to sharing their experience and isk with new players and generally more fun to be with3 wardeccers rarely mine4 the first time you kill another player you will find out why so many of us are addicted to this game despite the terrible pve gameplay constantly changing rules and clunky interface hint adrenaline is a drug5 fat dumb and stupid is no way to go through lifeand finally6 wardeccers rarely mineop you know something is wrong fix it abandon carebearism by choosing to mine in new order systems highsec miners have agreed to follow the new halaima code of conduct wwwminerbumpingcom
ok i can do pvp it just seemed like a good idea to get into how the game works before throwing myself head first into something bad but i guess eve isnt that different from other games after all
theres nothing worng with joining a corp run by experienced players with good support infrastructure early on in fact its absolutely the best thing to do although i personally would recommend to a new player that they run the tutorial missions to get an idea of what they actually want to do and be before joining anyone
the carreer missions are basics of all and provide a set of knowledge you the one way or the other must accuire i have done all of them however they do not contain pvp at all and for sure do not give any hints about how to play during a war
how if the 10 year char messes up badly maybe the main part is the 10 year can afford to loose a 1b ship a week but the new char can hardly afford to loose t1 destroyer dont fly anything you cant afford to loose is a good advice up to the point where your chances are low and you cant afford any loss the deccer is winning without shooting once because they can afford every loss and the other cant so they do the smart thing docking and in the end dropping eve because some vet needs easy ganking to bolster his kill board because he cant keep up with vets that have the skills and resources to match him
exactly my point and as a rookie it is hard to get any support for this view however there are some good advices in this thread that said this might be a game for the veterans that slowly will drop players because the new ones finds it boring be doomed to loose every timet
a good advise would be that he has to be there to hit you so if you watch local you know when its safe to fly second if he really hunts you and you are not just blanket decced move you are most likely not not worth it to move across half of new eden or you go to some area where you might find help by the residence providence this region is null but there the rule is nrds not red dont shoot you are not red but the chances that the deccer is red to the providence corps are high and even if he follows you killing you will put him on the kos list there
course bear in mind anyone can shoot you in nullsec regardlessthat means there will be people who dont carebut at least youve changed the battlefield considerably
even if a veteran can afford to loose 1 billion a week in ships it does not necessarily mean heshe wants to sink that kind of cost in a random wardec heshe has no particular stake in besides gigglesthis is especially the case if the the situation leading to the lost ship was frustrating and not very funlike i said before you do not have to fight directly you do not have to do things on your aggressors terms you merely need to make the war declaration not worth their time you can use 1 million isk frigates loaded with electronic warfare mods to buzz around and make the fight miserable and drawn out see you cant kill them because you dont have any damage but they cant kill you because ewar is effective against pretty much all ships including highend ones you can use these tactics when doing missions too so you can keep earning an income one of you performs the mission while the rest of you cover himher from hostiles if hostiles show up the people covering can jam the hostiles while the main mission runner warps away then everyone scatters wait until your aggressors are sitting on the undock and are all complacent send one of your guys out to be the sacrificial lamb so they all have aggression timers and thus cannot dock in the station then undock in destroyers fit for suicide ganking and nuke the most expensive squishy thing on field you have to crunch some numbers before you do this so you can choose the right targetif you score a kill you will have made the war expensive for the veteran players and are now forcing them to make a costfunbenefit choice see was that a fluke and should we continue or should we cut our losses to preserve our killboard reputation go out into lowsec the locals there may tear you apart if they catch you but they will also do the same to your attackers and unlike your attackers the lowsec locals are not gunning for you specifically hell if you talk with them they may help you a little bit example train youalternatively you can always dabble in the art of negotiation ask them what they want if they ask for isk say you dont have any what else can be donehere is something from my history when i was a nubbin my newbie lolcorp was wardecced we were harassed ganked camped and well you get the picturethen we organized and did exactly what i mentioned abovethen we talked with the war deccers we eventually worked out a deal where were would all meet in a certain system at a certain time bring everything you have to the table one glorious battle to end everythingand win or lose they would drop the war after thatguess what they did
if they arent going to clean them up then they need to open corp tickers to being up to six characters give us the ability to make more good ticker names
change the thread title to unwilling to play during wardec please
you snooze you losesorry but if id taken a five year hiatus or whatever after playing for several years and with a paidfor subscription no less id be pretty incensed that a johnnycomelately had stolen my identityfind another good name if you cant do that may i suggest either a thesaurus or a list of baby names
ccp thinks vr is the future rip eve online since the compnay can not compete in the near future with new space mmos source
i guess you have to trust ccp with your money to one day make some sort of crest related feature that is somehow replacing the igb sadly the company chose not to do this in the same point release cycle of ripping the browser out of the game crest is what remains of the ceos highly hyped and anticipated feature called carbon technology that gave us incarnathat was developed further by the current executive producer ccp seagull and still remains to see any worthy oog applicationsource
i regret to inform you its just not that simple integrating a browser into a 3d engine takes more than just waving your hands at it and integrating itbunch of work and things do change which would mean ccp would need to check it each time that they integrate a new version which means a ongoing workloadthey didnt take the decision to remove it lightly lots of internal discussion on it
exactly ive been reading this thread in various stages for almost 10 years now and no one has yet even managed to come close to reconciling the irreconcilableas long as people with no interest in learning how to defend themselves and no interest in paying others to do so keep forming corps which can be wardecced this discussion will continueits not really a discussion though because there simply isnt enough common ground for it to really be a discussion its just squirrels and sharks yelling past each other about which would be the best place for them both to look for food the squirrels want to look for nuts in the trees the sharks want to chase fish in the seas there is no option to satisfy one that doesnt kill the otheri alluded to part of the root problem in another threadpeople in this very thread have with all sincerity advised those troubled by wardecs to go rat or mine in null because its safer there of course nullsec isnt intrinsically safer its riskier in 50 ways such safety as exists in null exists purely because the level of risk is such that the inhabitants have no other option than to work together and put effort into measures to make it be safer the better organised and better led ones are more successful and their miners ratters and builders operate in a measure of safetycontrariwise the situation in hisec is that hisec is statistically so safe that the overhead of providing safety to one another is so cripplingly high that virtually noone bothers to do it if youre making i dont know t2 invulns for 2 mill and getting a 250k isk margin on each one then it is evidently foolish to spend whether in time isk opportunity cost higher mats costs whatever 150k isk per unit on protecting your production and transport operation when theres only a 3 loss rate due to hostile action doing nothing costs you 60k per unit protecting yourself costs you 150k however when that 3 is taken its not taken as just a lower overhead on each sale its taken all at once as a whole weeks production gets ganked because you didnt warp your hauler to a jita 44 instadock or whatever and when the situation arises theres absolutely nothing you can do about it its an unfair situation to the gankee in the sense that its unfair that a pair of 3s will always lose to 4 jacks even if the dude with the pair decided to bet a gsc full of t2 mods on his hand on the basis that the other guy folded on the previous 48 roundsdespite having watched ccp repeatedly nerf nonconsensual pvp in hisec since almost the day i started i have not seen any drop in the number of complaints about nonconsensual pvp in hisec thats because reducing the incidence doesnt make the occurrence any more acceptable to the guy it happens to in fact it makes it less acceptable because every such nerf makes it less worth taking any precautions inevitably meaning that the actual encounter is perceived as even more unfair provoking even more passionate complaintsthats why one more nerf will never fix the problem each nerf makes the problem worsei cant remember what t2 invulns actually cost right this second and cba looking it up figures are for illustrative purposes only
yupit is really an issue of incentives people who do not want to pvp present a serious challenge to anyone who wants to fix the war dec system how do you create an incentive for people to do something they do not want to do and have at least one avenue to select to let them avoid what they do not want to doregarding the rate of incidence and nerfing there may be yet another effect as well by making ganking less frequent it also becomes more shocking to those it happens too especially if they have joined after a round of nerfs this shock may lead them to the forums to clamor for yet more nerfspeople who do not face these aspects of the problem are doomed to failurethis is why i say that trying to fix war decs is a fools errand you cannot fix it with a structure or some other nonsense until you address the underlying incentive problem
has ccp updated the despawn time of wrecks off the grid maybe even in line with the security rating of the system it is in my findings along with another are that the wrecks despawn fastersource
they certainly cant be fixed with stuff like tinkering with how many simultaneous wardecs a corp can have thats a silly nerf that entirely misses the point the only number of allowable wardecs that the squirrels will accept is zero
i joined eve just over two years ago i can still clearly remember the first couple of weeks trying to grasp what eve is about and what i wanted to do in itbut in regards the the original post on attracting new players and then retaining them i think one major point is constantly overlooked and is probably a more important deciding factor in both cases costi am in my 40s and financially very comfortable perhaps thats why i appreciate the cost v reward eve seems to have a core player base that can easily justify wasting large amounts of real life monies disproportional to what most people would consider a acceptable amount to pay for what is after all just a gamenot even comparing eve to its competitors looking at it as a single entity what do you get for your moneyfor 1 subscription you get 1 character with a possibility to increase this to 3 with either more real life cash or from successful in game isk making this costs your time and i can assure you this is priceless and non refundablethis character can do bugger all until you have played and payed for the game long enough to have learned some basic skills with the constant pressure to get more so you can flyuse better all the while you can get attacked at any point and loose everything in and equipped to your ship to top that you find out quickly that this is the accepted eve ethos like it or ps offall this is set within a backdrop of a false sandbox concept full of walls and rules that favors mob rule and loss over gainnot only do you pay ccp for your time in game you need to pay them consistently to keep the skills points flowing and pay them more to have more than one character doing the samefor this you the right to slowly learn skills while under constant and actively endorsed threat of aggression so in essence you have to pay to play pay to keep playing pay to play more and pay to loose your stuff you payed to get but thats ok you can pay more for a plex to sell to get some more in game monies to loose more stuffno sensible right minded person would accept this those of us that play eve are simply mental and this cesspool of over privileged and unpleasantly aggressive nutters will never be attractive to a mainstream audience i for one would be very concerned if it was
generally agreed additionally with the tightening of areas where the mainstream player types had traditionally found their homes in eve  theres simply less room for them to have their play style say what you want about what the sandbox is how it should operate and where the rules and the players must adjust to one another  the bottom line of the conversation is still how badly has eve been hemorraging players over the last handful of years and can it regrow the playerbase if the current environment is maintainedi would argue that clearly ccp has created a massivly successful new revenue stream in the form of skill injectors but i would also argue that such additional revenue streams are commonly created out of necessity if ccp didnt feel the squeeze of loss then they wouldnt be inclined to allow this thing which theyve shunned for so long ie quick skill points for a price because its a form of power creep leading evercloser to a paytowin game so even knowing they grudgingly shuffled a halfstep closr to a paytowin environment they bent to the demands of the playerbase because they knew the additional revenue would do them some good let them deny it if they want but ill still argue its the truthultimately ccp is without possibility of debate losing more customers than theyre gaining because the game envornment is shifting based on rules changes i would argue this is much worse than catering to whiners by not permitting highsec to become lowsec for a section of the players who tend to stick to highsec and generally not bother anybody because they want to run minnig lasers and just be chatty for a little while let war be in highsec as an intermittent kick in the pants to get people to wake up but dont let it basically be there in the form of spamming wars without any reason other than the people spamming wars cant be bothered to go fight in lownullsec where theres a level of risk over which they have no control the irony of this problem is the aggressors discussed in this topic are manipulating the concord safety net which has historically been relied upon by those who just flatout cant accept constantly being at war  and that is how ccp has failed to enable a significant section of their customers expectations to be fulfilled regardless of what highsec should beif ccp wants to increase their subscription numbers again then theyll have to make another change which permits casual nonaggressive players to have some breathing room while also operating as player corporations  at least in highsec if not well then the game can be what ccp wants it to be albeit with fewer whiners roaming the stars theres the chance however that all of this is by design if ccp wanted to filter out what generally amounted to nonpvp players from the game and knew they couldnt survive the economit hit unless they created a new form of income  then this would fit that mold honestly however i see injectors as a reactionaccomodation rather than a part of a planmany of us are painfully aware of the debacles of yearspast where previous sets of management basically ignored problems players declared needed to be addressed incarna is a pretty strong example on the other hand ccp seagull has made it her personal crusade to not only save eve by seeing that features are complete when added but that swaths of existing sicknesses are removed from the game and replaced with something better for that seagull i salute you keep kicking ass and dont ever stop pushing the future visionhighsec is pvprestricted but not enough to convince tens of thousands of players to continue playing  and the rub is that for years ccp has been trying to push people to get out into nullsec and fight wars over space and resources partly by making highsec less attractive by being less safe than it once was this push has had very little success as measured by the number of players in various security levels of spacein conclusion one or two things are happening opton 1 ccp is actively promoting an environment whereby these players remove themselves from the game because these players are ruining what the game was designed to be a system of rules which encourages lawlessness option 2 ccp has failed to comprehend the expectations theyve set and are now denying any accommodation to the players who are leaving in droves because both sides are acting on their incomplete understandings both options are likely and both would lead to whats going on there is no third option  but there is a chance of both options being true
errrno you clearly have a job so you clearly have a price for your timeactually it is not that hard to make isk imo
okay but here is the thing these problems are a result of changes ccp has made for example making war decs more expensive this was a common request for those getting decced they probably thought if it more expensive they wont be able to deck me which is true given a very restrictive assumption that assumption is ceterius paribus or more commonly known as all other things equal but in life all other things are rarely if ever constant there was nothing to stop those who utilize the war dec mechanic from responding via some other dimension so many of these corporations formed alliances and got bigger this enabled them to afford the war dec costs whereas smaller corpsalliances could notso those complaining about the costs of war decs are left frustrated because they are still getting decced and it seems like nothing has changed the problem is the people advocating for these changes just do not understand things like economics while their reasoning was correct given the ceterius paribus assumption that assumption was something they did not fully understand or appreciate this is a problem for many people when it comes to economics and this issue is clearly an economic onewhen you try to design something based on prices costs etc then you are talking economicsan additional change was the removal of the watchlist this made it very difficult to engage in targeted war decs and a natural response to this was to utilize mass war decs and then camproam pipes between trade hubs and camping trade hub stationsso these two changes led to more use of mass war decs so in part those complaining about war decswell they got what they asked for and it bit them in the ass this happens quite a bit in economics because what looks like the obvious answer to something fails to take into account that we are talking about people who can change their behavior in response to policy change so it is tremendously ironic that we are still here talking about war decs and that those who utilize such mechanics for content can have as many as 200 war decs at any given timei suggest people look at my signature and consider that it applies very much to this game you may think you know how some change you advocate will work out but in the end you probably dont
might as well just eliminate high sec might as well eliminate small corpsan while wer at it might as well eliminate any form of structure because unless you got your head up your  or you just dont play you would see that these mass wardec are destroying the moral of new players they cant pvp they dont have the money  they dont have the skills but yet they are being hunted by 5 man mercs squads that have been playing since 2009 sure they can hide in the stations like cowards whos going to renew a subscription with that to look forward too  an fyi thats exaxtly what theyr saying
just stay off the trade pipes and out of trade hub systems they wont go looking for you they wait for you to come to themalternatively stay in an npc corp until you have more sp isk and exprienceor try eve uni to pick up the knowledge on how to fight back
i have a beter idea why not fix the problemlimits the amount of wardec a corp can have an limitt the number of wardec a corp can have on them i mean seriously three active wardec on a mining corp that has 6 active mebers and 5 of em been playing less than 2 months i mean seriously do we not see thisis a issue thats not going to go away an is spiraling out of control
would you feel better if you had only 1 war going you would fight then or would your next step be to demand that they not be able to declare a war unless it is evenwhy not just demand removing war altogetherthe dead swans lay in the stagnant pool they lay they rotted they turned around occasionally bits of flesh dropped off them from time to time and sank into the pools mire they also smelt a great deal
option a come to nullsecoption b close current corp remake a new one with the same name let wardeccers waste money on corporations that no longer existyou dont have to join eve university or karmafleet or pandemic horde however newbie friendly they tell you they are you could go browse the alliancecorporation recruitment forums and find a group you like i do however advise you avoid the corporations that offer new chars 5xx mil for them to join they just want numbers and wont do anything good for you in the long runand dont get swayed away from how you want to play the game by people who tell you how you should be playing itthats what eve is an opportunity around every corner pvp as many people call it  ill get to high sec pvp later  isnt the be all end all activity in eve you could mine kill npc rats run missions the two arent necessarily the same do exploration activities participate in wormhole lowsec or nullsec activities be in trading production intelligence relations diplomacy its up to you and people you dont trust to make your game time worthwhileyou can also change the way you play the game push up the stakes leave the trendy lowproffit cesspool of highsec and venture into lowsec nullsec or wormhole space there are plenty people out there who will happily extend you their hand for some fresh blood to swell their ranks without empty promises and an eye on your meager posessionsif you enjoy something do it but at the same time be understanding that your way of play might not be directly comparable to other peoples wants or needsyeah he could also follow that example and in response to having his family members raped join the gang of rapists and doing it to other people including his own as well stop bullshittingyeah way too people are addicted to shooting targets that cant shoot back because theya have no gunsb die in the first volleythat for so many people is the exhilirating adrenaline rush shooting target dummies then bragging about it over beer with their coplayersif you want some real pvp go watch some stramers like zarvox instead of promoting how you know how to play the game right
leadership v its a good skill to have regardless and it seems sort of appropriate the opmalcanis gave you some amazing advice and he said it better than i could have i will just reiterate one thing  learn how the game works player knowledge is the only skill that isnt on the skill tree and cant be learned via skill injectors it is also the most vital skill in the game if you get blown up convo the guy who did it and ask what you could have done differently some of them will mock you obviously but a lot of them will offer you a pointer or two and you gain a small measure of respect for not being a whinger about the loss i learned more about eve from people who killed me than i ever did from fights i wonin the case of the wardec fight back  get some cheap frigates and insure them and go out and shoot the guys deccing you yes you will probably lose hilariously and repeatedly thats not important whats important is that you learn from those losses ask for advice on improving your ability to defend yourself not on avoiding having too7 good luckeve is like an addiction you cant quit it until it quits you also iderno
 edutainment 
war decs are part of the game this is a game about player interaction often nonconsensual interactionso you are asking to change the nature of the game at a fundamental level no
that will be phase 2 and 3 respectively of their plan to make eve super awesome just like wow
just to be clearhow many of the people here complaining about war decs ganks and all these awful things that happen in the game have visited the home page for this gamethis is what you will see link it saysbuild your dreamswreck their dreamsthat second partdid you freaking read that when you got an account and downloaded the gamethis is a game whereyeah you can do bad things to other players in game you can shoot them scam them steal from them all sorts of things
i expected responces like these after all what would forums be without belittling remarks i can deal with this issue iv been killed an wont be the last time im just here trying to represents a few new players in the game your either hiding the issue because your apart of it or you just dont have a clue what wer talking about you just wait this has just began my voice may not fix thing but wait the caous this is going causesomethings going to be changed watch so flame me if u wishzec
this isnt some new thing happeningit has been building for several years to reach the current level of wardec spam many things have contributed to this buildup including a changing playerbase and multiple changes to wardec mechanics  including for a brief period i believe a limit to the number of wars a group could have active at a single time much like you are proposing hereyou all seem to think you are the only people playing eve who are capable of rational thought  and you are all so smug and sure of yourselves when you declare that this simple nerf will finally fix everything and magically bring wars back to balance forgive our rude answers  but weve heard it all before a million times and even seen the ingame results of some of the suggestions like yours and it wont do what you think it will do lets face it  if you cant handle the wars while you outnumber your attackers 10000 to 1 and they have so many targets they cant be bothered to come looking for youyou really dont want to see what happens when you only outnumber them 10 to 1 and they have nothing better to do than hunt you down and vent their frustration at how ccp keeps nerfing their playstyle by making your life a living hellthe dead swans lay in the stagnant pool they lay they rotted they turned around occasionally bits of flesh dropped off them from time to time and sank into the pools mire they also smelt a great deal
just curious when i was new we were in war decs we managed to deal with them we didnt fight but we up and moved they didnt follow later war decs were people who used the watchlist and locator agents we did fight back after teaming up with another corp they decced sowhy cant you do thisbtw the reason you are in the situation you are in is thanks to ccp blanket war decs no the only thing when it comes to war decsbecause of changes they have made to the game im doubtful theyll find a way to make thing better for you like you think ccp rarely does that
well maybe the adrenaline rush is better when you kill people alone rather than in f1 pressing packs heh real pvp elitism is funny by choosing to mine in new order systems highsec miners have agreed to follow the new halaima code of conduct wwwminerbumpingcom
ingame mechanics like war decs mean nothing to a new player who can barely comprehend the full depth of the game they are still trying to warp to a station or fit something on a ship when you do eventually find out about them and what they entail they just sound like away to grief people in small corpswhy would people pay money and their time playing a game that has such blatant disregard for their efforts and progresseves message is clear from from the outset to new players your time and assets have no value i want you to loose your stuff mwaaaahahahahahahahahthis is what eve is agreed and you accept it or just dont play it those of us that have chosen the former understand the risks the later want no part in it and wont until they have some more protection in high sec which as it stands at present is anything but highly secure space as thats the only place you think you have time to react to a threat inits abundantly clear the percentage of gamers on this planet that this does appeal to and do want their hard earned stuff getting stolen or lost through not consensual aggression is minusculepeople dont want to play with people that are not nice and do unpleasant things even if you want them to
another thing that i ponder on in regards to the original posts question as i would argue that eve is in fact exceedingly appealing and alluring to the potential perusing gamer its the keeping them thats the issue are the questions around whether eve needs more playersit would be very interesting to hear from ccp as to what they would consider a ideal number for their player base do they need more players how many more players would they like how many more players could eve support what would be too many players
riddle me this why do we almost never see any complaints about getting shot at from players engaging in industrial or pve or pi or rd in 00 or npc 00 or losec or wspaceand please lets not embarrass everyone by pretending that miningproductionpiresearch dont occur in those zones
