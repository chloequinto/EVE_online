med  large blasters need some assisteither that or the deimos needs a  to pg and speed
i agree that blasters need fixing at the minute they are horrifying they are the close range extreme damage weapon that cant hit a space station if you have any transversel i mean what is going on there blasters should be terrifying your counter is simple stay out of thier range however if you slip into optimal it should pretty much be game over a tracking bonused ship ie megathron should never miss when in fall off and rarely miss in optimal with max skills vs similar sized target with average speed unless you are being tdto summeriseblasters need a huge boost to trackingblasters need a slight boost to base damageleave webs alone pirates are getting them to go with blaster boats so i worry that they will become super powerful which they should be anyway with these fixesleave blaster range as is its perfect if blasters had these fixesfor the love of eve fix t2 heavy damage ammo the draw backs vs benefits are terriblethank you and goodnight
remove the 50 tracking penalty of void ammo should work
still void damage is not enough but thats a good thought maybe boost hybrid ammo especifically void and null and definitely way more tracking
this would be great but the heretic can already tell you all about the awesomeness of rockets soon as they fix that then maybe we can talk about such a boat
hum i dont have a smart comment to do but i support this
at fanfest they talked about t3 frigsfrigs there are 6 basic  2 assault  2 ceptors  2 covops  1 electronic warfaredestroyers oh yeah we got interdictors thats typical ccp instead of giving destroyers a powerup and players a reason to train destroyers they boost the already good frigs even moredestroyers are the unwanted stepchild of eve
supportedmaybe not the changes you propose but destroyers need some love even though they are supposed to be frigates with more firepower i think they need a moderate hp boost also a second dessy for each race would be interesting
my thrasher needs to be able to thrash moar ships supported 
hell yeah
yes it needs to be balance the rockets still deserve a proper looking at
i support this idea
add a drone bay scanner too
you have my support
if sentry damage was reduced 510 aswell atm having the damage rigs makes sentries very powerful
fixed for you but yeah supported
for the sake of humanity why hasnt this been fixed yet i fully support this proposal
yup
no brainer from my pov
supporting change
this will be the 4th csm i think
currently when a player deletes their character all of the characters items become property of their corporation however the items are delivered to the division 1 hangar of that corporation if the corp doesnt have a hangar at that station it is put into impound id propose that these items be placed in corp deliveries instead this allows corps to collect the items without having to rentcancel an office at each station furthermore if you do own a station there anyone with division 1 access can take the items with no record as they are just placed on the hangar floor
reasonable and very logical change
how often do players delete characters without transferring all significant assets anyway this change seems like it would affect very few people
1 poor design should be fixed regardless of if it affects 100 people or 100002 all it takes is one character with random junk in 57 stations to make corp asset pulls a pain all the sudden its showing 15 rounds of antimatter is some station well never visit and its a pain to clear it out id like my assets list for my corp to be as tidy as possible
supportedmake it low priority thats fine but it really is a bad way to do it
the beauty of this is that is is probably a very small fix and wouldnt take a lot of coder time its one of 100 minor things that can be done to improve eve
frequently people switch the corporations they do missions with when they do some lps are stuck with their old missioning corporation they dont have enough lps to be worth getting anything and they cant be traded to their new corporationto solve this i think you should be able to trade lps to another corporation at 90 of their original value with the other corporation if the corporation respects you enough higher standing they should give you a higher rate id scale it at another 1 per point of standing so someone with 50 with the corporation they want to transfer to would get 95 of their lp value when traded to the new corporation someone with 80 would get 98if i want to trade 30000 lps from amarr navy to caldari navy with 28 standing i would get 27840 caldari navy lps some corporations might pay lower than 90 if their lp store is felt to be worth moresummary ccp should allow lps to be traded between npc corporations depending on your standing with said corporation so that people dont have to abandon their loyalty points when switching the corporations they want to mission for
signed
so this friend of mine who has lots of loyalty points with me abandons me and decides to spend his time with other people in the future however he still wants to retain whatever gratitude i had for him and transfer it to his new friends so that they like him better yeah sure actually im more likely to call them an tell them what an unreliable jackal he is causing exactly the opposite effectdoesnt make sense in real world doesnt make sense in eve
while this might be nice to have for some people me included it neither makes sense in game mechanics nor in rp at most they might give you 3050 for your lps but even stillnot supported
dear god no different lp stores with different rewards are the few things that directly reward working for some less used corporations and factions if you use the most popular mission grinding hubs and corps you get to chain good missions but can only use those lp on the same rewards all the other lemmings canthere might be some merit in transferring lp within a faction but the conversion rate should be heavily fined since certain corps are just so much better suited for grinding lp than others not all corps have good multiple lvl 4 agents in highsec so using lol 90 transfer rates would make running missions for them a bad choicenot to mention you could have just cashed in your lp at the old corp and converted it all to isk iskies dont weight anything or take any space and they can used everywhere so i dont really see any issue to be solved

ok so we all know we have the well known slave and crystal sets slave been bonuse to extra hitpoints and crystals been for shield on the shield boost amount i know someone might have suggested this but i was thinking why not duplicate both sets and change them aroundetc for armor we would take the crystal set duplicate it and make it for armor so say lets call it minor just name off top of me head and it a gets the bonuse for armor repair amount or b gets a bonuse for the duration off the reppers and for shield take the slave set duplicate them for sheidl and call them diamond name off top of my head again and give it a bonuse to shield hp both parties then have equal sets and its alot more interesting for everyone as well thoughtsgflames a gogo
no a shield amount set would make passive shield tanks over powered especially on the drake to name one ship off hand
correct that it does just give you one preset orbital distance but i agree it would be better because of the ship you fly at the time then the change in tatics if required say if boosting abilities came into play because of fleet bonuses if friendlies warp in then all your settings now changei agree you need to be able to set distance manually on the fly per ship you fly and per target it all comes back to more control of the ship which encourages just a little more immersionsupportedps any1 know how to put the little thumbs up underneath the avatar yes im sure it been answered somewhewre but since im still in this post writing lol
its a very useful topic as the corporation ceo i can say it has often happened that a person took somebody elses ships or property for instance if you leave a carrier under the force field for the night you can find nothing there in the morning it could be avoided for example by setting access restrictions in ship maintanance array or under force field by password i think it is of vital importance to give the corporation members a chance to keep their personal assets or ships in poses being shure they will be safe

candidates are currently filling in their profiles itll most likely stay this way for at least a week to make sure all candidates have a chance to fill in their profile
does every candidate who answers the questionnaire know about this if not then onenot me mind you could accuse you of fixing the results towards someone you want to win i think you should take out the dont care option entirely if you dont think its indicative of a good csm member especially if thats skewing the results towards the kind of person you think should be in the csm either that or have it be a perfect match
the calculations are listed and explained in this thread so any candidate that wants to know how it works has full disclosure taking out the no opinion option is not a good idea because itll force people to form or fake a change in opinion if there is an issue they really have no opinion on
then it should be a perfect match not weak youve got an idea that not knowing or not caring about an issue makes the candidate less viable not knowing i can see not caring i dont if the person who is looking for a candidate that represents his interests does not care about a thing and the guy thats going to try to change things doesnt care either theyre perfectly matched it is only your opinion that makes them not so and that shouldnt enter into it

dominion viewsdominion is going to be a radical change for many people especially those who hold or are hoping to hold space in 00 space i have played most of my eve life in 00 and have become intimately familiar with the pos warfare the blobs dds and station ping pong of the old days it is my experience with the sov system as it has matured and broken in eve that is the primary reason i decided to run for csm it is the core of the game for people not living in empire and will make or break the playability of the game for the forseable futuresov i look at the sov changes from both sides of the equation i currently have high value capital build infrastructure in place in claimed sov space so that part of me does not like the changes to sov 4 specifically however the pvp side of me has become fustrated with the lack of movement in the large portion of 00 space that forces us to roam for hours to find and form of meaningful combat call me crazy but i like most of the new planned changes as they force the fights away from ducking in and out of pos bubbles and move it out to the open where combat fleets have to commit to the battle from both the defending and attacking side i approach everything with an open mind in that regard i do not automatically assume change is bad i do however believe that as the sov system matures and it is ballanced  added on that there should be now more then ever a council that specifically has experience and understands the mechanics  game play aspects involved to ensure that it evolves in such a manner as to make 00 both ballanced and accelerate combat to where we can have many smaller scale battles progressing on the map at any given time vs massive blobbing eve warssupercapitalsi personally do not agree with the roll that mothershipsi mean super carriers   have been delegated to within eve i do however believe that the titan doomsday is very overdue and welcome the change i make both of these statements as someone who both builds and flies titans and scs on trinity the changes to sov 4 will make these items even more difficult to produce and as such their value should increase based on the skill time required and the sacrifices nessesary to put a pilot in one i beleive they should have relevent roles especially in the case of the super carriers where if they were specifically renamed to highlight their combat roll vs being a true mothership they should project firepower at par with thier investment titans are well  titans and should not be the 1 button win button to ruin the day of a roaming gang that just came 20 jumps to find a fight and get taken out with 1 click i think there could be a roll for titans in the game and that should be somewhere beyond just a glorified jump bridge
there are few if any people who have the depth and the knowledge that qual has when it comes to industry and all things related his character has one of the highest sp totals in eve and he has done it all if you wanted an expert about all things science and industry in eve this is your man
it is probably true that my strongest area of knowledge is in all things industrial it was where i started in the gamei was in cornexant corps industrial group when we build the first known battleship in the game in 2003i was in xanadu and later xancom when back when naga and xanandu were the biggest public players in the early tech 2 market there was full scale market war between us back then that was funi was the only known char to have all skill related to invetion maxed out even before invention was released and i did my fair share in the community efford to figure out all the hidden rules behind thati was gas mining pioneer though that was with an alti didnt play that puplic a role when tech 3 hit this spring but i was out there in wormhole space collecting the resources and building those first rounds of tech 3 shipsso not only do i know the mechanics i also know the path that lead us to where we are todayas said i play with more than this character and with the others i have been doing pvp in all scales agents cosmos exploration out of game forum wars trading and morei have been around the block

i am willing to have an interview i will fire off and evemail to you the next time i am on line been busy at work this weekendweb siteedit adding my jita park post as well linkage
filled out the survey there were a few instances where i didnt agree with the way the question was phrased in other words i had an opinion on the topic that wasnt really represented by an agreedisagree option the tech 1 loot and 00 infrastructure questions were examples of this
thank you dierdra vaal for putting together this useful tool that both candidates and voters can make use of i think we can all appreciate the time and effort that has gone into such a project i do have some questions and criticisms however i would like to reserve them until the campaign is over taking the thread off course into a discussion about the process would not be respectful to you or your hostcheers
hmmm that is an interesting philosophical point you raise there hold on let me confer with noampauseyes correct i couldnt care less you are absolutely correct maybe a little though atually i care a little but  it is my firm belief that ccp will always pick the best route within the confines of technical limitations  ie the game design choice that makes players most happy and emotionally nurtured i am not that focal on what happens between those margins  it would feel like being a politician running on a policylist defining fair train schedules and bread prices
i will follow up on this after i get home from work thanks for the post

there really should be some kind of consequences involved with repping another shipsupported
effort means i havent read the entire thread but i just want to point out something that may or may not have been addressed lowsec piracy some roam with logistics in fleet and no local reps on the ships and often every bs has a rr youre going to make it so they would be forced to stay away from a gate after repping so they could get rid of their 1min aggro timer before jumping throughthis means that moving around with a rr fleet or one supported by logistics is slower than a snail on the saltflats due to the constant need for ships to deagress their repping which is saving their fleetmate from dieing to sentry fire to jump throughnot supported quit doing empire wars if you dont like the mechanics also this
if thats youre only fix  then why should empire war decers have to quit the way they play their game  why dont you quit roaming in low sec with rr fleetscute  what are you 12

void reduces range and tracking from that i conclude that it is designed to be used against larger tangets eg frigs against bs of bs against caps currently there damage is too low

my hope is that after they get done boosting the speed of af using abs the resulting enormous af swarms raping everything in sight will swing the pendulum back toward the idea of a dedicated antifrigate shipie the destroyer hullsi say hulls because despite my love for the t1 ships malformed redheaded babies though they may be the counter to a t2 ship is usually another t2 ship id just like the acceptable counter to t2 frigs to not be get one of your own which is what it is nowkrum
slots yes give a low to minniecaldari and a med to amarrgallentefitting more cpu and possibly a hair more grid nothing morehp most important  id like to see high base hull and armour hp think about the same as a tier 3 cruiser or a little more  about 18k hp still not going to beat down cruisers but will give some resistance to instagib hp buff should not be propagated to interdictorsbonus changes nospeedagility just fine though an increase in warp speed to 45 or 6 would be nicemight be interesting if corm got standard missiles and cata range bonus thoughbuilt in hull resistances would also be nice 50 and disallow fitting dcus shield remains the same as these are effectively heavily armoured frigs but still ultimately frigs

they have a role and even with reactor controls apocalypse is still one of the best sniping battleships it has a role and it is damn good at it i cannot say the same about destroyers i feel sad when i see a combat ship with so much potential used as a salvage boat

how did this go
i read this rocket fixi am disappointrockets will hit for full damage yes but that full damage still wont be near the full damage output of any rival ship please dont just increase explosion velocity but increase the damage or rate of firethis is mainly due to their low explosion velocity 85ms while rockets are almost always fit to frigate sized ships and used to fire at fast moving frigate sized targets no its due to their garbage damagerate of fire dpsif i can hit another assault ship with 70 dps using rockets while its hitting me with 230 with almost the same tank as me how fing fair is that
well a bit of max damage could should be added but not much unless the fitting is upped also remember the range it shouldnt overpower barrage acs or scorch pulses
would love to see an actual rocket barrage in gameimo rockets should beshortish rangevery high rate of firehigh capacity clip
with all respect as there still seem to be need of discussion i copied my proposal from the assembly hall into the features and ideas discussion part to unclutter the assembly hall from any ongoing discussionthe proposal is available for discussion here in the features and ideas discussion partproposal scanable wrecks and containersstrengthen the salvager professionproposal make wrecks and containers scanable with core scan probesmotivationthis would strengthen the salvager as independent profession and would allow them to scan for the wrecks that are left behind by mission runners rather than the need to scan for the active mission runner in his mission this would ease on the relation ship between mission runners and salvagers as the salvager does not need to salvage the wrecks under the eyes of an active mission runner especially since the mission runners still think that salvage belongs to them which is not the case as stated by ccp several timesit would also relieve the database from maintaining left behind wrecks for the full two hours and could works as player driven database cleaning of objectsaddendum 1as commented by myself here make it so that deadspace areas cover the sig radius of wrecks just like deadspace areas did before during the old scanning system to ships signature radius so that wrecks in deadspace areas are more difficult to scan down than wrecks in open spacethis would prevent people from abusing core probes to scan down active mission runners via their wrecks as these will be harder to scan down than wrecks in empty space or the mission runner itself with combat probesit would also direct the active salvager toward the abandoned wrecks first rather than to the wrecks of an active mission runner seperating the two professions reducing overlap of the two and reducing the conflict due to subjective percieve ownership rightsaddendum 2distinguished the proposel pointing that i want wrecks being able to scan with core probesi also think that the skill requirements for the different probes are kinda mixed upthe core probes should be useable at astrometics just like now lvl i the deep probes at iii which is now at v and the combat at 5  now at iincrease expanded probe launcher skill requirement from astrometics ii to iii as wellthis would distinguish the dedicated salvager  being able to scan directly for wrecks  from those that are looking for ships
im not sure if this is a troll or   you know i think it is a trollthere is no way you can actually believe what you wrotenot supported ninja salvaging is easy enough
i cant see any reason why wrecks should not be scannable ninja salvaging is a legitimate albeit hated career and this would expand on it and possibly open it up to those who do not want the inyourface of the current ninja salvaging stigmasupported
yes please there are so many missions unsalvaged why waste that
makes perfect sense that you should be able to scan for wrecks to me
yes this is a valid suggestion i would still prefer it to be flaggable but whatever
some further thoughtsit should be more difficult to get a hit on a wreck than on a ship in generalafaik deadspaces cover players ships slightly from scanning making it slightly more difficult to scan them when they are in a deadspace in the old systemin the old system ppl were thus scanning for the drones rather than for the ship itselfim not sure how this works under the new system thoughscanning a ship does require special probes namely the combat probes so scanning a mission runner indirectly by using core probes to scan the wrecks would become possible but you wouldnt know if one is inside till you get thereso to not make ppl abuse normal core probes to scan down mission runners indirectly it should be fairly difficult with cores to scan wrecksstill this would at least allow you to scan down for those wrecks that get left behind by a mission runner or left behind by exploration site users who didnt clean up their exploration sitein addition since deadspaces areas dissapear after a while the covering of it as stated above will dissapear too if it still exist so it could be that scanning wrecks in a not active mission couldcan be easier than scanning for wrecks in an active missionfurther as stated in the weekly salvager thread in the general discussion now moved and locked to features and discussions  its not ninja salvaging since currently youre doing it right under the nose of the mission runner there is nothing stealthy about it  it would be ninja if you could do it without noticing the salvager its not stealing as ccp has stated several times that they want salvaging to be an independent profession and naturally i support my own idea 
ive always wondered why wrecks werent scannable possibly make it so that any wrecks that are left after the mission is turned in become scannable ie  turn in mission wrecks now become scannable vovi like this idea
it makes sense to me when i was missioning myself i always went with a salvager and did everything before handing the mission in probably not very efficient but in my opinion that small part of personal deadspace you get from your agent cant be yours for all eternity salvaging is not part of missioning either in my opinion as it is entirely possible to complete a mission by not salvaging a single wreck so to a missioner salvage is also a different profession so to say and should be up for contest
this actually sounds very reasonable
love it make it so
well ok

drone int 5 gall spec reporting some of these i agree with hp buff being the most important 33 flat buff for kali and 20 per level drone intmeh to the rig stuffno to drone damage modfail to see point of drone range thingsentries racial damage ok but reduce their damage by a flat 10 as welldrone aggression changes making drones prioritize targets of a similar size is enough heavies to bc and bs meds to cruisers and essies lights to frigshull repairewar mehuniversal drone damage bonus yestp drones fix tps firsthp of assembled drones in bay sureid like to see sentries get a 150ms mwd speed it wouldnt help trying to stay aligned with sentries but it would be useful to retrieve themslow repair of drones in bay would be nice as well say 110 of hullshieldarmour restored every 15 seconds or 2 and a half minutes to fully rep a dronei wouldnt mind seeing t2 drones have t2 resists either though its not terribly likely to happen
i love this idea i have many fond memories of countless hours watching tribes demos and rejoiced when the t2 community made a live demo shoutcast toolsigned
agreed imy corp currently has 3 ships worth between 40 and 70 million isk sat impounded in different stations that would each cost 50 to 60 million isk to rent an office atit would be nice if i could get them out without paying almost as much as each ship is worth to do it
topic says it all
i endorse this suggestion
i could see some sort of transfer within the faction  but absolutely not for interfaction exchangeeven if caldari likes amarr why should they accept their coupons lpalso the conversion rate would have to be very complex  rare corps with hardly any agents should be worth more than corps with tons of l4q20 agentsif at all id suggest a new sort of factionlp which has to be claimed by converting corplp
as much as id absolutely love a set of implants that increased my shield hp by 537 the same as the current crystal and slave implants increase their relevant bonus i have to sadly agree with marlona it would be far far overpoweredrokh would be untouchable not to mention the soon to be released navy scorp and updated rattlesnake drakes nighthawks and vultures would be indestructible by anything less than overwhelming oddslets not even get into the ramifications of that type of an implant on a capitalsupercap ship
just make slaves not affect capital ships and you remove the huge imbalance that currently exists between the two implant sets
or make crystals apply to capital reps yes im aware that this would be vastly op just saying it to make the point that slaves shouldnt apply either
why would it be op why would 50 more tank be op in a capital fight defined by 100k dps and where tank is defined by rr
ok then make the new shield buffer implants increase shield recharge time problem solvedand its not op if they give the same amount of buffer as slaves do
not all capital fights are 20 dreads and 20 carriers on each side when youre talking a carrier or two and support vs another carrier or two and support that extra tanking dps means shield carriers are untouchable until the end of the fight when everything can be focused on them the phoenix in siege would be a  to kill even by a fairly well fit pos thats going to be quite a bit more difficult
yeah ive always wanted a repair effectiveness implant that wasnt hardwired to slots 610
i agree with the op and i would even go a step further as to how it should be implemented i feel the default orbit and keep at range distances should be a ship setting instead of a pilot setting i want this taranis to have a default orbit distance of 500m and this vagabond to have a default orbit distance of 15km and when i switch from one to the other i dont want to reset these distances again each time
meh sba doesnt apply on that many ships they need those midslots for tackle
power grid usage is phenomenal compared to other large artillery the heaviest large rail gun uses 2500 power grid while the second heaviest laser cannon uses 3575 the projectile artillery matches 3575 as well but again that is the heaviest caliber projectile vs the 2nd heaviest laserexamplelarge railguns350mm ii  1969pg425mm ii  2625pglarge artillery1200mm ii  30251400mm ii  3575large beam cannonsmega ii  3575tachyon ii  4125these grid needs are absurd for any players new or old the tachyon beam laser ii rack cannot fit on any amarr battleship im suggesting a bonus for the apocalypse that reduces beam laser pg needs or simply reducing the pg consumption in general regardless of the ship
tachyon apocs are already one of the best snipers in the game if not the best lrn2fit
goodlasers are the premiere turret for any role in this game you care to mention and on amarr boats the cap use isnt even an issue which leaves us with the one remaining downsidefittingso i think your thread is horribly misguided
ive never had a problem fitting an 8 tach apoc or a 7 tach geddon reactor control iis are an important part of the fitting bit lame to be asking for a boost to the already best weapon system in game tbh
meh sounds good on paper but really not much different from lowering the jam strengthboth end up with the same result more target locks for the opposition whether you completely jam less often or you jam as often but only half his target locks really doesnt make much differencealso people would just target lock tons of random ships as fast as possible to make it less probable that the lock that gets jammed is the one on the primary
nothing is impossible i hope

yes you can indeed hit a moving frigate from that far away the problem is that its not really useful to do so at that range youre using spike m and even with 3 mfs ii youll only volley for sixhundredish before any resist or tracking is accounted for also at 177 km the frigate will be beyond the range of any other ships in your fleet no other cruiser sized ship will reach those ranges and battleships likely wont hit the frigate or will be working on higher priority targets so your frigate will just warp awaythe main strength of the eagle isnt in shooting stuff at that range its that you can use faction lead of even move to thorium and still be engaging with the rest of your gang in sniper hacsthe eagle really needs some more pg of any of the remotely viable sniper hacs the eagle has the lowest absolute value and is the only ship of the group that cannot fit a full rack of the largest gun and mwd without a rcu even at awu 5the zealot by comparison can fit practically its entire load out without any help at awu 5

just one question what do you think moving all highquality agents to lowsecurity space would do itd be the same story we have now with maybe a 1 loss in mission profitability most profit comes from loot and salvage anyways the highquality agents would be controlled by pirate corporations as level 5 agents are now and players would form mission hubs around the quality 05 agents in short nothing would changein other topics ccp has already said that changing the bpobpc graphics andor colors is impossible using the current game structure dictor modules are banned from lowsec for a reason and that is not going to change scanning for macro programs requires access to the kernel which most players would be against or a list of macro programs the macros can be easily renamed to avoid said list restricted sell and buy orders goes against the laissezfaire attitude of the game and ccp has already said no to this oneim not saying you dont have good ideas but thought and research would help your platform out incredibly i see no reason to vote for a candidate who fails to research before tossing his hat into the ring

ashina sitos pvp trainings were my first pvp activity and the cdd i attended was my first 00 activity in eve thus of what i have learned about eve pvp almost everything have beed with asinas help its good to know theres someone there who cares about us rookies thanksfrom being in a fleet and in same voicechats with ashina i gained an impression of determined characrer patient and through instructor reliable comradeinarms and overall nice person wellversed in eve loreashina you can rely on my vote 
its a good thing someone is finally looking out for carebears like us you have my vote
hey man this guys legit man maaaaan
i will be available for an interview as well here is the platform siteplatformsjita park postmy email is ahsekuawbtmonasterycomregardsahs
im looking for a csm wholl represent my interests someone who will finally address the issues of suicide ganking and ninja salvaging in missions howm i supposed to get anything done when griefers abound and i cant do a single mission in hisec without having my loot stolen nor haul without getting suicide gankedits time someone got serious about bringing these issues to ccp someone whos not afraid to get in their face in person about these lame game mechanics and put a stop to them if they want to kill us or salvage our loot they should have to legitimately wardec us i stay in an npc corp for a reason and i think its just plain dumb that some idiot in a full t1 fit ship can come along and attack and kill me anyway and make money off of the insurance and loot to boot isnt concord supposed to stop this sort of crap from happening why does it take them so long to arrive why is insurance still paid for these ers ships once they get blown up this has to end i want a csm candidate wholl stand up for my rights to play the game how i wantwho will answer my call
what the heck this is the second thread ive seen about this why is everyone all of a sudden complaining about all these anticarebears as part of a successful merc group we use unethical means of carrying out our business a lot of people complain but the truth is you can ninja salvage and suicide gank just as well as anyone else ccp understands this which is why they havent put in a mechanic to fix it i want a csm who knows how to play this game the right way not some carebear that spends all this time protecting people who are helpless anyway
i agree with wapquad
how am i supposed to defend myself from 20 people just the other day i was afk piloting my fenrir through hisec and when i came back from getting coffee i found that my ship had been destroyed by a bunch of suicide gankers in battleships howm i supposed to deal with that i cant even fit guns on my freighterthe real truth is that this game has been infested by a bunch of zombies masquerading as people who have no real morals or seemingly emotions theyll easily just  away hours of other peoples hard work in a few short minutes one time i even hired a merc corp but they just took my isk and then didnt wardec the guys who were ganking me or protect me while i moved my cargo theyre unreliable at best and if ccp thinks that this is an okay idea then i will take my four accounts elsewhere i think lots of other carebears feel the same way but id rather not abandon eve because its a beautiful game this is why we need a csm wholl represent our interests
are you seriously still complaining about this you have got to be one of the dumbest ones ive seen in a while gtfo tbh
lol i cant believe you are so butthurt cause you got your ship ganked you need to htfu my battle hardened corp knows what its like to take a few losses weve been blobbed so hard by like 15 times our numbers and they came in bs but because we are so good at what we do we make back losses back with insurance and stuff everyone that knows anything about this game knows that people are harsh and will use any means necessary to get ahead in a way it is your fault for hauling expensive items that are worth taking perhaps you should rethink how you play this game and take it more seriously
the key word here that cretins like you fail to realize is that this is indeed a game it shouldnt have to be taken seriously to have fun maybe because you live in your mothers basement and have no real job or responsibilities you take eve seriously like its your life yeh right i bet your a big successful mercenary though lol in your newbcorp i have a friend whos in a nullsec alliance and they would stomp you flat i just prefer to play by myself though cause i dont really like to pvp real pvpers go to lowsec and 00 unlike these bullcrap griefers in hisec who dont really know anything about pvp run along little man keep thinking your hotstuff for killing people who dont wanna pvp back let me know when youre ready to get in a real fight and ill call them even this is the last time im going to post in this thread cause its clear that arguing with you is useless even i mean
thats what the corporations and alliances are made for you can join the corporation of carebears and you can protect yourself together you can even form an alliance and hire pvp corporation if you meet some serious resistance support them with ships so they can fight for you there is a lot of opportunities in this game to achieve your goals true carebear corporation can hire an army to conquer the place in eve
why are you supporting this carebear he obviously has no hope in this game and needs to give up while he still has some ships intact you wont be getting any votes from my corp
didnt i just said no
ccp iswe dont need a carebear csm drowning out the concerns of other faction of the playerbase better able to articulate what is wrong with our game
how are you supposed to defend yourself dont go for coffee when flying a 900m isk ship loaded with who knows how much isk in goodsbefore my csm term i was flying my industrial through space when i heard my daughter cry i ran to her while the ship was on autopilot and returned to see my pod flying through space i lost most of my possessions totaling over 2b isk that day but thats the game of eve and i recovered and prosperedpvp and pve exist in a mutuallybeneficial arrangement and the game hinges on that balance while i dont pvp due to personal reasons i would not elect a pure carebear if he had an unrealistic view of the game as one anonymous pod pilot long ago said undocking is permission to pvpeve is a tough game quit treating it like star trek and start to see it as firefly and the game will be a lot smoother for you
first check dierdra vaals vote matching service once it is up and running you may find your candidate there the survey had questions exactly like what you have listedsecond i dont think i am your candidate both of the issues you listed are important to the game so it stays true to its nature of being a place where you have to be careful no where is safe not even high sec high sec is just safer now i do back the removal of insurance for concorded kills it increases the expense of suiciding so that activity would decrease at the same time it teaches people who accidentally shoot people in high sec an expensive lesson that they will not forgetthe truth is you need to take matters into your own hands here is a video of my mining alt taking it to a can flipper still looking for a good video editoramber is on a rampagei cant sucker any more of the ninjas in dodixie to steal from me anymore i killed a pilgrim and a scrop and they stay away even my proteus sitting in a mission with the mwd on doesnt work they scan my site down and see its me and leave if you take care of yourself then they will leave you alonegood luck fly safeashina sitojita park csm thread

my campaign is pretty simple i intend to represent the interests of small to mid size industry corps as well as address the eternal struggle for balance between the carebears and the yarbears in empire spacei am a 6 year 5 account player that has participated in nearly every facet of eve including a trip to fan fest i am serious about the game but maintain a healthy perspective and differentiation between reality and evei seek to preserve and refine game balance and improve opportunities for the little guys and by assisting the small industry corps in thriving bolster the food chain for the predators sharks shouldnt be eating krill let the krill thrive and the sharks have more whales to eathere are a few of my talking pointsecurity adjustments in high sec that are more realistic in respect to the game environment and less artifacts of unfortunate game mechanics specifically i would seek to establish differentiation between the high sec system statuses ie there should be a noticeable difference between security in a 5 and security in a 10 there are already mechanics in place that would allow a more tangible security model included in this point are suicide ganking adjustments and ninja salvagingganking ganking should absolutely be allowed however i think that by adjusting where and how is can happen we could not only stifle the cries of the bears but also provide a more challenging and diverse prey group for the yarsninja salvaging this one is easy apply the same system of ownership to wrecks as to cans mutual shootage solves problemswriteable api elements and or a lightweight work safe training and monitoring client for adjusting training and monitoring market transactions and labfactory jobs this is more of a personal issue that i have found is shared by many i had a chance to talk with the author of capsuleer in the reykjavik airport returning from fan fest he gets a lot of feedback in this regard and is also pushing in this direction i intend to help outadjustments to lab slots in high sec to provide an option that lies between in station slots and a high sec research pos as part of a thriving carebear population to bolster the food chain there should be better access for them to lab slots what i propose would be a gateway to bigger industry i believe we can promote new industry corps without significantly affecting the bottom line of the larger corps this could be done by introducing some sort of module or service to noob players that offers slow limited research that isnt attractive to more advanced players or by providing a means of research in empire to the advanced players that would free up lab slots for the noobs high sec poss are possible in empire but so difficult to achieve standing wise that most empire moons sit empty opening this up a bit or providing a reasonable noncombat route to getting sufficient standing would help in this endeavori am not representing carebears or yars in particular i am representing both in the sense that one cannot survive without the other yars feed off of carebears that is a simple fact without things to pirate there are no pirates carebears do the boring work that creates the niche for the pirates to exploit i believe that a healthy carebear population means a rich pirate population there is a better balance to be had and i believe i can help find itsomeone give me a baby to kiss i am available in game or out for interviews or discussion drop me an evemail or convo me for further contact info or detailsquestions comments trolling and general flaming welcomeplease visit your user settings to reenable images
following a survey with very interesting results there where some things missing and some things needed further exploration so with not much further ado i present my second eve survey
the first survey is now filled to capacity which means 100 people participated in it its more than i expected but ofcourse its only a very tiny portion of the full population of eve but its the most that my current tools will allowthe second survey is coming along quite nicely even quicker than the first survey and at this speed itll be filled well before the end of the weeka big thank you to everyone whos participatingmore is sure to follow
i would request that anyone who is planning an event like interviews debates or something like dierdra vaals voter match service to contact the csms through an evemail in gameas a csm candidate we can not know of everyone out there that is doing something to educate the voters without you telling us about it i mentioned dierdra vaals voter matcher service by name for a reason at the same time she posted here in jita park she sent me and i assume all the rest of the csms an evemail telling us of what she was doingif you want the broadest level of csm participation then you need to make sure they are all notified of your event since every csm is a pilot in game an evemail should reach all of them equally thank you
im also available for an interview ill try to catch up with you ingame otherwise you can email me atahsekuawbtmonasterycomregardsahs
sent you an eve mail in game zarchlooking forward to the interview if we can hitch upcheers
the fact is a t2 af cost is around 40 millions and it can be beated by a 1520 millions t1 cruiser and if we put on plate that to fly an assault you need more skills that a t1 cruiser and that the assault should be a full combat ships thats really nosense ccp if 75 on afterburner is too much do something else but just do something for a ship class which also veteran players had to fly with honour by the way i think the 75 in speed was a great idea because an assault had to entering in battle without considering bs bc classes flying around seeking for other af or inty be carefull to interdictors destroyers maybe cruisers and webbers now the af is the primary target in a fleet because is the easiest ship to take down even bs lock and fire at you and when you said  ccp  using the speed as a way to fight you also said you are not considering frigates as a positive appoach to a fight from the moment you said thatalso giving to all minmatars ships the advantage to choose the range where to fight but thats not real a great problem giving a speed boost to af or frigate in general is not just a favor you do to us but it will create a better combat where ships classes will sit perfectly in their role

yes if they keep the draw back of 50 tracking and up the damage alot it would work wellccp have a month to implement changes and test them before dominion is deployed i know there is alot happening this expansion but this is a simple fix that can be heavily tested and deployed within this time frame come ccp give us our blasters back
supportthink of the blasters in eve as a shotgun in counter strike or halo you gotta move fast or blind side someone to really poon them aside the kdr being negative it sure is funnyin eve i do not feel this way with the blasters properties its either tank or gank of course you cant do both i know this but there could be an upper with tracking better hitsi dont know how to fix it but im sure yall can figure something outmy 2cents
worked for amarr
blasters do really need some fixing a tiny bit more damage a lot better tracking make gallente blaster ships the most agile will be relativated by platestrimarks anywaymakes for nicely working blasterboats in their current state i just stopped flying them
yes yes yesexactly what blasters need dont nerf lasers they work very well aprt from scorch ammo i mean wtfblasters need much much better trackingblasters need a slight boost to damage so that they are the heavy damage weaponblaster boats shouldnt have very high agility just slightly better base speed to close range seems as blaster boats usually are plated which slows them right down and just not fast enough to be nanod even though being very fast in a blaster boat makes you uselesscmon ccp get this fixed for dominion pleeeeeaaaase
lets do one better how about an auto repair attribute added i has a limited volume and bandwidth no drones are moved to the bay but they take up points in this attribute just as bandwidth is consumed when launching fightersdrones this would help limit the number of fighters and drones max that could be repaired without opening a new bay that could cause abuse the poor carrier pilots already juggle 3 bays lets not put a 4th one in there for them to watch over where did my 15th fighter go ah damn it was still in repair when i docked otherwise i agree to the idea especially for super carriers
i agree that destroyers need some love they are no longer the frigkillers they should be i like the idea of moving a high to a midlow and change to the 25 rof to 10 rof or complete removal
i began reading this a bit wary but am convinced that this would be a nice tweak this would be a good use of those wrecks left from standing speed runs
the key point in this is that it increases the chances of finding empty missions which is something the mission runners shouldnt complain about
i like this idea but i have question would this scan probe be a specialist probe with the possibility of having a specialist launchermore carebear tears though
supported  if they also fix flagging mechanics so i can actually shoot down ninja salvagers its risk vs reward not scan probes  t1 frigates vs reward thank you
i dont have issues with scanning wrecks that exist in space after a mission has been completed and the deadspace removed in that situation the missioner has abandoned the wrecks and anybody who can scanlocate the wrecks should be able to do with them as heshe pleaseswhere i have problems with scanning down wrecks is when the missioner is actively working a mission already its far too common to be in the middle of a mission killing rats tractoring wrecks and attempting to salvage all at the same time when some git shows up and starts salvagingif deadspace prevented wrecks from being scannable i could support your proposal
to fix something would have to be broke the flagging mechanices are not broken salvage does not belong to you and salvaging a wreck is therefore not stealing ccp has designed the game that way and has stated it many times if you dont like it i suggest you start another thread proposing that salvage has ownership rights not derail this one plus you mention risk vs reward but what exactly is the risk for the carebear highsec mission grinder these days very little is the answerand stop saying ninja salvager they have absolutly no relation to ninjas
no reason why it cannot be done
in light of ccps current stance toward salvaging changing flaggin mechanics is only trying to cure symptons of something that according to ccp is working as intended the salvage is not yoursin addition to that the current different proposal regarding salvaging and ownership rights always just and solely focussurround the issue from the its mine and its not point of stance to which ccp already took a decision which is it is not so rather than just optinglooking for new possibilities and changes ppl have so far just argued about something that already has been decided  malcom reynolds  jaynestown  firefly the changes i suggest are pointing toward a different direction namely making those wrecks that are really left behind  and imho there are more than enough of them in space not only in mission spots like motsu  and available to the salvager profession thus giving the salvager profession more options to find his salvage  and maybe even easierby making wrecks in none deadspace easier to scan as suggested from a salvager iskhour point of view there is no reason to further scan down a signal with just eg 40 when you already have a lock on a field of wrecks where you can warp to immediately and start salvaging right awaythe expanded probe launcher needs a higher skill level as well so the starting salvager could start his profession even at a lower skill level
supportedi would like to scan down unscannable t3 cruisers doing escalations in lo sec
if implemented in the way the original post suggests this would be a major step towards fixing the ninja salvage problem
im not a salvager and i never will be but i support the idea of scanning wrecks as this would imo make salvager a real mini profession and not a fake leech off of other professionthe only problem i can see with this is that it would make mission running in lowsec more dangerous wich isnt a good thing lowsec is almost completely devoid of any pve activity and this would just hammer the nail in the coffindespite that im still in favor of this as imo as soon as this is implemented a fix can be found also i believe lowec could do with an overhaul and this could be added in to the mix when that is done unless they decide to kill off lowsec that is
im fully aware of whats been stated and it makes perfect sense too i mean why would salvaging a wreck flag you to the corporation that shot it down when removing something from the same wreck does rightthe ownership issue has already been decided theres precisely two reasons why ccp is shying away from making salvaging a hostile act1 mission running in highsec has a considerably high iskhour value for relatively low risk2 it would involve additional codingyes missionrunning is relatively safe im not asking for it to be made safer but here we are and people are asking for easier access to wrecks which they can salvage with 0 risk involved so they can create extensive revenue from the use of t1 frigates and every time you mention flags aka risk they go up in arms because its unjustified or perhaps because then they would actually have to pay attention and have risk involved with making their iskthis is a ridiculous discussion and thats the end of it oh and before i forget it ninja salvager
i think wrecks should be scannable but not while the deadspace is active or atleast make it very difficult this opens up salvaging more as a profession without the need to ninja salvage  although that activity is not removedbut i also think the deadspace should dissipate between 3060 mins after the mission objective is completed rather than waiting until it is handed in
very good idea
login name is publicbut thats half your passwordwtf why hide it save the brute force password attacks
a good first step would be making it so that the items can be right clicked and purchased instead of having to search them individually by name
hi peoplei have made a pettiton for this idea and send it to ccp and they like it but they send me here to make this discusableand you willi also belief that alot of players will support it alsohere it comeshi therei have tought about sommething that i havend seen in the game yet and it would make life in evespace alot eassyer specialy for me i had the order of my ceo to pickup all the deliveries in space so i was one proud member that he pointed me for the jobtill i opend corp deliveries screen it scares me was a litlle crying to i had to visit 525 systems or maybe a bit more to pickup all that stuffa job for months but hUFFFD  the job will be done but i would be alot better if i could sorted all those deliverie assets by distance for example or separate and sorted them by region or cargovolume or kind of item etclike i can do in personal assets i hope you guys will give it a thought it can only make the game betterand i know becaus i have seen it changing sins it was launched in 2003still the best game on the marketkeep it up devsarin
whoawhat are you even trying to sayeditoh i see changed to support
your not my father and no your not anakin so dont order me aroundmhh good idea filtering options is always good i approve this makes deliveries easierhe said his ceo ordered him to pick up stuff he was happy cause his ceo trusted him when he looked in the deliveries hangar our victim here cried cause there was too much to deliver and hes stuck with it so hes asking for something easier to manage so with some filtering options based on items distance and so this would make it easier just like your personal assets windowthat said the deliveries if i remember right doesnt have lots of filter options if none
easy solution steal the stuff youre supposed to collect that way your ceo will no longer trust you you wont get these kind of jobs and you wont have to cry when looking at the corp assets tab dbut yes i support filtering options

i read all but some i may have missed so if i repeat anything forgive me my suggestions for sounds and notificationsfirst and foremost i think it would be great to have any statis changes to ships and ship functions accompanied by a voice notification including but not limited to warp disruptions stasis fields and anything that would change the normal function of the ship i am not sure how much of a burden that would be but it shure as hell wuld be awesomesecond i feel the ambient sounds are fine but i know others would like more added so i would request an option to alter sounds maybe a toggle for advanced sounds and notificationsalso if possible it would be great to have warnings to anounce hostlesin the area
give voice back to tutorials looking text bored not helpfall so voice tutorials b big help and voice for cargo say you r 75 fall and voice tell you eating hull dmg
oh yeah supporting this oneespecially drone launching hotkey bindingjust something to do exactly the same as right click  launch allperhaps setting key binding to launching specific drone subgroupsa bit of a problem with key bindings is how the chat log is set to intercept any standard key strokes pretty much restricting them from being bound without using ctrl or alt etc perhaps being able to set chat start as enter key type your msg enter key to send your msgmaybe just have this as an togglable option not default this would allow for much quicker binding use easier binding use and more key options for bindingtherefor opening up more things to be boundif the last half of all that is already implemented and i am just blindnever seen it please disregard my ignorance
i support this wholeheartedly
would be awesome to have shortcuts for different overview settings so you can quickly switch between different ones supported
in fact keystrokesbindings are easier to macro than mouse clicks as mentioned by ccpjust the above could be keybinded into a macro by a few programmable currently all available keyboards and would allow ppl to auto pilot through lowsecalthough i would love a lot of more keybinds myself alter orbit distance by keys im very doubtfull that we will see this in the near futureas currently to vague and to easy to exploited proposal i can not support this but might support a more detailed one that would not be open to be abused to easy
mouse click macros on icons that are on a fixed position on the screen are pretty easy to do already thats why im talking about adding shortcuts to those buttons that are already available as quick actions in the overviewand the solution against macros is clearly not to build a bad ui since some already use them anywayby the way i found a post similar to mine and actually richer here
i think this would be a useful and intresting feature for eve
i didnt notice that cause i didnt have to deal with it but it needs to be change if its like deliveries it is
for a long time now mwds have not been usable in most deadspaces this was implemented as a pve nerf and in this regard it has been successful unfortunately it has also hampered pvp efforts in deadspaces as an opportunity to refit an ab upon finding a player in a deadspace is not always presenti propose that mwds simply behave more like abs in deadspace rather than transforming into the equivalent of an empty slot primarily this would involve reducing the speed bonus for mwds inside deadspaces to the same seen from an ab and perhaps eliminating the sig radius penalty the mwd would still not be optimal for deadspace with its higher fitting and cap penalties but at least it would still provide a bonus
i am sorry but mwds already work in most plexes ever tried it lately even some missions support them now
i was aware of that i suppose an alternate solution would be to make them work in all deadspaces in my experience they do not work in missions with acceleration gates sometimes not even at the first accel gate they also do not work in many lvl 5 missions that do not even have accel gatesbasically there is no excuse for the module to become absolutely useless inside any deadspace

this change would primarily impact available resources in two different areas to drastically different degreesit is true that this could be implemented in a way that adds very little extra work for the server while true custom paint jobs would add significant resource usage as proposed previously this could be avoided by restricting the levels of customization this change could easily be implemented with little impact on the usage of server resources or our own bandwidth usagethe problem however is the effect that this would have on local resource usage your computer has to load modelsskins for every object in your area which it then uses to render the image that you see on your screen you dont have to be a computer scientist to understand that if there are more unique modelsskins that have to be loaded more resources will be used for such and thus we are presented with an unavoidable tradeoff the maximum quality of rendering is decreased by greater diversity of objects to be rendered the more unique modelsskins you have the lower the end graphical quality of each rendered object will be eve is lucky in this regard as it is able to skip trees grass etcso it is not a matter of whether or not this can be done but whether it should be done at some point we have to find a balance between unique ship modelsskins and their graphical quality it is for this reason that i do not support this proposal  i feel that we should devote our available resources to a game with as many unique ships as possible rather than the same ships with different paint jobs whatever balance we decide on any resources used to make otherwise identical ships simply look different takes away from what could have been more unique ship types with the introduction of strategic cruisers ccp seems to agree with me a big thumbs down
the choice of where and for whom you do your missions greatly influences the possible gains  and it should stay that way if you allowed them to be traded over you would see people massively grinding lps in safety in empire then running to a 00 lp store to cash in on the rarer items they sell therein short it would totally kill lowsec00 missioningnot supported

diversity is good then gives light neutron blasters a base dps of 5000 and other guns a base dps of 2 thats diverse
i think its amusing she managed to get you to troll your own thread with something that ridiculousand not supported shield tanking is fine the way it is if you need more midslots you always have the option of flying a ship that has more
you know this isnt really helping your cause
tax on lp so the corporation make buy stuff out lp shop
im going to the point without introducing useless words about this idea 1 hislot rig 1 medslot rig 1 lowslot rigdrawback yes 10 less cpu and pwg
will 1 rig give you plus in all 3 areaswhat if you already have 8 slots somewhereand btw the pg drawback should be 20 if you get 3 extra slots
so youve gotten the best fit on your ship and have 10 cpu or pg to spare  more for another slot
i like the idea butthe drawback need to be extremely high 30 slot layout is one of the major balancing points when ships are createdtweaked so should not be addedremoved willynillyex i train the rig skill to 5 and can very easily create a five midslot armageddon or an eight highslot dominix suffering just 10 cpugridbecause you would need to make the drawback so debilitating to prevent massive imbalances across all hulls there is little point to it to begin withit would also make navy ships kind of obsolete since a good deal of their power comes from the extra slots they get
right but youve missed out one very important detail amarr ships have more grid than any other ships in eve so stop whining and go back to playing scorch onlinethread
i too load scorch into my tachys
oh shi facepalm ok i hate you now
sure we need this
agree
mr sokratesz where do you stand on the alliance disbanding factorwill u be pushing for there to be a vote or a 24h grace period to disband alliance
i was under the impression that ccp had already fixed this but the recent cva trouble proved otherwise im kind of torn between the following two argumentspro spies need a place in eve and alliances need to secure themselves against it  its part of human nature and diplomatics and has made eve famous in the past so it should not be removedcon its a shame that years of work can end like thati would be against an alliance disband requiring a majority vote because that would make it 100 foolproof but something like a grace period of 12 or 24 hours not too long though in which a majority vote can overrule an initiated disband by one of the executors would seem a solution that means executors have to pay attention and if spies succeed in a thorough infiltration or elusion it would still be possible
an original  interesting workaround that does at least appease both sides of the argumentyou do appear to be the pvpers politician for this campaign moving on where do you stand on present factional warfare mechanics the ability for say alliances to war dec individual corps in a militia without fear of retribution from associated militia corps for example the star fraction factor although i am sure there are other alliances who practise the same methods
well you have to admit that in the end pvp is what makes eve tick without it the producers would be out of a job and missionrunners out of a market for their lp and named loots if you have suggestions for the industrial side carebear sounds so derogatory please let them hear because i have little to do with that side of the game in daytoday eve myself but improvements to it are needed as much as to anything else in the game i do not intend to ignore the large amount of players that enjoy eve like that but my experience there is limited so i may need a little more help i read a bit about that and indeed it sounds wrong but i dont think ccp anticipated on it in this particular case i would be for treating the militia as an alliance only to the degree that the militia members can initiate combat with the wardeccing entity without concord intervention but not the other way around ergo the wardeccing entity can only shoot the specific corp they decced unless one fo the other militia members intervenes by agression or rr then they are free to shoot back at them too this way deccing a corp in a militia becomes a more risky enterprise but with a potential for a lot of targets
another interesting response a very lateral way of thinking on the matter that again appeases both sides of the issue without necessarily unbalancing the mechanic to stop larger player alliances becoming too heavily involved
out of the current csm crop very few candidates caught my eye and you were one of them about 4 actually so yeah you made my short list hehei happen to remember you pretty vividly even from your earlier days and we never got into eachothers hair too much on anything that really matter so that in my book means youre either thinking mostly the same way i am or youre reasonable enough to understand something when toldso far so good until now you only raked up plus points now however we come to the tricky partyoure mostly a pvporiented player and your personal interests reflect that as admitted by you personally and also highlighted by the items you chose to address in the interview and most of the items on your pdf listwhen presented with a limited number of issues you will have to pick a few to dedicate yourself to so im asking myself  would you bother pushing things that ccp hasnt touched in ages in spite of people posting endlessly about it  or would you bother picking things that are heavily economyoriented as opposed to combatoriented for instance theres an upcoming change in dominion that will affect everybody even if most dont even realize it yet and from where im standing ccp looks like its about to make a huge mistake and it could take a while after patch before its noticed let alone corrected what would you do if elected to make fixing it if it will actually be needed of course a top priority  i mean even if its not yet insanely obvious but it could become nasty in the future you know things like that
i saw your thread about the moons and reallyi want to know what ccp has to say on that because it sounds like were all gonna be in a world of pain p i was very tempted to add an item about moon minerals to my list however i decided to wait until dominion before suggesting anything  if your predictions are even half accurate it will require ccp to take action on the matter in cases like that it helps that crazy people like you spend lots of time documenting the issues and i would be more than glad to help ccp become aware of it and help formulate a solution

you are quick to judge saying that i havent thought my post scanning is indeed very hard to set up and may never be allowed or done but still something that may stop hack rtm and so onfor bpobpc maybe the structure cannot be change as it is but every patch ccp adds content and solve problems therefor they may find a way to change this maybe by totally changing the database status of bpo and bpc that seems to be the problem as far as i know concerning agents i may be wrong but what ccp originally wanted was to have empire for training and tradecommercial issues low sec for pirates and 00 space for everybody with more then 6 month game experience the last 3 extension are rUFFFDvUFFFDlating of their goal  send people to low sec and nullspacei dont think im wrong when i say that most dev have said numerous times that thats the way it should already betherefor moving nice isky running agents to lowsec and null space would rebalance the as they want it

lately i have been thinking about how adjustments to a game can change the gamei came to the conclusion that all game balance proposals as opposed to interface changeslike larger font is how they create incentives for playersfor example ccp wants more people in 00 but instead of just saying to players go to 00 they are trying to give the current residents a reason to welcome the new massesor in a conversation i had yesterday a friend who participates in faction warfare said there were a lot of things he felt were wrong with fw specificallya plexing for system controlb incentives for controlling a system because right now there isnt onewhat he said rocked me back on my heels what should the reward be how what should it be rewarded for capturing or holdingthe first things to acknowledge is that there is no fairness policy in fw the sides arent externally balanced ie only x players from each faction are allowed to participate in a given incident for example all of the caldarigallente contested systems are held by the state if for no other reason than caldari has more pilotsso a reward akin to rd agents is inappropriate ie each day your faction holds a system you get points of some sort and whatever the bonus is it shouldnt make it harder for opposition to reclaim a system ie no home field advantagemy next thought was a slight increase in rewards for killing other faction player ships but again that seems to unfairly favor larger population factionsthen i thought maybe a discount on repair charges for ships if the repairs are done in a contested system your side holds it is small enough to not be unfair but it rewards system ownership but is it so small to not be worth fighting foranother thought is special science and industry facilities in contested systems maybe ones that charge militia lp as part of their costthis is an example of what i can offer csm goal based thinking with incentive based solutions
sounds like you need a job in corporate finance
either that or he realizes that in an ideal and fully maneagable world such as one in a game it doesnt make sense not to create something that does not do what it should do systemoriented thinking ftw
i have a question if you increase interactiveness of minging then what happens to those people who prefer to mine because then they can chat with their friends at the same time because mining can be done without paying too much attention to itim certainly not saying that i dont want to see mining become more interesting but i do recognise a symbiosis between semiafk activities like mining and players desire to interact with other players would you opt for a less intensive type of mining mechanic so this can still occur or would you prefer to seperate the two

i know i am going to get worked over for this but loltheres a tiny bit of a point in this guys issue dont get me wrong suicide ganking is a realistic facet of the game from the perspective of reality in eve but i dont think suicide ganking should be banned but i do think it needs to be tuned to make it riskier for the ganker in some high sec levels like you might get that 2bil isk score but its going to cost you more than a crappy t1 fit stabber and a security hit that you can get back with running a few missionsi think the valid portion of the carebare complaint here could be addressed by tuning suicide ganking in lets say 8 and higher systems for example you gank a ship in one of these systems and you take a sec hit that bans you from those systems in that faction space until you can recover standings that doesnt stop you from ganking that fenrir loaded with 2bil isk in jita but you cant make ganking freighters in jita a profession what you could do though is camp the 7 sides of 8 gates sounds fair to melook at it just from a balance perspective a couple of pilots in crap ships can make billions in a few minutes by ganking what is the noncombat analog to balance that out i challenge anyone to even come close and under current mechanics they can do that a couple times a week by alternately running missions to keep standing upyarbears complain that carebears want things to be easier for them mining in particular but when you look at how much even a high skilled empire crew can make mining vs what they could make ganking one well loaded freighter now who has it easy i say the scavengers and gankers have a waaaay easier time in high sec than the miners and people who disagree usually dont have any better counter argument than thats eve and maybe thats it maybe eve isnt supposed to make logical sense in some areas maybe the uber religious amarr empire doesnt have a problem with organized groups of minmatar pirates ringing stations in amarr prime and baiting or ganking amarr citizens doesnt make a lot of sense but maybe maybe thats the question that needs to be answered is jita for example a crocodile infested watering hole in the kalahari or is it the commercial hub of an advanced civilization if the latter then there shouldnt be so many crocodiles and lions ccp has made it a point to promote people moving to 00 psuedo faction alliances and real pvpers already operate there primarily carebears dont carebears that go there either dont stay long or learn to deal the inverse is pvpers that live in high sec i use quotes because its hard to call someone that ganks indys and noobs cruiser mining a pvper 00 is self correcting high sec isnt currently low sec is supposed to be a buffer between 00 and high sec but there really isnt much difference between 00 and low sec as far actual expectation of security goes nor is there much difference between 5 and 10 that is what needs to be tuned not for the carebears but for the sake of realism and balance you want to pirate high sec fine but if you want to do it in the highest sec core and home systems its going to cost you more than a ship and a minor sec hit maybe its a massive sec hit a fine or maybe concord pods you maybe some combination of all of themcan flipping leave it as is if you are jetcan mining you will get flipped but at least when that happens you have the option to shootninja salvaging needs to be fixed i think the same mechanics that currently apply to jet cans should apply to salvage mutual shootagelet the carebears thrive in some portion of high sec and the benefits of that will trickle down and out its impossible for that to be contained it would absolutely bleed out to places where it could be exploited to probably even greater effect than nowlet the flaming begin
as candidate id favor giving all players so much to do that end game players if there were such a thing but be far too busy to waste time on starting players id be completely against restricting freedoms  but i would be for creating a realistic universe where no player would want to gank i disfavor restricting freedom i favor increasing choice and opportunity
can you give some examples of what you would give people to do thats an easy statement to make but a lot harder to backup with something tangibleits my opinion that there is plenty to do but that certain factors that currently exist in the game breed a class of path of least resistance players people who look for the quickest money option to exploit even if it means not really following the spirit of the game no matter what options are presented there will always be people who find it easier to take advantage of the loopholes and weaknesses in designeve is the wild west for sure but there are still places where law and order would logically be upheld someone compared it to firefly i think thats true but even in firefly you had the core planets the reavers werent just floating around every planet waiting for ships to launch right now as i see it the storyline and the mechanics are in conflict either there are powerful governments that rule over the empire regions or there arent if there are then they wouldnt likely allow people to randomly blow each other up in high powered war vessels outside their stations for any reason you blow up a 300 meter long ship a couple of kilometers from a space station and you have crap flying everywhere even if its not a danger to the station to have a chunk of hurricane the size of a house hit it theres still the hazard to navigation from the debris floating everywhere dominion should go a long way toward making the stuff to do that currently exists more accessible which is certainly a step in the right direction and it would also open the door to changes in empire that werent practical before the changes that i propose only work within dominion otherwise it would potentially alienate an entire class of player in favor of another by pushing them out of a sizable portion of empire without many options to make up for itand maybe you are right maybe after dominion there will be options both easy enough and profitable enough for the ganker types to take advantage of outside of empire my platform is first and foremost about game balance within the empire food chain there will always be new issues in that regard so the specific issues arent as important as the overall concept i have taken major hits in eve as a direct result of things we are talking about and i am still playing ive seen the game evolve since 03 the one constant is that people will complain no matter what you do and since its a pay to play game ccp has to listen to the largest group complaining but pretty often people will argue against a change that would benefit them just because they arent in a position to visualize the effects or because they fear changethen again some people deciding on change are blind to the cliff they are running toward time will tell right now if feels like the game has stagnated into endless 00 territory swaps and ubiquitous high sec hub scam and gank routines seem that ccp has recognized that and is actively addressing the factors that caused it i feel like i have something to contribute to that processwhatever the case this is hands down the best mmo i have played flaws and all

i think you are overestimating csms reach and have wrong assumptions on csms roleto what end are they just going to be another sort of module or an upkeep cost crew wageswhat does this even mean is this like how some games allow people to pay for bonus experience multipliers if it is i think sp in a can is going to flat out rejectedgoogle dust 514a lot of these sound like would be cool options but perhaps dont add to the game
what does this even mean is this like how some games allow people to pay for bonus experience multipliers if it is i think sp in a can is going to flat out rejectedsp i a can whatever that is  hell no i am suggesting that the current game is quite onesided in its scope and i conclude it might have some trouble competing with other franchises of course established players wont give a flying hoot about that  it may be that some in the current established player base want the game to not grow contrary to ccps business interests i strongly suggest those players to not vote for me i want this game ten times as big five years from now in real numbers so as for powerplay a somewhat diffuse subject  id summarize it as adding some strategy game or trade game or maffia game or sim city aspects to the franchise this is possible and it would attract more potential gamers to the eve franchise without forcing existing players to dont do anything they dont want but if such a thing were implemented it would have bloody implications to the franchise  old timers would for instance be royally ed off if their docking times doubled because of some kind of annoying labor dispute bullplease visit your user settings to reenable imagesi am aware that designing and programming and integrating and finally balancing such an addition is a conceptual nightmare for ccp games however if it somehow dawns on these people that if they can tie this in with robust ambulation and complex gameplay on stations including talking with npcs and missions then hell yah they might start seeing some serious increase in subscriber numbers currently the game involves flying a spaceship trading fitting ships in traditional game design terms that is a 3d game half point  click strategy game it isnt a shooter and fleet game the trading part is a very simple trade game the fitting is a puzzle game sort of there arent very few other gameplay elements in the game unless you count mining and well if thats the case id call that a bit limited in dimension and depth now you think of a few boardgames you really like and try and visualise  how could you shoehorn that into eve lets take monopoly that would fit in the above example of powerplay almost instantaneously  players investing in real estate on established stations some investments would be purely about making money by cornering markets that would in turn be based on selling a product  so what if other parts of the game would involve cutting off supply lines of such products an investor would be left paying for factory upkeep without being able to produce any deliciously creamy quafe for the local markets google dust 514i am aware of dust514 and have been quite some time since before it left stealth as you may have noticed dust514 covers planets right now and it involves characters id love seeing that expanded to a large range of robots mechs cyborgs replicants androids droids veccs biodroids drones microform swarms id love seeing players explore spacestructures in zero g conditions id love seeing players develop skills in not merely open doors such as laser carbine  but how about stuff such as laser reflective armor specialisation or cover maximization or small team tactical movement increase  pardon me but this realm of expansion equates several ten million skill points and more poignantly it might also equate an appreciably bigger player base growth
ill be brief on this topic by inviting you to have a look or a wiki at the designs of liftport group and gerald k oneill in short an sf game in space has vast potential for introduction of concepts and both habitats skyhooks and massive solar arrays do not conflict the current genre and would enrich it  regard it like this players can construct a massive several mile big smallest to tens of miles huge cylinder and spin it like a centrifuge inside it would potentialy be verdant and lush surface area and if you read geralds book quite pleasant a place to live too now regard this habitat as an investment opportunity one that costs a load of money and yields a steady income say a corporation constructs one and it benefits them mightily now theyd also have to defend it a skyhook is a cable from a planetary surface to geo this concept flies in the face of what many people believe possible or plausible yet the rw liftport group claims they can build one on this earth maybe before 2030 if they are right they would decrease launch costs for sending stuff to space to tens of thousands per pound to hundreds per pound if they can pull that off they would kickstart an industrial explosion with growth rates in the double digits for centuries this idea if you look at it critically is so compelling it would be hard to believe the major planets arent bristling with dozens of skyhooks sure i can think of a few explations why not but i can also come up with a bunch of descriptions that would make the game a good deal more interesting why they woulda lot of these sound like would be cool options but perhaps dont add to the gameyah well i heard that a few times to some players a game is something with a start a smooth attention curve a culmination and an end a game is something conceptually confines and constrained if you adhere to that game philosophy a game is something that is limited and yes i would probably have the desire to see in eve or anywhere else something that is no longer a game call it everything game worlds where you have vastly more options than any single player can ever hope to explore in my ideal mmorpg id love seeing a gameplay experience where each individual player would have like in real life have to really choose what to do because in the game thered be more things to do than he has days in his lifetime i have written a small kinder gentler pdf on this topic with a few brief speculations on various possible avenues and why they would be of use to ccp games  by and large i would like seeing something like this emerge and since i am really smitten by the rather ingenuous design architecture of eve id really really love seeing ccp implement it here and as soon as possible if they dont some other gaming company will eventually tackle this challenge and my ideal situation would be it were not someone like lucas arts the reason i say this is because i am not all that happy about the americancentric design style and intellectual cowardice of some companies  and i really believe that in fifteen years the market for mmorpgs can be well in the hundred millions range id really really love seeing a gifted company like ccp have over ten million in a decade pdf

uh no waylasers take a  bag of cap to fire most amarr ships arent even cap stable only firing their guns the hybrid capacitor usage is just too small for it to be able to focus energy that far or in this case launch something increasing their damage or range will make the alreadyoverpowered gallente battleships even more overpowered
i agree blasters need a boost either more range or more punch medium blasters need more range for sure
youre all forgetting that blaster gunships usually have a superior drone bay for example the zealots 0 drone bay the sacrileges 1515 band drone bay vs the ishtars 125250125band and the deimos 50if gallente weapons were just as versatile as lasers what would the amarr have
and the ishtar has more or less 0 guns and the deimos is just pure broken whether used with blaster or railguns
agreed im tired of seeing pvp noobs flyin around in caldari ships with fof missiles and do afk pvp cause my deimos cant lay down damage from even abit of range especially with t2 blaster ammosupported
in general throw a role bonus375 web strength increase what makes 60 webs 75 webs on dedicated blaster shipsthorax diemos brutix astarte mega hype and balance from therewhat only leaves minor things you will end up with good solo ships deadly close range pvp machines and make them own at short range again instead of being only handy caped with range simply the same thing you had pre qr
lets see void 25 range 50 tracking speed 50 falloff 25 cap and iirc also slows the boats overall speed when loadedgreat formula for disaster when flying a blaster boat
hey csm memberswhere do you all stand on this onecurious as to wether or not this will make it to your recommendations sectionany info is appreciated
i think these should have the hp boosted by about 200 they are just 2 paper thin sig radius too big and too slow to be any good at anything 2 destroyers should be able to take out atleast a cruiser possibly a t2 frigate of some description at this point they could be removed from the game and i dont think anyone would miss them
bump for great justice
qfteven if the ev and er on rockets is fixed theyll still be pretty failid be happy to leave them as they are now but double the damage as this makes for a far more interesting weapon that would do high damage but only in the right situationsimply changing them to a weapon what does low damage but will inflict it every hit does not make interesting gameplay or promote teamwork
something along these lines would make for a useful security measure i would even suggest going so far as some sort of verification requirement to unlock characters ie security questions etc
i think this proposal would only help abandoned lvl 4 mission wrecksseems like when i plan to salvage a lvl 4 mission a salvager often comes in and starts on the wrecks when im in the middle of the mission i dont always plan to salvage missions even lvl 4s when im grinding reputation or lp recently when i was on my reputation grind in lvl 2  3s i rarely seen one when i did theyd quickly warp off without salvaging returning a type of deadspace cover for active missions is interesting ccp would have to make everything harder to scan in deadspace or theyd just scan down the dronesships
first heh thanks for bringing back one of my topic threads from before second yes wrecks should only be scanable by combat probes be generally kinda hard and only possible outside of a deadspaceit would in fact make it possible to probeout t3 ships in lowsec whatever thats what cloaks and observant players are for plus sifting through a systems wrecks to find one active player is not good odds if you want to do that more power to youthis idea overall is and always has been designed to give the ninja salvager a target other than players in active missions if someone chose to continue to invade missions to salvage for the tears then thats their choice but economically they have other places they can beunlike nowkrumps ninja salvagers go after bs wrecks and if they see youre running a l2 or l3 will just skip it for another persons mission its their efficiency calculation
i agree with op
it make too easy scanning people in missions even if the deadspace effect was restored doing encounterexploration sites and so on beside the small problem required by adding sensor strength to all wrecks and at the same time it will create a quantity of signals that will mask ship without wrecks nearby if they have 0 sensor strength any probe will get a 100 hit at first try size0 sensor strength  infinite signature
actually i was thinking more of using core probes allowing this at one skill level earlier and thus with the core probe launcher already to keep combat probes for intact ships onlyi do also think that the skill requirements for the different probes are kinda mixed upthe core probes should be useable at astrometics just like now lvl i the deep probes at iii which is now at v and the combat at 5  now at iand i would move the expanded probe launcher skill requirement from astrometics ii to iii as wellthis would distinguish the dedicated salvager  being able to scan directly for wrecks  from those that are looking for ships
you cant divide by zero and in the case of eve will most likely cause a server crash or may result in a notanumber value so anything with a signal strength of zero would have to be handled differently from the normal algorithm
good stuff badly needed
this just this
fix this plz
i hope this issue gets looked into also i hope that federation faction gets boost to be in line with amarr
amarr navy reactor controlsgallante navy railguns less dps than the t2 version if spec  lvl4 or more the caldari ones have more range so theyre ok i guessrepublic fleet shield boosters same as t2 but less per boost and shorter cycle
you forget that the dominationrf items use less cap are much easier to fit which perfectly fits with the ships

daily flog for one of the bestmost ignored ideas here
i think the biggest problem with eves ui is the fact that its just got too many buttons if you reduce the buttons and make the ui slimmer and more streamlined it will only add to the enjoyment of the gamethe second factor id like to throw into the mix is one of accessibility you all know it as that annoying thing that happens when you hit shift 5 times really fast well by introducing more keyboard shortcuts you will make eve an easier game to play for people with disabilities eve isnt the most fast paced game in the world and i would imagine it would draw a lot of people with a mild to major physical disability in i think if u can do it in a right click menu you should be able to bind a key to it
the amount of resources used should be directly proportional to the amount of objects around you data so yes fleet battles will take more resources to record than say a small skirmish depending on eves underlying data structure even objects such as asteroids could add to the recording loadproposed solutions a use active overview settings filter on which data is recorded fights involving more than a given number of total ships fleet battles could be recorded server sidethe cutoff for which fleet battles are recorded server side should be related to the potential point at which it becomes impractical for a players personal computer to record the battle adequately maybe these fights could be linked in the news feeds
yeah had a corpmate leave us about 100 mil of stuff by accident when he canned the character unfortunately it was in jita 44 and we had to let it go would be nice to see this get changed

i sympathize with you pirates just have it too tough and its not like they had a choice to enter into their career pirates should have carebears lining up to be canflipped podded or otherwisesarcasmthey call it deadspace for a reason you cant warp to other locations in the same deadspace or around it so why would a mwd work there yes pirates have special items to allow them to use mwds but they cheat anyways so it doesnt matterif the tractor beam is going too fast for you to retrieve the loot use a smaller faster ship if youre trying to kite learn to do that on an ab if you have the wrong equipment switch and come back in either case live with the way the game worksnot supported
how exactly would allowing a mwd to yield the same effective bonuses as an ab be any different than just using an ab it would probably still be worse assuming any penalties are retained higher cap usage higher fitting requirements etci do live with the way the game works but its dumb i thought that is what this forum was for to point out changes that canshould be madethe negative effects that i have listed were never the intention of limiting mwd usage in deadspaces this was implemented to make missions more difficult at least at that time mwds made many missions too easy the effects this has had on pvp in deadspaces is an entirely unintended side effect of thisthis is not a request to buff pirating etc it is a request to remove tedium
this seems like a fairly reasonable change

a toggle button would obviously make this more practical although i suspect anyone who has sound turned off would also have this turned offagain any resources used to make otherwise identical ships simply look different takes away from what could have been more total unique ship types do you really want custom paint jobs more than additional t3 shipssubsystems
i do understand your point but i really would rather have more personal already existing ships than new and incredibly expensive ships
i do not feel that adding color variants to existing ships would delay or in anyway effect development of t3 ships its not the same as creating new ships youre simply changing the shade of the existing texture this is almost no work for either server or clientthe only proposal which has a lag stamp is the addition of corp insignias and designs on ships color variants would not add any lag either client side or server side the main problem with this particular issue is getting enough people to take it seriously and get it implemented there are no actual technical problems id guess ccps programmers could implement everything and make it optional in one night
just add it two simple recolouring options the hull colour the colour of the lights
soprophecy is broken and we would like to fix itoriginal post in sm can be found herebasically what we are proposing is that the prophecy takes on 3 major changes  1 missile hardpoints maybe leave 1 turret2 energy turret capacitor bonus changed to ham rof3 extra cpu in order to fit the launchers and ballistic controls if desired
also the thanatos theyre getting to be a real pain to look at all the time
i dont think people should be able to trade lp but i would like lp to be empire faction based and not corp based so you could run missions for many different corps but the lp would all go into a pool which can be used on any corp in a particular empire
that would make the differences in lp stores meaningless they are almost identical now if anything they should be more differentiated
but trading lp isnt meaningless
agree nice but does not work within the game concept do a few more missions with your old corp and buy something
this not supported

also need a factory use role that doesnt include the ability to cancel all the corp jobs

below is something i devised a very long time ago however i honestly doubt ccp would ever entertain the thought of doing thislien protocol v217items required to initiate a lienplex  2lien amountopen character slot on the lending account  1a lien would work like a contract in eve however the interface would be through account management two parties would agree on a lien amount and repayment time frame this contract is accepted out of game under the account management screen here the information can be verified and the person taking the lien will be required to enter hisher account password to confirm once accepted the plex is locked to the lenders account for the course of the lien should the requester default the plex will be consumed during the auto transfer in this case the plex is consumed as the transfer fee should the person pay all monies back as per the contract the plex will be returned to the lender during the course of the contract one unused character slot will be unavailable to the lenderrepayment of the lien would work in the same fashion as redeeming a 60d gtc today using the secure system the player with the lien would simply click a pay lien button and the isk would be debited from his eve account the contract would close and both players would received a in game mail as notificationthis process helps ccp with consuming the overabundance of plex on the open market gives players a more unique system for extending loans and creates a new depth to the game previously unknown
i just had this idea for making exploration more interesting im not sure if anything like this has been proposed already but if you know it has please link itfirst of all the problem wisky space is too safe anybody that lives in an unknown system knows this and its because most of the people that are motivated to take you out cant actually find you and most of the people that can find you or should we say stumble upon you are not motivated enough to engage in anything costly so a corporation is probably safer in wspace than anywhere else in evenow for the wish we all want the exploration profession to get more depth the probing system is awesome but after you do it for a couple of million times its not that interesting unless all that probing can actually amount to somethingand finally the solutionill go from top to bottom so read till the end for details give explorers a way to plot a course through wspace so that they can reach any given system it should be an in game mechanic and it should involve player personal skillsimilar to probing but not in the same way it should also make use the experience you gather meaning that the more time you spend doing it the better you get also if you stop doing it for a while you loose your edge and go back to where you startednow further details there are two things that i propose implementing for achieving this signature prediction and unknown space mapping signature prediction means that you can analyze a signature in order to predict where it spawns next you could maybe get not just the next spawn but a few of them each time with a decreasing level of accuracy the mapping part could mean that you can create a map of the area you have visited it should be a temporary map as the systems move out of place in time but it should help you find patterns that signatures could take thats considering that signatures jump in a certain way maybe between systems at a certain distance or something like that mapping would also help you get somewhere if you know whats the target system area lets say you should be able to find out if youre getting closer or further from ita few random thoughts it might be too much for one person to handle something like finding a sure way to a system in reasonable time by reasonable i mean a few days maybe a week so maybe cooperation between people each relaying information to the others in a certain area so the more people you get spread out the bigger your map gets predicting whs wouldnt be completely accurate for example if the wh dies early because of mass it wont go to where you expected it to go so you could have something like a multiple possibility scenario where a chain of events might take you where you want but another might not it could include having to collapse a wh on purpose at a certain time to get it where you need it cyno jumps might be possible if you have the thing mapped well enough there could also be failed jumps where your fleet ends up in a near by systemif you dont get 100 lock or whatever and you still want to take the riskso what is all of this good for  well imagine corporations you can hire to give you a sure way from one null sec system to another like the enemys back yard maybe also wh wars where people would go after wspace colonists because they found out how rich they got it opens up the thing to a whole range of possibilities and ultimately it makes you feel like all that probing you did for a meager high sec exit isnt wastednekreps im not suggesting any changes to the way whs are now nor am i suggesting for it to be possible to map all the unknown systems there should be just enough there for people to navigate through itmeaning go wherever they want not where the wind takes them
increase it in recruitment chat i personally find recruitment one of the harder things to do ingame if youre a ceotying our hands with a 5 min cool down to reply to recruitment threads makes that job harder now instead of being able to sort through the posts and reply to them in one session  youre force to constantly go back and find where you left off if you can and continue the recruitment chat ingame really sucks and over the 5 years ive played the game find it is a poor way to get recruits
no shield and armor tanks are supposed to be different the current sets seem entirely reasonable to me
yeah its a real pain to dock up switch ships and have my orbit button set at the wrong range theres a big difference between how the orbits on a blaster ship and a rail ship should look and i dont always have time to type 15000 into the stupid little dialog box between undocking and combat
this and also offices and impound and such
thats like saying rockets are fine just fly a ship with more low slots so you can fit more bcs or fly a ship with more high slots so you can fit more rocketsit demonstrates than any counterarguments based on some vague idea of diversity are ridiculous
not really because rockets are inherently unbalanced at the moment they do too little damage to be really useful theyre called roflkets for a reason shield tanking active since thats what you seem to be most concerned with on the other hand is already balanced against the tanking types  and changing the ship you fly to better adapt to a particular type of tanking is a valid option
the whole point of this thread is to show that active shield tanks are imbalanced because of the lack of decent rigs answering thats not true shield tanking is balanced isnt really productiveas for sba id fully support the introduction of ara armor repair amplifier if shield boost amount rigs are introduced
but youre failing to show that shield tanking is unbalanced the lack of a rig doesnt make them unbalanced it makes them different those are not the same thing all youve said is these rigs dont exist make them without offering any convincing arguments why theyre needed except for the fact that they dont exist
i realize they are trying to make some progress with the epic mission story arcs but that doesnt go far enough and everyday missions could use some work as wellthis thread is not for repeating the common spam of lolmissions missions give too many rewards or missions are boring this is for improving the mission systemproblemmissions while i enjoy them could very easily be improved upon today they are more or less static with some possible random variations on certain missionsalso theres some discrepancy on things such as storyline missionssolutionsa number of things can be done below are some ideas1 storyline missions are currently given out every 16 missions and are in fact not storylines usually they are one off missions for the purpose of giving good rewards and faction standings  make storyline missions actual storylines take the cosmos or epic arc approach when you get a storyline mission give it several missions perhaps each of which giving slightly better rewards with the last one a faction standings boost im not asking for better rewards for my missioning but calling a short mission where i turn in some ore i bought a storyline not only doesnt make sense but is completely unimaginative2 make missions make you choose if you are flying for caldari navy for example yes gallente should hate you flying for the navy you should also be sent on a larger proportion of gallente kill missions and minnie because you are flying for the states navy larger proportion of gallente kill missions though shouldnt mean just gather more tags this would throw off the tag market and be more wearisome for the missioners some of these should just pay you similar to bounties as in the navy pays you to do the work they ask you to do2a in the case of point 2 there should still be corps that you run with that dont have a higher concentration of gallente kill missions for those that want to try to maintain okay standings with all empires these will probably have more concentration of nonpew pew agents however or not be for the major empires3 more interesting stuff 3a choices in the mission should do interesting things this would be especially helpful to make epic arcs more epic driving a wedge is a good example instead of being handed the mission to kill the gallente industrial and if turned down handed the same mission but kill the minnie industrial instead you should get there and kill one of them your choice while in the mission determines how the mission and subsequent missions turn out ccp has already demonstrated they have the capability to do these sorts of in mission adjustments3b along with 3b there can be easter egg things for example i destroy a certain lab and the resulting explosion opens a spatial rift i can follow to a bonus room or a branch in the mission storyline series to make these even better it could be random destroying that lab wont always open the rift or the lab wont even be there any inmission decisions to affect things would be very nice perhaps i am handed missions where i am supposed to destroy some rats to retrieve a passenger the rats randomly offer to pay me off to not destroy them i could accept this ransom and fail the mission id lose standings with my corpagent possibly but gain some standings with the rats this could be an interesting way to regain some pirate standings over time andor the payoff would be nice a faction rat module bpc or something or i could accept the ransom shoot the rat anyways id complete the mission get a pay off but drastically lose standings with the rat and maybe be punished by the agent by the next mission not being very good
3c more mission variationit seems that as i gain standings with my corpagent i am getting a slight variation on some missions that make it slightly harder or at least a little different as far as proportion of ships in mission or whatnotlarger variety for each mission would shake things up a bit instead of knowing the mission will either look like this or like that i could have 5 or 10 variations the triggers could change for the different variations but at least keep them somewhat predictible like a specially named ship or whatnot
i agree with this and pushed for this kind of thing with my term in the csm ccp has their hands full with mechanics that are in desperate need of a workover lowsec mining bounties corp ui wardecs and missions and they seem to be focused on fixing those items with scanning in apocrypha and sovereignty in dominion while i like these changes there are some that need more focus wardecs especiallysupported but dont hold your breath
spicing things up a bit ay i wouldnt call it a total ovehaul but its most certainly welcome there is a thread in the features and ideas section and that is actually a complete overhaulim not sure a complete overhaul would be good but spicing things up a bit would indeed make things a lot more interestingsupported

another task for the csm that still needs some work is communication with the players meeting minutes general information about the council and other such information are already available but very little of it is available in any obvious place that a player who doesnt already know about the csm would look its great to have a category on evelopedia for csm topics but that will only ever be visited by people who already know its there in particular jita park speakers corner needs a stickied thread to provide an archive of meeting minutes for players to see them without having to dig through dozens of pages of forum threadsultimately though as much as my campaign is about the concrete promises i have made above and the additional ones i will make as this campaign progresses i do not believe that it is my campaign platform that is my greatest strength as a candidate what i will bring to the csm more than a list of objectives is a wide base of knowledge a desire to make eve the best game it can be and a reasonable outlook on how we should get there i know that ccp cant eliminate fleet lag tomorrow and that they wont eliminate local chat theyre not going to channel all their effort into improving one minor part of the game and as much as they respect the csm were not going to change their corporate strategy  no we didnt overturn the gtc price increases and no we wont get dust 514 as a pc game just because we want it to be i wont clog the iceland agenda with timewasting minutia or monopolize it with issues for one part of the game to the exclusion of all others nor will i fill it with pieinthesky ideas that will take ten years to happen if they happen at all i understand how the csm process works and i will work within that process to create the biggest real lasting improvements that can realistically happen i have no objection to asking for a lot but i know how to take no for an answer and get on with businessi am asking for your support in this election because i believe that i can make eve a better game for all of us i have what it takes to represent the players faithfully and well to ccp and with your support i intend to do exactly that thank you

factional warfarefw has always been a focus point for take care as we have several players dedicated to fw in our team as a result we have raised many fwrelated issues to ccp but unfortunately only few of them have been implemented in game thus far such as lag fixes unique lp rewards like the exciting new navy ships fw still does not have the features that were promised during the empyrean age hypeup and even ccp agrees that fw is currently in an unfinished statei believe ccp should assign fw a higher priority as it currently takes months for them to fix critical bugs and address balance issues not to mention implement content that should have been present at launch these issues need to be pushed further and i will be your most attentive partner for fw in the csmrole playinggame mechanics support rp very little it is remarkable how a few entities go to great lengths even though the current game mechanics do not encourage players to do so the lack of an immersive avatar representation as would bring incarna is one reason another is the lack of personalized equipment i see the necessity in eve to own something no we cannot feel attached to a ship because every ship is like the other of the same type it is perfectly equal to thousands on the market personalized equipment needs to be something you need to care for make it grow in order to feel attached to it i call it the tamagotchi effectpersonalized equipment can be introduced unrelated to incarna ship crews is one such suggestion which has been brought in last term by erik and small anchorables is another one brought up by ankhesentapemkah these feature might also allow to give standing more meaning as crews might have to be recruited from planets in friendly faction space and personal standing would be required to anchor their small structures planetary interaction similarly could bring this sense of attachment to something unique which you own which you make evolve and with property comes obligation the benefit should lack single optimal choices and force decisions on the players strategydynamic contentcurrently pve content is completely static missions are always the same as are exploration sites and complexes they are boring and predictable meanwhile other upcoming games boast about their dynamically generated content which results in endless replayability and surprise space should be an environment that always has something new and exciting to offer and for this reason i believe ccp is taking the wrong approach when they went with epic mission arcs as their pristine pinnacle of pve sleepers while interesting and somewhat unpredicatable arent having the intended effect either as players mostly just use a select few working fittings to farm the lowerend oneswhile erik already raised the idea of dynamic missions there should be more pve content that is generated dynamically or at least built from a random sequence of modules npc factions should respond more to player influence instead of just churning out a constant stream of biteready bounties and the system should generate random events in the eve world where players that happen to be in the area can participate in so that you can actually run into something exiting when flying around and solar systems are not all the same
wardec issuesthe wardec system has been brought up by the csm since its very beginning ccp even called it a paytogrief mechanic during these meetings unfortunately it is not possible for a system to determine if a wardec is intended for griefing or if it serves a legitimate purpose any changes to the system should not penalize these legitimate uses however wardecs should not be indefinite by default and should not be as unilateral as they currently are unless the war is mutual there should be win and loss conditions upon which the war ends in addition the wardec fees may require some rebalancingviews on 0000 has always been seen as the endgame of eve but there is some controversity around its accessibility for newer organisations and the level of excitement it produces for current sovholders luckily dominion will do away with the need to eliminate dozens of poses to claim sovereignty and hopefully make the system exciting and volatile again i strongly believe that more people should actually live in 00 and make their income there and that alliances should be strongly encouraged for having players using their space be it their own players or neutrals this would then provide targets for roaming gangs and encourages alliances to actively patrol their spacei would like to ensure that the game mechanics encourage and provide targets for small gang warfare i am against moon minerals being a huge income source for alliances i would like to shift this to the taxation of players which are actively using the alliances space more players should be able to exploit the resources of a 00 system than is currently the case and 00 income should be competetive with highsec level 4 missions dominion may be the first step in this direction and i want to ensure that dominion does deliver and 00 becomes the endgame most players have hoped for for a long time now ccp will ask for feedback from the csm after dominions launch and i will keep close communication with the players especially highsec inhabitants trying out 00 for their first time to ensure that their interests are represented properlylowsecwhile the csm did make a little bit of progress by having battleshipsized rats introduced to lowsec belts the riskreward balance is still not sufficient to motivate ventures into lowsec instead of increasing the boring pve rewards we could reduce the risk while less risk usually means less pvp playerpolicing could bring more security or at least the subjective impression of more security while increasing pvp i have observed many pilots enthusiastically pushing this thought and we may assume that honour one kind of reward that need not be weighed in isk the mechanics are sometimes referred to as marshal force or concord mandatethat is not to say that iskfaucets from the environment need to remain as is the minerals harvested there are often less profitable than highsec thus mining is out of the question it also lacks the complexes and exploration sites found in 00 on the other hand 00 space is often more secure i believe lowsec should have some resources to fight over preferably in a way which encourages emergent casual and smallscale pvplowsec needs to be an attractive twilight zone
player justicei strongly support systems that allow players to deal with crime and punishment player policing i mentioned above but also bountyhunting should be a viable career where it should be a solid system for players to bring justice to criminal individuals that wronged them bounty payout should be linked to the value of the ship being destroyed to prevent players cashing in their own bounties in addition kill rights should be tradable so that players who are relatively defenseless can hire a pilot which can avenge them there should be a market for killrights and bounties so that players who wish to pursue the bountyhunting career can do so without too much effortinsurance systemcurrently the insurance system is static and npc driven one of the few parts of the economy of eve that has not been liberated this has caused inconsitencies regarding the gap between t1 and higher techlevel ships as well as insurance payout of t1 ships which does not reflect the actual market value of these ships which results in an artificial price floor on ships ie if the market price of a ship falls below a certain price it becomes profitable to selfdestruct them for insurance money as well as a large iskfaucetwhile we have had this insurance system for a long time and it is somewhat adequate despite the downsides there should be systems in place for playerdriven insurance schemes to be competetive just like any other part of eve in particular the t2 and t3 insurance market should be opened up for playerrun insurance schemes based on actual market value game mechanics should be implemented to support this so that insurances can actually fight to get their money back in addition while i believe suicide ganking should be a valid tactic i believe that ships destroyed by the police on a warrant concord or players should not pay out insurance

id like to endorse this candidate z0d is professional and has a great amount of knowledge regarding the game mechanics i also believe he will be a truly independent csm and actually serve the playersas fw veteran i appreciate what take care has done so far especially regarding hammering ccp to fix the lag but z0d could you please focus more on the pvp aspect of fw and not the silly complexes and everything thats wrong with them almost all fw players hate or dont care about the complexes so i dont think that that should have any priority fw is for pvp not stupid pve mechanics
good manifesto and excellent ideasyou have my vote
i will join this fleet pmy support is for z0d 
posting my support for z0d hes the man

2 votes here alek having met alek and some of noir in person i can tell you they are a joy to talk to eve about and its clear that they have a real affection for the game i learned something new about every 5 minutes i spent listening to them talk and alek is impressive both in his knowledge of eve and in his personal life also he got lavistas endorsement who is near and dear to my industrialist heart and is the only csm member ive ever voted for i think alek is also one of the few who really wants to improve the game and like lavista has the personal integrity to fairly represent the entire eve community
one of the most experienced and level headed players i ever worked with he is heavily involved in all aspects of the game  pvp pve politics t2 industry cap and supercap production logistics etchave all 3 of my votes
listen to siradio tonight for an opportunity to throw questions at me live on air
there are a lot of negatives in that sentenceso if i cancel out the first two negatives it becomes it makes sense to create something that does not do what it should do that cant be what you meantdid you instead mean it doesnt make sense to make changes that dont accomplish the intended goal just omit the middle negative in that case i agreei say incentive based solutions because this is a game players invest time and give multiple ways to use that time the logical behavior is the one that reaps the highest quantity of a desired reward be it territory isk resources bragging rights or fun at the highest acceptable level of effort cost can be an efforti bring this up because it is a known fact that players are willing to push a button for in game rewards theyll complain the whole time that it is boring but they will do it in preference over an alternate activity say negotiating a dungeon or other task that takes longer for the same amount of reward if you dont believe me ask yourself if you would be willing to sit docked in a station if the game gave you 1 million isk a second 36 billion isk an hour you were logged ini mention this because eve is a game everything players do has an incentive behind it even if there is no actual in game advantage for example killing someone in low sec but not lootingsalvaging their wreck has no financial gain and in fact if ammunition is expended in the process it has a financial loss but there is a nonfinancial gain pride at success bragging rights killmail statsthat was an old idea that i have since wrote off i left it there because i did say it was an idea worth considering at one point and i am trying not to edit the first post but that was before i adopted my incentives based approach to resolving issues in the game i credit and thank helen highwater with reminding me of the importance of addressing incentives in gamesin her interview with evetribune she talked about creating incentives for mining specifically mentioning unique sources of materials that cant be produced except by refining ores creating a new niche good but while that does create a new thing for miners to mine it doesnt make mining any existing ores any more profitable i do fully endorse removing meta 0 modules from rat drops another of helens ideas i think that would have the most positive impact on the profitability of miningi know this sounds like i am jacking helens platform but i think it is more important that people acknowledge that few ideas are developed in a vaccuum the abilities to recognize a great idea and why it is a great idea are way more important than just coming up with them being able to articulate those things can make the difference between ccp accepting and rejecting a proposed change
your bring up good points and in general i agree that incentive based solutions can have great results but you also very craftily managed not to answer my question  even if you introduce incentive based solutions to the issues people have with mining there is still a choice to be made between a mining mechanic that is semiafk and allows for simultanious social interaction or a mining mechanic that is intensive and does not allow for easy combination with social interaction or would you prefer ccp to make that call
also i hope you like the challenge of finding an answer to another question that incentive solutions bring to the tablethere is plenty of incentive for people to blow other people up but none for getting blown up so how do you solve the problem that people who want to blow people up are always looking for more people to shoot and the people getting shot are hiding from them giving them less game for their buckgiving the losing side some kind of insentive to come to the fight anyway will result in a lot more players finding the pvp action they are looking for but whats the insentive one obvious contender is the thrill of the fight itself but in a lot of cases the victim isnt looking for that fight in the first place like miners or haulers who get raidedsuicide gankedas i said before i do like your approach even though we have vastly different ones as a csm candidate i research where the problems are and youre looking for insentive based solutions a potentially good combination but since that is your chosen method i do want to know if youre good at executing it
socializing does make up for a lot of the boredomwell my initial thought was why not allow for both after all ccp has said that dominion will feature more exploration sites perhaps put more profitable ores there unfortunately i cant think of a way to reward interactive mining that doesnt also invalidate the current mining modeldid you just ask how people can be given new incentives to become victims no that mechanic isnt broken additionally if one side is obviously over matched such as a hauler vs a pirate gang there is never enough incentive there is no way to artificially create such an incentiveinstead i would suggest those players go to high sec and just war dec a sizable corp so they have a lot of targets or go to sisi and goof off there since everything is inexpensive there
im not sure if rewarding interactive mining with a higher yield than semiafk mining will invalidate semiafk mining as the ability to do things like socializing and web browsing etc might well be worth the reduction in profit to most people unsure of that at this point but its an interesting question for one of my surveys in that case having your cake and eating it too could be possiblegetting people who stand a large chance of losing to come to the fight and enjoy it anyway thats much harder and if the csm cant figure it out i hope ccp can but we can still tell ccp to put more manpower into solving it ps im not asking for incentive to be victim im asking for incentive to see the fight through for instance by making sure that the loss of not being there is higher than the loss of losing the fight or by adding goals to the fight other than killing the opponent so that even if you couldnt do that you could still complete a different goal during the combat just 2 random things that came to mind
there exist incentives to go out and fight the opportunity to win to blow someone else up and to take or defend territory however your question asked about incentives for people with a low or no chance of winning to go out but you fail to mention what happens if they choose to evade are their families going to be slaughtered or their homes sacked no so why fight if you know you are going to get wrecked more than you wreckyou also single out miners and haulers in those cases the objective is to protect their investment ships and assets cargoif you want your target to stand and fight you have to give them a reason to that means either getting them in a corner prevent them from escaping or pursuing them until they dont want to give up ground any moreand in the case where one side thought it could win but now feels they cant retreating to save remaining assets is smarti guarantee that any gang looking for a fight can find one in null sec by just going to some alliances territory and kicking sand in a mining fleets eye or go join red vs blue or factional warfarebut your original question doesnt imply a desire to start fights it implies a desire to start massacres because even if one group goes in knowing it will lose there comes a point where they also know they probably wont deal more asset damage than they are going to suffer ie way out numberedthe only thing ccp could do to make such risk taking more alluring is to increase insurance payouts but that doesnt address the fact that the kind of pilots that look for one sided fights are also the kind of players that are going to pod their victims that dont have bounties should ccp also make implants 100 safe of course notif someone wants a onesided battle they need to find it themselves as the game already has 3 ways to do it 1 stake out a route 2 probe andor 3 use the on ship scannermy idea of interactive mining was to add another set of mechanisms before parking and cycling specifically probing out an exploration belt any sort of twitch element doesnt really work in eve however that doesnt address the hauler issue of mining fleet operations mining in a fleet is more fun than mining alone but each hauler in fleet has to make up for not miningbut is that even broken using haulers means the miners arent stopping aligning to a drop off point warping docking unloading undocking realigning warping again rescanning for a new asteroid etc of course on paper 10 hulks look better than 8 hulks and two industrial ships to haul their ore to a station but is it better in practicei figure i spend last 3 minutes one mining cycle without ganglinks each time i have to go unload not to mention having to micromanage my 4th cycle to only mine just enough ore to over fill my hold by the barest of amounts so in 60 minutes of mining that is a max of 20 cycles but lets say that 3 cycles fills a hold and it uses 1 cycle of time to unload so 15 productive cycles for a hulk that transports its own ore 10 hulks is 150 cycleshr 8 hulks that dont have to move their own ore can conceivably do 160 cycles an hour 8  20 that is a net gain of 10 cycles by trading 2 miners for 2 haulers

ive flown with darthnac for years from the sparta days though sparta v2 daisho tortuga and sothe knows his  has a very firm understanding of both the game and the infrastructure that runs the game and i can think no one better to participate on the csmhe has my vote and i recommend everyone else seriously consider voting his way as well
1 million  agree that darth would make an excellent csm the most level headed logical online gamer i know cant go wrong with darth
i like this mans platform particularly his technical background i support darth and will will vote for him in the election
thank you for the support
i can vouch for ash i and many a newbie has been introduced to pvp via the excellent cas combat days which ashina helps to organise not only are you given excellent pvp advice you are also given free ships plus replacements and hours of roaming fun without ccd i would probably have gotten bored of high sec and left eve for a second time long live cas combat day
sounds like your the guy for me thenas someone who is interested in minerals one day i will have more veldspar than chribbaand the industrial side of things i will be putting my support behind you becausenot only are you well versed in the bear side of things it seems as though you haveknowledge of why pvp as in the blowing up ships kind is necessary for us that prefernot to blow stuff up
youll get my votemy reasons are my own

as a young player with more than l5 decades of rl  id just suggest that those concerned about balance consider the balance that occurs here and in rl that is known as the predator  prey dynamic for those getting ganked make em pay and pay in the markets it isnt personal it is business only business
i am inclined to agree with one exception if you lose your cargo ship loaded with goods in rl you have insurance on the ship and the goods if you dont you have a serious problem that might remove you from the shipping business for goodin eve your insurance doesnt cover the whole ship much less the goods and even then all you have really lost is time to the tune of 15monththere are real world fixed costs that dictate markets even if you consider your own time free there is always overhead that factors into price points in eve there are plenty of people who not only consider their time worthless but will actually pay more to work more and you have to compete with those people if everyone ran profit and loss statistics and adjusted their prices to compensate then it might work but there are plenty of people who sell goods far below the cost of manufacturing the item yourself not to mention that in the real world you cant just go buy a billion dollars with your fake game money to cover the cost of your lost cargo ship full of ipods which plenty doi dont think it can really be made into a well the way it works in real life is type argument in real life you live one time and 15 year olds dont dictate foreign policy from the decks of super carriers purchased on their parents dime there are certain aspects you can apply like the common human tendency to try and control and order things but past that there arent many analogsi guess maybe the us government nerfing cars in the late 70s is similar to nerfing ships at least you have more to say than waaahhhh i gotted blowed up or stfu carebear
darnhey hey hey the catalyst is a great salvag whistles innocentlycrosses m0f0 off his list
well im caldari but i go have gallente toons and do fly thanatos nyx and an erebus  does that count  in my opinion the gallente caps are very good but yeah  the rest of the product line does need a bit of spit and polish darth for csm
i am gallente i am not going to just press for one race to be raised above the bothers and i do believe that equality does not mean all the sameeach race should have its strengths and weaknesses its give and take gallente ships seem to have a bit more give and could use some more take true but the domi is one of the most traded bcs out there vexor also holds its place in the hearts of many drone ahem users if there is an imbalance i would adress it if you are looking for someone to make the gallente ships all anyone should fly because we iz uber l33t looke elswheremike
my toon may nominally be achura but i have caldari cruiser at 2 and can fly every gallente ship save the eris and the erebus so yeah id count myself as gallente on the topic of balance i dont think gallente are really all that bad they just have a couple unresolved issues blasters are supposed to have the best effective dps and they dont especially and dampeners are supposed to be effective ew and arent really theres some other shipspecific issues like why the hell the myrm and eos still have 75m3 of bandwidth and extra turrets instead of 125 and fewer turrets but on the whole i dont think gallente are too badly broken they need a few tweaks not any sort of wholesale revamp
bunch of hippiesedit now also selling sarcasm detectors starting at 2999
i like smelly cheese does that count i do agree that the gal sub caps need some love i am amarr but pilot mainly galentebut since i am not galente i guess i cant count on your votewhat if i asked in my horrible french je vous serais reconnaissant de vote
hello i apologize for my tardiness but i think it is important that i place something here explaining my goals and motivations for applying to be a csm my name is fndragon my out of game name is jayson randy ward ive been a software developer for almost 10 years now and i recently came back to eve after leaving for approximately a year i came back almost exclusively due to the improvements that the last few csm groups achieved and i thought it would be the right thing to do if i were to participate in that process as a way of showing my appreciationi apologize in advance for not having a set platform up to this point i like to think that i have a generally wellrounded knowledge of the eve universe even though i havent had more than 2 years of playtime i think that the new user experience has been vastly improved but there are a number of things that i would like to see improve if not just to have an open discussion with the developers about as a software developer myself i know all too well the difficulty of wedding requirements with functionality and i hope that if elected my expertise will help facilitate more discussionsso without further adieu my planks of my platform1 i would like to open up the discussion of wrecks and ownership currently any player can salvage any other players wreck however any player can not tractor any other players wreck i think that this could be either an oversight or a design flaw and i would like to make the ownership issues consistent this could also extend to cans and tractoring of other players cans2 i would also like to address the consistency of player aggro and session changing currently if you are fired upon you can dock and use a jump gate without repercussion even if you are warp scrambled it would seem logical to me that warp scrambling would inhibit these things from occurring but that would not be the case ideally there would be some repercussion for doing such an act especially when you take into account the fact you are abusing a npcs hospitality to use them as a safe haven since you are using their facilities to warrant an escape i would therefore propose either a standings hit with a corporation if you use their facilities while under fire docking in a station or using a jump gate or to use the already existing aggression mechanics to prevent such a use while you are under fire3 i would dearly like to reopen discussion of a full macintosh and linux client many new players are using netbook class machines and a maclinux version of the client software would introduce the game to a new wave of playersi do have more ideas however those three are more fleshed out at the moment i understand that no one representative will be able to represent every single player in eve and i think that i have the experience and knowledge to help make eve a better world to live in i would dearly appreciate any votes that come my way and i promise that i will do my best to represent the community at large

id put 3 thumbs up if the doctors wouldnt have removed that extra arm when i was bornthis topic is of significant interest to me and i will push heavily as a csm
just replace these bonusesdeimos  stupid mwdcappenalty bonuses and increase capacitor capacitybrutixeosastartehyperion  armor rep bonusforstasis web bonus like kronos
i would like to point out a few different problems with blasters blaster tracking is fine i have no problems hitting targets however these must be addressed1 all ships which deploy them do not receive the bonuses required to make them work the deimos cant fit an effective buffer tank without gimping its speed and cant fit an active tank at all additionally it lacks the cost effectiveness to fit a glass cannon setup like a thorax this is a problem with some other blaster boats but the deimos shows it the worst so revist the bonuses and ship designs for gallente2 give me like 3km more to play in optimal ffs if i orbit at 2500 m i hit at optimal but if i orbit at 4000 m i hit for  all thats just not right level 4 and 5 skills basically a slight buff to optimals this could even be handled with gallente ships
more damage more tracking more range on medium  small variants
yes i agree 100 with the opin regards to the deimos id like to see the following changesswitch the mwd bonus for an ab speed bonus like the afs on sisi haveswitch the falloff bonus for a tracking bonusit will give the deimos a unique role and allow it complete range control within scrambler range youd also have the option to try to disengage if things go badyou might even be able to fit somthing in that utility hi slot with the lower fitting cost of the ab
you know what i love this idea i would actually fly a deimos if it had such bonuses 
v
good idea
in light of the number of pages any salvage threads gets and how fast those threads and up discussing something that has already been decided i think this warrants a bump to my proposal in hope it gets some more attention and support again
i like this ideaobviously ccps stance on ninja looting is do to their being no distinguishing between deepspace active missions and just left over wrecks from a missionerthe one cavet though is that scanning for wrecks should not increase the odds of finding an active mission more then current methods additionally with the ability to distinguish between active and left over mission wrecks the stance on salvaging a mission while it is actively being completed should be reexamined granting the missioner the first opportunity on his own wrecks ccps stance currently is a necessary one for the survival of salvaging as a viable profession however with these changes flagging ninja salvaging would work without harming the salvaging industry all about balance
i like the idea of scannable wrecks myself but as to another part of discussion the claimant rights and abandonment that has been mentioned in different parts i would like to see an auto abandon option in menu first off this way i dont need to click anythingsecond the ability to abandon jet cans ifwhile wrecks are unscannable this way i can dump bookmarks of my mission sites outside of station undock and whoever gets them first can take to have wrecks scannable and keep server load down i recommend that the site works on scanning the grid it is on instead of the item itself
i approve of this idea that might have something to do with me not having any encounters with ninja salvagers beforethe amount of people blitzing missions for standings seem to be a lot and there is no reason why those wrecks and in extension all other wrecks of course should not be scannable
personally i like the sound of this i think an important consideration is whether it is desirable to make salvaging a career if it is salvage yield might need to be decreased along with this change and a new tier of skills and wreck difficulty added etchas anything official been said along the lines of whether salvaging is an end or just another thing lately it seems like scanningexploration has been heading in the not really a dedicated career and toward the just something everyone does direction sadly
as stated before ccp is looking to tap into the console market to gain more money there is a lot of ppl that use console for a gaming platform more than pc and ccp would be making way more revenue than they would if this title was a computer exclusivelol to all of you who think mouse and keyboard dominates a controller of the xbox 360 you obviously havent faced a good console player or have tried playing console and just cant get the hang of the controllerhaving ps3 and xbox 360 compatibility is alrdy a lot of work since they have to make two different games for each platform and then they have to develop their communication idea so it works for pc ps3 and xbox 360 which is also gunna take some workpc hackers would have a grand time putting bots up or hacking the game and that would not be cool pc just has too much code and room for programs and stuff and if they made a pc dust theyd have to make a mac and linux version now im thinkin that would just be way too much workto all u pc players that are winning about this i say hahahahahahahah ill be playin dust and you wont be unless you get a console so get out there kitties and get urself a xbox 360 lol i dont like ps3and quit supporting this cause ccp aint gunna make it pc mac and linux lol too late for that shiz just be happy playing eve and sit at ur desk chair bed etc and be happy they aint gunna f up everything in eve with this game

thread
something in this vein  i dont even really care what as long as it works  would be lovely
i like
makes fitting ships easier without dumbing the game and doesnt kill market pvp i dont see how anyone could disagree on this one
the operative word here is almost  while yes that is a solution it does not redress the repeated clicks needed to accomplish the task that an enhanced interface would by bring up a sub directory listing for the build in question  with the buy and view details buttons after the item descriptionso again while a drop down menu in the fitting tool would work  it still means you have to click on each module separately and repeatedly  hence defeating the intention of the proposed improvement

seconding this that said if youre planning on doing this again id love to participate
we are running a series of debates actually the number of which will be determined by the interest the csm candidates will show into this the first debate is already over and it provided quite the insights to both us the journalists the listeners as well as the candidates themselvesregarding contacting the csm candidates through evemail we firmly believe that candidates should be keeping a close eye to the assembly hall forum were it is the status quo place for the players to convey their suggestions to the csm members and this is the reason why we posted the invitation on this forum it also stands as a test to the candidates to show that they take their candidacy seriouslyif you are willing to participate on round 2 which will be held on wednesday november 11th at 2100 eve time then do drop an email to qnaplanetriskshowcom by sundayon the round 1 subject the show will be uploaded as a podcast shortly on the planet risk show website and itunes

bump for round 2 debate details
gdayas this is my first ever post may i ask you all to go easy and not beat the post down at first glance now i wouldent be surprised if this has made it to this forum on countless occasions so please dont comment on that that being said here is my petitioni and from the amount of forum topics on the subject many others would like ccp to make character name changes an available feature on the account management page i have read quite a few threads on the subject and found it seems to be a heated topic because it conflicts with the user and character name policy 
you should be able to change your character name for any reason once its obviously possible without breaking the gameas gms can change a persons name for breaking the rulesso why cant we do itthe original character name should also be listed on his info screen
while i do not believe this should be a priority i would like it to see it implemented sometime in the future as long as the original pilots name is listed somewhere in the pilot info i do not see much of a problemlimits such as number of timesfrequency you could change a pilots name would be important with the new redeem plex option showing up in sisi this might be another easy way for ccp to suck those plex off the tq serverashina for csm
character name change already is a reality sell your character buy a new one with similar skills i dont see any great reason to allow name changes beyond that  if youre the sort of person who starts and ends their name with xvx you can live with that afterwards
just as in the last 10 threads about the same topic your name is your identifier in game all your reputation is tied to it you shouldnt be allowed to change that even with historynot supported
herschel im not sure if that was ment to be an insult or not i quite like my name  thank you for your inputdarius i believe i covered the fact that there are alot of theads on the subject  thank you also for your inputeveryone thank you all for your imput you all have some great ideas on the subject thanks againxvxreaperxvx
i agree its also a first step towards moving pve ships to fitting more like pvp ships currently engaging in pvp in a pve specific ship is like hanging a sign off the bow reading gank me which is one of the things mission pirates count on being able to fit ships for missions more like ships for pvp would enable the mission runners to at least put up a plausible engagementedit forgot thumb
hi therecurrently killmails are showing following statsyyyymmdd hhmmvictim xcorp xalliance xfaction xdestroyed xsystem xnearest location newsecurity xdamage taken xinvolved partiesso on where nearest location can be planet x planet x  moon x stargate x station x belt x and so on this would give the killboards the opportunity to organize the fights by location where they passed and not only by time windowthis would be great thank you
may i suggest a coordinate instead this way we can be even more specific which grid did this take place instill i support your initial idea
updated the initial post thanks for supporting the ideaps may i have your attention to look over here  may be another good idea which needs your support thx
due to the size of my proposal i will link it since i posted it in features and ideasmaking missions engaging beyond the 101st mission you completeplease discuss in the original thread and just give thumbs up here or thumbs down if possible because you dont like itwith many thanks to syekuda ive realized i should put the tldr version in this postif this isnt how its supposed to be done i would prefer if my original thread was moved here
argh there is more in eve than only missions wow  that way
thats not a reason for missions being as utterly dull and predictable as they are
hell yeah
yes theres miningproductionpvpexplorationblobsforum trolling and much moreyour point iseach activity in eve get their separate attention while i could have written the billionth proposal on fixing ninja salvaging or fixing the nano nerf or have a go at fixing pvp so that everybody actually does some of iti decided to go at it from a different angle and fixing missions so they actually are a part of eve as an mmo again while keeping it in the back of my head that the ultimate goal is to make mission runners more confident in themselves and their pvp fittings to go out and actually do it against real peopleif you had read anything in my proposal you would have known this but my guess is you are just a troll
read the tldr version its worth itheres the copypaste from his his ideathe real tldr versionmy first iteration on this proposal was written over 7 hours in a row i constantly had new refined versions of my idea come to me and realized that some of these things really needed some extra attention this is why the proposal which i initially intended to cover on one post grew to the massive wall of text it is needless to say i was too tired to write a good summary after the first iterationtldrmissions are and have always been about static content this gets old and repetitive very fast the ai even the sleepers is all about targeting and shooting you while using magic yes magic effects on you that have no relation to how the game actually worksdue to the static nature of missions any sane person would grow tired of seeing the same thing over and over again even pvpers who run missions occasionally will face this reality way too soonlast but not least missions are not challenging to you after you train a couple of skills to level 34 and above and there is no proper teamwork and lacks the competitive atmosphere that we want eve to be well most of us anywaystherefore i propose that we actually ccp scrap the current mechanic completely and implements a mission generator that can create some much needed randomness to missions all this randomness is then backed up by an npc enemy that actually use fits to the best of their ability to fight the mission runner the same way a small gang of pvpers would fight using ships and modules that we would use in pvp added to that if we beat that ai it will self reflect on its fitting and try and create a counter to your successful gank of their artificial beings basically they copy our fittings used in pvp engagements and try to utilize them against us this means you might very well see a buffer tanked myrmidon in a mission that can kill not only your own myrmidon but your friends myrmidon and a failfitted raven the best part is when a second npc warps in with a dominix and start to transfer armor to that myrmidon just before its about to go into structurefinally the best part after completely new and dynamic mission content i propose that we add in a competitive and teamwork encouraging element which i named the agent mission boardno more shall a few solo mission runners talk to their agent and receive a mission just for them the new system will create missions as a real live element in eve that everybody with standings to that agent can take part it this means that in the new system whatever mission you subscribe to can be subscribed to by anyone else you might actually have to compete or work together with other players youve never talked to beforesome missions will have many objectives to complete and some missions will only have one objective if there is only one objective you should make damn well sure you complete that objective before anyone else hopefully you realize you will fare better by doing this together with others as opposed to going soloif there are many objectives you can at least finish one of those objectives and still consider the mission a success and without you knowing it you are actually doing teamwork because with your assistance that mission can be completed by others too
missions are considered player vs environment for a reason and i cant see this resolution passing for general missions forcing people to play in any specific style is against the idea of mmos let alone the sandbox of evehowever this is what i thought the faction warfare missions were going to be and i wouldnt mind seeing that happen i dont support it in this incarnation but given a rewrite to focus on fw missions id gladly support it
making missions much more variable and closer to pvp or alternately pvp closer to pve which might be even better is an excellent goalspecifics can vary widely but the broad goal im in support
good thing i dont visit sm thenprophecy is fine learn to fit
but then it wouldnt be a gleaming golden laserspewing death ship at all i mean come on surely your corp should have some respect for the frickin lazerbeams more seriously its a t1 hull missile bonuses on gallente and amarr only come in on t2 hulls specifically roden and khanid t2 hulls t1 is about the plain vanilla truetoracialphilosophy stuff if you think the proph is bad make it better at its role dont give it a new role

no reason not to support it

when a tower goes offline after a period of time 7 days the tower should be considered abandoned and anyone who wants to should be able to unanchor it it is becoming fairly common to find abandoned towers in wormhole space and it is a shame that they just sit there and rot
im not really opposed to this idea in 00wormhole spacethough im not crazy about it either but its definitely not the right system for empire
all you need is armageddons and time and towers pass away you want that tower gone kill it
no problem with it for empire either maybe require a hacking module to unanchor it though and while you can blow it up id rather just take it
id like to see them degrade over time so that it requires a progressively smaller and smaller force to blow up an abandoned tower the longer it sits and rots
you mean less then 34 4week old toons in geddons blowing up offline towers is one of easiest things in this game
during my term in the csm we discussed this very thing on our trip to reykjavik i cant go into details due to the nda but ccp knows about this problem and are looking into ways to solve it dominions avoidance of pos sovereignty is a step in the right direction but im sure well see more of this later on
i know this might change the way some ships like the lach arazu and all tackle ceptors work but i think we should make the scram and web hit out the same range now that weve got them designed to work togethereither nerf back web range a few km or boost scram range to 10 km it makes no sense that you need to overheat the scram to hit out to 9k and the web goes out to 11
t2 scram goes to 9k dont need to overheat problem fixed really problem is web attributes which slows down shipits laughing at us
fit a faction warp scrambler they hit out to wooping 1125km before bonusesoverload true sansha there are also others reaching to 10k and are a bit cheaperand nice side effect some have warp scram strength of 3 hello mr double stabbed hauler 
i like round numbers as much as anyone but this seems completely unnecessary no thanks
im a pirate and i disapprove this message
heres a better idea make it so that you can accept lp store offers in bulk and add a new offer  100 iskor something equally lowend for 1 lp anyone who wants to clear out and shrink their list now can and that way you dont get to convert all your motsu lp into navy domis and slave implants
of course it is hence no support for either idea from meeven if 100isklp is low do you really think this is a good idea more ways to create isk out of thin airwhy not trade them for standings instead something that is intangible
lp are called loyalty points you earn them for showing loyalty towards the faction theyre from it would make absolutely no sense to be able to transfer them between corporations or from character to character lp is not currencythough perhaps lp can be changed to being given to you directly from the faction the corp belongs to and then you just need a standing above 001 to shop at the lp store of any given corp if not that then i agree with herschel that lp should be redeemable for small amounts of isk certainly lesser amounts than you would be able to make from saving up the lp and buying the faction modules and selling them through contracts
all isk comes from thin air anyways this offer will get used so rarely that it wont make any meaningful difference if you can come up with something else worthwhile to offer for 1 lp id be all for it but the only things that come to mind are faction ammo which is too small and starbase charters which are too big hence you need something to offer that costs exactly 1 and a token amount of isk would seem to fit the bill
yeah the role management tools in this game are terrible ill definitely be bringing up this topic or a very similar one if im elected
i totally agree there and with the original poster
the corporation management system just needs a complete rework in generalit is super complicated very unorganized and theres no horizontal scrollbar which is hell even for my fullscreen 1680x1050 resolution it must be even worse for people with smaller screensplease ccp for the love of god just delete the current corp management system and start over
so let me see if i understand this right i create an account off the buddy program and activate it with a plex which costs me exactly nothing i then hand it two more plex and forget about it for the rest of time and have a fourslot account or hand it six plex and have a sixslot account in other words any worthwhile industryresearch operation is now going to take exactly one account no matter how many lines i want to have and doing this will pay for itself in six monthsassuming i dont want to train or i can do it the other way say i have three characters to train up for industry i get three accounts off the buddy systemagain these are free hive off one of my permanent accounts character slots to each of the two temporary accounts train all three in parallel and a month later put them all back on the permanent account and let the others expire bang character transfers with no 20 fee i can do the same thing as a business too  ill train you a hulk alt for your main account mister pirate and itll be cheaper than market too because i dont have to price in a 20 fee why would you want to do this and more importantly why would ccp ever want do this i dont see what problem this solvestheres no overabundance of plex they wouldnt cost north of a quarter bil each if there was a true overabundance also why would ccp mind an abundance its an interestfree loan for them it just seems like a mass of coding and a bunch of headaches to no good purpose youre allowing a bunch of things that shouldnt be allowed and i can virtually guarantee that this will be a longterm nerf to ccps income either im totally missing the point or this is a very crazy idea with very few redeeming qualities
does lien mean loan in that post dont have a clue what the op is talking about
this makes no sense and seems to mix up the definitions of several words a lien is something that you would claim if somebody were to default on a loan payment to you are you talking about loanswhat
this is a lien on a character just like a lien on a car or home failure to pay the lien back results in the loss of the character which the lend could then sell to recoup lossliennounlaw the legal claim of one person upon the property of another person to secure the payment of a debt or the satisfaction of an obligation
no by using a contract via this method you would lose an open character slot on the account until the contract is finished
silly and unneeded imo
and unenforceableme takes out loan accepts lein for 60 dayslender gleefully claps hands at expected repaymentme transfers cash to main account cancels secondary accountlender also ccp is going to give you some very funny looks because you hae this working through an out of game interface
it uses the same interface as the current 60d gtc system obviously if someone accepted a lien contract their account must be pre paid for the length of time of the lein contract and they will be unable to cancel their account for the time of the lienlooking for constructive posts here
you still havent said what the lien is you still seem to be confused as to what a lien is a lien isnt something that two people can make a contract about unless it is something written in a contract for a loan or other instance where a regular payment schedule is requiredlooking for a wellthoughtout proposal here
this proposal is simple and straightforward reduce the native ship signature or add a ship feature based on skill level to do so for all electronic attack frigates these frigates have much potential but seem to be inordinately easy to kill as ewar ships it wouldnt be unheard of for them to have some native sensor fuddling gear that makes the ship seem smaller in the way halo implants work this would up their utility and survivabilityeven with a slight adjustment
please make it so you can fit ships you are not inor say select like 10 ships of the same type and select a loadout and it loads to all the ships if you have the mods in the hangaralso how about an automatic buyer you list 10 things you need and the market automaticaly searches the best price for you and gives you a quote for it all and you can choose to buy it then
why i mean kudos for good manners and using the word please but this isnt an issueagain why its not like you can fly ten ships at oncethe problem with this is range the best price from where you are may be 900 over the actual market value of the item i can see some poor new player accidentally paying 8 million isk for a shuttle because they dont know any better but the searchy thing said this was the best price looking at items one at a time means i get to actually see the prices  ive actually saved myself a couple million on a single ship by flying one or two more jumps to check the price in the next region oversorry not supported
mining can use a little boost in 00 and low sec the risk u take should be more rewarded than the current 1525m hourly income from mining the abc oresremovingadjusting ore refine rate from lustering alloy glossy compound plush compound and opulent compound from drone loot mining will boost the rare ores in 00 and make mining worth mining
certainly a cool idea but i dont think it can be implemented sensibly if you want to get to any one of the 2000 wormholes in existence in a week you need an average of three links to other wormhole systems in every wormhole with absolutely no doubling back so in practice more like 45 do you realize how absurd it would be for wspace to be that tightly interconnected thats more ways in and out than the average kspace system
well as i said i dont think the wh mechanic should change from what we have now at least not the things that are clearly defined point is the mapping system should give you enough information to be able to reach your target dont forget that kspace is still available so you might go out in null sec do a few jumps and wait there for the next ride in its absolutely possiblealso im not suggesting that just anybody can find any system in 1 week you should be a bad arse explorer to even have a chance at doing that for the more inexperienced folk it this thing should help them find their way back to empire for example so it would still be useful and by help i dont mean like a clear path out more like a hint of whether they are moving into the right directionim aware of the difficulties of implementing what im proposing but as any developer knows having a clear picture of what you want to do is always the first step id be incredibly happy if ccp would just add anything like this to their backlog
its painful for anyone who wants to do anything on the forums in bulk id love to see them phase in reductions  see if the spammers come back when its 3 minutes for example still i dont see why the recruitment forum is special just evemail them
the recruitment forums for me arewere hassle free bulk recruitment tool i wouldnt have to be ingame to work on the gamei wouldnt have to take notes to make sure i havent hit the same mark more than once  i could just look in the thread just to name a few drawbacks working in bulk would net me 45 leads a week  now that the work is doubled by being forced to eve mail people or wait 5 mins between posts has brought my recruitment almost to a grinding halt anyway  just seeing if others that recruit are in the same boat as me

i can has bump
you got my vote
you have my vote toothere is some other candidate with a good platform but you are the only one that has a forum history that support hisher candicacy speek
yeah yeah vote for your corpmate more than me its okay ill survive thanks to both of you for the support
1 for unruly behavior when liquored up he fits right in
here we go again
vote zod the future depends on it
zod has my vote
by god and his infinite will through right gained by killin the heavens a mirage appearedand our destiny shall be revealedid est that i hereby claim my right to vote for z0d of rubyfor the empire
ah z0dand once again i see you delve into a new frontier one would never accuse you of doing any thing at less than all out full throttle so i would expect you to excel at this task with the same vigor and flair that you have for the past 4 years that ive know you in my travels though out eve ive never crossed another soul with the shear drive to master something as i have seen with you 23hr a day you can be found on line and even though youre from canada i wont hold it against you and so you have my votedo good do good
zod is an intelligent guy who knows his stuff you got my full support here
vote for z0d he knows eve like the backside of his hands as others have said he is always reachable and takes time to help individuals learn to strive in the sandbox we all can everemember to vote everyone counts
i have had the pleasure to know zod for the past year during my time with eveonline zod is a knowledgeable player who engages in a variety of aspects of the game and in my opinion would be a suitable candidate for the position of csm good luck to all canditates
he knows how to build and how to sell he helps newbs and gives advises to experienced i see no reason not to vote for himsovote for z0d
i have been a supporter of the take care party since it started i supported and advised both the previous take care csm members ankh and eric i have known z0d in game for a good while now and he is the perfect successor to eric his knowledge of industry and markets is probably only eclipsed by chribba his policies are sound and carry on in the direction set out by ankh and eric and i will be happy to lend my full support and advice to z0d and the take care party once againi especially like that we will continue to push to make lowsec a relevant part of the game as it is currently being overlooked whilst the focus on gameplay is generally on empire 00 and faction wars whilst all these should continue to evolve lowsec should not be overlooked
vote z0dquite possibly the best friend one could have when it comes to manufacturing and trade helpful resourceful and extremely knowledgeablevote z0d
greetings alekid like to hear if you have any thoughts on the gameplay experience in lowsec as well as in factional warfare
speaking for our beloved sick atm ceo fellow directors and all members of mvmv fully endorses and supports elvenlord for csm elven is one of the coolest even headed eve knowledgeable and worthwhile candidates for csm in all of eveelven for the miners just make roids that shoot back oh and on a personal request encourage ccp to make it possible for fc to select which types of ships follow fleet warps
the podcast is now up at planet risk thanks to quivering palm and luminus for giving me the opportunity to take part
what i was implying is a problem between the people who want to start fights and the people who are attacked by them who dont want to fight them with the defending side often running away mostly since the battle was innitiated on the terms of the attacker the attacking players looking for a fight arent finding what they seek sure they can go to 00 and run into big alliances who arent afraid of them but a lot of players are looking for unfair fights in their favor because thats where the guarenteed positive feedback is at and in the end thats why people play games to get positive feedback so to give it to them on a regular basis you need to provide them with targets easy enough to win more often than they lose and if those targets are other players those players wouldnt want to be easy pickings hence the problem but its not the problem im looking for its the solution
they arent trying hard enoughthus the highest form of generalship is to balk the enemys plans the next best is to prevent the junction of the enemys forces the next in order is to attack the enemys army in the field and the worst policy of all is to besiege walled cities sun tzubut there is no problem if people want easy kills they can go rat or run missions or just work harder to corner their quarry but i guess that wouldnt be an easy kill if they actually had to run down their targetpirates crying about over matched targets running away need to htfu if the roles were reversed they would be running away too evading a battle that cant be won is a victory in its own right just as having surviving ships of a convoy escape with their cargoes also a winso this problem that doesnt exist would call for removing the positive feedback of one party those fleeing combat in preference of positive feedback of another those attacking since neither party deserves preferential treatment the win goes to the side that does a better job ie if one side escapes hurray for them if the other side blows them up first hurray for themall warfare is based on deception hence when able to attack we must seem unable when using our forces we must seem inactive when we are near we must make the enemy believe we are far away when far away we must make him believe we are near hold out baits to entice the enemy feign disorder and crush him sun tzuif a gang is having trouble getting other groups to fight them perhaps they should be more discreet in their numbers hide pilots in other systems or form multicorp gangs so that not every member in the fleet shows the same corp in the local chat specifically make other pvp gangs think they can win then after combat is joined and they switch back to fleet chat bring in reinforcements and quickly lock them downof course this is why battleships hanging out near stargates all alone look kind of fishythe point is there are a variety of alternate strategies that players can employ to be more successful and none of them require ccp to do anything
and then to ask if they are actually applying them and if not why not and how can we stimulate them to so that they can have a more gratifying experience
are pirates applying these strategies some are but you dont hear from them because they arent complaining the ones that are vocal are the ones that are not succeedinghow can we stimulate them to use more sophisticated strategies continue to evade them to force them to give up or adapt that and tell them to try different thingsagain i reiterate that pirates having to corner their targets is not an issue that needs to be addressed by csm or ccpi have expended enough effort on this topic
were pretty much in agreement now you make a good case
why i want to be your csm representativei believe the csm makes a difference any time you can sit down with the people who directly effect the direction and composition of game youre playing you should take it as much as writing in ideas is productive its not the same as a face to face discussion by bringing up the points we deem important directly to the developers we can move the game in the direction that we the players wanti have a diverse background in and out of game as it relates to eve online like many ive tried my hands on a diverse cross section of professions you can be in eveas a ceo i deal with the horrible ui for corp management and the associated difficulties managing a corp roles and access including issues with pos operation and want to see them changedas a mission runner and podcaster on them i deal with questions and mechanics about them routinelyas a trader ive used and abused the market and contract systems and as business executive out of eve i have the personal tools to aid in the improvement of those systemsin addition i also have been part of the out of game community building with my podcast and bloggers with the upcoming deployment of new eden i think the insights and experience i have in these will aid in directing the expansion of this servicesince i play in different areas of the sandbox i want to see them all vibrant and continue to expandin real life i have years of experience sitting on a number of society and corporate boards as both chairman and as a general directori care about eve online this game has given me years of fond memories and entertainment i want to continue to see it improve and bring in more players
what i see as prioritiesbookmark revisioncurrently the bookmark system is antiquated and tedious for any corpalliance that regularly creates bms and shares them the current system is ridiculous having to move to hanger copy replace then rinse and repeat for everyone this creates huge amounts of entries into the db which causes lag and server load and is a pain for playerswhat eve needs is an integrated bm system similar to the new ship fitting interface where bms can be saved for personal or corporate usedrone interface changesthe drone interface is horrible old and clunky launching and commands requiring tedious menu clicking the interface needs to be modernised to more reflect the current hud system allowing drones to be group and assigned a hotkey for major commands launch group recall group attack targetyou should be able to see the status of drones while theyre in the bay so you know which ones have been damage having to undock just to group drones is ridiculous and should be added to the fitting interface actually this should be extended to regular weapons as wellpos access changesallow members of corps set to a certain standing to freely access the shieldborked mobile lab access to non corpalliance memberscomplex and arcane role requirements for access pos and labscorporate managementworst interface in game requires complete overhaul to simplifycontracts pageclunky with poor search refinementfleet missionsmissioners get typed as anti social loners that dont really play the rest of eve as part of the helpmymission community i want to see the sleeper ai moved over to a regular stream of missions in empire space to encourage more fleet operations and to get missions more comfortable with the strategies used in pvplow secas it stands now low sec is the bastard region of eve in reality low sec is more the unsecured part of eve then null sec in null sec there is the infrastructure of alliances and corps to protect allies in low sec there is no one high sec has its relative security and null sec has its high rewards but low sec has neither there needs to be a rethinking on what and how low sec operates to entice more players to live thereyour issueslets face it no one has all the answers or is aware of all the little issues these are just a list of mine i like to think im pretty good at seeing a good idea when someone points it out to me i want to be able to put forward the issues that are important to other players as well my only agenda is to make eve online a better game for everyone and if you put forward a good idea i want to see it implemented
bump 
lmao matrixskye for president of sig imageswell said anarchy while attractive to students of college philosophical and anthropological concepts isnt exactly sustainable i have played since just after launch and its kind of disturbing to see the skyrocket trend of asshattery for asshatterys sake that doesnt add anything to the game you can be a piratescammerbad guy and not be a tool it is possible its unfortunately also increasingly rare in eveeve isnt anyones experiment in social behavior unless i missed the memo last i checked it was a video game he has some good points about treading lightly on game mechanics maybe hes even correct about the source of the demise of swg i think eve can endure far more than a game like swg and wow thoughtime will tell
huh by the same logic one would assume from watching the evening news that humanity is all about murder  war and whatever ridiculous holiday is currently being celebrated these are all facets of humanity but they dont define humanityeve in my opinion is an empire building game you can play and excel in eve without ever fitting an offensive module counterstrike is a slice of a reality taken out of context the whole world doesnt wake up in the morning strap on a tactical vest and head out to the office to snipe the guys across the street maybe if you live in mogadishu or something but probably not even thenthere are a lot of people that want it very badly to be a pure combat game just like there are people who want it to be mining game or a market trading gamehowever i am pretty sure that no matter what your slant you would probably whine to someone if you went to the grocery store in your average modern city and someone mugged you and blew up your car with a rocket launcher if you went strolling through some bad neighborhood that you didnt belong in to go grocery shopping you might expect trouble and if you lived in a world where there were no good places then you would essentially have the dark ages no progress just war and famine and sorrow for war famine and sorrows sake given the highly organized nature of eve i doubt that is what ccp have in mind but thats just my takeits weird how this argument always seems to end up with one extreme or the other being the only way the pvp folks want unrealistically to be able to destroy at will anyone anywhere with no more inconvenience than a lost insured ship and a slap on the hand in the form of a security ouchie and the non pvp folks want unrealistically to be able to autopilot freighters from one side of eve to the other and afk mine anywhere without risk of getting gankedwithout pvp industry is worthless without industry pvp is bumper podsfind a happy medium or whine about it pretty simplein my opinion there are two kinds of idiots in this game high sec grief pilots meaning the unorganized pilots with no goals beyond blowing up as many people as possible regardless of gains and the ninnies that want a game that you can play on autopilot while you do your laundry i like to pretend both of these camps are all in the 1218yo range so that i dont have to be sad that there are adults that are that deluded naive and self importantyou want respect as a pirate try a hard target now and then instead of killing noobs all day and salvaging peoples wrecks then high fiving your buddies in local like you accomplished something you want respect as a miner tank some 00 belt rats while ninja mining a rival alliances space and dont cry when a 10 man cov ops roam blows you out of that space or do a freight run in low secthe real pirates dont give a  about high sec because theres not much that ccp could change that would prevent them operating somewhere and the same goes for real industry pilotsthe root of the problem as i see it is high sec is a misnomer its not secure and its certainly not highly secure no one wants to take away combat well no one that matters people just want it to make sense currently it doesnt really high sec is a pile of crap right now just a giant monkey  fest of griefers and carebears solve this and i am pretty sure you solve several interdependent issues like spreading out the population why would anyone leave high sec as risky as it is its still the safest place for the little guy to mine and build and the risk keeps the markets relatively even between low and high sec and considering that there isnt really any risk to the pirates why not park next to the food bowl and just stay there
for the record i dont think ganking should be outlawed in high sec i dont think combat should be outlawed in high sec but the penalties should be adjusted to be more in line with the varying sec ratings and that doesnt mean more gate cops and concordthe juciest targets should be riskier for the same reason there is no arkonor in high secand salvage should have ownership like cans that way when i run into logit he wont be the only one having fun although i am pretty sure the reason it doesnt was a design issue more than a decision to not apply ownership beyond the loot inside the wreck
i stand correctedthis isnt confirmed but its entirely possible comes from the ceo of suddenly ninjasninja salvage
i agree  ill be contacting you ingame as soon as i have some free time tamber
indeed a timely fashion would be preferable but failing that some sort of timetable for the notes to be released and as a bare bottom scraping minimum some sort of semi regular status updateif its to say ccp want us to withold the notes untill dominion then so be it if its to say notes have been sent to ccp for final approval but they are incredibly busy at the movement then this is also fair enoughthis blanket silence except from a semi cryptic comment from the new guy issler that he has seen the notes  though what this means to the release process nobody knows is a disgrace  and should not be allowed to be buried by the plees for votes from the next wave of fanbois bored housewives layabout students and paupers seeking free holidaysskunk
were at around the 2 month mark for the meeting at this point have they canceled the csm at just not told anyone
at the very least it would be nice to know if the present delay is on the csm or ccp sidethe last comment from the csm secretary was that the minutes had been held up because something needed further discussion at fanfest the minutes of the iceland meeting should be the minutes of the iceland meeting minus anything ccp isnt willing to release yet if the response in iceland is well talk about this at fanfest then the minutes should say further discussion to be held at fanfest no more no less if a supplementary report on what was discussed at fanfest is needed generate one when the time is ripe dont hold up the iceland minutes
i have also flown with darth sith since january 2006 i have never met a more dedicated man to this game his integrity without a doubt is one of the most unwavering i have met in this internet spaceship game it is easy to do something in question because there are no repercussions this is a person who holds to his word and doesnt falter in any manner end of story flying so long with this man has led me to understand him not only in game but out of game as well this is a man who can take responsibility and put it toward the greater good of the game i have no doubt in my mind he is more than capable of being part of the csm and will be voting for himi do consider myself a good judge of character and i have fully faith in darth to do what he actually says above good luck bud
ashina is responsible for introducing many players to their first intentional pvp and first presence in 00 you hear a lot of people talk about wanting more pvp and more people out of empire they usually are proposing some halfbaked idea that would actually result in less pvp not ashina ashinas ideas are feasible and will result in more pvp and more players involved in activities outside the safety of empire space it has already been shown through ashinas work in game
please check it outmy csm campagne video and messagevote extreme
you have my vote those care bears must be protected
obvious troll is obvious
ill give you an 8 out of 10 for all the serious replies you got i especially liked how you snuck in a bit where you basically said that you should be invulnerable in an npc corp and no one picked up on itan excellent troll post sir
i dont think he was trolling i think a lot of mmo players are used to having a safe portion of the game ie if i stick to a b and c i might not ever reach the top but no one can ever hurt me either cough cough wow cough eve doesnt and shouldnt have that but i think the carebears make up a large enough portion of the user base that they should be taken into account and i think that can be done in a way that not only can everyone be ok with but in a way that could actually add to the game in the long run from a pirate perspective how much of a challenge is ganking its a practical yawn fest a couple noobs with half decent skills can freighter ganki think this topic has been all whining and name calling for so long that its lost credibility which sucks because there is a real opportunity here to add realism and more sport to the game
well thanks kirana 1st time ive tried posting on the forums  it is nice to know that i dont sound like a complete fool lolrisk avoidance is a goal but rl or eve only ever gives us opportunities for risk mitigation  and always with an opportunity cost like it or not grim reality includes moments when stuff happens some of those occasions are not good some are quite adverse yeah  stuff happenswhile no combat specialist myself i recognize that this environment is by its nature conflict driven be it markets pvp or regional dominance ergo stuff happens should i rage against the machine if my mining barge or hauler is destroyed i think not much of what i build haul or trade is combat oriented geari ask for no sympathy or special status unless ive already negotiatedpaid for that status  when i am effectively an arms dealer i use the game mechanics as best i can to achieve risk mitigationlet the games go forward
agreed the one thing people shouldnt do although almost everyone has at some point is freak out when they get ganked whether in a freighter or a retriever its pointless particularly when many gankers operate in the hopes that they can get a good local flame off going most dont admit it and play the roll of taking the high road but its pretty clear from watching local in just about any busy system that many of them love getting railed out by ed off carebears dont feed the trolls as they say i think most low or no profit ganks are just bored trolls looking for conflict but bored trolls arent the problem the problem is why they are bored theres no incentive to be more creative than floating outside of a station waiting for some noob in an ibis to empty out the free stuff here can its absolutely allowed by game mechanics that doesnt mean it makes for good game play from either sideand yah its a combat heavy game to be sure but its not all bombs and bullets so it goes back to the main question is eve about staying true to realistic societal storyline concepts or is it about pure neutral game balance i dont know if those two things are compatibleive ganked and i have been ganked hard and i still play the game and love it but i wouldnt mind taking care of a few things that just dont make much sense as an old player its easy to lose sight of that time waaaayyy back when some player took everything you had just for a chuckle i still remember the first time i got popped i had just spent most of my bankroll on a shiny new moa joined a 00 corp and headed to stain to begin my life as a bad ass 3 jumps into low sec i got locked down and popped faster than i could even react to i dont remember if i got ed in local or not i probably did i was a noob the last time i got ganked was to the tune of 45billion didnt say a peep went back to lick my wounds and adjust my strategy the point is that while most carebear whining is just that there is an awful lot of it out there and i think we can silence a lot of it for the sake of all involvedthink about this for example if you had a class of systems 8 or 9 that werent gank proof but were very difficult to gank in it would give small industry in high sec a place to flourish more or less unhindered the result would be to drive prices on manufactured goods down and high end resources up in these areas this would increase the traffic of large quantities of goods flowing out of these systems to the exposed outlying 8 or 7 areas where they could be sold for huge profit as well as increase traffic of high end resources from low sec00 to supply this industry right now theres not much margin in price from the market hubs and the high end of low sec that gives traders and gankers no incentive to spread out what you end up with is exactly what we have currently its a bit dysfunctional when you think about itwhat i am talking about benefits both sides the gankers get a boost in quality and quantity of ganks and the carebears get their safe spot the only thing that changes is where the ganks happen a secondary effect would be to give new players a chance to get their bearings before being gun d i have had several people i referred to eve get scared off because of that its a different kind of game to get used toi am not a champion of carebears i am a champion of mutually beneficial game design if it helps the carebears so be itif nothing else i can talk like a politician 15 ways of saying the same thing over and over with as many words as possible
the latest on ninja salvagingread it and weep
i stand correctedthis isnt a huge disappointment though i rarely run missions and mostly salvage sleepers which i have never been ninjad on for obvious reasons i can see why it bugs newer players but if ccp reviewed it and made that call then thats thati love your corp name btw you guys are hilarious if i was to get ninjad i would hope it would be by people with a good sense of humor
with the results of my second survey now in i am supported by it that indeed people want to take the whole csm process and move it to within the games graphical user interface ive also inquired about what shiptypes players want to see added to the game since in the previous survey many people stated that they wanted new shiptypes and the results are remarkably in line with the first survey adding explorationoriented ships is most popular and exploration also scored high in the first survey meaning thats where a large portion of the players want ccp to put some focus on nexthad the results of survey one been very contradictive to the first id have known that this system of finding out what people want doesnt work but now it shows signs of consistancy there are plenty more conclusions to be drawn from the surveys and id like for everyone to view them independently drawing their own conclusions from the data if your conclusions differ from mine id like to know what you thinkin recent interviews players have been given the chance to ask csm candidates questions i feel this should be the other way around we should be asking you questions so take a look at the results of the second survey here and review the full results of the first survey here and let me know what you think the csm should learn from themaynen
which is why that ccp is integrating the csm voting process into the eve client 
but why stop there ingame survey tools ingame assembly halls there is much more thats possible
nice graphics but jesus christ man this isnt elite 2also the second picture reminds me of tropico or something i do like the thought youve put into these ideas and youve fleshed them out to a surprising extent which is far more than most candidates do so props to you for that if i was voting at all this year id probably vote for you just on the strength of the commitment you seem to have given this thing
the second survey is filling up rapidly and soon there will be results to give you if you havent allready gone and filled it in please hop over to
the results are in this survey filled up much faster than the previous one a big thank you to everyone who participated the results can be found here
supportedthere should be more consequences for interfering in a fight
when the speed changes hit the server and everything slowed down and webbers were changed i said okay whats a reasonable amount of time for ccp to realize that my gallente bss are screwed over and ill give em that time to fix the problem before i do something drastic the goal was 60 days i will now make fun of the ammar race for the rest of this post60 days hit and nothing so i said well i hate missiles and i dont want to fly duct tape into battle so that leaves ammar and their l4z0rz of deathso i started training ammar with the notion that by the time i could fly all ammmmarr ships with level 4 skills they would fix gallente and i can keep flying the ships ive known and loved for the last 3 years till the nerf but no months have ticked by and i looked up todayi can fly every single amaaaaaaaaaaaaaar ship in the game except capitals and i can use full tech 2 on both but still not even a peep about fixing gallentekso here i am i love my blaster boats charge up to an enemy double web them to gumby in winter mode and lay down some justice yeah thats how it used to be now its charge up to enemy slowly mwd nerf but fleets are still the same distance apart it seems oh noes so more of my precious capacitor is gone finally get in range and ha ha i exclaim as i fire my web on that damn other bs going 800ms hell slow to 100 ms like before nope hes still going 400 ms webber nerf so obviously i need a second web to get the same effect np opens eft and has 4 mids to work with k webber check cap injector check scram check mwd 100mn check hrm seems i dont have enough slots and cant take anything off interestingwell i could work with the tacklers but warping around even once messes up any plan i could take off my scram but then he could just warp off i cant take off my capa injector or i wont last more then 2 minutes in combat of which 4 to 5 mintues will be spent mwding into the super close range well i can throw that idea out the window  even with 3 ccc rigs this thing gets a tad expensive whether hyper or mega and when people see you going that close in your going to get primaried into the stone agei dont want this to come off as whiny its more of a well i hope they take a look at it at least many people have brought this issue up before and it hasnt been addressed hopefully with enough supports csm will at least address the issue many of us seem to be havingas for meim flying aaammmarr till its fixed do i like aarrmammar not really lasers are cool and all but i love the thump of a railgun tearing the air that doesnt exist in space like a giant air ripping device with laz0rs i get to hit from 30km and usually tear apart the megats trying to close the gap long before they arrive even with our similar close range fits so my ammamaamrmrrrrhickuprrars battleships and such have my attention i hope ccp will at least consider fixing the gallente issues atm and i hope the my beloved blaster boats get some loving till then thoamararrarrraaaaaaar victorlaugh damn you laugh
signedfix blasters soon please
yes lasers are cap dependent however they do not require ammo hybrids require bothyes amarr ships are cap stable l3rn2fitwe dont want extra range as a whole we want better tracking with a bit more damagegallante battleships are not overpowered they used to be a bit nasty but are now hopeless if you need evidence of this megathrons are now so cheap if you buy one undock and blow it up with full insurance you make a profitgallante weapons will not be as versatile as lasers they will still have next to no range drones can be easily destroyed and then you lose your dps in dronesat the minute lasers can do almost the same ammount of damage as blasters but and epic range blasters cant even hit their target at their optimal range and only slightly outdo lasers in damageplease just better tracking and a smidge more dps its an easy fix get it into sisi for testing please
dont forget destroyer warp speedfrigates are 6 ausindustrials 45 ausdestroyers and cruisers 3 ausid recommend boosting destroyer warp speed to 45 aus
by all means yesdont forget to add tags to bpcbpo
need more posts
im guessing this was implemented to cut down on the server usage to that extent i do not support an implementation of the scanner that is using too much resources that said this delay seems to be only a temporary solution it does not reduce the resource cost of each scan only limits the rate at which any individual player can scan ie 2 people scanning once every 2 seconds  1 person scanning every secondi do however believe that the efficiency of the directional scanner could probably be improved properly implemented i see no reason why the directional scanner shouldnt simply be turned onoff constant scani do support a more permanent fix to the directional scanners resource usage
signed2 sec delay sucks
so thats why im ing up my scanning
signed
signedmake it even 72h tbh
yes please
very sound and fesible idea of course if someone compromises my account i suppose it will be moot seeing as they would change my pwd andor email address if they really wanted to do some damage
issue information warfare links while not completely useless are of far less attractiveness than armored skirmish and siege warfare links also information warfare doesnt really suit gallente at all as far as rp is concernedsolution scrap iw links in favor of assault warfare links these deal with damage applicationassault warfare link  target leadingincreases all turret tracking by 23 before skillsmindlinkscommandshipsassault warfare link  gun drillincrease all turret falloff by 23 before skillsmindlinkscommandshipsassault warfare link  surrogate combatincrease all drone speed and tracking by 23 before skillsmindlinkscommandshipsq why no optimal range linka because they would become pretty much mandatory for fleet fights whereas all other gang links are only nice to have
nice idea but only fair if the target leading and gun drill links would give a bonus to missile systems toomaybe a explosionradiusvelocity boostif there would be another set of assault links like those for missiles only nobody would fit them anyway probably because lolcalamari
its a great idea and i dont think they have to have a missile module its not really very gallente
pretty hot although maybe add some kind of bonus on them for missiles too sig radius and explosion velocity
the missile and a couple other issues can be resolved withbesides that this gets a big fat thumbs from me
i think its ok that missiles not get a boost because as its been said above it wouldnt be very gallente and it kinda falls in with the other races links since they too can have limited use on other races ships ie siege warfare links are pretty irrelevant for most noncaldari ships excluding some minnie shipsat best maybe target leading could be changed to giving a bonus to turret sig radius and missile explosion radius in effect its still a boost to turret tracking but it also helps missiles some
these seem interesting but im not actually sure that theyd be any better than the information links are now these provide a fairly small boost to a lot of ships instead of a fairly big boost to a few ships but neither one is going to be obsoleting damnations any time soon
a maxskilled eos pilot with mindlink would be giving a sniper bs fleet between 25 and 38 extra turret tracking with the target leading ganglink thats a considerable bonus
yeah thats the one most likely to see use still though its nothing special  nowhere near as powerful as either of the resistance links for example and what about the other two links you propose who would ever fit a falloff link besides maybe a solo sleipnirand even then theyd probably prefer shield resists or tackle range and the drone speed link is handy but its really nothing to write home about either which of these is going to make the eos a viable fleet command ship
currently it is not more profitable to go to lowsec systems since you get killed by pirates pretty often this annoys pirates because lowsec is often barren of targets and deprives mission runners of exposure to other aspects of eve online since most of them stay in highsecmore mission runners will go to lowsec if the following changes in no particular order are implemented1 tweak pve equipment to make it better at pvp so that mission runners stand a fighting chance when they get attacked inmission note this is a bigger problem for drakes and ravens than for other ships fit for pve and part of it is due to mission runners insistence on using passive tanking drakes in lowsec instead of say harbingers2 tweak some level 4 missions so that like level 5 missions they need more than one player to easily complete the mission runners will survive more because there will be more of them in the same mission so pirates will have to fight two or more mission runners instead of just swarming one often there are not enough pirates to take out two drakes at the same time so the pirates will retreat and both mission runners will survive3 make many missions have an npc that warps away this will make mission runners carry warp scramblers or warp disruptors which will make it more risky for pirates to attack them4 substantially increase lowsec mission rewards they should be increased beyond the loss incurred by doing a mission with your buddy and splitting the reward so a level 4 twoperson mission should have more than double the current level 4 mission reward5 leave some level 4 agents in highsec but decrease the rewards having a few level 4 highsec agents will allow mission runners who just bought their first battleship to be able to cover the cost of that battleship before having to go into lowsec lowsec mission running will not be initially profitable till the mission runner learns to fend off pirates if someone loses their first battleship in lowsec and cannot replace it they are less likely to go there in the future even with lowsec rewards being increased many mission runners will stay in highsec if the highsec rewards remain the same since they will still be profitable enough
thoughts1 good luck this is a balancing issue that could be a problem2 again good luck the problem here is that with mission running in general except 5s it is much more profitable and easier to solo than it is with groups if ccp had intended for groups to be the main thing they would have done that way before now it seems that it isnt3 no 4 they have pretty much already done this5 already donewhat is the problem and why its because if and when pirates find out that people are missioning in a certain systemarea theyll just constantly camp the area making it useless for ppl to try and get in this is a problem with lowsec in general tbh only place ive seen exempt from this is certain caldari areas and lower domain due to the deliverance campaigngood ideas but its not enough
2 reengineering missions to require groups will mainly be for the mission runners safety not so much to make level 4 mission running more of a cooperative as opposed to an online single player activity3 in particular having a warp disruptor will make it riskier to solo tackle a mission runner often one pirate will scan down and tackle a mission runner and then ask his buddies in corp chat or vent or whatnot to help him outright now mission runners can choose to carry warp distruptors but they still dont not being able to be scrambled drastically decreases the risk for the often solo first tackler since he just warps away if he cant hold the mission runner till his buddies arrive4 5 these werent done enough mission runners can make 20 million iskhour at least the ones ive talked to claim this doing high sec level 4 missions motsu has a quality 18 level 4 agent though the 9 sec status takes out a big chunk of his rewards perhaps level 4 high sec missions could give rewards somewhere between level 3 and 2 lowsec agents of course these level lowsec agents will have increased rewards tooalso pirates would aggregate less if ccp further dissipated agents away from hubs converting highsec space in general to lowsec could help this as there wouldnt be enough pirates to roam it alledit added 2
1 your amarr mission ship with dual rep is dying as fast as the passive fit drake you might be able to hold the attacker while he is killing you doesnt make you win anything2 while i would appreciate that  i think that role went to the level5 missions for giggles my corp some times does lvl4s in hacs as a group just to give it a bit more challenge not much though also afs dont really get into sweat with lvl4s3 that would require fixing npc warping mechanic in first place atm they warp happily away even when warp scrambled iirc they are not affected by any ewar atm except for sleepers4 the reward is already much higher i am not sure if boosting it even more wouldnt make it unbalanced5 the current balance of lvl4 agents between highsec and lowsec is ok
grate idea signed
support  i have tons of stuff left by dead toons but it would cost more isk to get them than they are worth 
if a bunch of corps have assets in stations like this that arent worth getting it has to generate unneeded database calls whenever the corp looks at assets fixing this would help corps tidy things up a bit

the first round debate was really a good listenhearing candidates speak about their ideas and their platforms and what they envision for csm offers a lot of insight into how seriously they take their candidacy and the job of csm delegateas i stated in a discussion post on my blog today and in a previous post a week or so ago i have a hard time taking any candidate seriously whos not making an effort to reach players by whatever means possible and tell us why we should vote for themif youre a serious candidate and havent gotten in touch with lumi to participate in csm round two on the planet risk show why the hell not get your ass in gear man prove you deserve a vote
shame i missed out on round 1 luminus didnt inform me i was booked for the show till the night before xd and by that time i had a schoolrelated obligation which couldnt be avoided i am looking forward to the second round is no one really going to stand against me
ive emailed them no response yet thoughedit just got a response in game seems like ill be on with you and whoever else is in on this see you then
i do not support the idea of permitting a name change as has been previously stated your name carries with it certain baggage that should remain even the notion of having a history that would include all name changes is flawed imoi believe in the crime and punishment principle if you create a characteror use a character to commit a crime ingame then that crime should always directly be linked to that character name not in the form of a history of name changes which can become quite convolutedmy two isk on the subject
my first question is why why do you need to be able to change your name i mean i realize people have some downright stupid andor offensive names but its not like they didnt have a choice when they signed up for themso why is it necessary to support changing a characters name
why do people do that ive never understood
no i will because it is on a ed topichere is why namechanges are not viable1 i sucicide gank you in a raven proving im not afraid to lose money to troll2 you remember my name and dock up whenever i enter system4 i change my name my old name goes in some kind of list on my bio but next time i enter system you dont notice because you dont check the bio of every single person in a system with 100 people in it5 i gank you againthere are a large number of people in this game who i would dock up if they entered system its an upshot of their prior actionseven if you add names to some kind of list the instant recognition will be gone along with any consequences of prior actionsnot supported
normally because the name they wanted was taken and they werent creative enough to come up with another one
if youre allowed to change your name once just once thisll definately get supported
id categorize it more as poking fun its a naming scheme i dont really like but i sort of figured you did
thank you all for your posts all your imput has been appreciatedas brought up by kara mz and others there are problems with the idea but with every problem there is a solution for example the gank situation now this is just one idea so dont shoot me down the gankers name text could show as red to indicate that you have kill rights against that person which would peak your interest and as you check why you have kill right you would see the last name of the ganker doc deeb i agree completely just once is more then enough thank youand to the person who asked why i say why not i think everyone should have this option available to them if they choose to use it is up to them after all this is an amazing game with so many options and paths to choose why not this option sure there will be problems to to address but as i said each problem has a solutionnow this thread wasent intended to be any kind of debate thread this was made to see if anyone else like myself thought that this would be a good idea to implement in to the game that being said this is a majority rules thread and the majority has spokenthank you all for posting your views they where all appreciatedfly safe all see you ingamexvxreaperxvx
fail thisits deadspace thats also the trick of pvp you never know what you are going to run into so be prepared for anything plus plexs werent meant for pvp but pve get over it you want pvp come to lownull sec and ill shoot you personally
this applies to all security status systems im not sure what exactly made you think i was referring to highsecas for your painfully obvious pvp advice it was not requested and is not relevant make sure you are prepared for anything at all times mkayby your logic we may as well disable all forms of warp disruption inside deadspaces as well
question would somebody who is running the mission perhaps as much as 1 to 2 jumps away knowingly equip a module that will perform as well or less and take away a large chunk of his precious capacitor to run said mission when he could equip the same or better module with less requirementswould a pirate do so when he never knows where his enemy might be safespot asteroid belt or mission sitethis suggestion is an obvious buff to mission raiders i see no conceivable reason to support it
good addition dont know about coordinates theyre non descriptive but nearest location is fine
location near planets stations and gates would be good maybe some killboards could sort by locations or even give more points to kills away from stationcamping
low priority but could be interesting
sounds reasonable to me but while youre at it please rehaulfix the current system so that killmails are actually accurate thanks
this should stay on the front page for more support
woo support for this idea because i think it is awesome and would benefit the eve online community
not supportedcurrently missions are a very solid and steady source of income for people whose friends either arent online or dont exist your proposed change would make them more dynamic sure but it would also make it impossible to plan for what youll be running into making specific damagetype hardeners totally useless in nearly all facets of the game extraordinarily likely that your ship will be killed another pointless extension of pvp really what is the difference between missions and pvp if the npcs act and fit exactly like players in pvp and no longer viably soloablevery very against something which takes a unique albeit a little bit boring part of the game and makes it exactly like something that already exists as well as being against something which completely shuts out of the game anyone who happens to be going it solo at the time and actually wants to fight and not just shoot a rock for 5 hours
i like this idea i like it a lot theres some changes i might want to make though for one dont make the mission board agentbyagent make it corpbycorp for example say that the caldari navy offers missions in forge citadel lonetrek and black rise theyre heavy combat and large in number you want to work a cn mission you look up the cn mission board and filter it  okay missions where i meet the standings requirement within two jumps17 hits sort by lp payoutooh that one looks nice damn lowsec okay guess ill do that one instead have missions update regularlylike every few minutes not just at downtime and players can claim missions just like they do now this will naturally make lowsecfactionshootother annoying mission types balanced since theyll be taken less often and thus itll be more valuable ones that are left similarly i think the balance point for npcs should be that they are equal to minskill human players with t1 gear stop npc cheating make them use the same stuff we use at the same effect this might make each individual npc laggier but there should be enough fewer of them to make that not actually negatively affect performance ideally thered be enough fewer to let npcs actually use drones below l5 missions which should make gallente play a bit less stupidly with these rules from there make npcs actually fit their ships with real gear not just random stat effects a npc blackbird might have one t1 jam of each type a sensor booster with range script and an afterburner  and theyll have actual aggro mechanics so they point those jams at the player they feel to be the most dangerous a l4 guristas mission might have a couple of those a couple rr osprey a couple ogrespewing gilas a rattlesnake a drake and a few frigs to tackle and itd expect you to bring probably 34 players to fight it the rattlesnake and gilas will have higher than minimum skills and will have chances of dropping fancy geargood chance of named low chance of faction whereas the other stuff will have minimum skills and a chance of named gear droppingfactionshoot missions will replace faction ships with t2 ships  the same mission vs caldari rats might have a widow a ganglinked vulture and a basilisk as highend rats instead as with the original proposal itll only drop gear that actually showed up in its stats when you were fighting it as for the objections that they wont be soloable that seems easy enough to fix go back to the oldschool definitions of mission levels  l3s are intended to be soloable l4s are not jack up the rewards so that l3s are at least close to current l4 rewards though  i dont want to nerf solo missioners too badly but still this is an mmo it should encourage gang work similarly make l5s actually scary  those carrier rats sure as hell cant be killed with a solo nighthawk theyre genuine carriers 15m ehp and all if you want to do l5s sanely you should need several players including capital ships give us some actual highend content for pve that doesnt require 00 exploration im sympathetic to arguments about soloers and i want to see their lifestyle remain viable but im completely cool with knocking down what they do to lower levels as long as it doesnt bugger up the income streams too much in any case yes something in this vein is desperately needed
if you read the linked suggestion and not the reduct that sound reasonable you will notice that he has no idea how to balance mission risk and rewards and that to cite his words i dont see how balance has anything to do with it the end sum should be able to cover each and every ones ability to fight they can decide what missions they want to attempt and there will be plenty to go roundhis suggested system will give 0 information to the one doing the mission the briefing will be something likego and take that hillwho is the enemysome insurgent from 1 to 10000 maybe some enemy regular troop perhaps some gun emplacementnow go you have your orderswhile the current system give too much information thank to the point by point description of every mission his system will go too much in the opposite way with his lego suggestion you could have one mission where the target is in the first room of a multi room dungeon and you need only to kill 23 ships to get a 10 million reward while the next mission will push you in the equivalent of ae with all the ships in the first room and instant aggro with a reward of 1 millionthe autobalancer would be incapable of matching missions success and rewards and the suggested system will have practically random rewards for what you do his suggestion is to move from a broken mechanic to another broken mechanic only in the different direction to work a system like this will require the equivalent of a real military briefing one where like in reality the information cold be wrong or insufficient but i really doubt that cc can implement it without a lot of work and naturally the old npc should have fitting like ours problem fitting like ours require more server power and more coding it can be lazy but ccp dont want to devote that kind of resources to pve
ive yet to see a big long detailed proposal of any sort on the forums that made me truly with how the idea was to be implemented i include ones i have written myself in that the bigger and more complex an idea is the more pitfalls there are to it the more qa work itll need the longer itll take to balance all that fun stuff after a certain point  and this proposal is far beyond that point  i generally start to care less about detail work and more about the big picture youre right his system has some real holes in it but they seem less relevant to me theyre the sort that will get fixed along the way i think as for the fitting like ours thing we currently have a big mission spawn 2030 ships at a time with fits like ours you might get a fifth of that because a bs wont be doing 80 dps any more i dont know whether itd ultimately be more or less work for the hamsters but an 80 reduction in number of ships allows for a pretty hefty increase in complexity without actually upping server stress at all remember were talking about a game that fairly routinely puts a thousand people on one grid at one time and while the lag from that is awful a lot of the problem there comes from everyone being on one grid even if npcs are exactly as much server strain as players after this changewhich they wont be no networking needs putting 20 players on grid doesnt break anything im no serverroom guy but it doesnt seem obviously insane to me
there seems to be a lot of controversy in new eden over the role of smartbombs though i came up with this idea independently im not the first to suggest that a cpu driven module like smartbombs could use sripts to give them a wider array of userather than fixing the weakness of smartbombs with a module range or damage adjustment that will surely have divided sentiments across the community why not just introduce 510 scripts to grant them what they really need versatility a assault frigate is not going to use smartbombs in the same way that a capital ship or mining vessel is going to so load a script like you would your ammo type to deal with issues likefriendly firedrone onlyextendedlimited rangestructural damagekamikaze pilotingi only hope that ccp can invent something like this soon and drop them on the market with dominion

youve just loot a battlefield or your last mission youre hangar administrator for your corp  you look for that oUFFFDUFFFDUFFFD officier t2 or meta 4 module but you dont remember the name youre a producer and you look for meta 0 or whatever module required for your next invention jobhow never wanted a sort by meta level and sort by meta level reversed choice when you right clic on hangar background ccp will confirm but i think this does not need so much devs job time and it could be very very very usefull for everyoneps  maybee a sort by slot also 
good idea
this is an old old issue and the csm has brought it up already im all for it but theres no need for another thread
i looked at the link and it shows that it passed on csm vote but there isnt a results or i missed it  i am in a hurry getting out the doordid ccp ever indicate that it was going to be donesorry if this has been answered already
i suppose he means the preview icons of the said ships when they are being either targeted or viewed in their info pane the hue of the icons gets a bright bleeding effect which not only destroys the icon but its really annoying and contrasting with the whole dark themesupported of course
id like to see it go between 3 stages 13 week interval anchored derelict decrepit and finally removedanchored can be unanchored by corp current behaviorderelict can be unanchored by anyone all fuel destroyeddecrepit damaged can be unanchored by anyonerepair costs a significant amount and is not done via the normal system think a rejuvenation blueprint that needs mins and npc stuff costs about half tower npc priceso yeah 1
in whs just go blow it up ive done it before with a bs takes a bit but its possible to do haul modules away and reuse them in same systemother than that id like to see this done esp in low sec null sec shoot the damn thing
i would like to see something down about abandoned towers instead of having to shoot it to pop it maybe after a few months the tower becomes hackable and with proper skills you can get the password for it and unanchor it
have spent quite some time chatting with hersch got to say that even at points of disagreement he is such a good conversationalistthat the result is always very constructivein my opinion one of the most important assets for a csm memberas for views and ideas you can readand judge them for yourselves truly a great asset for the csm
i have known z0d for close to 3 years in this time he has advised me on skill training when i was quite new to eve helped me get started in industry helped me on missions helped me aquire a character on the bazaar he is always ready to help othersmy vote without questions goes to z0d
i support take care because you all seem to understand that even though representing diverse player interest and playstyles is important open minded objectivity resulting in unified front towards ccp is what makes a good csm delegate myself and my small corp have voted for tc delegates in previous elections and we intend to support you again

as promised you have my two votes keep up the good work
hi jonathan best of luck mate 2 votes to you from my accountsre the quote above i support this product griefers might abuse this by temporarily dropping from their corp to get rookie intel however it isnt really much different than having an alt so 1i know youre also open to nonpve issues as well youre open to discussions re faction war and pvp more generally if people disagree with you they can let you know to your credit one of your strengths is that you dont dogmatically stick to your preconceived perspectives youre open to persuasion and logical argumentanother fw issue that you and i have discussed is the balance of the npcs the respective sides face my background is caldari but ive used a gallente alt to test the other side caldari npcs have long range missile spam and ecm gallente npcs are slowboats with close range weapons whose only ewar is sensor damps this makes it more difficult for the gallente to both mission and capture hostile plexes in fw maybe ccp should look at balancing this a biti think youd be a very responsible and representative csm member particularly for pveers and rookies as well as the eve public more generally

agreed song li for president
whats great ideas
cool my vote for you
very interesting program especially the point with the rigs change ill vote for you
nice program but u should probably adress some implant problems too i was more specific on russian site so u can read there i saying it here like that not to help ur rivals in adjusting their programs but u seem to be best candidate for me
while i understand the desire to fix the deeper things of this game internal mechanics and such there are a few problems with this ccp worked hard on a patch a few expansions ago that fixed 100 of the most reported bugs and oveur could count the number of positive responses he got on one hand and have fingers left over new players are attracted by the bigger newsmaking mechanics of the game while bug fixes are a constant struggle a whole expansion dedicated them would probably draw people away from the gameim not saying its bad to fix these aspects of the game but that the method ccp is using right now is best theyre fixing one major mechanic per patch while releasing new content
no
hes welcome to come try d
i agree 100 with you on all counts my 3 votes will most definitely be going to youyour proof can be found here in the post by ccp incognito
the last comment from the person who appeared to be claiming responsibility for the minutes whom to name and shame ismeissa anunthielredshift industrialrooks and kings was on the 10th of october in this thread and then silencei was concerned that the forum silence and non comment may have indicated that this person may have had real life issues preventing him from posting in deep depression after being sacked from his high powered job for inability to write up meeting notes wife leaving him for losing job in hospital treated for depression due to wife leaving him etc and thus any complaining on the forums would be inappropriatehowever that poster has since posted a couple of times on non related issues such as to praise someones combat video so heshe is obviously active  jut choosing not to respond to this thread i also believe that individual is laugh seeking reelection to the csm the last official mention from a csm memeber on the issue was this from the new guy isslerwhich i appreciate immensely that he has spent the time to post a response but it doesnt really help the people who voted them in and are trying to work out whats going onperhaps issler whom i know monitors this thread could perhaps attempt to get a status update for usskunk
minutes were sent to ccp weeks ago whenever ccp decides to publish them is not under our control
praise be one of them speakethseriously though thanks for the response its all us mortals have been asking for for 2 months non the less and gratefully receivedive petitioned ccp and received a very quick and very polite response without revealing specific responses which i believe to be against the forum rules i can confirm that people are working on it and there is no specific date when they will be readyso basically anyone interested has to lump it and wait im tempted to go get the new york times article again and launch into a damming tirade about ccp and the csm but of course you all know the ins and outs already skunk
velocity prime i agree 100 with kirana love the corp name lets see im on the open ocean in a sailboat i find some stuff just floating there and as im picking it up another boat comes by and says hey that is mine cause i made it international rules first one there owns itthey take you to maritime court court says first one there owns it other boats owner is royally poed it aint fairme get over itworried about ninjas bring along a friend who knows how to salvage quickly and efficiently and safely at the same time that youre generating all those lovely wreckskirana ive been giving some thought to your idea of a safer safe haven for light industry it might work but the same issues would apply once a newer player like me begins to move out into the colder crueler wider world same issues just delayedbesides ganking and piracy are just as common in rl as in gl ask anyone in a commercial or private ship traveling off of east africa or through any indonesian shipping lanerl or gl it happens plan adjust strategize prepare and if need be bring along friends with guns
sure but the difference is in the distinction between piracy off the coast of long beach california vs piracy passing the somali coast i havent seen many news reports of pirates ganking ships coming out of seattle or tokyoand yes the same conditions would exist outside the safer space but thats the point we wouldnt remove the conditions that currently exist because they are realistic we would just shift them to a position that accentuates the realism you go outside the hight security population centers and you are fair game but thats where the money is and yah from time to time there will be a high sec heist just not these constant arbitrary ganks of noobs and low isk soft targets in my eys they hinder the game the longer it takes some noob to build up enough to actually be worth killing the longer they take to add value not to mention how many of them quit before they every make it character judgments aside its a waste of everyones time eve can and should be a brutal place but is making it brutal from end to end really the best wayits more about diversifying eve and less about protecting anyone that is really just a side effect the more similar the rules and conditions are throughout the game the more homogenous and boring it can be because then people will have the tendency to aggregate into limited areas and play the entire game within a few jumps of that area you just have to look at jita or rens or any market hub to see that too many just hang out therethe usual argument against my sort of thinking is that if we create a safer space everyone will just stay there and there wont be anyone to hunt outside of the safe space but i dont think that would be the case at all there will be some that will be true for but i think the majority will venture out and penetrate every area and besides it would be safer not safei would also redistribute missions move most of the combat missions outside of the safer zones because one would imagine that the factional navy of that space wouldnt need mercs to patrol their core space for them but they would in the outer reaches where there are less patrols add more freight run missions that go out etc etcon you salvage scenario thats not really a ninja situation if i am reading you right if someone abandons salvage even to go swap ships then its abandoned ninja to me is when you are there salvaging your wrecks or still killing them and someone comes and salvages youagain i dont think this should be banned but i do think i should be able to shoot you but it sounds like ccp ruled on that id be curious to know their thinking behind it its hard to know their mind sometimes
well done kirana now i get it excellent comparison using the geography it sometimes takes a while but i can usually get there im not sure if ccp would go with it but the idea might have merit with the following as suggested addonsthose who choose to reside in these safer safe havens get clear notice that they are inhabiting safer safe havens step outside and nobody will be remotely interested in any boohoohoosthere is no such thing as a free lunch want the higher level of safety then you register with an npc in that safe haven and pay a substantially higher tax to offset the cost of the protectionfor the salvaging  ninja topic apologies for being unclear when i salvage for team members i am as close to the action as i can safely manuever the salvager doing everything possible to clear wrecks asap without getting blown up ruins my day that and i get no end of joking from my teamkinda tough to get ninja salvaged as long as im not supplying one of the wrecks fly safe
yeah i am not looking to make gallente fotm although it would be nice ccp has been systematically nerfed gallente ships over the last 3 years and that must stop my vote goes to the candidate who is willing to protect gallente ships from further nerfing and put all the balancing issues affecting gallente in the agenda blaster boats diemost sleepers hate of drones helios model  etc
the last 2 surveys have been a great success but there is still far more to learn and far more questions to askin the first survey ship ballancing scored high in the question of what ccp should be focussing on and id like to know more about where the balancing is needed according to you the playersthe questions will be pretty general giving me a guideline to work with from there on i can better determine where and how i need to get more specificplease take a moment to fill in this survey and let everybody know what you feel needs to change in terms of ship balancing herethank youaynen
holy keyloggers batman
explain
well its not that farfetched to asume im another keylogger placing links on the forum like that luckily im not though 
that might fit into cosmos certainly not the eve clientthere is a balance that needs to be achieved survey tools could be very very immersionbreaking in general i dont think that surveys are worth doing on a regular basis as people will become apathetic to them
there is another way to study accurately what the players want which might be used since ccp can see what people do on their servers they have loads of statistics about player behavior those statistics could be usefull to the csm too if they get access to them unfortunately the risk of apathy towards surveys is real but for now its the best tool at my disposal and i plan to run it into the ground

as you may be aware ccp plan to dramatically improve the 00 experience with the dominion patchplayers will have the opportunity to drop billions of isk on fun sovereignty charges and will really enjoy spending even more to upgrade space so that the limit on how many players a system can support can be around 1012further isk returns from activity may in some cases reach 80 of level 4 mission rates in empireempire players you are missing out on all the funhigh sec needs to be boosted in the same waygive the high sec corps the same enjoyment from paying a few hundred million a month to earn the right to dock in jitalets give mission runners the chance to pay regular fees to set a limit of 15 pilots missioning in motsualso lets limit payout to the more enjoyable rate enjoyed by anomaly rats in 00 about 70 of belt rat bountiesif 00 is getting this huge boost then empire pos owners should also have the chance to be forced to pay for happyfun upgrades so that they too can enjoy 2 extra anomalies in systemfor too long empire players have suffered under risk free generation of limitless missions and have been deprived of the opportunity to pay arbitrary rent to faceless beaureaucratspeople of empireclaim your birthright demand the same buffs that 00 players are receiving with this patch
why yes deldrac this is a fine proposal which i support wholeheartedly you handsome lovable rogue you
as per the recent blog it appears to be a widely held view that none of the proposed resource upgrades will have anything like the power of a single level 4 agent and that people will be drawn towards increased highsec mission running to support the new maintenance bills in particular it is difficult to see how any one system could support the activities of 100150 people which was apparently ccps stated goalthus for systems with suitable upgrades anchored i propose unlocking npc agents at preexisting outposts as the systems military index increases starting with level 1 and eventually reaching level 5 as more missions are completed
i can support this if ccp would introduce a way for people to actually run these agents in the space they holdchances are if youve been living in 00 the local pirate agents wont like you very much
shouldnt be difficult make the agents employees of the sov holder and spawn mission encounters in systems with that sovccp have said that creating agents in the first place is hardtm but as theyve made clear doing anything useful is also out of the question and as they are desperate to make missions the only viable source of individual isk in the game they are left with this as their only choice
id support a similar idea  instead of having you run missions for the local pirates import agents from pirate factions hostile to themas an example lets say you were constantly butchering blood raider rats in belts eventually this brings angel cartel and serpentis agents to your outposts the factions blood raiders mostly send you against in missions to subvert their influence which allows you to run missions for them in your space this allows and rewards people to continue ratting the more you rat the bigger and better the agents get while making mission running a viable optioni have no idea how this would work for drone space
first option that comes to mind  have a militarybased upgrade where if you have military x you can hire level x agents at your outpost you have a choice of 23 factions based on region and choice in agent type agents will cost money for upkeep and a lot of money at higher levelsl4l5 should be measured in billions a month no cap on agents but each one costs individually  if you want to pay triple the cash for 3 l4 combat agents so you can have mission selection go for it this doesnt need to be the system used of course anything that allows big population densities100 online in a system not fighting is fine by me and i dont much care if its by upgrading a system to having a couple l4 agents or by having 60 belts with an effective truesec of 2 and quadruple factionofficer rat spawn rates but it needs to be able to support population densities at least within hailing distance of highsec for any of the other stuff to work sensibly im fine with cynojammers costing an arm and a leg but the systems are going to need to be able to earn those arms and legs reasonably im no 00 expert but i dont see how that is supposed to be the case in the current proposal
i believe they talked about this or answered a short question regarding this on fanfest could be wrong thoughgood idea anyway
nothing more to say
atleast make somethin that may benefit holders of space even though small their members will actually use the agents i would also go so far as to say a 1 tax on all mission rewards go to holder alliance but atleast these agents would be useful 
ok the cries from pvpers about a upgrade that will require people to do pve would be fun even more when they will be required to protect them for the good of the alliance supportedseriously it is a good option but from my experience in 00 most pvpers will simply ate on first sight those using the agents in 00
they wont eat their own and might tolerate others too if some of their income gets taxed to the wallet of the sov holder something that might happen with the implementation of contracts between corps and alliances even in the worst case they might be treated more like cattle they would be tolerated and protected since the income they provide allows pvp people to focus on other thingseven though im not a fan of missions they are so convenient and lucrative that for a combat oriented character it is a very good option to have even if you have other income sources not to mention taht pvp doesnt just happen and you dont always have the time or inclination for it so you need other activities to keep people from getting bored making some decent money while doing it certainly wouldnt hurt either
signedi support this proposal as it would create additional taxable income for alliances and reduce the need for highsec altshowever i would love to hear some thoughts on how this idea would work out with regards to lowsec mission hubs and npc 00imho lowsec npc 00 and 00 with sov should retain or get clearly separated roles in the game and this proposal would eliminate one of the central differences between them
ill support the idea based on the principle but the fact is ccp will take many detours just to avoid this because their current system is heavily reliant upon there being real stations in the area however i will not go into further details about this instead let me just say ccp shrug as soon as someone mentions itsome day soon we might see this happen but only if there is enough room for them to squeeze it in side by side with another simple featurein reality afaik there is nothing simple about it
a few more thoughtsthis would be more of a constellationwide upgrade as missions often involve moving around a bit it would make sense for agents only to appear once sov has been held across an entire constellation for a considerable length of time so that people are not sent out behind enemy linesit would also involve coming up with a means of dynamically generating agents which are currently static and avoiding complications arising from agents disappearing or being downgraded after reduced activity ie it would need to happen slowly enough for people to have time for their missions to be completed or to expire naturallycourier missions would be out of the question as theres no guarantee that people running them would have the required docking rights mining  marketbased missions would make a decent substitute
yeah voting for the win
noif you want agents go to npc space or go to empire
supported this is one of the upgrades that should be done and done quickly
totally supporting this plz dont tell us that it wont work you already have agents in space what the db issue with just getting some more into 00
agents are the only major income source that is taxable by corporations in this game that allow population scaling if they want diffuse active sources of income as stated by one devb this is the main goal they should strive for
do itdo it
id like 00 as a place where you can attract neutral agents to your outposts who can give you unique ships like the fury styx ixion swordspine medusa etci dont think the mechanic should rely on upgrades though and alliances should be able to take away agents from one another andor damage outposts to stop the agent missions temporarilypermeantely
if ccp allow me to run level 4 missions from alliance outposts id actually move back to 00 againhowever rather then locking people out by automatically assigning this or that faction or by allowing an alliance to pick a single faction to have agents from they should let players communicate with their existing agents from inside the outposts the level of agent you can talk to would depend on the infrastructure levelthis will allow all alliance members to move back to 00 to run missions there without adding new problems related to everyones standings it allows for a nearly unlimited number of alliance members to generate isk per star system owned this increases activity in 00 allowing for more pvp
so were just giving up and admitting null sec corps carebears

dont forget that for each mission runner running solo there is a pocket with those 2030 ships shooting at that mission runnerso for a system with 30 players each running a pocket it grows to 600  900 npcs shooting at themin my proposal there will be a set number of missions active at the same time many of those missions will have more than one person in each pocket either working as a team or trying to beat each other to the objectives less missions actively running means even more room for cpu cyclesyou didnt read the first post in the thread i assume there is a sample of what the briefing should look like and that sample is just that a samplethat particular sample was written to highlight the exploration concept the one type of mission where you would need a scanner ship to find the enemy and carefully assess the situation before going in guns blazingso your statement about my system giving 0 information is incorrect and all you are managing to accomplish here is being an ass about my ideaif one gang of 10 players manage to do one mission that nets them 200 million isk and that takes them 2 hours to complete they share 20 million isk each that is quite possible what the average mission runner makes today 10 million per hournow if another gang of 10 players do 10 missions that each reward 20 million and they are done in the same time two hours then the net effect is that each member gained 20 million over 2 hoursit is up to each and every gangplayer to decide if they can do the mission or not some players will have less skills and experience and might settle for the less rewarding missions but every once in a while they will encounter a mission that rewards them greatly for something quite trivial and sometimes they might be underpaid thats all part of the dynamic system you have to do your research before you embark on your mission instead of just hitting undock warp to the mission activate your tank and wait for your drones or fof missiles to do the job for youedit whoopsedit 2if the rewards are imbalanced ccp can easily adjust some figures in the mission generator as opposed to the current mechanic where they have to rebalance many different missions
yeah srry dude i might have answered a bit bitter but the fact is that mission in its current state is the best isk making way in eve and that in the safety of empire and still are people not happy about it i understand its dull after running the 2000st mission with a heavly faction pimped cnr u should try some plexes in 00 they are good fun to do
you are so enamoured of you presentation that dont see the flaws as herschel pointed out and as it was said several times in the linked thread you have overdone it drowning the good point in a lot of useless jabberabout your comment computer generate briefing for a lego mission will not work decentlyyou really think that a briefing with ours guy were slaughtered by insert npc group in mission they had insert descriptive work from someseverala few insert ship class both depending from mission composition find them in insert bookmark will be really useful or it will end like you suggest in the thread with people jumping in noob frigates to see the enemythen look what you suggested as a possible briefing blood raiders have killed a paladin search for them starting at point xwow informative you see you should scrap that thread and keep only the reduced version in this thread it is way better than your lengthy presentationto repeat it again seeing how ccp work complex lego structure like the one you suggest will not work to much different parts to join together to make a mission the end result will be a frankenstein monstera functional system should have more variables that the current one but cant have so many that it will become uncontrollable you as most people trying to balance missions are trying to balance them only around old pilots doing level 4 with ships worth several hundred millions at least forgetting that they should be doable by new players too it is almost granted that mission done with your system will kill new players mopst of the tiemsigh you again show total disregard about how balancing work with a absurd examplefirst even the simple act of warping to 10 different missions will eat enough time to make very hard to do them in 2 hourssecond your proposed system has no controls to avoid easy missions with high payoutthird 10 players running the same mission wow refugee i dont want to have to assemble a damned 10 players gang every time i want to run a mission if i assemble 10 players is for something different and it require preparationmaking 10 man raids the norm is the worst thing you can do to this game scrapping mission totally will be less destructive
i understand no worries i too agree that missions are way biased in terms of risk vs reward and the potential they have of slinging out massive rewards in contrast to other activities in eve that is the sole reason why i suggest that missions will actually kill the runner if hes not paying attention going in with a cookie cutter setup cnr will only amount to them losing that shipin other words they are expected to lose ships once in a while and the rewards therefore will not be as great as before all things consideredwhat makes you so sure this is exactly how its going to bealso thanks for the constructive suggestion that being allow the npcs to pod you if you show up on their doorstepthose missions that will get you kill will also allow you to warp in with a cloaked ship such as a covert ops and assess the situationthe only missions that will have acceleration gates are the ones that are as easy as the current level 4 missions but they will have the crappiest rewards and the npcs in there will have a bunch of failfits those missions are what you might refer to go in and kill all targets in the deadspace area return with the objectivefor everything else while it may take a lot of testing and fine tuning there will be nicely constructed briefings that give you just enough information to not be killed in the mission if the mission is to assess the situation the briefing will tell you to assess the situation if you dont then you didnt want that ship anywaysits good that you have an opinion about what i really meant but i can tell you this much i dont agree with what you are insinuating about methe only thing i had in mind as for who can run these missions was that no matter what you fly you will be killed in it eventually if you dont take the necessary steps to prevent it from happeningthere will be super difficult missions and there will be super easy mission to pick from in the pool if new players pick the difficult versions they might be able to complete them with real skillsin the current mechanic the npcs are at a set difficulty per mission new players attempting attack of the drones for example will quickly learn that killing the initial 4 cruiser sized drones will get them killed so they wont do that next time and now they can finish that mission perfectly every timethen they get worlds collide which they will die in if they dont have enough tanking skills no matter what they doin the new system they get a chance to with some experience avoid getting killed especially since subscribing to a mission isnt the same as accepting one in the current system if they decline a mission they accepted in the current system they lose standings they dont want that
it is a very simple solution we know ccp is monitoring player activity in the system now anyway to determine eligibility for upgrades why not use this activity to reduce the upkeep paid more activity  less upkeep this way we solve multiple problems in one fell swoop no difficulty in taxation of players since their activity indirectly pays for the upgrades by reducing their cost players who are not part of the alliance that has sovereignity still contribute solving cvas problem amongst others it will still prevent afk empires by having those alliances without activity pay the full amount
im supporting this after reading the latest devblog about ccps solution to allow more people to make a living in 00 my preferred solution would be to provide more rewards and activities that actually allow much more people to make a full time living in 00 this solution wont affect that but would help to convince alliances to be more tolerant to small operators in their area so it might be a good thing regardless what happens with the infrastructure upgrades
i like this proposal itd address a lot of the concerns going around  not nearly all but enough to be worth doing
when i read the title i thought you were suggesting more activitymore upkeepi like your idea
its a start
after reading the latest dev blog about sov upgrades it is nice to see we have a development team so out of wack with our community and how 00 works we get idiotic ideas like this was it that hard to buff the rat bounties and remove cruiser and below spawns 00 systems will not hold anywhere near the 50100 people the dev have been spouting but i guess someone who never actually played the game wouldnt know this
signedfix the price
obvious issue is obvious
in agreement with every other 00 pilot on this
well done ccp what an epic fail theres now way they can actualy play this game  come up with what they have
fully agreedand finally nerf that truesec  in 00 boost the ore values of 00 boost the rat spawns at least get rid of the plexbounties in 00 plexes and anomalies the current hub is a joke
as a 00 nomad i am looking forward to seeing less sovereignty and more wildfree space in my null sec wanderings i do not think this is a bad thing
so for an alliance to hold sov in 20 systems they need only pay for 100 towers  as if this isnt completely within their means if titans showed anything its that isk is never a barrier to entry so why is the only requirement for holding lots of empty space a bill in the wallet every 2 weeks in addition if i sneak into someones space and do their plexes they benefit by keeping their infrastructure levels intact denial of activity is not achieved solely through force of arms having in effect carebear wars would introduce a new aggression dynamic to how people interact to that end i propose the following changessystems to have a minimum activity requirement to hold sovactivity to count only if done by the alliance or party subject to treatyonce this is in place some thought could also be given to this proposal
no alliances should not be made to have activity in that area if they want to hold sov thats ed
well i will second wat jpnwobigheadz is saying  mainly because he is correct about the drones being hit and miss with drones mining large rocks actually mine them and the drones do cause lag mainly when they r being pulled back to ship
no and how exactly does an aoe module only effect certain targets
the ships computers manage to convert capacitor energy into a pulse that doesnt damage the bombers ship hence the smart is it so far fetched that perhaps with the assistance of an additional lowpower module that the pulse could be stabilized or directed to omit fleet membersill admit that a hostiles only script would be going too far but would anyone actually object to scripts that would trade range for damage or reduce cycletime at the cost of selfdamage kamikazesmartbombs as they are play an extremely narrow role and the small and medium sized modules are close to useless rather than just universally boosting their range or power wouldnt you rather see some minor customization a smidjin of versatility added  i think that scripts would be perfect even if it took a lowslot module to load them into
i support the idea of scripts that load into the sb for more range less dps less range more dps kamikaze more dps  self damagethe other ones would be too imbalancing and would make the bombs actually smart the name is more of a euphemism tbh
smartbombs role is to destroy drones or if youre in jita to kill you every carrier and sc fits smartbombs for antidrones its what theyre used for the only drones that smartbombs will relatively not effect are sentries since they dont move obviously and fighter bombers they orbit just outside t2 smartbomb range
smartbombs are just fine the way they are if youre using them as an offensive mechanism then youre most likely doing it wrong theyre to defend against drones and little  frigs that are right up in your facealso if you want to talk rp rather than game mechanics smartbombs exclude you from taking damage by creating the energy pulse outside your ship the blast isnt somehow programmed to not damage you it never comes in contact with you its an aoe weapon and thats what its for dont ask ccp to change it just because your fc gets mad at you for being careless just stop being careless
i think it is unrealistic that in empire market upkeep is free who runs the markets behind the stations the databases etc just like how they imposed taxes on npc corporations for payment to concord for policing etc sales in empire should have a sales tax it doesnt have to be exorbitant and make it smaller as security status goes lower until in 00 the player run sovereignty holders can choose how much the tax is where it goes etc this would help encourage the sandbox approach by encouraging both 00 empires  empire industrialists to interact and cooperate in order to prosper hauling will become more lucrative  necessary both 00 alliances and empire tradersindustrialists will be rewarded by working together and it will open the way for all sorts of interaction instead of just the machinelike monotonous take it to jita and sell itperhaps this could even open the way for actual financial statement presentation for 00 empires to account for where their taxes are spent on an empire that is open and seemingly more trustworthy would attract more empire industrialists to trade in their markets because they would know or think they know what their taxes are spent on profit will be had both for empire industrialists  00 nations to work together and it will create a tougher economic situation for those that choose not to work with the rest of the universe
npc stations have a sales tax and a broker fee
should really put a corp tax on the npc corps while you are at it11

1st of all im strongly disagree on a state that the new players are attracted by the new expansions the expansions are the thing that keep the old players who got the experience in the game and bored i remember the time when i first got to eve  and thats not an expansion what brought me here i just searched the elite remake and found the article about eve the main question is not why i tried eve but why i stayed in this gamethe first is  noobs were wanted in this game by older players by their corporations and alliances frigs were needed in the fleets you were equal amongst the others when you just entered the game no matter on skills you have and ships you can fly when the t1 frigs and cruisers will be declined in fleets  we would have a serious problem with a new players stay in game assault ab boost is bad the second thing is expansions yes but not every expansion made me happy and there were several times when i was about quitting the game  guess why loosing ships in lags and bugs the issues grows in every expansions we have and the longer we wait the more problems we have so there could be a critical mass that no one could overcome as for the positive responses for a bug fixing well thats what people are they just take it as it suppose to be since its a bugs and therefore dev mistakes they never says thanks for that as it said in the laws of online world design by raphael koster i dont say that the big content expansions are bad i just want them with no haste and polished

now that is what i am talking about exactly right now people whine mostly because its so ambiguous there are thoughts about why things are the way they are but not much in the way of fact granted its usually noobs whining but then that triggers all manner of counter whining and bla bla bla but your second point is the real deal that is the sort of balance i am talking about safer doesnt mean easier or free it just means that among the things you have to deal with the constant threat of gank isnt one of them and when you get tired of paying for your safety get bored of mining veldspar or feel like you are ready for the big boy game you can go outside the bubble meanwhile the big players who are moving serious money around inside the bubble still have to worry because even with the higher security it might still be worth ganking themanother thought i had to go along with the safe zones is some system of licensing to mine along with it making more sense for the factional government to protect its citizens in the core systems it would also make sense that resources wouldnt be free different grades of mining licenses would allow carebears to mine safely but at a price i was thinking of a mid slot module that loads script like licenses that get burned on a cycle different script types for different lasers and maybe even different ore types a couple examples would be a standard laser grade veldspar license or a strip laser grade scordite license module isnt running lasers dont work refining tax is separate from this since that goes to the station corp these fees are applied by the root faction can flipping would still be in play as much as i think can flipping is a cheesy tactic its still a well designed mechanic that makes sense as it there is a counter that prevents it and if you choose not to counter it ie not to jet can mine then at least you have the option to attack the flipper
and who would that be i didnt see anyone listed on the csm candidate page who is a member of eve university
i dont think so but dierdra made a great effort with that vote match help tool so players can decide what candidate they wish to vote for
basically i just wanted to let everyone know heres a thread where you can  at me or say whatever you want heres a website that gets tons of spam comments and i dont really pay atention to
until the iceland minutes are published no one from csm3 is worthy of reelection
i dont normally mind people taking shots at my opponents but this is completely unfair blame the secretary if you like but a random norole member like zastrow has no real influence over when the minutes get published
there were reports that mr zastrow was using his csm delegate status to bring confidential information to his corporation andor alliance which got an unfair advantage with the upcoming dominion changesafaik this particular case was about the new outpost system and how it will be much harder to take them and they will be very beneficial to the sov holders
then its a shame he didnt tell us it was going to cost infinity isk per day to hold them
that totally fits my program gallente is the one who needs the urgent boost railguns are awful guns rebalance is a primary goal dumpers was nerfed too hardeos sucks we see a gila in dominion so was the eos overpowered after all arazu needs 5th med drone omg you gived the drones even to a falcon most of lp and faction stuff are uselessdam even my gallente pos is buggy no wander they are loosing in fw
changes needed sinsin needs 2000 base power more a lol 8800 ccp did u forgot a 1 in front of the 8800 redeemer has 17000 base power base power on a semi hybrid boat is failremove all turret slots and replace 5  hybrid damage bonus for a 25m3 drone bandwidth usage bonus per gallente bs level and increase max drone usage from 5 to 10 max dps 950 with ogreschange agility bonus to a 75 bonus in max velocity of drone flight time give sin the special bonus of scooping drones from 7500 meters and deploying drones at 5000 meter redeemerneed a 30 boost in large pulse damage and a reduction from 125m3 drone to 25m3 drone bandwidthwidowneeds a 200 cpu boostneeds 25 boost in torpedo dpsneeds a slight boost in cap recharge 1020pantherneeds 1 extra mid slotneeds a 40 boost in projectile dps and a reduction from 125m3 to 25m5 drone bandwidthvelocity bonus need to be changed in a 10 fall off bonus per black op levelchanges in generalrange increase from max 45ly to 65lyrange formula should get an exception that the black op can always jump 1 system jump some systems with  45ly 10ly20ly a to b with 45ly range need to be done manually in the current statestandard fuel bay increase from 1000m3 to 3000m3a bonus should be given to the fuel bay amount when a black op jump portal is fitted it will add a additional x amount of m3 of fuel bay per black op level example adds 3000m3 to fuel bay per black op level the black op jump portal should give a 10 reduction in fuel usage of that module per black op level currently a recon that bridges uses 15001600 fuel while only 6666 fits in the fuel baynewall bo should use same type of fuel
1220 light years no way that is way over powered now i would be more for a 25 boost in range max it is a battleship not a capital ship change your proposal to something more reasonable and i will give it a thumbs up

in response to those that have given a variation of quit empire wars if you dont like their mechanics as a replyavoiding a problem does not count as a solution
supported but id like my logistics alt to not have to wait outside a gate before reentering into my mission system after remote repping me in a neighboring system during a mission however i think the moderate inconvenience that your proposal would cause in my scenario is far better than the current game mechanics
blaster problems in my view1 a problem with all subbs ship fitting and bonuseson all ships there is one type of blaster worth fitting the neutron blaster everything else and you do not in fact have that significant damage advantage over other weapon systems up close making blasters pointless this is a problem because all subbs ship bar mega cannot fit neutron blasters without fitting mods and paper ehpthis results in a line of ships which are worthless at ranges theyre supposed to dominate at namely point blank excepting the odd drone shiptake the brutix the only way youll get a bc which has a damage advantage up close is by fitting neutrons 3 mfs and a shield tank as a result you get a paperthin ship which even when it does get to its optimal range aside from horribly dying to anything smaller then it dies to proper bcs which can in fact gank and tank at the same timemyrmidon works much the same way although gets a better passable generally tank in return for a smaller dps advantage over its opponents up close it also has a for pvp purposes stupid active rep bonus for solo work low dps is a horrible idea for gang work active repping is generally a bad choice on top of low dps being a horrible ideafrigates are plagued with split weapon systems or being tier 2 in case of incursus thorax is plagued by inability to fit buffer and neutrons vexor is good because drones plus small guns work on the ship thanks to the dps output of the bonused 75m3 drone combinationdiemost is a 110 million thorax it also suffers from ed fitting not to mention that the idea of a point blank hac is probably bad anywayastarte has all the brutix problems again the ship if fit for tank becomes trash because of damage output if fit for gank its too paperthin2 generic problem with up close damage of blasterscurrent dps figures of competing ships are such that you only have some form of advantage over them with neutrons and even then the advantage is very minute at best combined with fitting issues it means that you can often kill blasterboats in their optimal i fly minmatar and do it all the time  after one point i decided that kiting blasterboats is tedious when you can just reload to hail and show them whos boss at 1km not to mention the horrible death if they have to actually sustain damage while closing rangethe damage advantage is just a bit too low as it is which when compounded with fitting issues and useless bonuses on subbs well hurts blastersalso do not rebalance things looking at scorch in sight its a ammo which provides you with a 124 boost to range over high dps faction which is a bit frivolous and out of line with everything else like javelins null barrageboosts need to be aimed at making blasters better in the area where theyre supposed to have a advantage and in fixing the whole load of subbs ships which are generally trash
a sniper zealot cant aggro at station either a sniper zealot cant do sentry damage at 80km a sniper zealot cant chase down an enemy due to its lack of defenses eft is a perfect valid damage presenting tool and i never said ishtars were better snipers i just said their dps was high with a large optimal and i like how you completely left out the parts that you have no argument against like how the ishtar and deimos are completely superior at closer ranges anyways eft works just fine hate you superior i can do it myself hurr my math is better than computers  inappropriate text removed  ccp ildoge
lol what do you even pvp which sentry goes to 80 km sine when is heavy drones good at taking on hacs and tell me how is deimos and ishtar being superior at close range the only way a deimos can outdamage a zealot is to fit neutron blasters couple with void ammo void ammo gives a 50 in tracking which does not show up on the dps of eft means at close range against anything that has a transversial velocity such as a zealot it does pathetic damage and thats exactly the reason why this thread exist people are moaning because blasters are supposed to be superior at close range but they are actually notso while a blaster deimos looks although it has a higher dps in a real closerange fight it does less dps no i cant do maths better than a computer but what i can do better is use my brain and battle experience and a computer cant do that oh forgot to mention you cant even seem to use eft with all skills at v with 2 heat sinks ii and heavy pulse laser ii a zealot actually does 406 dps with scorch even with no heat sinks zealot with hpii does 301 dps so please tell me where does your 276 comes from also when equipped with the 75km sentry drone warden ii and no guns a ishtar does 338 damage that is actually less than a 5gun zealot nafiy
first of all the ishtar is not a good sniper hac as youll be movingaligning somewhere all the time leaving no option for the use of sentry drones because youll just fall out of range of scooping themsecond on the zealot vs deimos argument the zealot can do instant damage at a variety of ranges with quite a bit of tank while the deimos to actually be used needs to have a 1600mm plate and needs to burn towards its opponent to actually apply damage while its speed isnt that good either of course theres a lot of variables to take into account such as warpin distance and whatever but in general blaster boats could use more base speedreduced mass or a significant boost to damage or look up the thread for some awesome suggestionsalso a zealot vs deimos fight is actually a dumb example because the zealot is a sniper and has range bonuses while the deimos is not really geared to be a sniper although it can fill that role and its supposed to be an in yo face gankboat and for that role i can say that a shield brutix before you start flaming me for even combinating those two terms go and check it out yourself theyre pretty good boats although it doesnt have the agility and speed of a deimos in terms of numbers it has a similar tank much more damage output and it doesnt suffer from plates penaltiesso past that i want to bring up a especific thing thats been bothering me a bit which is gallente command ships nomenately the astarte i believe the armor rep bonus should be upped to 10 because right now it is not worth the buck i reckon its role is for small gang warfare so that small rep bonus doesnt do the trick compared to the almighty absolutionbut anyways thats an issue worth a whole different thread this one is about boosting blasters
zealot does 301 with multifrequency i used scorch ammo because 276 people are crying about the range being too huge a zealot with 75km range cannot do 338 damage even with 3 heat sinks and aurora ammo so its not less than a 5 gun zealot firing at the same range heavy beam laser iiand the deimos is superior in close range because it has drones 5 medium tech ii hammerheads a scrambled zealot with hammerheads and hybrids on it will die very fast to a deimosthe gallente specialize in close quarters combat so dont try to change that with federation navy antimatter a deimos also will hit harder than a zealot with amarr navy multifrequency even without drones
and a full neutronfit deimos will just die faster than anybody when scrambled your point ever wondered why the deimos was called the diemost
dont see why not
would definitely support some kind of email or even telephone confirmation could also be very good
this is excellent proposal but i think that locking time should be longer 2 weeks or even one month
suuupooorteedddd
hi supporting thing
well the little icons in the corner are a good ideabut how about just putting a star slightly belowright of the center one for faction two for deadspace and three for officer make them somewhat higher contrast or coloredbut yeah be a good idea but as with blueprint originalcopy issues they wont do it by claiming additional server load or some crap
but think of the scammers wait dont
interesting that this isnt ingame yetthere could only be some problemes with modules that are in fact t2 and factionofficerhistorywhatever  like the smokescreen covert ops cloaking device ii but that would be in my eyes very much a minor problem
supported
the proposal to have login times displayed i think is a great ideasupported
i found a 1010 escatation with a few friends we warped to the gate any only 1 got trough apparently u need the skill leadership v to enter the plex i think the skill requirement is too high my proposal is the adjust this or remove it
lollet me make a stabhigh energy physics lvl 1haha you fail
leadership 5 for the centus assembly tp co 1010 plexdo u have it
actually i do as im a carrier pilot
if it is for a bonus wing of the site i have no issues with itif it is to get into the site itself or to complete the site i think that is a problemi have not encountered the site so do not know which it itashina for csm
it is for entering the first gate of the plex
looks like it is worth looking into then ccp wants more people doing exploration and this is something that would be limiting the ability of players to do content for some reason this may be their intention or it is something that just has been overlooked over timeashina sito for csm
bumpimao t2 sentries should get those 10 because they are stationary gun platforms and therefore should not moove but have slightly bigger guns otherwise we get imbalance between t1 setries being stronger then t2 heavies but t2 heavies being stronger then t2 setries which does not make sence
yes they need some love they need new upgrades and rigs
use a bit of logic pleasea mission is reenginered to require a groupb as mission require a group all the people missioning will be subject to attacks or are required to kill the rats before the tank of those targeted failc having 5 ships with strained tanks and whose dps are needed to kill the npc will not help you against pirates more than having a ship with a strained tank and whose dps are needed to kill the npc will help you as long as the npc target only the people already running the mission the pirates will have a huge advantage
considering lvl 5s are basically lvl 4s that you have to passive shield tankso on that basis alone theres plenty of incentive to do missions in lowsecwhat happens they take covop into lowsec get lvl 5 missions declined until they give one in highsec do the lvl 5 mission in highsecthe issue isnt in the value and incentives of the missions its the threat pvp you either do missions or you do pvp you cant do bothin my opinion from my experiences the sleepers ai in making you fit for pvp doesnt really address this from my experience people who do go pvp those fighting the sleepers end up getting killed by the sleepers and not those themselvesso if you really want to fix the lowsec missions issue give the rats ai that switch up and smoke any pirates who come into the missionthusly the mission runners can continue tanking for pve but when pvpers come into the mission they better be quick in killing you or they will almost certainly die to the rats
tldr but supporting because op is handsome and loveable
why should we hog the fun
equal opportunity for all
not supporting supporting not supporting this topic
nope just saying there should be a way to maintain a good income for the individual pilot without the need for a highsec carebear alt
from the wise vaults of shcmy 02isk an alliance tax for all the new bounties and loot logs but corp members can also be paid a percentage of what the corp is making a monththat way we can get ours from passive incomes alsoand a real bankstock market system would not hurt to incentivize alliancescale moneymaking in eve either
to quote joshua back on shc
get new programmers ccp your programmer obviously sucks just look at the mail boxsupport
sounds reasonable supported
thats sounds not only better but also easier this would probably solve the problem of income in 00 all together
we now have 3 candidates slated for the next show we will put a cap at 6 candidates as any more on a single show will make the show move really slow and well have to allocate less time per candidate to reply to questionsstill 3 empty slotsalso besides email also send me an evemail just to be on the safe side i think there might be an issue with our mail forwarders
yay for me posting with my dj alt p
what if you get half of the mwd sig penalty when you are in deadspace or when you are scrammed when you have it on it still has its fitting and cap requirement unchanged and it has has speed bonus of the equivalent meta lvl ab would still be usefull but not as effective
right now jumping from high sec into a wormhole is 100 safe because youre in jump range when you land theres a session change cloak and theres no way of not being able to simply jump outfrom what ive seen there is a 4 minute countdown after youve jumped through a wormhole two times but only the regular session change timer after youve jumped once i propose a timer for wormholes is in effect every time you jump even the first time for 212 minutes or more unknown space should be scary after all the warning even comes up telling you concord wont protect you there and its dangerousplease prove me wrong if i am because from what ive seen theres no way of catching people there with interdiction
the current mechanics avoid getting ganked everytime you jump through which is imho good we dont need another place like entrance gates where people are just camping to gank people
pvp is hard enough to find in eve seriously wormholes are care bear space too now its too damn safe people find a wormhole jump through see people jump out wow big loss there right every action should have consequences and this one doesnt seem to have any other than the fact of wasting 45 seconds probing down the wormhole
there are still enough ways to die in a wormhole and ganking people on a gatewormhole is not pvp its just gankingmaybe try syndicate lots of pewpew there or providence or fw area
i fully support this makes those 4 years of wasted training time become usefull and fun again
atm i find it silly that corp contracts have the same 2 weeks life expectancy of the public contracts many corps want to have buysell orders that appeal to the corp members alone for industry or ship replacement programs but having the same contract lifetime of the public contracts2 weeks makes it pretty bothersome
note this is long and mildly wallotexty if you wish to see the net point of the post scroll down to the tldrproblem with the new system currently outlined in this devblog the costs associated with holding a system are paid fully in isk additionally the costs for upkeep do not seem to be directly tied to any external factors level of activity number of other systems owned hostile action in the system etcproposed solution before i go into it im just going to outline a really quick assumption the assumption is that ccp in the current iteration of the sov system are trying to create an isk sink in 00 in the form of upkeep costs with that out of the waythe solution i propose consists of two parts 1 give the tcu a fuel bay and set the fuel requirements to be nonflexible ill discuss this in more detail in a bit and 2 have the system upgrades be a pure isk cost that is flexible based on activity levelto elaborate1 giving tcu a fuel bay yes i know what youre going to say but why thatll just make it pos 20 not quite or at least not in this particular scenario you see poses currently require two things  ice products player mined and npc goods my proposal for the fuel bay is give it a fixed requirement of x ice products per month where x is the number equal to the amount a large faction pos uses for example and a flexible requirement on the amount of npc goods tied to system activity number of jumpgates and the amount of isk ccp desires a certain level of activity to be chargedto explain this a bit further npc goods  isk sink for the most part player activity can result in some of them but for the most part a majority of the goods currently used in poses come from npc sell orders therefore having npc goods be a part of the fuel requirement is closely equivalent to having an isk cost with one major difference being an item which requires hauling it maintains some of the logistic overhead required to own space think 1 dst of fuel per month in terms of cost one large poss worth of npc goods per month may be a good reference point for a sov 0 inactive systemas a part of this change there also should be the following change done to the npc goods uncap the prices for all of them fully ie speculators could drive a price up in a hub to 10m per unit if they wanted to and reseed them all at 1 isk per unit on dominion day why two reasons a levels the playing field for initial deployment and b allows market forces and 00 uptake aka busyness to dictate the base price of owning spacefinally the upkeep option should be kept but maintained as a maximum fee for the tcu and also as a means to keep it online without full fuel requirements2 keeping the upgrades as a constant isk cost if you read the previous section you may have thought this guy wants a pos well no what i think would make sense from both future and current points of view is a place where you need some level of logistics and market interaction to get started however once youre started in your system there should be no reason beyond maintaining a baselevel functionality of the tcu for you to have to spend any more time on activities not directly related to making your space awesome as such the notion of iskmonth for upgrades makes sense since this comes directly from using your space so ideally the addition of an upgrade should be a pretty simple decision based on how much you use your system and not a decision based on how much more extra hauling of ice will i need to do personally i think a fee of 2033 of the value of the addition that the upgrade provides should be a reasonable fee iskwisesee post 2 for conclusion
so in conclusion i think that by implementing those ideas the following goals will be accomplished 1 presence of two distinct isk sinks base tcu upgrades to price the space with the option to go iskexclusive 2 incentive for players to participate in 00 based on market prices of fuel ie hey ive run the numbers and if it stays this cheap itll only cost like wild exaggeration 20m a month to own a 00 system 3 allows for potentially more interesting trade route conflicts 4 ties costs closer to activity levels and upgrade levels which should encourage more activity in 00 5 allows 00 to have the fuel seeded  npc stations which goes back to point 3 with the trade routes etcso let me know what you think slash flame on below dont forget to support if you consider this a good proposaltldr 1 tcu  fuel req of 1 large pos or just pay the isk 2 pay the isk for upgrades tie upgrade monthlys to activity
system holding costs were put in place to allow sovereign space to be more autonomous instead of carting the huge amount of materials from highsecurity space eventually concepts like the muchdiscussed planetary colonies might allow for the production and refinement of enriched uranium mechanical parts and such to be done onsite to make it truly autonomous with the minor exception of skill books and blueprintsi like how ccp is going about this change and while some of the numbers might be offkilter thats what singularity is for therefore i cannot support this proposal
i propose that ccp make a 2010 new year resolution resolve to spend 2010 fixing all the broken issues like any successful company experiencing rapid growth great ideas infused into the current product line and a consistent forward momentum there comes a time when that company must take a moment to slow down and reflect on issues maintenance and customer needsdesirescomplaintsits fairly obvious we have long list of standing problems with player owned structures alliances being crashed with a single button press asset and resource sharing with corps in established alliances epic arch missions and we all know based on the past performances of new expansions surely dominion will be riddled with fixes bugs problems and tweaksi am quite sure many will add to this list seeing how the forums are inundated with complaints issues and suggestions many are very good suggestions some are tweaks and a few are just simple logic with the need for some serious considerationthat said i propose that 2010 be dedicated to repair its quite evident that eve is cutting edge and superior to any other game in its category however i have personally seen corp mates leave the game based on issues like the ones stated above and with comments like i am going to take a break and come back in a few months with high hopes some of these issues will have been worked outin the same breath i have seen as many of you have others threatening to leave based on the proposed sov changes and a plethora of other reasons many based on poor performance and a inherent feeling that they the player base are not being heard not being taken seriously or even considered after years of flogging dead horsesin the past year we have has some awesome improvements with tiii ships worm space and now a in the initial pitch more balanced and easier to attempt sov plan not to mention a trickling of info on station mobility and further improvements to player interaction and the social element that drives eve behind the sceneswith what we have on the table currently i implore ccp to pause for a moment take a deep breath and look at the reality and vitality of the game hold off on dust for a bit finish what you have on the table for this year dominion and spend 2010 rehashing the ignored overlooked and often ear marked too big to deal with at this time issueswhat good is that shiny new car going to be to you if you never put it in the shop and do some routine maintenance or repair the broken struts  obviously anything neglected long enough is going to breaklets not reach the breaking point instead lets take the time to fix whats wrong and if and i say if the repairs goes smoother than anticipated the ask the clientele the player base are we ready to take the next step  and i am quite sure that the majority of the players once they feel repairs are effective and the car is again running smoothly with answer with a resounding yes and look forward to your new fresh innovative ideas with promise and enthusiasm rather than the hundreds of posts knocking the system and its feeble efforts to make great things happen by way of half hearted implementations overlooking issues and ignoring the paying customers requestsa great leader knows when to retreat regroup and reassess hisher battle readiness and capabilitiesa poor leader fumbles forward patching up the troops with high hopes they will have the heart to see the mission through to completion be the great leader and think wisely listen closely and keep your equipment in perfect working order any successful leader knows the value of getting the job done is not the same as getting the job done rightso lets see how many agreeshould 2010 be a fix it and tweak the settings year or should we just continue fumbling along hoping it all turns out right

ccp is doing fine as is theyre fixing one major problem with the game while releasing new content in each expansion new content ensures new subscribers and one fixed problem per patch allow for a dedication to that problem and its resolutiontheyve already fixed scanning in apocrypha and now theyre working on sovereignty in dominion im hoping the next patch is devoted to warfare covering wardecs and bounty hunting each patch they also improve the ui with eye candy and now cosmosccp is a business and therefore new clientele is essential for growth without rejecting the veteran players of the game in this rough market entertainment industries like ccp have the potential for unparalleled growth and theyre reacting in a great waybugs will always exist with a game and this is true regardless of whether you play wow coh or whatever theyre working on it and doing finetldr dont bite the hand that feeds you
with all due respect sir you apparently dont keep up with current events or forum poststhe latest dev blog regarding sov changes has generated 69 very heated pages of response in 2 daysmany not just a few leaders of major alliances have posted their input and expressed the dissatisfaction with current plans and past mistakesthis is just one example many things like storage alliance shared access player owned stations and the ever popular kill a alliance with the push of a button are some huge areas that need fixing just to name a fewccp is doing fine  how many months ago did bob get disbanded with a single button press and yet here it remains unfixed and happens yet again how many years has it been since player owned stations was released and the features introduced with them never fixed you say scanning was fixed  if you mean made easier for everyone yes that is correct and i applaud them for that however easier isnt always better and there are many topics regarding that subject and dumbing down the profession that many have spent months training for and learning so again with this in mind did they listen to the veteran players and tweak it a bit more so they didnt feel rejected  no instead it was made to work and they have moved on to the next project ignoring the fundamental input of the pilots in this professiondo not interpret this as a way of knocking ccp it is not intended to do that ccp is doing ok i would not go so far as to endorse your statement of fine and definitely think they could do betterits time to take a short break from creating and start repairing that which has been developed and released it is in fact just my opinion and you are entitled to yours however like i said ccp is capable of being much more and i think the 50000 plus pilots who pay for this game many with multiple accounts deserve a bit more recognition for their input as well as a fully functional gameyes there will always be a few bugs but if you read a few more topics i think you will find there are more than a few bugs and many are quite old and ignored
sory planetary interaction and incarna is allready planned  so more bugs and issues are coming on our way considering how well ccp propgramers are familiar with their code
its a supercapital sized miner who is capable of sneaky mining
and the activation of the supercapital miners have a 5 minute cycle and the ship cant warp when its ongot nads enough to fly it now1 antisupport
yeah why not i personally hate mining and all mining ships are paper thin would be totally laughable to see a 30 billion mining ship and even more of a laugh to catch and pop oneedit again and the internet tough guy himself says so so you have to support
i like it
a nice idea solves many issues at once
excellent idea
yes
agreed
does anyone know what activity they are planning to monitor number of rats killed avg people in spaceregardless excellent idea should encourage bloatalliances to either contract or recruit actual active members
suggesting changes is still difficult when dominion is not in its final stage that being said i like the idea as proposed as stated it allows a player to pay taxes even in situations where the tax system does not function additionally it helps out an operation like cva also if you happen to have a hostile or a neutral if your nbsi doing something in your system then their activity can help you hold your space i like thatthe only down side is that more activity  more isk income but less for the isk sink the upgrades represent some tweeks may be needed but i can support this ideaashina sito for csm
i like it
to repeat it again so maybe someone notice it prices have been changedit is here
theyre being made to maintain activity if they want perks like jump bridges cyno jammers and csaas wheres the difference to simply say that to hold the system in the first place it should have some activity if ccp are serious about making small gangs able to disrupt sov which we all want after all then theres no better wayedit  the three examples are sov based and reading the blog may not be activity based but in any case the point holds for the other perks and so stands  even if we assume that the strategic level is the sole criterion for those upgrades
not experienced this with mining drones but i have read it is a real problemi have seen the same bug working with npc structures in missions sometime the drone circle them but do no damage it is a bug somwhere in the orbiting mechanicsi prefer the current mining drones to static mining units as it make mining drones different from deployable stripminers but i fail to see why mining drones need to orbit a asteroid the gravitational pull of a small sized body like an asteroid can easily counteracted by the drone propulsion so they could get in range and stay there till the cycle finish then return to the ship for delivery
i cant support this particular proposition but mining drones do need a looking ati have also experienced the if the rock is above a certain size the drone will orbit it but stop mining syndrome
vote bald you know it makes sense

if i wasnt voting alek i would vote sokratesz
thanks decon also ive updated my campaign blog with two new posts one on the proposed sovereignty changes and one on how ccp designs industry systems head over to my blog and check them out
take care has done a lot for factional warfare despite ccps desinterest thus has my vote again
ive known zod for a while now and his advice has helped me out lots he has my vote
you rang
you can count on getting the support from my alliance and the merc contracts chat via 2 press releases  but for nowquestion  whats you feelings on this topic clicky
thanks for the reply you have my vote and my axe and id like to applaud you not only for your viewpoints but also for the way you argument and present those points of view your reasoning is sound and your skill at argument makes you a promising csm candidate in my view best of luck with your campaign
good luck alekseyev you have my vote
great guy and one of the most experienced eve player aroundmy votes goes to himgo elven 
ive got your back all the luck in the universe my friend
lvl 5 missions in highsec yeathis is content we all are paying for and i dislike having to make a run through gankers and griefers to get to that contentwhile at it ahsekuav you should also look into the task of improving the bounty system as of now the bounty system is worse than useless as the griefers can easily collect the bounties on themselvesccp love to tell us all the game should have crime as there is crime in real lifesomeone should tell ccp crime should not always pay well  there are penalties in real life so we want some of these penalties in the game as wellwork on this and you have my vote
i like a lot of the ideas you propose on this post youre not afraid to show your personal bias which always exists regardless of the candidate even those who claim that they have no biasin addition many of the changes incorporate pvp as well as pve so you demonstrate your understanding of the balance of the two activities that exist in this game for these reasons you have my single vote the only account i have as well as my support assuming you do not crash and burn like some of the other candidates most notably in this current term
youre right jarl the bounty system has been a sore spot since i started in 04 im happy to bring this up within the csm a good place to start might be to prohibit bounties to be collected by players within the same corp or alliance still that doesnt address the problem of alts or friends in other corps doing the hit and splitting the bounty with the intended target i would be willing to explore bounty hunting as a profession and the development of a skill tree for that profession the danger is tilting the board too much in favor of the bounty hunter and giving them an unfair advantage over other players thats the primary reason why i oppose the pirate profession getting some lovin until i see specifics of the type of lovin they are looking for they shouldnt have an unfair advantage over other players they should have the same level field as everyone elseanother potential issue is the bounty hunter doing a counter contract with the intended target say you take out a contract on a griefer the bounty hunter locates the target the enterprising bounty hunter may tell the intended target that he has been hired to do the hit at that point the bounty hunter may negotiate a pay off or counter contract on you in that instance perhaps a new contract system could be implemented that specifies no payout until the target has been podded further in order for the bounty hunter to use the bounty contract system they need to be registered with concord in much the same manner that real life bounty hunters need to be registered with state or local authorities if a bounty hunter violates the terms of the contract system then he loses his license and the ability to utilize the bounty hunting contract system food for thought ahs
hes got my vote
ill vote for you
as i said in an earlier post here in jita park i am the sovreignty csm to vote fordevblog  the upkeepthis matter will be so big in dominion that you just need one csm with long time experience knowhow and knowledge about the history of evei am that candidate to vote for
at this time eve university hasnt lent official support behind any one candidate there are several candidates that individual players and directors support but no corporate position has been put forth
from what i have seen so far of the candidates there seems to be 2 that fit the concept that eve university follows this is not a statement that eu endorses ether candidate but that these candidates are looking out for the newer players out therethe first would be jonathan dawnchaser if your more of a pve csmthe second is actually myself ashina sito for a more pvp leaning csmor for pure carebear if your looking for that you can try aaron mirrorsaver
a majority of the ancients is made up of new players as any of our pilots will attest to we are happy to train new players and show them the ropes we just choose to keep a lower profile than eu im sure eu and ivy league will weigh their decision carefully prior to supporting the candidate of their choiceregardsahs
aaron was being seriousbut i fully endorse ashina for anyone that cant persuaded to vote for me
sorry to ask such a basic question i did try to find the answer myself firsthow do i vote it starts thursday right will there be a link on the main eveo pageread the blog
when it is time to vote theyll include a vote button on the list of candidates where you can cast your vote it is noted that your account has to be more than 30 days old to vote

alfons youre missing the pointblasters can not track their targets when in their optimal range unless the target is bigger than the gun cruiser shooting a bs or stood perfectly still the argument is that the effective not theoretical eft dps is hopeless the weapon system is flawed in that it is supposed to be used within 3  6 km but cant hit titan yes i have exagerated if transversal is anything above 100 for the short range weapon of eve this is not right the short range weapon should be able to track its targets within its optimal fall off isnt really an option as te weapons range is hopeless and just going 500m into fall off drops your dps rapidlyall we ask is that blasters be able to track their target a smidge more base damage too but tracking is the priority
do something already
not supported if anything a slight range increase on blasters or a slight range nerf on scorch so people stop their complaining
in order to keep the flavor difference between acs pulse and blasters but get blasters inline with regard to performance blasters damage need to be raised a bitthe difficulties associated with not being able to deal damage at speed disruption range 1013km is a huge disadvantage over lasers and acs

you think a 150 mil boat with 700 dps at 5km but no tank whatsoever is good try comparing it to the brutix or the ferox and see if you find anything the deimos does better than the two aside from a little damage
yes its true but he try to compare the zealot again the deimos to say the blaster or railgun are not goodhe say the zealot are more dps in short range its false and its also false for the long rangefor me they are no problem with the hybrid turret with gallente but they are certainly some problem with the caldari
an honor tank diemosthis thread is not to discuss ships but weapons and eft warrioring doesnt help again theoretical dps isnt effective actual dps
so you need 2 tracking enhancers to actually be efficient that doesnt seem efficient at all to mealso if the cruiser size difference in blasters vs pulse lasers is that big then why is this not translated into large blasters aswell blasters still need a tracking boost to justify their damage and large ones need a damage boost on top of thatso here you go if you like numbersarmageddon gankheat sink iiheat sink iidamage control ii1600mm reinforced rolled tungsten plates i1600mm reinforced rolled tungsten plates iadaptive nano plating iiadaptive nano plating ii1600mm reinforced rolled tungsten plates i100mn microwarpdrive iiwarp disruptor iifleeting propulsion inhibitor imega pulse laser ii conflagration lmega pulse laser ii conflagration lmega pulse laser ii conflagration lmega pulse laser ii conflagration lmega pulse laser ii conflagration lmega pulse laser ii conflagration lmega pulse laser ii conflagration lempty high slotlarge trimark armor pump ilarge trimark armor pump ilarge trimark armor pump iogre ii x51088 dps over 25km 1510megathron gankmagnetic field stabilizer iimagnetic field stabilizer iienergized adaptive nano membrane ii1600mm reinforced rolled tungsten plates idamage control ii1600mm reinforced rolled tungsten plates ienergized adaptive nano membrane ii100mn microwarpdrive iiwarp scrambler iifleeting propulsion inhibitor iconjunctive magnetometric eccm scanning array ineutron blaster cannon ii caldari navy antimatter charge lneutron blaster cannon ii caldari navy antimatter charge lneutron blaster cannon ii caldari navy antimatter charge lneutron blaster cannon ii caldari navy antimatter charge lneutron blaster cannon ii caldari navy antimatter charge lneutron blaster cannon ii caldari navy antimatter charge lneutron blaster cannon ii caldari navy antimatter charge lempty high slotlarge trimark armor pump ilarge trimark armor pump ilarge trimark armor pump iogre ii x51148 dps over 175km 45  13 even though you would be shooting only in falloffthe difference in dps is barely noticeable whilst the range is entirely different if i were to choose between an armageddon or a megathron to go with in a large fleet battle i would definitely choose the first one for various reasons megathron doesnt have enough damage output and tracking to justify its choosing even though it has a tracking bonus armageddon can hit targets at a much superior range armageddon can switch ammo in 1 second and hit over 55km megathron doesnt have enough speed to catch up with targets to apply damage what else the only good thing is that it has 1 more mid slot for any miscellaneous module could fit a tc there but would have to downgrade 1 eanm for an adaptive plating reducing tank ability

cool pictures
no this isnt worth looking into at all dave and all the other ridiculously lazy people with entitlement issues need to just suck it up they can do everything but 1010s for the few days it takes to train the prereq skill needed every dedrated plex other than the 1010s and all of the nonrated combat plexes are open to them the idea that requiring a prereq skill to enter a 1010 is preventing players from doing exploration is pure bswhat next no hackingarchsalvaging prereqs for opening cans in radars or magnos or maybe i dont feel like training any skills for using probes at all but i still want to be able to do exploration can we have that how about when one warps to a 1010 theres just an unlocked can with 1 bil loot in it no wait its too much to ask people to scan down anything at all how about after downtime cans with xtype stuff are just near the normal system gates
it is bs when theres not even a hint of a warning given that a prereq skill is needed to access the site until you find yourself stopped by a locked entrance gate i dont mind needing to train a prereq skill to access a site as long as i can somehow get an ingame warning ahead of time that ill need it
exacly and its a real bummer when its an expedition from a cosmic it happed to me once and we just let the timer ran out becasue we didnt have the time to train leadership to l5
its not crap it means you need to train your skills bettersome of the skills are a must haveiewarp drive operation 5weapons upgrades 5leadership 5and ill be frank 1010s are a little bit hard than you think its not just battleships you have a super repping citadel torp firing death star at the end which doesnt play niceif anything 1010s need to be tougher and require more skills
as a matter of principle i support the right of inadequately trained pilots to get blown up by npcs
supportedgallente warfare is very aggressive and these links would reflect ithowever keep the information links and create a new ship class covert command ship ewar cruiser hull that uses and bonuses the links will have a slightly buffed tank and very low dps but would be useful on blackops fleets anyone agree
drone damage rigs and mods t2 mods aswell light webber drones let us see hp of drones in bayothers too with some balancing work to do
i hate it when someone posts like this but it must be done more hp yes when ccp boosted the hp for all ships 2 years ago they did not boost drone hp this should have been done thensig size i do think they are a bit too big a small reduction in size is warranted they are crewless ships and should be smaller you would have to be careful to not make the light drones safe do to being too small thoughi have no issues with this no no no balance issues way too many issues with this one no balance issues again should have been there from the beginning potential balance issues if your adding drone damage rigs i would say no if your not adding drone damage rigs you could say yes i have reservations with this one an omnidirectional results in increased damage though better tracking also high med or low slot no but adding a normal drone rig would be ok i can not explain why i believe this it just seems right cont
a developer commented on this a few months back the comment was i thought that is the way it was ill look into it i see both sides of it easier to skill for but you miss out on the 10 bonus the only wrong choice would be to add the requirement and not give the bonuswould need new code just for sentrys i would say no sounds cool but can you imagine the bugs it would take years to fix them gettign current issues fixed would be better yes should be in game already while we are at it add hull hp rigs i want to make a super hull tanked domi yes but buff the current ear drones eccpet ecm and go from there this does not match the description it could be rewritten though would be overpowered if ewar drones were buffed that said you drone interfacing should function with ewar drones all ewar drones suck ok not ecm if ewar drones were buffed up this would not be an issue 0dont count on getting any of these things ccp regrets 3 things in eve1 learning skills they are a drag on retaining new players and a hassle overall2 more then one pilot on one account3 dronesi think ccp has dragged their feet with drones because they dont want to draw even more people to them then again we got the fed navy omnidirectional tracking links and there has been implied comments that there may be more faction drone mods in the future
we the eve community humbly request more out of game mediaeventsportable applicationsthis idea is good and should be discussedcheers
my bro jason edwards would hate this which in turn makes me love it
agreed its not fair the empire dwellers are missing all the neat new things dominion brings give it to them quick before theres a empire revolt
how about we enforce a isk fee for people like the op who post troll posts110 troll epic fail
you madsupported
suppoting this cause ccp is nonsensical
yes  give concord weekends aswell no concord on staturday give allainces the option to bribe concord in 05 systems give people that live with 2 chars or more on the same account in 00 an subscription discount of 20 give 00 allances the option to buy empire station from factions ctrlcctrlv source code to make it easy for u ccp maybe that would take a whole day of implementing
supporting cause its truewhy would i ever want to go back to empire when i can enjoy a far more profound persecution by game mechanics in 00 and lowsec
whats good for the goose is good for the gander

goal  encourage people to go to 00 no sec spacepros 1 ccps stated goal was to increase participation emergence in 00 space2 more people  more contact  more conflict kicking industry and everything associated with it up several notchescons 1 anything besides pvp is better safer and makes more money in empire not just fotm lvl 4s but everything until ccp changes that 00 will remain unattractive to a vast number of people there has to be a reason for people other than pvprs to exist out to 00 and the nonpvp players have to be accepted by the pvp crowd dominion imho wont help 00 become more desirable or attractiveso while industry  mining  refining  invention  everything is safer to do in empire is closer to markets and doesnt have the huge drawback that it is so vulnerable people will stay away from 00 in droves as they are doing nowthe only thing that makes sense is if the rewards for doing industryminingrefininginventionresearchmissioning in 00 were higher lots higher because of the risk honestly you can take missions right out of the game and if people can still make more money safer more consistently in empire in other ways  they willand 00 will remain underun  utilizedso 00 as a whole has to be way more desirable than hisec not in isk necessarily but for exampleindustry gets a 5 material bonus from 00 manufacturing not needing to abide by all the empire safety restrictions  or however you want to roleplay it or 10 or 15mining  5 to 15 bonus to mining amount in 00 buff asteroid mineral amounts in 00 maybe 25refining  10 bonus to refining outputless wastageinvention  come to crazy als pos in fountain or where ever i can give you a 25 modifier on invention from your bpos or 10 reduction in materials or a buff to me whatevermissionssalvaging  missions are easy  peasylvl  4s  one or two rats multi  room missions spread all over a system blockade normally gives x number of npc ratsin 00 blockade mission rooms should  npc rats  2 for example  30 rats would equal 15 rooms now its not impossible to scan them out  find them but its not a slamdunk either because they are separated by gates and warp gates can move you wherever in system they care to drop the other end of the grid keep each room separated by 2 au minimum or whatever works to make the mission viablesalvaging gets a 15 difficulty modifier and a 15 amount modifier to resultsall these things could be done via the upgrades systems including npc agents there is no reason this couldnt be donethese are the kinds of things maybe way off on my numbers but what the hell that would draw people out to 00dominion will not do this hell judging by the feedback were looking at exodus ii
numbers may need some tweaking and im not sure i like the change to 00 misisons missions need changing all right but not like this but the basic idea is damb fineand industryresearch bonus would give a real solid advantage to living in and most importantly using sov 00give 00 industrialists inventors and researchers a real advantage to compete with the massive free subsidies that hisec ones get
i hear a lot of people talking about making 00 a little safer and whatnot thats what i thought this thread would be about before i read it that kind of thing would be utterly ed and if it was the case even though im not a 00 pilot i would probably quit evethis i can support i am in total agreement with there being higher rewards in nullsec make it profitable for industrials to go there even if they lose a couple ships along the way that way everybody benefits pvpers get their precious killmails and loot industrials get their precious minerals manufacturers get their precious money from selling more industrial ships out there it will be great with these new sov changes
dominion isnt even out yet and youre already saying it tanked ccp knows what theyre doing and knows the limitations of the codebasewhile i agree that agents should exist in 00 and be hireable to player outposts the objective is to create a communal benefit pvpers gain benefits for protecting pveers in their space and pve gets a boost by having pvp carve out the section of 00 where they will run missionsminemanufacturei believe that given time certain alliances will be renown for their treatment of pve both positive and negative and well see those alliances that promote pve gain power in the grand 00 menagerie while those that neglect it will find their upkeep costs much higher  to the realms of unaffordable this will draw pve to lowsec since the rare ores and maybe the level 5 missions will be available there increasing the profit per hour while maintaining relatively safe roaming grounds on top of that level 4s will be a lot more profitable than in highsec due to the security rating of the system and maybe the quality of the agentspve doesnt need any more benefit than its gonna receive from dominion soon if the alliances understand the repercussions of persecuting pve i believe it will draw a large portion of highsec runners out to lowsecin either case lets wait and see what happens before firing shots in the dark i believe dominion could be the ultimate benefit to both pvp and pve
hm did it ever occur to you that there might be reasons beyond game mechanics you know like the people who live in 00 ruthlessly murdering any carebear that tries to set fot in their spacethis expansion is about making the carebear hating pvp brigade accept carebears in to their space so that small roaming gangs will have soft targets to shoot at if you think its too much effort then you dont deserve any soft targets you want something you have to work for it dont like it theres the door dont let the airlock hit you on the way out
interesting idea have you considered the cons a single player can already cover most of the industrial need of a corporation save the raw mineral gathering but npc loot can cover a good percentage of that and high sec import the restmake mining more efficient and you will need less minersmake refining ore efficient and you will need less miners againmake production more efficient and you will need less miners third time ouch and less producers make invention more efficient and it maybe will give a real advantage to 00 but at the same time it will reduce moon minerals demand t2 market is already glutted so demand will not increase simply prices will decrease pushing high sec inventors out of the market intended result so ok for this ideamissions with mega number of gates  brr the time lost navigating themextra salvage you already have that in belt rats like extra loot but most people will not loot and salvage them but again it can help i think it will not get more industrial people in 00 it will only make life easier for those already there and reduce the demand for ne producersthe mission part could partially workthe invention part would be a success probably
ok fair enough just answer me this then given the current state of affairs what is the draw of 00 other than sovereignty or pvp for a pverwhy would you go to 00 when everything pve is gimped out thereexodus was supposed to encourage people to move from hisec to 00 back in the day  it didnt do it and as a matter of fact many people moved from 00 to hisec and if you dont know what exodus is it was a patch i think you can google ityou might very well be right but imho ccps missed the mark again vovwell seei disagree there are ways to get to 00 you have to look for them and 00 alliances could be doing a better job of recruiting  but thats another threadthis expansion will not encourage 00 space holding entities to invite pvers in because the root issue there is nothing better about doing industry et al in 00 than in hisec will not have been addressedi have no idea what your 2nd paragraph is all about so will leave that alone
dude i think you just won post of the year this is the best idea for fixing 00 ive ever seen no word of a lie im going to steal this idea and flog it shamelessly now
yes of course the upgrade could simply spawn the agents in space like they are in some null sec systems in gates or at some system visible spotperhaps each level of upgrade would provide the corresponding level of agent from 1 to 5
true but shouldnt they also be actively looking at ways to compaign following the csm sections should be part of that and from there they should see the thread expect more out of csms they shouldnt need spoon feedingsong li for csm
thanks again la for the quick note to my comment on the planet risk site earlier todayas i mentioned you can appreciate the amount of time going through the eve online boards can consume and also how easy it can be to miss a post here and there as an astute csm candidate i had been going through these boards however my time has been focused on proposals that have been garnering the most merit via the support feature in the assembly hall threads from the community rather than reading every thread and every answer to all threads please do not take this as a complaint as i am familiar with the last round of the debate and i must say it was a job well done as a candidate and firm believer in what the csm represents and the significance of how rare an opportunity that has been presented to the eve online community it is critically important that word gets out about the csm its role its history and its futurei was simply making an observation that we have several tools for communication and all of them should be taken advantage of in order to reach as many people as possiblekeep up the great work and hope to be able to set up some face time within the debate sooncheersprodigal

imao there should be no hard border between there levels every mission will have difficulty rating and so there will be both missions equivalent to current lvl 4s and challanging stuff for gangs also i would rather have 12 bs that deal 300 dps each then fight 15 battleships that deal 5 dps each and massive amount of cruisers
why shouldnt level 4s be balanced around old players in good ships
because he is trying to balance all missions against old players with good ships not only the top missions

bumpno one but me finds this usefulcorp contracts have a different role than public contracts making corp logistics easier to manage as opposed to selling and buying stuff off of random people the fact that you have corp contract slots only enforces thisif you want people to use those 500 slots for their intended use you have to give them much longer lifetimes
are you sure its actually of any use to the corp at all if nobody is accepting it within 14 days
oh yes producing and selling cheap shipsrigsmodules for only your corp to enjoy
for hauling mining foreman and mining director are very important to maximizing output these skills are ideal for a hauling alt because that alt can be moved to any system and be put to use within any fleethowever the bonuses dont work while docked and a hauling alt can dock often depending on the output of the fleetit would be a great improvement if the fleet bonus loss were delayed by a minute or two so haulers dont stop giving fleet bonuses when dropping off cargo
while were at it why not have all the bonuses work that way so you can get the joys of additional shields and resistances without ever leaving the comfort of your stationno the solution is a fairly simple one you dont want to lose the benefits dont have your booster dock
not supportedyou must be in space to apply bonusesif you want your hauler to apply bonuses drop some secure cans in a safe spot near the belt and haul all your ore there cant be scanned down unless you hang around too long and means you dont dock till mining op complete
my pimped out iteron v carries 12 gscs permanently to squeeze out that last little bit of carrying capacity gscs have never really been a solution to the intermediate storage problem at least not once youre using something bigger than a frigate to minenot that i support the op bonuses should be carried by a barge or orca pilot not a hauler and if you want group bonuses all the time you might try being in an actual group
not sure if any of you realized this but not only does this change mining boosts butit pretty much supports docking games with pvp gang booster getting shot at oh just dock for a couple minutes till the boosts wear off then undock and dock again
pos fueling is a terrible awful no good very bad mechanic i am completely against any proposal to expand it to another type of structure
you misunderstand my post im not saying that bugs should not be fixed far from it bugs should be given attention in every patch especially those that interrupt gameplayhowever devoting a whole year to something that will not attract players to the game it might make a few return is economic suicide bigger things need fixed and are on the slate to be fixed wardecs ui etc ccp is working on thoseget off your high horse and realize that your idea is both unrealistic and improbable bugs should be fixed but your idea stretches the bounds of realism to the breaking point
do you have any thoughts on the situation with drones and having to tell them to do stuff 45 times before they will actually do as they are told and then a second or 2 later going back to whatever the hell they feel like doingim also kind of curios to hear your thoughts on the expansion name as it seems to be geared towards an effort to break the dominion of the large alliances
i think ccp has tried to fix drone behaviour about ever patch for the last 2 years or so  i have to admit that i have not be bothered by any significant problems with their behaviour for awhile now even though i use drones a lot are there any specific situations that it seems to happen inheh fortunately a has no pretences to dominate the evelives of anyone other than those who enter our space uninvitedand occasional bystanders

jade and pitboss behind me totally sweetpit not sure the issue you wanted me to see there other than it took a while sometimes  happens im willing to give ccpcsm the benefit of the doubt that the delays were legitcatch me on the planet risk show wed 2100 debating some suckas
the main dominion discussion thread has turned into something of a monster and so im going to post my thoughts about it here insteadfirstly i believe that the goals of the sov revision have not been met with this new system in its current state effective holdings of existing powerblocs will remain as they are even if the official sov map shows smaller blobs of colour sovereignty in systems with no strategic value will be dropped but any local power will be able to make sure that noone else sets up in there eithersmall corps and alliances who were previously frozen out of 00 by the pos mechanics will continue to be frozen out because it will be trivially easy for any competitor to shut down their space and force them to fight a onesided battle with corporate bankruptcyso even though one part of the design will on paper at least have been realised in that there will be more unclaimed space the effect will be the same as the current status quo which most 00 dwellers seem to agree needs to changelet me be clear this criticism is not dependent on the numbers in fridays dev blog ccp have stated that those numbers will change and have put forwards some new ones which are significantly cheaper even if there was no cost at all the issues i have with the design would still existccp state that they want to consolidate large empires down to a few core systems which is fine however those fewer systems will need to be able to support more activity and ccp have not yet put forwards a realistic proposal for how that might happen early in the information stream we heard that the target was a single system supporting 50100 pilots over the weekend that seems to have dropped to 1015 or so with the caveat that those 1015 pilots need to be doing different activities so as not to trip over each otherthis really is the core of the issues that 00 dwellers have with this we are mostly prepared for the fact that well contract and that some activity will be less profitable than it used to be we were looking forwards to a new wave of 00 colonists coming from empire providing fresh targets and a shakeup of the status quo as it stands though there is really no reason for anyone to make that jump 00 will continue to be filled with incumbents who fight each other for mostly historical rather than strategic reasons in fact the future of 00 looks even more stagnant as a result of these changes as there will be almost no reason to actively conquer space we will send wulfpax to our enemies who will send wulfpax to our space and we will have good fights but nothing will ultimately change as a result of these battles any incumbent alliance that dies or gets expelled from 00 space will do so as a result of internal schisms rather than through strategic conquest or ingame military actioni was excited for a system that would lower the barrier to 00 participation and make 00 life more dangerous and more rewarding this is not that system
someone from legion of xxdeathxx brought this up earlier and id like to make it a formal question for logitwhat is your position on the local channel specifically relating to its effect as an instant systemwide scanner would you advocate the change or removal of that function and in what ways
the systemic effects of changing local chat to a delay would need to be considered clearly such a change would have farreaching consequences beyond just the hopedfor effect making pvp more unpredictable presumablycurrently there are methods probably exploits of creating superdeep safespots there are also many players with bookmarked superdeep safes from when they were easy to make these safespots would allow people to circumvent the only remaining way of gathering intel probingscanning and would generate a lot of complaining this issue would need to be addressed firstanother issue is how it would change the incentive structure surrounding fleet sizes currently in lowsec and 00 smaller gangs of both pvpers and pveers can use the easy intel local chat provides to assess possible engagements without that easy intel blobbing for defensive purposes becomes much more attractivewhile i have never liked local chat and would personally be happy to see a delay added to it a change to it would have farreaching consequences it would definitely make eve more hardcore a plus imo but it would encourage blobbing bad and generate a lot of whining from all types of players about unfair advantages a change would have to be carefully thought outsorry if this seems like a dodge but this is the kind of representative i would be i would approach changes to game mechanics conservatively no matter how attractive they were to me personally
pardon the thread jack but why not just take away the pilot list from local altogether it doesnt really make sense that you would just know who was in a system even on a delay but if you happened to be in a system when someone made a broadcast then you would know they were therei wouldnt argue about whether local list is fair or not but i would argue that it doesnt make a lot of sense it assumes that there is some system in place of collecting stats on the local population and then broadcasting those results out to every ship in local i guess you could say this is a function of the gates but why does it exist whats the purpose wormholes have no gates but still have local listseven from a pvp perspective i think it takes some of the fun out of it more fun to guard the gates and start probingthats my 2 cents leave local chat but take away any pilot stats just like a radio at sea i know you are there if my radar can see you or if you are broadcasting past that
thread
not at all  your position on the issue is that youd look at any proposed change very closely and be watchful for any negative impact on the choices we have in the game strengthening blobbing as the only choice counts as a negative impact on choices in my book you told me exactly what i wanted to know
any news  nocsm is useless  yes
now availablethis will not happen again ie the delays
bookmarksill nail you guys on that if it does happen again
from their podsi see what he did there i lold then i rofld then i stfuagbtwi think this was basically nixons campaign strategy in 68 or as its known in some circles the ufia
your sex cash and pina coladas sig image makes me want to drop out of the race and run on your ticket as viceits hard to compete with those campaign promises
why should we vote for you your place is already secured because of the goonies vote
do you like any of my ideas did you think i was dashing and witty during the alliance tournamentnothen dont vote for me im not going to grovel for votes and im not going to apologize for being in goonfleet i think i have good ideas for where eve should go and i think i can get things done if its more important for you to rail against the goonies then thats your prerogative
i was reading velocity primes suddenly ninjas ceo blog and i noticed that they have formed a political party in regards to the upcoming csm electionit seems to be somewhat libertarian in that they want to block or at least put under a microscope any proposed game changes that might restrict or reduce the number of viable activities available to players ingameat first i was like but i have to admit that sn has always operated in a way that takes full advantage of the qualities of eve that make it great if they think that its worth it to organize around the idea of preserving those qualities than so do ianother thing i noticed is that unlike other prominent corpsalliances instead of just nominating one of their own members they seem to be supporting a candidate from a competitor group of ninja salvagers its nice to see a corpalliance that is more interested in the good of the game than currying influence for themselves
sounds good to me imo seems dominions changes for 00 are really nothing more than adding a bunch of rules that will limit how people act there that sucks pretty hard i just cant see any epic events like we are used to unfolding once that new system is in placethe guy they are supporting logit probit has my accounts votes
these guys are pretty experienced at dealing with carebear whining seems perfectly suited for csm 1
hurray for cooperation i would assume one of the changes theyre concerned about is breaking ninja salvaging i find flaw with their theory adding aggression mechanics to salvaging would actually increase the number of activities in game ninja salvaging would still remain but ninja salvage baiting and ninja salvager ganking would be 2 brand new activities added to the gamei call shenanigans on their platform they really just want to protect their free tearfaucet
i think its pretty unlikely that suddenly ninjas would be opposed to letting people shoot at salvagers
moved to jita park speakers corner
so are you saying you want us to be able to wardec npc corps
that would be pretty sweet
hell yes it would be i think there should be 2 npc corps per race one for newbies and one for people who are too scared lazy or asocial to join a real corp you should be able to dec the second one
thats not a bad ideahow bout this assuming you never join a corp at a certain number of sps you automatically graduate transfer etc from the noob starter corp to a sister npc corp that can be decdand that corps offices are all outside of the sec bubble i have been talking about not only facilitates the dec but also encourages people to move outside the bubble or join a real corpdecing an npc would have to cost more though probably significantly more and if you attack a decd pilot from the npc corp in that corps space their npc patrols will respond outside their space no support but i wouldnt put their patrols in uber ships thoughwould probably be best to just add a 1 more npc corp to every faction for the noob corp and maintain all the current npc corps that way when a noob graduates they can get a status on current decs in case they want to choose one that isnt currently decd and to make it even more interesting you could base their graduation options off of their sec status with the faction then you could tie the cost of npc corp decs into the rating system of the corp you are decing the corps that require higher sec status to get into are also the most expensive to attack 00 sec status would give you below average graduation options could maybe even say 00 or less gets you the base corp
and how exactly are these players in npc corps supposed to defend themselves against organized gankers you can bet on it that if what you two propose happens that it will be impossible for npc corp players to visit jita or any mission hub for that matter as there will be campers there looking for easy ganksthey will most likely quit the game as there is no way for them to defend themselves chances are they are not even interested in pvp at allwardecs are too unbalanced and in favor of the attacker ccp called them a pay to grief system for a reason wardecs should be brought in line and provide ways for defenders to end the war and do not last permanently as long as the attackers can be bothered to pay the minimal fees that is
start with my first post in this thread and keep reading this has all been coveredtry to not freak out because a goon posted and got some traction the idea has merit
the idea is to get people to leave npc corps and join real ones
i did read the thread tyvmnot all people want to join a corp just like not all people want to go to lowsec not all people want to pvp and not all players want to use voice coms ive been in an npc corp for over 5 years for a reason stop trying to force your own playstyle on others
in the absence of an eveuni candidate then i would humbly suggest that as an instructor with agony unleashed i would be a good substitute yes we are focussed on pvp not pve  but some of the things we teach are applicable to pve encounters as well
i deal with newbies all the time therefore i am the best choice
z0d deals with newbies all the time isnt a goon and wishes to improve pve thus hes the best choice
why eva what shameless self promoting from take care i love it
it would be cool to be involved in some scandal but im pretty sure we havent dropped any new outposts since the csm summit evne if you really believe outpost taking will be harder than it is now
how dare you accuse a goon of abusing csm powers

no they simply need to get unnerfed they originally nerfed the stats because they thought theyd become the omgsolopwnmobile1 maximum target range nerfed vs t1 variant which is crazy afaik no other t2 ship had this happen2 25  lvl 5 agility bonus on sin yet 50 more mass3 nonexistent t2 resistances 10 for kin meh4 20 less armorshieldsstrucutre then t15 less powergrid yet more slots6 less gunsthats for the sin moreso which is what i fly just for comparison i happen to be in my oneiros atm as logistics 5 is almost done and im changing my fitting slightly anyway oneiros has1 33 more maximum targeting range over t12 oneiros is slightly less agile but fairly acceptable plus oneiros generally matched up with command ships and battleships so not an issue3 4875 more kin res vs 10 more for sin and 325 more thermal res vs no change for thermal on sin4 33 more armorshieldsstructure then t15 has fitting bonus over t16 well gets 4 large rr vs 1 large rr or 4 large rr to 4 medium rrso how about we unnerf these we dont need to talk about making them jump further or suchthat really only may lead to other issues i wont mentionblack ops and titans can lock onto any sort of cyno including beaconsmy suggestion would be the allowance for black ops to lock onto any alliance beacon regardless of alliance association which isnt that overpowered as you cant exactly move much to that enemy pos that the pos cant alphathis is true however by design sadly this isnt that bad then again i really like the agility cloaked velocity is fairly useless on a ship so fat anyway presumably you jump into a camp you abmwdcloak and even with all that you really arent going to get away from inties who run at you the cloaked velocity would only work if it was like 1000 per level then youre practically nano while cloaked which would be very fun but i cant see that happenthere are more titans then black ops
oops forgot supportthey cant bridge to cyno gens ccp did a dirty hack and made the bridge a passive mod so you cantthe agility is nice but really useless frankly this coming from someone with a sin only thing ive used it lately is a glorified loot transport warps faster than a cs with a built in cloakwarp trick and more ehp lolbeing able to jump farther is critical for them to be of any use if they cant jumpportal portal range tied to jump range a decent distance unnerfed or not they would still be more or less useless in the role ccp would like to see oh as far as the covops cloak stuff goes meh it would be nice but balancing it would be somewhat hard id rather see jumping and ship stats addressed first
totaly agree on the part bout boosting would be more fun
i agree with this i think they need real bonuses i would like to see combat recons be allowed to use the bridge also that would mix the clandestine fleet up a bit
i am almost to my first jump cap ship and now i get a puddledroppingblop effect much like the new jump gate i think that whs effect was taken a tad too far in apoc its like they got an idea and then everyone one said so cool and suddenly everything ended up looking like it a heard mentality in the dev department i assume and we lost so much character in apoc i honestly looking at youtube stuff think only a few things really improved  mining lasers did  but shy of that no much is better in fact alot is worse or has no character at all well maybe shield boosters and such armorhull after a few it gets a hand down effects should be something unique and interesting that can be seen from a ways away or what is the pointsigned and double signed
well i know the vengeance used to have a 4th 5 shield resist boost or something it went away with quantum rise or some other expansion around that time but i was told the resists were just added to the base stats since it was under amarr frigate which had to be at v anywayim pretty sure the other assault frigates had a 4th bonus too so are you all taking this into account or were these never really added into the ships base stats
t2 ships all had resist bonuses listed as the 4th bonus quite some time back there were a lot fewer of them at the time it was decided to roll that resist bonus into the base hull all other t2 ships that were affected gained an additional bonus assault frigates did not that is part of the argument for them to receive that missing bonus now
this has been needed for some time
fully endorsed a neutral who involves themselves in someone elses fight is no longer neutral they should face the consequences of the aggro timeralthough i wouldnt mind seeing them concorded either
if all youre asking for is tracking then you still end up with useless shipsthe tracking problem isnt really there unless youre doing something wrong or shooting smaller ships then you maybe with two ab frigates fighting each other maybeyou must be simply doing something horribly wrong i have little problems tracking ships of same size using acs loaded with hail m which track about 50 worse then blasters with cnam and have a yet shorter optimal and falloff then neutronsrange is more of a issue but that is how blasters work lack of real dps advantage in realistic fits compared to competitors is more of a issue then anything else damage and ships and fitting in general is the problemalso you cannot separate ships from the weapons bad ship bonuses need to go armor rep bonus im looking at you specifically alternatively introduce dual reps as one module and reduce fitting requirements of reps in general so ships can fit damage and tank
i do agree that three bays might clutter things up and if this proposal makes it through and gets implemented i would like to see it as a blinking highlight in your drones bay on your overview this prevents abuse and keeps it nice and tidyhowever you point out an auto attribute which repairs if im understanding correctly is that you mean that when a fighters in a bay has damage that it will start repairing i think if this is what you meant the option should always lay with the carrier pilot though and not have it done automatic
it hasnt been mentioned here yet so ill be the first id like it to be easier to scan down player wrecks no matter where i am in the galaxy players get popped being the first little scavenger on the scene would be very helpfuli mean i know this thread is primarily focused on mission wrecks but i care more about scanning down t2 ship wrecks xd

drake this isnt a troll post and if it is it is the best sort imaginable this is a sarcasm post pointing out the wicked flaws in the new sov upgrade patch well done deldrac and you get my support for trashing this ridiculous new patch
stop neglecting empire in this shameful fashion ccp
as an empire industrialist i quake in fear at ever receiving the same upgrades 00 is having forced on it
supporting in hopes of getting in on the fun
um no
libertUFFFDegalitUFFFDfraternitUFFFD
these ideas would be a boost for people already in 00 more than a draw for new people i dont think anything short of removing highsec edit which i am not suggesting would really push highsec citizens into null sec if they wanted to be out here they already would be its not as bad as the op and others make it out to be those are excuses and rationals to justify decisions made because its easier in empire and the majority like the path of least resistance more than the path of challenge
that is flat out wrong we have 6 or 7 fulltime very pro industrialists in our corp and they not only pay market rates for every last unit of minerals they can get from the rest of us in an effort to persaude us to recover rat loot they have to import minerals by the multiple freighterload weekly they cant build enough ships for us eitherhow on earth you could think a single player can cover the mineral and manufacturing requirements of an active 00 corp escapes me do you think we do a onceperweek t1 cruiser op then go back to rattingif we had 20 full time miners doing nothing but strip belts every minute they played they still wouldnt cover our mineral requirements we dont have 20 or anything like reducing our requirements such that 17 full time miners still couldnt cover them wouldnt change anything for us except the number of ships and minerals we import from empire
i think you are missing the point somewhat some dont want to be there because it is inefficient and lacking in things to do the people who will go for the crappy 00 are already there but that is no reason not to buff it so people with differing interest could find it appealing too i for one enjoy pvp but it is just one thing among many and im not interested in limiting my other playstyles just to escape the limiting rules of empire the thing that keeps me currently mainly in empire isnt just the security but the richness of the interactions and better rewards i cant avoid working for isk but i can do it so much easier in empire with several different playstyles and there are never times i dont have many different things available to do in 00 im mainly reduced to shooting npcs and the income from them in actuality is a fraction of what i can make in empire the no rules pvp in 00 is fine and all that but currently living full time in 00 isnt worth the limits it puts on your income and other activities challenge is also fine but i enjoy other things besides pvp and im not a masochist so ill try to minimize the time it takes to grind my isk
im a low sec dweller but i assume the same problem applies with some gradient to all regions outside of highsecnonpvpers have no real reason to go therethe suggestions to buff industry outside of the large hubs sounds very good to me after all facing logistics problems and smaller markets is not exactly encouraging if there is no compansating factor
you read what you cite a single player can already cover most of the industrial need of a corporation save the raw mineral gathering but npc loot can cover a good percentage of that and high sec import the rest1 i single character can run up to 11 industrial jobs and a simple player with 1 account 33so your 67 very pro industrialist can run at least 60 jobs fulltime more than 400 bsday how many people in your corp to need more production your corp info say 193 so 1 industrialist every 30 people to you seem a high quantity ok probably you have a big capship program so the components require time but again those 6 industrialist have 2 alts that can be easily trained to build them note that the word is player not character 2 save the raw mineral gathering but npc loot can cover a good percentage of that and high sec import the rest seem pretty clear that 1 player cant get all the minerals for the whole corporation but in my experience ratting cover a good 3050 of middle and high ends needs save morphite and that for me is a good percentage the high ends can be generally gathered on site be a few miners in a good quantity and the rest is imported by high sec as yourself attest in your post again if you have a big capship program you need truckloads of tritanium and other low ends but for what i know no one want to mine them in 00 even increasing all the 00 minerals yield i dont see why people would mine super velspater instead of super araknor or bistot so the problem will stay the same a few less high end imports at most honestly if you have 67 industrialist characters it probably mean you have 23 industrialist players making your production more efficient will not push you toward recruiting more players to do the industrial workyou say that those 67 characters cant cope with productionwhy you havent recruited more people for the job
agents yes please
i support this suggestion a way better way to make 00 worthwhile then the cartloads of bull that ccp is pulling out of the garbage atm
supported its realistically the best way to match or exceed lvl 4 empire mission agents in a way thats scalable and thus incentivize 00 in order to populate it thus achieving the goal
access to high quality viable agents in 00 is realistically the only conceivable way that ccp is ever going to get anywhere near the 100playersystem figures theyve been talking about
we have fully articulated turrets with nice effects but frankly when it comes to cool looking weapons once again caldari gets the shaft common a large blob of light comming out of the center of your ship isnt a good effect for missiles its a copout i propose to make missile launchers visible articulated turrets that serve to add realism to missile launches an example of what i am talking about would be the drake right now it has 8 clearly visible launchers but instead of the expected swarm of missiles comming out of them we get the usual blob of light comming out of a compleatly unrelated part of the ship i think its high time ccp buckled down and gave the caldari somthing nice if we have to suck at pvp at least make our missiles look cooler
supporting my own topic
good idea thought about the same thing
yes please
the missiles are coming from the center due to optimization and missiles having real flight paths unlike projectilesthis can however be fixed imo by keeping the flight path from the center in terms of the game mechanics while visually the missiles should be flying from the launchers and follow along the path created by the game mechanical missile position without being forced all into one lumpin this way the game mechanics remain simple while the visuals will be stunning as the missile group is launched in a quick sequence after quickly accelerating towards the same point they start the dance of the missiles
i support this too one other thing i noticed is that turrets have a much better ability to fire at random times from a ship whereas missles seem to have definite onesecond clumps of shots ie in a drake when you hit f1f7 to fire your missles they either all fire simultaneously at the beginning of the launch cycle or some will fire initially another set will fire one second afterwards and if you have a straggler youll get one or two more missles one second after the second setif ccp could get both visual missle launcher turrets and allow for more randomized timing of the launches it would be visually quite stunning imagine the coolness of the graphics and sound from a stream of randomly timed torpedos hitting a target in rapid succession instead of them all happening in big blobs one second apart from each other
without a total ship modelling overhaul visible missile hardpoints wont be around for a very long time however the missile hit effects are due for some serious changes
rec
i too would like to see better missile effects
even i as someone who hates missiles with a passion think this is a good idea
not supported because it defies game logican afterburner simply provides addtional thrust to the ships normal sublightspeed drive systema warp or microwarp drive is supposed to operate by warping a pocket of spacetime around the ship which is precisely why it doesnt work in dead space
and the reason you cannot activate afterburner and microwarpdrive simultaneously is because mwd both provides additional thrust and warps space not if it is scrammed and cannot warp space it will still attemt to do so producing enormous amount of various effectsemissions and minor distruption of space which is why it is so much easier to lock for your sensors but the afterburner component will still function properly
needed changes should not be avoided simply because it favors one group more than anotherneeded changes should not be avoided simply because they disagree with your precious rp the games setting should be made to fit the desired game play models we can always say that advances in mwd technology have allowed it at least some level of functionality in deadspace etc
weve already changed it so that exploration sites allow mwd use we plan to do the same for mission sites but that will be part of a much larger renovations project that incorporates other changes as well its already on the agenda though
thank you for this insight i look forward to this implementation
wormhole mechanics are fine as isif you really want to kill people in wh space let them enter and warp away then drop a bubble on their exit and go get them
wormholes are fine delayedmode local lends whs to stalking ones target if you want to sit on a gate and shoot at anything that comes through go to lowsec00
here we go again you think you know what i intended with this system but you are wrongthere will be easy missions alongside the more complexchallenging missionsyou might wanna respond to my posts before you continue on that line you are not providing anything constructive and if i said you thought missions should give the players 100 million isk every time by shooting a noob frigate i wouldnt be correct now would ibut if i did roam these forums for any thread you post in that is related to level 4 missions and told people that is how you thought about it you wouldnt be very happy and i wouldnt be very constructive now would iso once again ive kept every players experience and skills in mind and it doesnt matter if you have been here since 2003 or joined yesterday you will eventually lose a ship running missions and you will have the power to decide what mission you want to subscribe to if you happen to subscribe to all the most difficult missions out of greed or sheer stupidity then you only have yourself to blamethe easier missions are there and they might not be as lucrative as the difficult ones but thats what risk vs reward is and that is what is missing from the current system as it is now once youve run a mission you know what its about and can fit or fly to counter it being able to complete it perfectly every time and only get better at it the reward is there but the risk is gone because the only reason you would lose a ship in that situation would be if you forgot to activate your tank and that is a user error and doesnt make the mission any more riskyi have been running level 4 missions for 2 years and counting last time i lost a ship in a mission was more than 19 months ago and that was because of user error i thought i was running a different mission than i actually was running
the forum has eaten the long reply so short versioni say that your are trying to balance mission around old players with good ships because it is the way your idea will workreread what you wrote in your long presentation read it like it was some other guy presentation dont add what is only in your head and dont think it will work as you think it will work think about what you are suggesting in your writingthere are no checks to balance mission within the same level there is no way to reliably inform people of the difficulty of the mission in the briefingin a lego system with computer generated descriptions a lot of mission will miss important informations that will endanger the player shipa old player with a good ship can prepare for them even when the mission seem easy a young player or one with a soso ship would be destroyed even before saying ouchwhen i pointed it out the first time your reply wasthat remind me of a old joke about statistic the one where a guy with the head in a oven and the feet in a freezer enjoy a perfect temperatureyou reply is on the same wavelength there are plenty of mission between wick you can chose so some of them are of the right difficulty for you forgetting that there is no reliable way to chose them
the player fits on npcs wont work sleepers are generic and still create enough of a nightmare if one is not properly prepared a decent fit ship is hard enough to solo in an equal hull adding just 1 or 2 such ships to a spawn will make some missions nigh impossiblethe last paragraph concerning a competitive element has a huge potential for a lowsec mission boost basically offering another tier to mission running if you are willing to run the risks create new lowsec only corporate divisions with speciality itemsprices in lp store has to really matter for people to want to risk life and limb reduce or eliminate sec status hits inside dynamiccompetitive mission ded space creating true competition  dynamiccompetitive ded spaces can be probed out after activation ie warped to low signature like the hardtonail exploration sitesmaybe make a bunch of small mission arcs using that fancy tool ccp has for them nothing major but 35 steps each would go a long way towards making things a little more interesting if mixed up enoughno matter what you do it will become same old after a while though  a truly dynamic mission system would be such an insane drain on server resources that it is a practical impossibility or so i presume restricting it to a small number of agents in lowsec should be possible without killing off all hamsters in the first hour and could increase lowsec populations quite a lot if done right
i am in general a 00 alliance player and ive dabbled enough in missions to make a safe buck to make it recently to level 4 missionssomething i noticed that wasnt new to me but did fly against many suggestions made by the ccp guides for missions came to my attention the issue is aggro and more specifically how npc aggro works on missions in relation to player dronesthe guide would tell you to manage aggro only pulling a few ships at a time as pulling an entire grouping would be near impossible unless you have a very heavily tanked ship and enough skills trained to keep in the fight however with a drone boat such as the dominix i currently use managing aggro is nearly impossible as the npcs as current will attack your drones even if not pulled now with my current skill set i can manage pulling every npc at once so they dont kill my drones making me defenselesshowever i got to thinking that players less skilled would probably not easily be able to accomplish this feat and would have to resort to buying new ships different tactics etc that they may not have training for thusly increasing the displeasure of the experience for the playerso the proposal i would make is to change npc aggro sensitivity to work in the same way as they do in relation to the player ship on missions the correct npc ships would only attack the drones if they entered the same proximity or agressed the npcs the same way as they treat the player i think for those of us who use drones this would make the overall experience much much more enjoyable
i have a small idea maybe its a bit crazy but here it goesi would like all sov holding structures flags or whatever in 00 to be invaulnerableunlockable untill there is a war declaration and it would be impossible to plant structures that would threaten sov without a wardecie only entitys at war can attack the sov of each otherthis would enable the entitys that are at war in 00 to be at war everywhere as it should be total war no hiding in lowhigh secif 2 alliance fleets are in a fight to the death jump through one gate then suddenly they cant shoot each otherthis would ofc not prevent entitys allied to the attacker that are not at war to raidharrass the target in 00 but they could not attack sov without a war decthis might allso be used as a diplomatic systemtool to end wars surrendering with the option of handing over systems items andor isk for a peace treaty that would last for x daysmonthsyearsif a peace treaty is signed with terms for 6 month peace treaty then the attackerdefender entity couldnt wardec attack the sov of the enemy for that time ofc he could still pvp with themofc this can be abused with moving all corpalliance members under a new flag but this would rather be the exeptions imho
i didnt want to be the one to tell you this but 00 is 00 because you dont have to pay concord to let you kill people
well corp vs corp 2mweek and alliance to alliance 50mweek what is that compared to the multimillionbillion bill every 00 corpalliace has to pay to concorde every week for just holding the sovnow with domination capturing sov will be much easyerfaster and each corpalliance holding less sov cost of sov then it is likely that long wardecs wont be neccesarybtw regarding the sov payments to concord please pretty please with cherry on top come up with somthing betterrather have some special fuel or some material that is only sold by npc empire andor pirate that was very expensive and small logistics wouldnt be an issue but somone might try and pirate the logistic guy with the expensive fuelsov structure unitsday each unit 1m3tcu 2dayih 1daymaybe a second cheaper material for the upgreade structuresanything better than just bill to concord or some empire entityif we roleplay a bit what would concorde do if you didnt pay the sov bill come and pod you
this is a pretty good idea but it would probably be a issues client side in any sort of large fleet 500ships with 500 different paint jobs spread across lets say 20 ship types that would add 480 more textures then the current client needs to render and bufferid say it might be a good idea around 20112012 when hopefully ccp will force people to at least directx 90c with sm30 if not dx10 with sm40 for min requirements which would be anything newer then a nvidia geforce 6 series or radeon x1k series
i think this is a good idea i want to see ccp force upgrades to higher direct x levels but frankly they do need to keep direct x 9 support since people are going to be using xp till the end of time putting directx 10 suport would be nice
pink up me world
client side issues if there were any  can be dealt with by simply making color varients a check box in graphic settings plenty of people play on low graphics with no audio this is some longover due fluff for those of us operating on maximum graphics with no lag d
i like this idea and it should hopefully be a simple changewe have people who put up corp contracts of ready fitted ships and it is a pain for them to time out before they are all used up
if the abillity to manually set standings would be removed it is a thought that haunted me for a long time now and i dont have the eve insight to comprehent the consequences
interestingso we are to trust you can you seriously tell us how you are more trust worthy than larkonis trassleri must say ccp disappoints me greatly what is the process that they vet out candidates for the csm do they look at petitions for people do they look at eula violations do they look at the hundreds of petitions for harassment in game and out of gamei wonder how they missed this one hes another larkonisgate in the making
hes a worthless griefer why does this surprise you he sits on a gate all day and preys on helpless noobs thats not what a real man does

noticed it happen a few times during pvp although this could be atributed to lag where you tell your drones to return to bay and they flat out ignore you i have also seen it in missons with multiple agro you tell it a ship to shoot and the drone icon dose flick over to the desired target with all 5 drones if you hover the mouse over it then about a second later it will switch back and shoot whatever random it feels like usualy the triger heh
ah yes the returningthats the only problem i have discovered occasionally but it could be atributed to lag alone
would like to add that i will be supporting any motions that deal with fixing command ships and maybe prepare one of my own together with a few more experiences cs pilots again ideas welcome
i have been in z0ds corp now over 2 years great cool knowledgeable guy he has my vote
i am interested in knowing a bit morethis political party idea where how  whotill now i like what i see
erik read a text message from ankhaywert68732tr6gd out loud at the csm3 summit in iceland loli liked erik finengan he was cool to hang out with irl but the guy was really clueless about a lot of game mechanics and i generally think the take care party has been a counterproductive influence on the csm
counterproductive to the goon agenda im sure yesas for the text message erik asked me rather specific factional warfare question iirc which he didnt know the answer to he asked me not the other way around i bet you didnt know the answer either so glad to have been of serviceits not really a political party its more of a think tank so that all players can have a say and the csm representative really represents the players instead of them going gee thanks for the free tickets bye and you never hearing a word till the next load of vague election promisesthe reason i founded this organisation back in early 2008 was that i wanted to represent as broad a section of the playerbase and i knew my knowledge was lacking in certain aspects mainly 00 and industry mechanics but there were quite a few knowledgeable players in these areas which didnt have the will to run for csm themselves at that time z0d was one of those back then we got together and i agreed to confer with them after the elections so that i benefited from their experience and they got a say in things in return the organisation grew over time as i started receiving a lot of lengthy emails during my time on the csm and players wished to discuss their ideas and feedback with meone of the things i consider important to the csm is continuity and after csm1 we saw a few csm leaving with their remaining issues being orphaned in addition documentation became cluttered i started organizing this in my wiki which was later integrated in the evelopedia by omber zombie but i realized that all of my knowledge would be lost after i had served two terms on the csm this is why take care got together and appointed erik as representative for csm3 i went to berlin in person to talk him through all of the remaining issues csm1 and csm2 have dealt with and what ccps replies and promises werezastrow may criticize erik for not having much knowledge about the game mechanics im sure that his gap in knowledge is limited to 00 and fw mechanics though but the reason we picked him is that he has been altruistic not having ego issues nor being a prima donna as weve unfortunately seen on past csms the csm is about bringing people with different views together and working togethernow how can you players contribute to take care send us emails come up with ideas and discuss them when you see us online come talk to us we bring likeminded individuals together and have some group discussions if possible and then hopefully draft a post on the assembly hall so the csm can take the matter to ccp

greetings my name is teadaze and im here to ask for you to vote in the upcoming csm 4 elections of course i would be very happy if you decide i am the right candidate for your votes but the most important thing is that you do vote for somebodyeve is a unique place with a vibrant and diverse community and where players can shape the news and even the game itself the csm is an important part of this taking player ideas and issues filtering them and finally passing the best to ccp for a response as the csm is under a greater deal of scrutiny due to recent events i feel it is important to vote for candidates who take the responsibility seriously it is in the best interests of the players to vote and continue to post issues in the assembly forum because it shows ccp that the csm process is worth supporting furtherabout mei have been playing eve since 2005 and currently specialise in 00 small gang pvp but like many people i started as an empire carebear running missions for a while was a member of a spaceholding alliance i also dabble in market trading have an alt in factional warfare run a reaction pos and am involved with low scale t2 production via invention so have a wide variety of game experience to draw on i was selected to be one of the commentators for at7 and was also invited to be on stage commentating at fanfesti teach classes with agony unleashed to help players new to pvp to find their feetout of game i am a senior software developer with an engineering degree and 10 years of experience in the professionwhat can i offeri take the csm process seriously and will put in the necessary effort during at7 i spent many hours on research and with a couple of the other experts produced many of the notes used while in iceland i am methodical and committed to researching any subject raised by the players thoroughlyi have a wide breadth of eve knowledge including areas outside of my primary pvp focus i will listen to feedback from players on any issue and ensure items are presented to the csm as proposed by the players before the csm make any amendments accurate representationi will attempt to get correspondence to the players in a timely manner some of this might be out of the csms control but in that case the playerbase need to be kept updated even if it is to say that ccp havent yet published the supplied materialrisk should be rewarded for example im looking towards lowsec players for suggestions on how to improve it if people want to stay in empire that is fine but those wanting a riskier path should find it worthwhile to do so carrot not stickim in favour of where possible buffing a weaker item instead of nerfing stronger ones i feel that not all ships need to be good at solo pvp and that racial differences should be maintained rather than homogenizing everything that said balance is important and must be maintained in some way if an item is nerfed such as webs or sensor damps then in most cases specialised ships that have bonuses to that item need a slight buff to maintain some balance looking at minmatar and gallente recons heredominion is being released a day before the csm results are published it is likely the majority of issues raised to the fourth csm will be related to those changes however i want to ensure that whilst any issues resulting from dominion sov changes faction ships etc are addressed that other topics are still submitted toosome of you might agree with my position but might have specific issues i will try to address some of the common ones in a further posti will be happy to answer any questions you havetldrvote for teadaze
why vote for me and not another 00 candidateit is likely the large 00 alliances will be well represented on the csm without additional votes from players outside those alliances their combined block voting will take around four or five of the nine available seats going on previous resultswhilst i live in 00 i dont have political connections to any space holding alliances i represent a different style of 00 play agony and others base out of npc 00 a current necessity for station access without getting into naps and roam around looking for targets i wish to ensure this remains viable post dominion and beyond and represent the smaller gangs which move fast hit hard and gtfo or explode spectacularly it is all good why vote for me and not another pvp candidateas an instructor with agony unleashed i have taught hundreds of players how to take their first steps in pvp and have a good understanding of the challenges they face i want to help educate players in how to survive in pvp and maybe they will get the same pvp bug that i didas i stated above i wish to ensure that small gang roaming pvp remains viable to all this is applicable to low sec as well as 00 dwellers i know agony have a reputation for only flying frigates but rest assured we fly every ship class in game to some degree and when i say small roaming gangs i mean subcapital ships with between 220 pilotsi support many forms of pvp even though i prefer 00 roaming this includes piracy gate camping and even pos bashing just dont ask me to join in i prefer a policy of educating people in how to avoid obvious ganks rather than attempting to remove current tools in place dont break the sandbox however that isnt to say that some things shouldnt be made a bit more trickyi am a ccp certified pvp expert why vote for me if you live in lowsecbecause i hadnt spent time with factional warfare since it was released i put an alt back into fw recently and have been splitting my time between fw missions small roaming gangs and larger fleets i know people have ideas for improvements and will look into any raised armed with my recent experiences therewhilst i am not a pirate i have a good relationship with many pirate corps and understand their game style it is a valid form of pvp even if not to everybodys taste as i said above i support risk vs reward and this appears to need looking at in lowsecwhy vote for me if you live in empirethere may be other candidates that are a better fit for people who live in empire however i feel i can still represent your needsi have experience of being a carebear missions and mining and understand some of the frustrations therei trade run a pos do low scale manufacturing so have better than simple background knowledge in those areasi help many people to get into the mindset of pvp even if they decide that style of play is not for themso ends my wall of texttldrno matter what playstyle i can promise i would look at your proposals and submit the best to the next csm meeting for votingvote for teadaze
hey teai think people might like to hear your thoughts on dev focus after dominion comes online could you expand on your statement above where do think they should be putting their effortspin
i think this relates to this point listed aboveby this i imply that for the larger space holding alliances there will be many specific sov 00 issues that need to be looked at asap once dominion hits whilst i agree that due to the level of changes a great deal of csm effort will be expended in analysing player concerns about the new mechanisms for sov titan and supercarriers i would aim to discuss other longstanding issues directly relevant to other aspects of the game tooincluding but not limited toquality of life changes such as shared corp bookmarksbalance issues such as the assault ships 4th bonus minmatar and gallante reconsfollowing up any of the previously raised items that have not had a responsesome issues raised between now and one week before the first csm 4 meetingthe csm is supposed to reflect the whole playerbase and if elected to csm 4 i will attempt to reflect that on the issues raised

as a longtime experienced player ceo of various 00 corporations and friend of ahsekuaw it is my honest opinion and perception that ahsekuaw holds dear the many values that we as pilots should come to hope for in a candidate to represent us ahsekuaw has remained one of the very few in my many travels that has consistently done his best to remain understanding and considerate of others and their respective needsi feel his handson analysis of game mechanics his interest in the welfare of this game and its participants makes him one of the best candidates for csmi endorse this ancients product

i would settle for the ability to easily share bookmarks among a fleet something like a share bookmark to fleet option maybe this would make the scout marker usefulfyi there are shortcuts unused by default that you can set for engage target return and orbit and return to drone bay i believe the lack of launch drones is because for ships with more than 5 drones which are you launching i guess they could possibly allow you to set a shortcut to launch members of the a particular foldergroup but that could lead to a lot of groupsif you sort the unused shortcuts by description and why would you sort by anything else you should find them near the top starting with the drone prefix or something like thati use control e for engage control s for orbit and control d for return to drone baycoolwhich part is clunky because i love the dev that put in the specific item and minimum price fields why scroll through the countless 800k wtb contracts on 700m isk itemsi think more sophisticated ais could be added to l5s since their low sec locations mean fewer people run them which means fewer people run them at the same time in the same system as ccp has said sleeper ai is more taxing on the system it uses a combination of damage taken and net effect on the target into considerationbut even if l5s were being considered they arent utilized enough to justify developer time that is better directed towards fixing rocketsi thought low sec was for people that couldnt make enough friends to push into null sec i kid mostly

my blogepisode 9 on planet risk where i had a chance to speak herei do not have a huge force behind me i am counting on people who probably dont read the forums for that sort of thing i am just a casual player   more carebear than pvp because i do not have the funds to replace lost ships more missions than mining because i can only stare at a screen of rocks for so long more comedy and sarcasm than is warranted because i like to have fun when i gamethis is a game not a second jobi entered into the race to try to help make the game better not different i seem to be in the minority in that i dont have a dozen planks to my platform i am supposed to be a representative of the player base not an unpaid game dev figuring out all the bugs and fixes by myself that being said i would like to see the ui get smoother and the sandbox continue to be what it is all things to all people pvp for those who want it relative but not total safety for those who want pve consequences for actions that you take no matter what those actions aremy name is mike azariah in game    in real life i teach high school    math and sciences i am used to dealing with tears whining and griefing think back to your own high school days i do not flinch in calling things as i see them and when it is bull    i call that too not on the best terms with admin at timesif you are reading this you have probably already made up your mind who you are voting for fine but if you have 3 votes how about tossing one towards a normal player    one who is still saving for the next shiny ship who has only one account and enjoys the game in moderation one who is not trying to make his career the best and the only true way  to play my name is mike azariah and i am asking for your votesmike
im looking for the candidate that will verbally beat ccp about the head and shoulders until they revert once again to they find a way to allow at the very minimum the major rp alliances to participate in fw it is absolutely ridiculous that ccp has decided that the two oldest participants in the faction war  having been fighting the war since long before fw existed and even before alliances existed  will continue to be excluded from the fw mechanics this after years of bashing our heads against them finally getting them to agree to allow us access now with a slight tweak to their proposed changes theyve written us back out of the storyso which candidate can convince me they actually care about rp issues and mine in particular
from the finally published csmccp september meeting notesso perhaps the wheels are already in motion
that is the very quote that has made me upset ive emphasized the key words this would exclude both cva and ushrakhan from participatipating these are two of the oldest alliances in the game and have been rping the faction war since the early days of eve then ccp finally started working on the mechanics wed been waiting to see for so long and when the 24th imperial crusade was formed to reclaim minmatar lowsec the group responsible for the largest territory increase in centuries cva was told to go home and when the tribal liberation force was formed to break the chains of our kin the oldest freedomfighting alliance in the game uk was told that our phone number would be blocked if we kept callingsince then weve been told that they were working on mechanics to fix that oversight  and now thisso my question stands which candidate actually cares about rp and will fight to get ccp to understand what all those letters in mmorpg stand for as opposed to all of the ones in the csm currently winding down
interestingso we are to trust you can you seriously tell us how you are more trust worthy than larkonis trassleri must say ccp disappoints me greatly what is the process that they vet out candidates for the csm do they look at petitions for people do they look at eula violations do they look at the hundreds of petitions for harassment in game and out of gamei wonder how they missed this one hes another larkonisgate in the making
hes a worthless griefer why does this surprise you he sits on a gate all day and preys on helpless noobs thats not what a real man does
if it were not such a sad person running there would be humor in this seriously this is truly sadthis guy makes it onto the csm we are only going to hear about how hes been kicked because he beat the crap out of someone who refused to agree with his half baked fail agenda
thats a lot of is in your blog you got there im happy that you think you know where a game played by 300000 others should gostill one can see you put a lot of work and thought into some of your ideas so i imagine it wont be the end when the goons vote you in
yes lets ignore the events a few months back i remember they hated the idea of salvaging carrying aggressionflagsbut at the same time i guess the real scares were always in wardecs so youre probably rightone would hope that they finally have small and medium turrets trained to level 5 by now oooh shiny
first of all thank you to all those who support the ideology of our newly formed political party and thank you to everyone who has decided to give yoursupport to logit probit for the next csm we are still in our infancy as a political party but rest assured that we will be fighting for your rights as a player as we expand our sphere of influencethe sandbox preservation party supports salvaging in its current implementation as ccp has deemed that the salvage found in a wreck belongs to the first person that gets to it we do not support mission runners having ownership of the salvage however personally i pray to be shot at when i am salvaging a mission as i loot every single mission that i scan down thats my playstyle though not all ninjas will loot some ninjas will only collect salvage from the wrecks  again salvage that has no legal owner until it is picked up the fact of the matter is that given the opportunity 95 of mission runners will not shoot at a ninja salvager even if they have aggro rights i wouldnt expect them to start shooting if the salvage ownership mechanics were changedbutthe formation of the party is not about suddenly ninjas or ninja salvaging it is about the preservation of the sandbox as a whole with ninja salvaging only being a small part of the larger picturean example of the downfall of the sandbox would be the recent changes to aggro mechanics a little known fact is that there used to be a way for players to extend the aggro timer effectively allowing you to bring justice to those who had aggressed you keep in mind this mechanic was not an exploit but a legitimate tactichowever ccp has recently changed this game mechanic so that it is not as effective as it once was and now the aggro timer will eventually run out the tactic still works its just very limited now  which in itself assists the perpetrator in escaping justice i dont know about you but i find that pretty restrictive and a definitely blow to the preservation of the sandbox there have been countless other changes including increased response times by concord and the increased security status hit for aggression in empire spacethe sandbox preservation party is not looking to dominate the csm or the direction of eve we simply support players who have an open mind and who wish to be equally represented on the csm players who choose to play the game as it was meant to be played  as a completely openended universe playable in virtually anyway you choose you want to suicide gank fine you want to mine awesomeright now our web address wwwsavethesandboxorg is forwarded to a post on my blog supporting logit probit for csm im looking to make a more official page sometime in the future so stay tuned for thatsave the sandbox power to the playersvelocity primechairman the sandbox preservation party
i would support a space libertarian except theres already a candidate for that its me lol
i think that without a crystal ball it will be difficult to determine what if any changes any patch will make that will with any degree of certainty dictate a limitation or restriction of any preordained activity beyond the actual actions of the activity itselfwhat does that mean it means by the changes in dominion were seeing an obvious and wholesale beating of the 00 big boy alliances ninja is capitalizing on this travesty by offering up a political party with this as an example on which to launch a platformit is important to remember that we are not psychics or fortune tellers there are many changes that people have wildly differing opinions on so determining that a change drastically impairs a particular activity in game is indeed no metric at all it is a parlor trick intended on riling your anger to sweep your wind into their sailsthe basis of political parties in eve should rely on economics the cold hard reality upon which this universe derives all meaning the will of provider ccp with the design development and corporate backbone of the game we love and the will of the consumer the person footing the bill for all this fun any party would want to divide their policies and platforms along these lines if they are to provide cogent and defensible positions on any topicplease dont bring meaningless rhetoric to our game if we are to have parties let them be born of reason and logic with meaningful things to debate enough with the slander and doomsayer predictions bring facts figures pollsinformation is power use it wisely

sorry the comments you made gave me the impression you hadnt read the threadso let me explain myself better and maybe correct me if i am wrong here trzzbk clarify trzzbks point a bitthe idea isnt to force a different style of play on anyone its to prevent people from hiding in npc corps that doesnt mean you necessarily some entire corps will empty out into npc corps if they are wardecd just to avoid the war this and other similar practices make npc corps as they exist now problematicunder my proposal this goon inspired aspect would make it more difficult to get into and stay in an npc corp they would be standing dependent and would be more expensive to be in another thing i thought of today that expands on the npc corp reinforcements idea would be that any system regardless of sec level would provide npc combat ship support to members of the npc corps that owned that system that would provide added value for the higher isk costs of being in that npc corp and also add another interesting aspect to the gameso to recap this conceptstarter npc corp kicks you to an intermediate npc corp at some point either determined by sp or time not sure yetoptions for which intermediate npc corp you move to is determined by your sec status root faction standing or some other measurement the higher that number the better npc corp you have the option to join this point is important this mechanic would help ensure that players that are serious about being in an npc corp make up the vast majority of members of npc corps it would also help to prevent most people from hiding in npc corps on a whimbetter npc corps have lower taxes better services etcbetter npc corps are more costly to war dec to the point of being nearly cost prohibitive but not impossiblelower end npc corps are cheaper to war dec but easier to hop in and out ofimplementation of this change would be fairly simple once implemented a grace period would begin that would allow current members of all npc corps to meet the requirements of the corp or move on either to a real corp or to another npc corp
just thought of another idea that could be used in addition to or instead of the last ideaintroduce a mechanic that makes leaving a corp en mass less attractive from the perspective of the corp as an entity perhaps a corp standing hit or some other condition that would be easily absorbed by standard membership turnover but would be dramatic in the case of a mass exodusi dunno though the more i think about this the more i think this is like can flipping ninja salvage or several other things that will be lop sided no matter what you do you cant make it impossible to quit a corp so people could always go somewhere even temporarily if you make quitting take longer its only going to impede legitimate player circulation and even so a determined corp may have a couple sets of alts in other corps they can shelter in or worst case scenario they can all quit start a new corp and make the war chase themone thing everyone can probably agree on is that this game is chock full of cowardly yet clever s even if everyone in this case is talking about everyone but themselves and their buddies yah i dunno i think this one will require some critical thinking this csm candidate is going to smoke a bowl and think on it and inhalation is absolutely going to happen i leave you with this to think aboutplease visit your user settings to reenable images

i was under the impression that eve university wasnt about dealing with newbies as one of you has put it it is about taking new pilots and showing them all the things the game can be in other words a player run new player experience look to the corps that some of these new player friendly candidates are in tell me if their actions back up their wordsi am a common face in the help channel i am not an instructor ingame but i help where i can a few others who are running are also worthy of consideration by the university i would point you towards teadaze and song li yes i can say when a competitor is good because i want the best for the csm and the game i want to see someone like me or me get elected should the university step behind one candidate probably not they should read and evaluate and vote from an informed positionbut i would appreciate being part of that considerationmike azariahmike
just to make sure eve university do not explicitly support any one candidate  any slogans or mentions in this thread should not be taken as a sign of support from eve university
i would agree to boosting the black ops only if there were concurrent defenses implemented to provide botha ongrid cloaking detectionaoe decloaking possibilitiesb sovereignty holder antiafk cloaker possibilitiescurrently the blackops is primarily a logistical tool for sbrecon gangs and for that they are very effective if there were tools to counter cloakers offensively not just using bait and hoping they make a mistake then id be allfor increasing their jumpportal range far enough to make some of the very long interregion leaps such as to the drone region from the northkrum

the first paragraph there sums it up pretty well as i see it even with comparable damage bonuses blasters deal inferior damage at inferior range compared to lasers the armor rep bonus is not nearly as bad as the mwd cap penalty bonus though  medium size blasterboats arent going to win fleet battles so the dps they are likely to be subject to isnt too large for a good active rep tank to have an effect and switching it to a res bonus takes a lot of the flavor away perhaps an ab bonus instead
its a good idea but maybe it should require a special module and skill
supported for moms since they cant docki would like to see some kind of fuel consumed though possibly tritanium
omg yes ive groused about this in the past on my blog its a much needed change my preference is a 2hour reduction per level total reduction should never exceed 12 hours in any event some other ideasoptionscould require infomorph psychology to level v before you can train it could require a skill and an implant to make it workan implant that requires cybernetics to v im sure there are others didnt read the whole thread yet anything that forces a choice would be fine whatever but please give us a choice to be able to reduce the time between clone jumps
now that weve made use of this loophole to win please close it to prevent others using it against us or our friendsthanks ccp

eves ui is archaic bulky busy space consuming and overwhelming there are easier ways to display 90 of the information both in a prettier way and a more space efficent way and with the planetary updates in dominion well be pretty much set for graphics changes except for the ui that is which looks remarkably like some of the early versions of windows what would the new ui look like well personally i would like to see that holographic interface used in the eve trailers recently put into the game proper i think it would really add something but i leave the specifics up to the community at large the only requirements of this new ui would beconservation of space currently eve is spreadsheets online i find that in half of my combat encounters im basically instrument flying using the overview and have so many windows open i cant see what im shootingease of use the ui is a signifigant part of the barrier to entry to eve its just so complex that it overwhelms most people it doesnt need to most of the information could be presented much better and much more clearlyadaptable assets this is more of an expansion on what is already ingame you should be able to move and adjust and relocate pretty much every asset on the ui allowing players to choose how to arrange all the elements would make the game much easier to work with with these three elements you can create a ui optimized to you personally that fulfills its functions and makes the game better to look at

ill side with the keep the one mid crew on this one the retri needs help for sure but it doesnt need to homogenize with the rest of the af out there just like i would oppose adding a second mid slot to the coercer the retri merely needs to be better at its assigned role in the amarr lineup dealing large amounts of facemelting damage are range while tanking long enough to get the job doneyes it could use more speed so could all the afrather than swapping the high down to the mid the retribution deserves a 5th turret and concurrent increases in fitting plus a bit more if any ship deserved to be able to fit toptier frigate guns without fitting mods in both lr and damage versions its the retri retri could also use a higher lockrange the ship does very well as a replacement for the destroyers that dont work in keeping other frigates honest it is still unfortunately a questionable choice for a gang because either you should be taking a sb for the larger targets or tackle because your gang is heavy damage should be around sb levels or a bit less to make it reasonablekrum

agreed void is absolutely useless atm so is the highdamage railgun charge forgot the name they half your tracking with void also severly cutting your falloff need inssane amount of skills to use and offer nearly no additional damage over navy antimatter the range and tracking cut would be acceptable if there damage would be significantly larger then they could be used to give small ship edge over larger ships say frigate over a bs or used by hacs and bs against capitals they either need much lower penalties or increase in efficiency

i approve of this product andor servicemission runners dont complain too much if empire and 00 are worth about the same amount empire is much easier and empire scaled infinitely then nothing will really change except some deflation
i say lets just invert empire and nullsec too turn 00 into 10 and allow wardecs to be protection decs where you pay for someone not to shoot youequally as crazy
tax me baby one more time
this is needed
i support equality
eve used to be harsh this is a step back in the right direction
i dont know how could this be done but its a good idea in a odd weird messed up way with the upgrade system in place the more you rat the better the rat will be  same thing with mining and such omg well get 47m npc rats in beginner systems lol same thing goes for mining wowanyway this troll but good intention in it
now about 60  of the ore come from mission by reprocessing its clearly too high i propose to reduce the pourcentage reprocessing from 100  to 60 if you have the skill max the reprocessing will be 60  of the ore you need to build the item
simply remove the loot from missions and u will see that1 mission income is equal vs 00 income risk vs reward2 mining abc ores in 00 is worth it again after adjusting drone alloys3 manufacturing gets a boost4 t1234 modules will have their prices corrected to the value of the mod5 ccp will lose numerous isk sellers6 ccp will lose numerous isk farmers mission runners that buy plexes anyway
TRUE
60 of the people who play this game love to make statistics up on the spotnot supported
i kinda agree with this proposal especially the no meta 0 loot from missions under one condition that they first make mining more interesting the reason the market is flooded with these minerals is in two parts  the missions are more interesting and more profitableplease note im not saying to necessarily nerf missions but rather to buff mining yields andor activity while mining however given the game mechanics as they are now i cannot support this proposal
kinda the whole point of my thread vm hard to recruit people when activities in 00 are no more remunerative than the exact same activities carried out in hisec more dangerous and ultimately harder to performthe whole point of this thread is to present ideas on how to attract people to 00 because lets face it ccp has said that they would like to see more people in 00 and fewer in empire and i think weve all established that ccp is perfectly willing to take actions to improve their game from their point of view even if those actions would angerupset and even piss off their player base nanonerf anyonemy opinion is that its better to attract them with honey ie  00 is better for everything than empire than to force people out ie  nerf every activity in empiredo you or anyone else have any ideas to contribute towards encouraging players to go to 00 keeping in mind that is ccps stated goal whether you me or anyone else likes it or agrees with it
heres my support ive long held this idea for a long time ya theyve said itd be hard itd be so worth it though plus those 50000isk docking fees would be so worth it alsoalso since there are 5 levels of any of those industry military strategic the scale can easily be madelvl 1  lvl 1 agentlvl 2  lvl 2 agentlvl 3  lvl 3 agentlvl 4  lvl 4 agentlvl 5  lvl 5 agentpersonally i have a feeling that treaties and these agents and a few other neat little nuggets will be coming together after a fair bit of internal testing i suspectalso technically the agent doesnt even have to be in the stationagents in space are fairly common you can put them  the infrastructure hub though doing this hurts the docking fees and suchthis would mean that mean pvpers can go around killing agents everyday after downtime so having them in every one of your systems would be good

ok so normal ship gives you anomalies that you can warp to using the scanner how about make it so tech 3 ships are able to detect wormholes without probes perhaps at the cost of being able to scan down anomalies like normal shipscould be an interesting change
someone got stuck in his shiny t3 cruiser
the billboards at the moment are pretty boring wouldnt it be awesome if they streamed to eve tournaments and stuff and maybe more of them around stations larger ones at a side of a station that cover almost half of it and when there is are no tournaments they could stream some kind of eve chronicle with moving textpictures something interesting to watch while on stationgate rather than the concord dont do drugs signsif the quality of the in game screen was good enough would allow a look at button to maximize the screen without much transparency i think it would be common to see a bunch of pilots just hovering around a billboard at a station or gate watching the tournaments in game at the moment players dont really have much business with each other outside stations in high sec spaceon stations i guess they would be either aligned with the undock example 2 or just off the station at a certain angle example 1 kind of like this ms paint owns
oh and maybe allow corporations to rent out a billboard during a certain time for some kind of commercial for contracts or mercenary hiring the commercials would of course have guidelines and rules and would need to be approved
dont  with wormholes
waaaaaa i want easy gankswaaaaaa i want to critmass thehole then sit there waiting for something far smaller to come thru to gankwaaaaaa game mechanic that is there to stop this is bothering mewormspace is pretty damn barren atm camping the entrances will the complete opposite of what would get people into wormspacei like it how it is tbh
you forgot the last waaaaa cause i also want a free 10000000000000 isk and maybe a cheeseburger
i like using spareempty slots for offline mods to act as heatsinks andor for later use if no station is available problem is onlining a module requires 75 of cap which means that i can have a rather long downtime before moving onproposaladd a 10lvl reduction in cap requirement for onlining modules in space to either energy grid upgrades or energy management or an entirely different  those just seem logicalwith a maximum of 375 of cap drained when onlining in space with skill maxed fitting solutions currently impracticable open upi personally cant see any major downside to it but may be blind to it so feel free to point it out if you can
works for me but i dont feel we need a new skill for this maybe the racial skill for that ship or some other skill but not a new skill dedicated to this imo
for the killmail im sorry but even though this is good info to give i rather want ccp to work on this problem if im shooting x ship i want that killmail even if im not the guy who laid the final blow its hard enough to find out who killed him we have to deal with the question or even order please post your killmail on kb so i support it but very very very low on my list

glad to see you running for a csm position elven the eve community will be better as a result of your influencethanks for running
teadaze has my support a good in between the best aspects of eve imo 
to begin with i shoot goons and their friends however the ops point about goons bringing to the table many important changes some benefit the game as a whole while hurting goons is validavalloc csmaddkick character historyfocus groupfix cloaking gangslassie fighter come homechange clone totrash it activeeasier way to switch characterswhat 00 system was thatthe abyss that is a carriers corp hangarflag the looterthe ole boarding an unfitted ship now i have to wait 20 secondsi just lost the fleet to a dd because effects were turned offwhy cant we unrent these offices in the outposts we captured a month agowhere have all the bookmarks gonethe i dont want to log goon local spam buttoni hate pos modules and they hate meon bouncing off a pos because you forgot to reenter the pw for the thousandth timeidentifying the idiot who is trying to bring a noob ship in fleetwho is this and why are they convoing mean improved logofskizastrowwhy doesnt my pod fit in the carrier toowhy cant i make money in 00 without being a goonfix outpost docking radius so you can play docking games with goonsmarlona sky this is a short list of current issues brought by goons for you
the obvious question here is so what would you do to make it work
that would be handy for fleet ops but in wh space thats no more usefull then the current system nor does it help corps deceminate tactical bookmarks if they move to a new home locationi have those setup and use them all the time but the drone interface already has a way to group drones it would be nice to be able to hotkey those groups for launchyou cant contract a container in a ship a good reason theyre not utilised is because theyre in low sec running in a mission fit or group of mission fits in low sec is still flying a target if low sec missins were reconfigured to be more like a sleeper site where you need  can use pvp setups and where the ai targets new players on grid you would balance out the odds of the missioners more instead of a pure target you would have a small gang that could fight back im all for ways of bringing missioners into low sec but that will require a change in current missions design or riskreward balance

im writing this as i read so here goesapparently and as far as i know its only rumoured but the pc version of assassins creed 2 as been delayed till next year to get running on dx 11can anyone in ccp guarantee that its not going to happen with incarna or whatever the name will be in 2010it could even get me in to fps pvp but please release it and incarna before im an old manconsidering it was a meeting with three ccp officials its a little light on detail and especially facts even a non comment on listed questions would go far to increase forum drama and speculation dont tell anyone here that ccp doesnt like itis she single actually is eris a female its the intewebz and theres nothing wrong with asking directly and is she available to be gazed at in a non predatory waywas this added after the forum rage over the weekend
what is the plan for the turn around from new to old it does affect few people however with a single role alliances can be closed corps can be closed personally i dont believe im in that position but as a good administrator of the corp i wouldnt mind being made fully aware of whats going to happen even if it means revoking everyone roles to secure the corp assets or am i too paranoid it would i believe help every new character new player and established corp if rat drops didnt drop tech 1 stuff on the subject of industrial stuff as ive had the pleasure of learning how to use excel access and logical mathematics to get my spreadsheet working would it be too much to ask ccp if waste could be applied in a coherent and unified manor at some point it need not be guess work requiring tech 2 blueprints on sisi and a kindly donation of a t2 bpc in actual game to confirm my which i will always be happy to share even if its not 100 correct theory i would like to thank the csm for standing up for the industrial side of the game arguably the most important not the most fashionable or the most glamorous but important nonetheless i would like to take this opportunity to  my excellent audit skills when it comes to income and expenses over a period of time what youcorpalliance does in the future can always be based on the report i provide as long as its over a long enough period of time all i require is an api key capable of full wallet information retrieval and a nominal isk amount for my time yes i really really love access excel and eve hq glaring easter egg before christmas  what is the parameter ccp would like to tweak i thought  and i could be wrong here  if a character had access to at least one corp wallet division and had the blueprint and minerals in the same division that they have query access to currently based on rolestitles of course  that they could build from that query division being paid from that wallet division if im wrong let me know great idea as long as both or more characters are similarly skilled up or the quota is so large that its done on corporation scale perhaps d woot corp missions for empire how can it possibly fail except to empty 00 agreed its their business to record the events not make them erm you know what i mean what about free station services for the controlling fw members is eft in the new browser going to workccp baldur recognizes the need for short clear and unequivocal sounds cowbellbye
you tease monsters youre evil or im rather slow and its been public for a while now the thought that excited me was getting huge outposts or pos towers even the dead horse pos that should be more popular than the beatles and quite possible removing local from 04 and belowwill ccp make it easier for people to import overview settings without first having to export them to create the directory personally i play eve through the overview  whatever i am required to do i do through the overview  if i cant see it it doesnt matter getting new and even experienced players to actually use the tag column is more annoying than getting corp members to read the forums suffice to say its complicated to explain via voicewhy cant a corporation or even an alliance recruit for a limited period of time an agent based in station of our choosing to provide missions and other services locater agent maybe at the very least perhaps for a limited number of missions certainly for a limited time the price unless its going to include a cool down period is going to be very difficult to calculate and what would a gallente agent be doing in caldari space unless they were up to no good just a thoughtits a role play element only as far as im concerned and while i enjoy the thrill of sometimes believing im undocking with a few thousand souls its only for story related purposes or a marriagethank you thank you thank you
nice to see them finallyif youre going to continue to be a bell end about this at least get the facts straight the changes to the scanner came less than a week before the iceland summit too late to submit the issue to ccp officially we badgered them about it off the record though and it is afaik going to be raised in one of the online meetings
your interview has been published 
ashina is a great character who has shared a lot of her time and knowledge along with other members of the ccd team helping others myself included to gain the confidence and experience to explore the badlands of eve and of course blow ships up some great ideas put forward would be especially good to have someone nagging ccp about the the ui and fontashinas experience knowledge and dedication to the universe of eve would be of benefit to all types of player if shes voted onto the csmcount on my votegood luck sling

lol yes i am a woman in real  life at 54 years old it seems i also am the eldeest candidate this time around
such a pity carebears provide the goodies for pvpers and missioners to blow up or get blown up but each must vote for the candidate that addresses their particular concerns just make sure that you vote
let me be more specific limited highend roids my thoughts are along the line of a semirandom spawn within 1 one belt of a system spaced over a fairly lengthy period of time im thinking maybe 45 to 120 days between bonus spawns per system and perhaps to make them rarer but available make it 1 spawn per constellation obviously there are some technical issues to sort out but the idea is to provide miners with a fairly unexpected bonus a boost to the wallet but not something one could build a business onas for the moons id like to see the possibility of mining moons dry physics points to the existence of more but less productive patches of highend materials so a system could reasonably have several highend moons but with limited draw this would have the effect of forcing any moon miners solo or alliance to keep somewhat on the move layering is another possibility that is the highend materials tend to be heavier and thus would be deeper within the moon a layering concept would mean that one must remove a certain percentage of the lighter mostly lowend material before being able to access and mine the highendthese are just some ideas that i have what i am looking for in this thread is your ideas
take care has raised this issue repeatedly after it was originally raised by inanna zuninumber 1number 2number 3ccps reply is basically yeah we still want to do this but it has no priority i personally find the sov restriction silly as well especially because ccp originally agreed to implement this under condition of the alliance corps all meeting a high standing requirementso vote for z0d this round as we have fw and roleplaying on the agenda
dear mister starforged your concerns are valid the outcome of factional warfare events does impact the backstory of eve and this backstory is of great value to roleplayers for this reason it is not logical that the major roleplaying alliances are excluded from affecting the storyline directioni agree with miss ankhesentapemkah that ruling out alliance participation in factional warfare based on the criterium of holding space is not an acceptable one the standing requirement is a much more realistic marker as only the most loyal roleplaying alliances can expect to meet these requirements or motivate all their members to raise corp standings to the required levels you have my assurance that i will continue the work of our previous take care representatives and raise this issue until ccp implements it properlythank you for voicing your concernsz0d
that is just so crazy  i suppose that way they hope to exclude the largest alliances as has been said before the standings requirement would be a far better way to ensure that random big players do not stomp all over fwbtw even long before we moved into our new home one corp in uk had one sov claiming pos in k0cn3 should that really in itself have prevented us taking part in faction warfare
that accurately described everything ccp did regarding fw whoever does the game design on it is just incompetent and detatched from what the players want and do
i am not involved in faction warfare or roleplay but i have a great respect for cva and uk as enemies and friends respectivelyi have heard suggestions and comments about the situation from several cva members already if you would be willing to help me formulate a proposal i will gladly push it sok
at the risk of losing potential voters i dont agree that rp alliances should have any special treatment in this matter you choose to rp and i respect that but it shouldnt give you special powers over and above any other alliance i could just as easily complain that as i want to rp a minmatar resistance fighter i should be allowed to sneak into a cva outpost set explosives and blow it up yes extreme example but the principle is the sameso setting aside rp the argument simply boils down to should alliances be able to hold space and still participate in factional warfare the current csm and ccp think not ive yet to see a convincing argument for letting space holding alliances have their cake and eat it regarding fw and why wouldnt they want their cake its so delicious and moist  there may well be a good reason to let them but simply pointing at rp isnt itit would be so easy to go hunting for easy votes and say i would support this but i would rather people saw how i approach these kinds of issues so the short answer is i do not support your agenda in this form i would however be happy to take other rp issues to the csm if voted in and am always willing to support a well reasoned argument
proposed changes need to be examined closely you sound like an idiot
you sound just like the opposition actually your ideas on to which to base a political party sound decent you should start one thats the great thing about politics it allows for different viewpoints but its obvious to me that you have your own agenda which seems to be to smear ours  making it sound like we are some sort of wild internet cult leaders bent on taking over the game with our crazy conspiracy theories by riling people up its absolutely absurd the fact that you are so strongly opposed to the partys formation tells me that we are doing something rightthe criminal segment of the population of eve is underrepresented in the csm and if you cant see that then you are truly blind its time to change that but i wouldnt expect you to be looking out for the little guy knowing that you are a member of a large 00 organization
the competition is getting nervous
youre half right without a crystal ball it is difficult to determine every effect a change will have on the game with 100 accuracyfortunately most humans have brains which are functional enough to look at a proposed change and start thinking creatively about it those experienced enough with the game its mechanics and its history will be able to figure out some of the effects a change might have on the game some of the people in md are doing that all the time and making a fortune at it because they can extrapolate as an example a clumsy one but youll get the idea they decide to up the bonus on a certain type of rig by 2 doesnt seem like much but what if it made it suddenly more effective than a nonrig module that affected the same parameter because of stacking penalties we might suddenly see a sharp rise in the demand of that rig because people will want to use the rig instead of the module of course that means the demand for the module will fall just as sharply so demand changes price changes for both the rig and module but now lets say the rig was made with a type of salvage that previously had very little demand suddenly the salvage has more demand and the prices go up suddenly you start seeing more ninja salvagers in missions because salvaging is getting more lucrativeas i said a very clumsy example but thats mostly because i havent been playing the game for very long the point is you dont need to be clairvoyant to see where a change might take the gamethe freedom this game allows is the one thing that sets it apart from so many other mmos on the market its the reason i got into the game in the first place as im sure is the case for many of its players the spp as an organization can raise more legitimate and persuasive arguments against restricting freedom than can scattered forum posters and logit as a member of the csm can voice those arguments directly to ccp
you made our argument there are wholesale changes in 00 and you are there to represent your constituency you have good representationlet us have ours that is hisec criminals looters suicide gankers scammers pirates etcsimple
is the vote matching going to be enabled before the 12thi think anyone that hasnt taken the time to do it by now isnt going to
csm canditates who are too arrogant to fill their answers should be banned
the removal of the old effect has to be one of my biggest pet peeves the old effect used to say duck  there is some nasty sht landing on your head the new effect is more of a hey vern  did you see something   darth for csm
making salvaging viable is the main point i believe anything is viable when properly implementedbump
being part of a group in eve for most people is about more than just getting out of an npc corpmost people have a hell of a lot of friends both in game and out of game in the corp and alliance they fly with being in a corp for most people although 999 of people wont admit it is about being with friends and having a laugh in game corporations and branding are everything in eve without them eve would be a dull and boring placeim not asking to be able to paint ships ala homeworld i dont want to see 5000 pink goonswarm thoraxes ramming the undock point of jita 44 you know itd happen what im asking for is the simple option for the ceo of an alliances executor corporation to click a check box that controls the ability to have the alliances logo displayed on every members hull while itll be a lot harder to implement it on a corporation level given the huge variation available in logos the alliance logos never change once theyre patched into the game and for a billion isk to form one an alliance should at least have this benefitim aware that there are more pressing issues that people want taken care of with the game and thats fine this is something minor that would simply improve immersion and gameplay a little for a lot of people its also at least partially implemented and has been experimented with in the past given theres been trinity graphical demos with red alliance logos painted on shipsccp have been considering it and talking about it for a long time and with dust 514 on the horizon even the war barges in the dust 514 trailers are painted with the ishukone logo alliance branding and recognition is going to be even more importantif ccp can do stuff like this and let alliances claim space with their colours then its high time that members of alliances whore proud to fly their colours were allowed to do so

sorta like world in conflict  i loved how my awesome commie choppers were displaying the red army mightsupport for great measure fw corps should get faction logoplease visit your user settings to reenable images
definately yes i always wanted to see this happen
currently the items container in station hangars provides sorting functionality for item name item type or item quantity i would like to suggest the addition of a sort by meta level functionseperating the treasure from the trash when looking at a hangar stuffed full of modules can be time consuming at best as it stands if one does not have a fairly complete knowledge of the module list and associated meta levels the only other viable option is to show info on each module individually adding the ability to sort items by meta level would allow identifying the higher level modules to become a much more streamlined taskprior to posting this proposal i have posed the option to many eve players in various channels ingame and so far the suggestion has been met with a resounding yes
yes please that would be great
i agree it is a time consuming task and would also like to vote yes it it counts would be a great addition to domination right hey bigger and better
and put a color coded 0 1 2 3 4 or 5 in the item icon lower corner opposite the the tech ii corner badge add a meta column for the nonicon view i know that would be kind of a hand holding feature but it would help speed things up a lot when looting without having to fill your brain or desk with the metalevel names of so many things

ill agree that the ui could use some improvements but a complete overhaul is taking it a bit far the complexity of the eve user interface is directly related to the games underlying complexity frankly if you are playing spreadsheets online that is simply your own fault nearly all of the ui is already customizable to a degreeit is easy to make broad criticisms without proposing concrete alternatives the right click menus being a prime example

v check here if you want to give your support to the ideadiscussion going on
i propose to have 3 additional check boxes in the drone settings pain for small medium and large ship types when checked the drones can automaticly target ships of this type when unchecked the drones wil not target said type of ship until told to this is to keep your medium and large drones from attacking the friggates and acidently triggering the next few spawns when your busy focusing on say the 5 battleships already attacking you
i second this idea it would help out tons being able to choose what type of ship your drones focus on
because i need another annoying keyhanger thingamabob amiriteheres an idea create an account security tutorial page outlining the creation of proper passwords stressing the use of decent antivirus browser and network security software advocate against people just blindly clicking yes to whatever popup appears on their screenand then dont do squat for people who get their account hacked because they had a trojan on their pc likely obtained on a shady pirated software ographic or isk selling websitehonestly 90 of all these account security issues must be caused by user error dont try to put a costly annoying physical solution on the bleeding wound that is the general lack of user intellectnot supported
in addition to failing at real security since that only reduces the odds of someone having their pc compromised and account info stolen its also failing at practical considerations many pc users are simply only semicomputer literate you base your business model on the users you haveuser should be more knowledgeable is a idiotic way to run a business which has consistently lost to user friendly systems just about every time so farthat said 90 account security issues must be caused by user error means your security is not worth fortunately eve is only a game with virtual assets so well if you do everything right you maybe wont have your security compromised but you might isnt that tragic of a approach since you wont lose real assets still is horribly badbut given people are asking for a optional thingy you can still retain your luckbased security and give people who want something stronger a option how is that bad
i believe that having an optional authenticator in addition to the account name and password is a good idea granted there are other things that can be done to increase account security but i dont see a reason not to have an optional authenticator be an additional hurdle against having ones account compromised and i suppose i should read the whole thread before posting in something that was recently bumped someone said the csm already discussed it and linked the minutes
well i do agree with this proposal except that i think that it will be to difficult to implement by december instead i would suggest just dropping concord from all systems with a 9 or lower security rating excluding jita of course that will give high sec players that arent brand new to the game plenty of fun brand new players of course will start in 10 systems so they will still be safe for a little while
sure why not still not going to get officers or any spawn above 650k in empire no matter how upgraded a flat increase in volume doesnt seem like too bad a thing possibly make it lowseconly
maybe you should look what the upgrade do before crying at level 5 the system get 10 insta respawning top tier anomaliesthat mean 2530 millions in bounties with bs worth 12 millions a chance of a faction spwan and of a escalationplenty of people would like that
i want equality for all
equality for all
missions are interesting
i like this idea but id need to see some hard numbers before being sold on this i had hoped this was based on the qen but looking through it i saw nothing related to reprocessing lootperhaps if coupled with a lowends buff this would be good until then hasty changes are bad mmkhave to keep in mind this nerfs compression which is needed to get the quantities of mins needed for supercap production and the like in 00 because mining lowends by itself is very unprofitableslow progress if a superdense version of veldother lowends 200 yield or something would spawn in 00 id fully support this
i agrea in principle but i think this would be the wrong way to go about iti would like to modify your proposali think it would be best if it was possible to have corp tax on refining and reprocessingthe stationoutpost owner gets his tax ofc sometimes nothing with good standing in npc stations but the corporation should have the option of taking taxes from refiningreprocessingthis would mean that a pilot for a npc corp in empire would maybe get away with paying tax to the station owner due to standing but he would still haveto pay the 11 corp tax 
ccp did release numbers like 3 months back or so iirc they broke it down for each mineral type and mining reprocessing and drone loot and reprocessing accounted for 4060 of the minerals of course it didnt differentiate between mission loot reprocessing and compression but i cant imagine compression counts for much compared to the tens of thousands of people in motsu everydaythe fact that a significant portion of minerals come from kill missionsratting and not from mining is a huge issue and pretty much a deal breaker for dedicated miners i can only imagine a mining fix is in the works but dont hold your breathnot supporting any quick fix as mining in its entirety needs a revamp
how to make nullsec more attractive for industrial characters5 fixed concord tax on npc corp refineriesso starting player has 5 from npc corp 5 concord bunch of wastage fix that up by improving standings with that npc corp training up the refining skills still stuck with 5 concord tax in all npc corp refineriesso head out to lownull sec or set up your own posthen have the sov industrial upgrades allow pos refineries with appropriate skills to reprocess at 100 efficiency in a few secondsthen reduce hisec ores to veldspar and scordite only no kernite or omber reduce the ore quality to only the 100 veldspar scordite all veldspar in lowsec is the 105 variant all veldspar in nullsec is the 110 variantfinally scale the scc sales tax according to the security status of the system in which the sale is made 05 sec will attract the current rate 10 sec will attract double the tax rateso ore becomes more valuable refineries become more useful in nullsec each stage of the industrial process should have some extra cost in empire that is not present in a sovereigntyclaimed nullsec system poorer ores in hisec lower efficiency in the overworked empirebased refineries manufacturing lines that cost far more to operate due to highly organised unions pushing for higher wages and increased sales tax in highersecurity systemsin the meantime allow the industrial upgrades to improve the exhumer class ships so that they tank like battlecruisers not cruisers a hulk or mack in nullsec should be able to tank a t2officer fit stealth bomber at the very least if not a gankfit cnr there should be some allowance for response time when a stealth bomber sneaks through a gatecamp and starts attacking industrialists  the ship should be able to have a chance of lasting long enough to pay for itselfempire should be safe but boring nullsec should be a world of opportunity
a 10 or 15 decrease in some 00 production requirements wouldnt make a scrap of difference to miners income it would only increase the number of ships produced actually scratch that in fact it would probably increase mining income mineral prices are tied to ship insurance prices not mineral demand if it takes n minerals of average unit value m to create a ship with net platinum insurance value x then decreasing n by reduction y will necessarily increase m such that the new mineral value m will be mm1yergo the proposal is a boost to minersedit and if the miners are producing more then their income will increase again due to price support from insuranceedit2 still waiting for your reply to this venkul
bump for round 3 and round 2 podcast
well in regards to the earlier posts i do take my candidacy seriously and i do monitor this thread it is however unfortunate that you only run these debates at 2100 hours which equates to 4 pm eastern standard time and 1 pm pacific standard which is right in the middle of a work day for pretty much every north american playerif there was a debarte to cater to this time zone i would be more then willing to participatein the mean time people can see my platform at the following site darth for csmthanks
darth i can see how this poses a problem timezone differences are usually a pita the local time of the show is 2300 to 0200 so its kind of tough to push it further
im pretty sure this happens to alot of people running missions with a particuler faction where you ae running missions either for cash or standings you will eventualy get an offer from a storyline agent for a simple mission or mission series for a large increase in standings with that agents corp and the corps designated faction this in itself is fine but i find it really irritating when one is grinding for corp standings to then get a storyline for a compleatly differnt corporation and particuly when the corp you get offerd the mission from is that of a corp you never run missions for and probably never will then it basicaly turns into just running the mission for the cashitem reward and the faction standings im sure some people will welcome standings with another corp and sometimes it is helpfull but after a while it turns out you get higher standings with a corp you never did a single normal mission with over the corp you have been gridning away with the past few weeksmonths or soi propose a simple fix for this to change the system from the nearest storyline agent to the nearest storyline agent of the same corp you did the last mission for
this would require a lot more storyline agents as it is now you would often have to travel quite some jumps or even get to lowsec to haul ore or that 40k mUFFFD boxesthough i see your point grinding standing for a specific corpi think it is better as it is right now take the standing for the other corp as a bonus or look for an agent with samecorpstoryliner right next to it

well here are a couple of issues that have probably come up many times but it isnt fixed so it needs another round1please make meta 5 t2 items better than meta 4 items its as simple as that this applys to everything from modules to ammometa 4 modules often have same benefits as t2 but lower cpugridskill requirements and are therefore better than t2dont change the cpugridskill requirements just give t2 a slight boosthere are a few suggestions web ii 11km range instead of 10km give mwd ii 550 speed bonus instead of 500 like meta 1  3 boost dps andor reduce penaltys on t2 ammosome items like reactor control unit dont need any change but in general all t2 should be better than meta4 after all its harder to fit them on any ship and it requires spthis would further incent t2 building and boost the t2 market some modules are not worth manufacturing atmmeta 24 is npc loot meta 1 and 5 is or should be built by players2well i would personally like to see no more t1 loot dropped from npc wrecks or at the very least a reduction most of it gets refined anyway this would be an incentive and boost the mining profession allso the sparsly populated drone regions most importantly this would give the t1 market back to the industrial players instead of the npc rattersmissioners
with your first topic i agree with some of what you wrote the reason the highmetas were equal to t2 was because t2 could be massproduced from the bpo lottery while highmetas were dropped with increasing rarity from npcsmission reprocessing is more profitable than mining so the fact that far more people run missions messes this equation up some changes are needed but really t2 costs a lot less than t1m4 gear usuallywith your second topic i agree to an extent but first mining would have to be made more active and less afkable this is an area that has hurt a lot of people miners t1 manufacturers etc but major changes are needed before it can be a reality these changes are along the lines of a whole expansion and we will have to wait for that to arrive ccp has said theyre in the works of revising the mission system so well have to wait and see
make rats only drop named loot and not normal t1 and of course tags and that kind if stuff increase amount of salvage a bit to compensate for lost loot increase t2 stats where neededi support the idea
lets just cut to the chase and reform rat loot altogether remove module drops totally replace them with named bpcs produced from salvaging along with the normal salvage materials
id like to answer bunyip on his commentisnt it possible that the price of the t2 module is lower bechause it is worse quality you dont specify any specific modulestake ecm modules for example best named meta4 are better than t2meta5 lower fitting cost cpugrid and less cap usage but it still has same stats maybe give t2 ecm 5 bonus to range and strengthi dont see why anyone should fit the t2 ecm modules to the falconrook why use t2 and nerf your setupecm spatial destabilizer ii costs 580k in jitabz5 neutralizing spatial destabilizer ecm costs 175m in jitathis is due to the fact that the meta 4 item is better than the meta 5reactor control unit ii costs 538k in jitabeta reactor control reaction control i costs 348k in jitain this case the t2 item is better and guess what the market price is higherthere are a lot of examples out there about meta 4 being better than meta 5 some exeptions exist on meta 24 that are very expensive due to rarity andor the fact that not everyone has skills to use t2and in closing i would like to say that if t2 was always better than best named then im pretty shure that prices on best named would drop and prices on t2 would rise this would put more pressure on the producers and maybe this might improve the profit margin on industial production and maybe even get more people to do it lots of pilots have skills to build but consider it not worth the effort to do itwell tbh if t2 isnt as good as meta 4 why train to use it
so i was thinking since minmatar ships have this reputation of being a pile of junk why not make them a ship that actually looks like that a ship that looks like its been put together in a scrap yard an i know i know what you think they already look like that which is true but theres nothing on them thats actually recognizable like i want to see the rear end of a harbringer as a bs engine or half of an executioner as part of some cruiserbut it doesnt have to be minmatar it could be for one of the pirate factions or maybe the sleepers coming out into kspace and incorporating our technology into their ships something like that
no i wouldnt goto wormspace with a t3 cruiser i go in my arazu which has never been stuck anywhere
so where does the candiates stand on this issuefor or against
whati cant see no nerf hereand tbh the new super carriers scares the  out of me and my future capital ships
is it on tranquitility yesnoif you answered yes ok this thread is legitif you answered no wait till it comes to that server quit freaking out
there is little point in raising an issue to the csm about changes not yet on the tq
so with the revamp of system scanner and probes the space looks way better than before with this high definition revamp however someone might have noticed that we now lack colors in the big picture that is explorationyep colorscurrently 5 types of cosmic signatures are being spawned magnetometric ladar radar gravimetric and unknown  why do we call it unknown anyway call it some other way d  after the dust for the probe revolution has settled and we begin to lose the entusihasm we had before we might just think of tweaking the scanning results a lil bitproposalmake each signature dot show its color instead of the redyellowgreen semaphor blue for gravimetric aquamarine for gallente orange for ladar yellow for amarr grey for interferences  i dont want to call em unknown forever  brightness should reflect the signal strenght draker lower brighter higher and you should just keep the red dot as a i dont really know what that may be  this means unknonweventually just mix the site signals no need for new types when you can have gravimetricradar they would only show as multifrequency until 75 heh
i suspect the game servers would not appreciate the added load of 20k video streamsi would however support player designed advertisements for the current billboardsedit the main problem is that it would have to stream the video to everyone near a billboard even afks this is simply wasted resources perhaps this would be more practical if the videos only played upon request
idk youtube seems to handle it pretty well you have to admit the current billboards are just a sentry with boring pictures
aside from the fact that video on ingame billboards is a useless idea it wouldnt add any load at all to the eve cluster it would link to an external server that would host the video and the only additional load would be on the clients oh and the enormous amount of load that would be on the streaming servers as they streamed to the 50000 people that are online during an alliance tournament broadcastanyways very bad idea that will cause extreme amounts of lag extra resources used by the client whether or not you have streaming turned on and the possibility of some jackass namely me sitting in front of the billboard to  people off eve tv broadcasts have enough problems as it is only streaming to people who are explicitly choosing to watch it in their browsersdefinitely not supported but talk more about corporation ads and whatnot because those would be neat if billboards were a little bigger and less impossible to read
kay so kick down the tv idea but i still want massive billboards with some kind of motion on them stations and gates are so damn boring i mean cities in our times have big tvs and advertisements with moving pictures why cant this incredibly advanced space game
yes i would also vote for ppl who cant separate rl from gamelife who track down eve players irl and make threats over the phone for which they get aftewards missdemeanor chargesi agree with the issues he raises but i strongly dissagree with the person

i wouldnt have responded to this normally but the prospect of getting the page two snipe in this particular thread was too great to pass upinstead of answering the allegations made against you you have jumped ship from your corporation in order to distance yourself from their reputation which i might add is largely a result of your doing in an effort to gain a modicum of legitimacy you have joined a rather respected organization whose aims and ambitions are completely different to those you were trying to woo with your campaign originallythe delinquant teenager inside me would like to see you elected just to see what sort of buffoonery you cause however for the physical well being of all involved in the csm process both delegates and ccp staff i do hope you are notthankyou and goodnight
1 vote as long as you will yell at ccp for the dominion fiasco that we are dealing with
why do you feel that l4 missions should remain a highsec commodity when we all know that exodus which was supposed to make all players move to 00 introduced them and caused the reverse effect ie more people than ever stayed in highsec and now even with dominion and a chance for ccp to change their stance by decreasing lp or isk rewards with each high secmission they still wont do itso in short  do you really feel pvers should really have a natural benefit in highsecwhy with the new system in place wouldnt they actually do more good in 00other then that much  for any a and most notable excurrent tri members running for csm which r a isp 
dear sokrateszcan you publish small press release related to rumors that you was involved in scam
i have noticed that some of the other candidates have voiced quite strong opinions about the level 4 question in the csm matchmaker my current stand remains mildly against moving level 4 mission to lowsec because i dont think it would solve much the people who use missions to make isk to finance their pvp losses may already do so in the more lucrative places 00 empire because the iskhr difference is quite large and the majority who runs the missions for enjoyment to finance more expensive pve tools or business sell isk will simply not go into lowsec and find other means of making good isk in highsecin short i dont believe it would change much in presentday eve i would be in favour of making 00 and lowsec more attractive to these players but that would have to be done in a more subtle way or go accompanied with suitable changes f ex to prevent them all getting ganked on the ingate to lowsec or 00perhaps with dominion this will change  i will have to review my stance on this one and indeed on many items once the effects of dominion have been fully feltand thanks my heart still lies with tri 3 ask all your exnano buddies to vote for me dfirst let me draw a very fat line between ingame activities that are allowed and in fact endorsed by ccp like piracy and scamming and the combination of metagaming and illegal ingame acitivies that larkonis was doingsecond yes i made some isk there in a way that not everyone might approve of but those players both apparantly unfamiliar with game mechanics were there every step of the way and they fell for it with eyes wide open i merely equalised their balance between isk and sense and there are countless people friends corp and alliancemates that can testify that i am not an inherently evil person or have a tendency to betray my fellows i have been with my current corp for over two years now and i am proud to say that i see no reason why i would ever have to leave it you can find more information in a thread made by one of the victims here this thread incidentally will also provide proof of his cluelessness let me also stress that this was the first and in my book last time that i engaged in such activities but i believe it is part of the game and will oppose any suggestions that would make scamming illegal or impossible see csm matchmakerthus i have no intention to follow in larkonis footsteps and the suggestion itself sounds appalling
1 bump for a friend
go sok go
you have my vote
bump for the dude im voting for
herschel is a great guy with a lot of knowledge about and passion for the game i am sure he will help a lot to improve eve if he is elected i just voted for himgood luck herschel
the fact that three previous csms including an exchair and exvicechairsecretary think voting for hersch is a good idea should be a good indication of what his perceived value to the csm is
i voted for hershel because i believe he is the right man for the job ive seen him very active in both csm channel and on the forums discussing the issues arisen by players and taking into account both sides of the argument he does not just point out whats wrong and goes around screaming about it like others instead he tries to find a solution that would be the most suitable and i found myself in agreement with nearly everything he has said so i gave my vote to this candidate
ankhesentapemkahs in game mail worked voted with my 2 accountscheersak
how do you prioritise your policiesi for one am interested in your ideas in trade can you expand upon them i want to know what issues are most important to you and where trade ranks in them
do you like volume 911 of berserk 
my personal priority lies with industry and the market and i think these aspects have been neglected by ccp however they agreed with the previous csm that they will have a slot for related issues reserved in each expansion and ill definately make use of that fix what is broken and critical make some existing features more practical fix the cosmetic side user interface and add new featuresfor corporation specialising in trade where 2 and more dedicated players can for example sell corporate goods a new role could be added corporation order manager which could be attached to corporate wallet divisions for security purposesmultiple traders could then especially when playing from different timezones run and manage corporate sales as a team as opposed to the current system where the person who initiated a current corporate sale be the only one who can modify itat the moment also there is practically only the 001 isk undercut system to sell items on the open markets a system promoting more personalised sales could allow a player to make public sales as himself or his corp adding in this case on a player  corp info page new tabs for public contracts sales and shares that directly relate to those initiating themthis would promote more teamwork between players as opposed to current models where a trader has to work alone and manage his own sales even if he is doing corporate sell orderson the shares front to be able to put them on the market as the current real life market functions create public share sell  buy orders would put a lot of life into the corporate share systems trading is definitively a core part of eve at all levels players need to buy assets they use sell items they create and the ones they find they can use the income to buy  sell items or services that they need and progress in the game in any way they choose to
you failed to adress my question as one of the many token candidates backed by the boob vote i demand to know why you chose that name
i have not personally read the manga books to answer your question as to where the z0d name came from i am a fan of the tv serie smallville and a couple seasons back i was preparing to create a new character and chose the name z0d derived from a character i liked in the serieand hence z0d was born into eve
i can honestly say that z0d has my full support if have been convinced by my work on the csm during the last term vote for z0d now he is a perfect candidate to support our cause and negotiate with ccpread more about take care on our website wwwevetakecarenet
zod has my vote 
i met z0d in august 2008 at zimse i was thinking about to leave eve because the guys from our corps was seperated after some disasters at zu 00 sec and with our allicance bos and nobody knows where to go so i was shortly before to have no interest to play any longerbefore i met z0d i was nothing and do not have a plan he met me catched me  brought me to amarr empire and since them  i live here he trained me well and gave me so much suggestions as no player done this before he introduced to me the items what are needed to grow up he adviced me how to use evemon and other helpful thingswe flown several missions and trainings meanwhile after nearby two years in eve i never believed that i will play a online game it is a pleasure to know him im absolutely sure that he will take care as a csm to all players of eve he has a huge knowledge and a analytical mind to understand the processes of eve and also he never forget that behind all of this avatars are humans he is a great diplomat during wars and takes care of our corp and the alliance so to vote for z0d as a csm means to have a great supporter and he will be a positive contribution as a doorkeeper between all players and ccpvote for him and you never will be dissapointedregards andreas germany aka austin golightly
woo thread revival maybefirst of all i would like to think that i am rather unbias in all of this mainly because i dont care so much to be honest eve is a game no reason to get all worked up over it  anywayi have noticed many of you keep saying that damar is bias and is running just so he can have his way or whateverhave any of you realized that by not voting for him you are bias as well you are looking at him being in caldari militia and you automatically assume he will not help the minmatar or gallente either i dont know too much about his actions in local but once again it is a game i troll local from time to time just for lols but it is not who i amdamar is talking about a broken system that needs fixing not just on the caldari side but all sidesi think some serious looking into fw is in order because it is a nice idea but is so broken also bad messenger is very right in the fact that plexing does need more incentives because that is the idea of fw you are fighting for your chosen race you want to destroy the other side and take their space so far caldari and namely pervs as i understand have been accomplishing thatdamar has my unbias support if he was a part of the minmatar faction and told me he would want to fix a broken system i would be for him also i will be spreading his name around edit i will admit that this thread has not shown damar in the best light but i have heard good things about him i have cast my vote for him 
his answers to dierdras questionnaire say it all almost everything filled out as i dont care except him wanting to keep bombs and bubbles out of lowsec which are the most important issues in the game for himpersonal agenda ftw he doesnt give a  about the aspects of eve that everyone else plays
can you link this questionnaire for the benefit of us all
yeah but we arent running for csm saying we will represent all of fw
another vote for alexhes a merc hes honest he listens to other points of view he has a clear understanding of the game he wants to help improve the game not just for mercs but for all eve playershe now owes me some isk 
with over a year and a half behind the wheel of noir ive established a lasting and very public reputation for integrity and exacting standards you can call me a pvp candidate yet i have no ties to partisan 00 power blocs grief tactics or piratesso this mean we dont have to hear how cool your profession choice is and how we are all doing it wrong i think that competition is healthy and i would advocate the removal of barriers to competition like npc sell orders suicide gank insurance and other price ceilingslove itstrong desire to see small gang pvp become increasingly relevant and fun promote diversity and balance among shiptypesif your single and lookingjokes aside gotta say no matter what your profession or role in eve is alek is a strong candidate that will most likely have at least some of the same views and hopes for eve that you do flmc supported 12 votes gl

hey teadazewhat do you think about some proposals to increase bounty on 00 rats to balance out risk reward in 00 vs empire
i would support a proposal to look into this but without any specific thread here are my current thoughts on itfor sov holders increased bounties could be linked to the pirate magnets i propose we call them pieces of eight  so rats are not only related to truesec it would also be interesting if they would escalate in some way increased bounties and difficulty so that they retaliate with greater force or give the whole system a temporary improvement of truesec based on killing x number of rats per hour it might also encourage people to ninja rat in upgraded systems leading to more chances to pvpfor npc space some similar escalation ideas could work but they shouldnt be as high as for sov 00 we need to give some extra benefit to holding spaceif anyone has a better idea please put together a proposal in the assembly forum for us to look at
teadaze please consider filling out the questions of the csm vote matcher while i completely agree that such a questionnaire cannot represent everything that a candidate has to offer it covers at least some issues worth taking a stance for or against
i filled it in the day the eve mail with the logins was sent roundif im not showing for you then i guess i dont match well enough on those questions however feel free to ask here if there are any issues in particular you have and ill respond
duh found you now based on the answers that i feel different about here are some questions for you about nerfing of local do you propose it for everywhere or maybe just low sec  00 if you want to see it implemented everywhere i see a great imbalance in favor of attackersor the larger gangs its bad for solo low sec dwellers and it hurts the victims of empire griefing corps about nerfing of point income sources in 00 i think the question was badly formulated since i think rebalancing moons was necessary but on the other hand it killed the strategic assets alliances have been fighting over dont you think valuable moons where an essential driver of all 00 life up until now alliances needed to be pvp heavy to conquer space to hold moons to do more pvp with the changes 00 turns into carebear wonderland because you need to pve to pay for the space and get the upgrades and there are no strategic assets worth fighting for and space is more of a burden then anything else so pvp for alliances will be degraded to only fun gangs between ratting while the strategic fleet fights will become rare about 00 infrastructure being vulnerable to small gangs another badly formulated question as it could mean just that small gangs disrupting 00 infrastructure just to annoy an alliance or it could mean that small entities should be able to get a foothold in 00 the latter includes the former and in that case id support it but if its really just the former i dont really see a point shooting some stationary structures to annoy the alliance but with no real purpose and if youre just after pvp you dont need to bother about structures depending on how easy you make it for small gangs the pain for the space holding entity could be really big if any roaming gang could fubar their sov another aspect is that if the proposal was made reality dreadnoughts would have nearly no function so how do you see this could be balancedthere where quite a few points where you answered that you have no strong feelings about i guess thats just honesty so its okay
hi helenyou and sokratesz both scored around 65 so im not sure who to vote for  sowhy do you feel that l4 missions should remain a highsec commodity when we all know that exodus which was supposed to make all players move to 00 introduced them and caused the reverse effect ie more people than ever stayed in highsec and now even with dominion and a chance for ccp to change their stance by decreasing lp or isk rewards with each high secmission they still wont do itso in short  do you really feel pvers should really have a natural benefit in highsecwhy with the new system in place wouldnt they actually do more good in 00
two good questions ill deal with michaels first as it will be shorterlevel 4s and mission running is now firmly entrenched as an empire activity there are thousands of people running l4s who have no interest in moving to lowsec or 00 if l4s moved out of empire those players would in my opinion either stay in empire and chain l3s instead or simply quit ccp have acknowledged that l4s are somewhat out of whack with the rest of the design but that they are rightly unwilling to simply reset them i think its inevitable that a fix for l4s will come either as a buff to everything else or as a direct nerf however i dont think moving them out of hisec is the right fix at the momenthaving said all of that i do think that missions in 00 as well is a good idea and one that will fix some of the issues with dominion im hoping that ccps strategy here is to implement the system first then balance it certainly thats a sensible way to go forwards even if its frustrating for those of us who will be getting the short end of the stick in the meantimeregarding my suggestions for dominionfirstly the design should match the requirements which currently it doesnt the aim is to free up unused space by forcing large sovfootprints to contract rather than simply put a high linear cost on sov holding i would suggest that an exponential approach is better where sov holding costs quickly spiral out of reach of any but the most active alliances to prevent alliance simply setting up smaller splinter alliances as a way to spread these costs out have cost rise with proximity to other alliance holdingsin other words sov becomes more expensive the further away it is from your capital system but also the closer it is to systems under another alliances sov this will naturally create buffer zones of unclaimed space between sov markers which will encourage roaming warfare and also add a level of strategic decision making when claiming sov as it can be used offensively as well as defensivelya nonlinear cost allows a reasonable investment level for smaller corps looking to get their toes into 00 space while scaling properly to the level of a very large alliance fixed costs penalise small corps too much if they are in any way nontrivial for large allianceslogistics is also a way to reduce the effective size of an alliances holdings jbs are vital for managing very large areas of space by making them expensive or difficult to achieve then the amount of space that can realistically be held reduces also again this reigns in large alliances without unduly penalising smaller entities who are only trying to hold a single system or constellationof course reducing the footprint of an alliance is no good if the new holdings cannot sustain the pilot numbers of the old area the current system upgrades do not allow this mission agents would be an easy fix for this if ccp cant put them in outposts yet then put them in space or have roaming interactable npc vessels of a hostile type to the incumbent pirate faction flying around space offering missions to anyone who sees them give the mission journal interface a current location for this agent and suddenly you also have people moving around space more and providing more opportunities for small scale pvpin addition to this cosmic anomalies should be ubiquitous and worth doing the best way to handle large numbers of pilots in a small area is the way its already done  through generating content on demand missions are an example of this but cosmic anomalies can also be moved to this model perhaps the anomaly doesnt exist until i scan for it once i scan for it the anomaly is generated in the same way as asking for a mission generates that opportunity and by warping to it i accept the anomaly and it is spawned anomalies should of course be worth doing and range from reasonably valuable solo content to really valuable but very hard group content
hellobased on the csm vote matcher site it seems you are an interesting candidate sadly i could find little more information about your platform since the site you linked to is not open to the public requires registration and therefore agreement to the legal terms of another private company also i could find only 4 posts by you on this forum so unfortunately i cant learn much moreregards
if a fairly small number of eve players even bother voting does anyone really think that many will bother to go through 49 different web pages to fully understand the candidates platform i think theres a reason that in politics there are normally only a couple of candidatesbecause the differences between them are then much more apparent and consequently each candidate will more thoroughly be looked over im mostly interested in getting feedback here because im curious has anyone really gone down the entire list and read every single candidates platform
my concern is how fragmented the voting will become with so many people to choose from in effect it could be handing more seats to the bloc voting alliances voter apathy is pretty bad too just look at how few reads the candidate threads have been getting in here but it seems to go furtherthe original candidate announcement page had the raw text pasted to it and whilst i and others sent updated html formatted text to ccp it wasnt afaik uploaded some people didnt put any campaign message in when they applied but it didnt hurt their application at allnow the voting site is open but no official notification on the homepage in game or on the rss news feedsi know there are 2 weeks to vote but it is a shame that there has been no official announcement from ccp to raise the visibility of the voting process
he i guess that is why i ended up not having a website nor a long platform message just a short statementeither the people who know me form my six years in the game will be enough or it wont i dont think the information on the voting pages count for much in the endyou could probaly cut down on the candidate list by requiring that a certain number of people support you candidacy in the first place many real life election systems solves the problem that way
you are probably right but then again just a simple site and a little bit of campaigning might sway a few floating voters i decided not to take anything for grantedthat is an interesting idea the question is what number do you put for this 10 people 50 people 100 people i suspect it isnt difficult to get that level of support and so it might not make much difference to the number of candidates for the extra complexity involved
dierdra vaal created a vote match just fill out the questionnaire and you get the csm candidates matching your views just read up on them so you dont have to go through all of the others and votei personally only look at these forums i didnt read the whole list of candidates on the eve website as anyone that doesnt have a thread here is just slacking and doesnt deserve a vote
i agree the vote match is a useful tool but it doesnt give the whole story so i hope people do still read some of the campaign sitesi agree however if you look at the number of reads per candidate thread it is pretty poor some threads have been up for a month with only a few thousand views in that time and that isnt unique viewersmany of us have put the effort in to campaign outside of the forums via si radio campaign sites in game events etc but we wont see if that has increased the overall number of voters until the 2nd of december
got my vote
overwhelmed by all the candidates cant decide who to vote for despair notvote matchwhatthe vote match website presents the user with a list of statements pvp should be optional trade orders should have a 1000 isk minimum increment etc and compares the answers the user gives to the answers given by csm candidates using this comparison the website then calculates a match percentage neatly identifying and displaying which candidate represents the users views the besthowgo to the website and click on the vote match link fill in the 30 questions and well take care of the rest
some statsresponseout of the 49 candidates 38 have filled in the questions 2 confirmed with me that they felt they were not properly represented in the questionaire the other 9 have not replied to mailings or convo requests i was aiming to cover at least 75 of the candidates and i made that mark hopefully next election with an evemail system that doesnt suck ill be able to get 95 questionsthe answer index ai is the average answer on a question as all answers range from 2 to 2 a perfectly balanced question has an ai of 00 questions where the ai is greater than 1 or smaller than 1 are questions ill look into removing or changing as they do not get as many different answers as i would like  only 4 questions are candidates for removal based on the current answers  1 question was perfectly balanced and resulted in an ai of 00question importance qi is also an interesting stat as candidates can mark 3 questions as being important to them a question that no candidate finds important is one i will review for removal or change  only 1 question was not important to anyone the question that was marked important most often was marked important 9 times

much praise to you and your team for putting this useful giz together  run next time and ill vote for youseriously i feel that the csms are every bit as obscure and remote as ccp because the thought of wading through these forums to identify and relate to issues im concerned about give me a headache and noone wants to deal with the consequences of thati must be out on a thin political wing anyway because the highest match ive got was 70 and all the candidates between 60  70 match bar one have not provided a link to any sort of manifesto for me to scrutinise which bums me out somewhatcome on wannabie csm types this is questionnaire is a decent polling tool use itbleenin amateurs tutsigh chris k aka quandary247  playing the sisters tem

signed ccp i urge you not to go through with this change there will be no point in owning a supercarrier with these changes i may aswell just go buy a carrier much cheaper with same dps
for a new role to be designed to be a capital killer this seems incredibly shortsighted and ill thought out nerfing the ships will only result in the same tactics of old wo the realm of other aspects of pvp i can see a whole gang of motherships in the future being nearly unstoppable but what can you expect from a user base with an above average iqwe will adapt of course but in a compromise if they refuse to give us 3 fightersperhaps 2 would be acceptable to be on par with a common carrier is somewhat insultingsam

hi thanks for introducing yourself  you matched highest in the vote match questionnaire and merit my provisional supportmy hot topics of interest are1 making the client a level playingfield  use of external comms and utils degrade the experience and provides advantage why am i forced to use apps beyond the client im paying for2 clear communication  i think youve got this covered under documentation but i want to see clear representation of who stands for what in this morass of of conflicting viewpoints and agendas at csm and ccp give us the tools to see what is really going on the forums are not good enough3 bounties flawed system game design makes it next to impossible for me to play the lone bounty hunter while hundreds of popular pirate gangs clamour for more love from csms  game mechs does anyone else see the disparity there4 storyline i cant see the link between storyline missions and events in eve does it exist it should in my opinion every patch release and upgrade should be linked to the storyline trouble with the game balance could very well be solved with the introduction of new modules or tech rather than the blunt instrument that is the nerf bat it would also provide the march of technology just as in the real world and a structure to hang chronicles upon thats enough of my high horses hobby horses and nightmares for now i would very much like to hear your opinionschris k  playing the sisters tem
got my vote
igonoring the fact that faction warfare is as meaningless as red vs blue without the rpbackstory aspect and i know rvb is great fun  i dont think the rp players are asking for favoursif uk were able to form one huge corp which met the standings requirement and called it ushrakhan wed be able to join fw now so why should a large allianc rp or not be prevented from joining fw if the alliance as a whole meets the standings requierments
because a corp cant hold sov so that avoids the issuethe op specifically stated find a way to allow at the very minimum the major rp alliances to participate in fw ccp and the csm supported the idea with the restriction that no sov could be held while in fwi dont have a problem with the idea of an alliance with the right standings being able to join fw under those conditionshowever there hasnt yet been a convincing argument for allowing a single alliance to take part in sov 00 and fw  the only proposal made so far is it would suit rp allianceshopefully you can understand the issue here an alliance with 00 sov has access to more resources than a pure fw corpalliance and at the same time doesnt give anything back to fw in exchange maybe it could be allowed if a sov holding fw alliance automatically sets the rest of their militia to 10 and thus gives them full access to their space and outposts that way both the alliance and the militia gain benefitsjust a thought
my question would be why is holding sov an issuethus specifically excluding the two oldest alliances in this game what kind of argument is needed beyond some of us would like to  it is a question of counter arguments surelyi really do not understand what you are saying here an alliance which joins fw would be just as much part of the militia what it gives back would be the resources it can invest in fw
personally i find the idea of an alliance wanting the benefits of holding space out out in 00 as well as to participate and get the benefit of factional warfare to be rather greedy and also in many ways counterproductive what is the point of holding space if you actually want to go and do factional warfare instead csm 3 and ccp took a similar positionmaybe im missing the point but youve not given a good reason why you should be able to have both abilities it isnt specifically targetted at you it appears the aim is to exclude any alliance from fw that wants to hold sov insteadthat isnt how it works you want to make a change to the game thus it is you who need to make a convincing argument why come up with a good one and ill support you fullythe original request was to allow alliances into fw and csm 3 agreed with ccp it could be allowed as long as the alliance wasnt holding sov as well it isnt hard the alliance would gain access to all the benefits of fw easy pew pew missions lp store etc except that unlike the rest of the militia it also has access to 00 sov benefits as welli was suggesting a quid pro quo for an alliance wanting to have sov and join fw is that it would have to share its space with the militia it has joinedgive us a better suggestion instead
the fw is balance of power is very fragile particularly on the amarrmatari front with a grudge match being carried out between plexers and pvpers alikebig fleets happen but are the exceptions rather than the rulean large influx of people from an alliance on either side or both would reduce it to mainly gate camps and other such wet blankets making it less than it is add to it the possibility of fw space being used by alliances to duke it out without jeopardizing their assets ie space and you have the reason for the no sov ideai have yet to see any idea that would keep fws integrity intact while allowing major organized entities like alliances into the theatre has to be done with immense care if it is to remain a primarily smallscale conflictyou flew the bleak skies mr starforged so you should know this
yes i would also vote for ppl who cant separate rl from gamelife who track down eve players irl and make threats over the phone for which they get aftewards missdemeanor chargesi agree with the issues he raises but i strongly dissagree with the person

i wouldnt have responded to this normally but the prospect of getting the page two snipe in this particular thread was too great to pass upinstead of answering the allegations made against you you have jumped ship from your corporation in order to distance yourself from their reputation which i might add is largely a result of your doing in an effort to gain a modicum of legitimacy you have joined a rather respected organization whose aims and ambitions are completely different to those you were trying to woo with your campaign originallythe delinquant teenager inside me would like to see you elected just to see what sort of buffoonery you cause however for the physical well being of all involved in the csm process both delegates and ccp staff i do hope you are notthankyou and goodnight

great blog post trzz hell i am half convinced to vote for you now
in that canditate selector some guys support this i find it pretty terrifying
well they obviously have never done trading with a high volume low margin item makes the choice of candidate much easier though im not saying there isnt a problem its the solution in the questionnaire that sucked
it says i put no opinion which is weird because i thought i didnt leave any as no opinion so i guess i didnt understand what it meant because all those things i imagine it to possibly mean make no senseif 2 undercut means that if i want to post a sell order cheaper than the lowest i have to exceed 2 ie post at 98 or less of the previous one no way i understand people hate the eve price is right but seriously it is a free market the artificial floor price of stuff is based on either the manufacturing cost which is impacted by the insurance for ships or the buy orderseven if that rule were put in people would quickly abuse it by posting a stupid cheap sell order of quantity 1 then post their desired price higher for sell orders lower for buy orders for the rest then buy back their initial one this assumes that sell orders higher than the cheapest and buy orders lower than the highest are not effectedsince it has such an obvious method to circumvent it it is an unnecessary market feature
i picked no opinion because being only a part time trader it isnt an issue i would pick up unless it was being ignored by everybody else i used the match site as a place to show where i have specific interests and this wasnt one of them if it was brought to a csm meeting i was at then i would disagree with the proposal much as i dislike being undercut by 01 isk 30 seconds after posting an item for sale it is part of a free market
it was a good question since anyone in favor of it was clearly too stupid to be allowed to have any influence on game design decisions i didnt hold an uncertain position against anyone though since that should be the default position on issues you are not sure about or havent considered yet
well you got 1 vote for all the time youve spent on the sm forum trying to teach us how to properly fly wyverns and chimerasyou should probably plug your campaign some more on that subforum though
voting you at leats with 1 vote cause regarding the voting matcher youre on my top 3 and the other two i dont think they need more help gs mm you look like an involved and rational person youre from netherlands cool country cool people nice chiksgood luck

what is wrong with people in the big alliances getting in my dear ankh
they are biased more often than not and frequently fail to recognize the simple fact that the silent majority are highsec carebears and casual players in small corporations that play only a few hours per week solo or with a select group of friendsnot to marginalize 00 or anything its good that 00 gets some attention with the dominion expansion and boring pos warfare is done away with but lets not make 00 politics any more important than it is
too bad you didnt run i dont think theres anyone to catalyze the cplowsec vote 
and cva is not a major alliance that sounds like a little short sighted bias
z0d isnt from cva and i was in an npc corp during my time on the csm
well allright but dismissing a candidate based solely on their ticker is still wrong
major alliances as a whole should be represented but that doesnt follow that each major alliance should have at least one seat on the csmthe issue i think ankhesentapemkah has is that with the number of candidates splitting the rest of the voters that bloc voting major alliances may well end up with proportionally more seats than the share of active players would suggest the should havei hope there is still space for those of us between empire and sov 00 but well have to wait till 2nd december to find out
if those candidates do nothing but represent themselves and their alliance then yes somethings wrong but i aim to be more than that
bloc voting is the defacto way of doing it just in rl the blocs are political parties while for the csm its alliances those running on standalone platforms then have to battle it out for the rest of the unaffiliated votesif players want to make sure that they have a representative on the csm that specifically covers what they want to see in the game they need to get out and take the 2 minutes it takes to vote whatever your play style and issues you think are the most important find the candidate you like the best and vote for them if you dont vote you dont get the right to complain about the outcomeand when you go and vote remember the name song lisong li for csm 4
well in my experience large alliance csm often vote against issues that isnt their playstyle and they dismiss them as irrelevant or carebeary simply because they do not understand how much it affects players that are confronted with the probleman example is that all factional warfare issues that were repeatedly voted down by the alliance csm at the start of csm3 to the point that it led to public outcry simply because the csm didnt think that fw as a whole deserved a higher priority and because they didnt understand the extent of the issue fw lag is a myth we have lag in 00 too fw lag isnt worse than thatanother example is the issues surrounding medals that when you delete a medal and award it again it doesnt show up in your list anymore and the inability to edit medals after they are created yet it is possible as ccp edits csm medals too ccp sais its working as intended and the alliance csm voted the issues down and dismissed it as a nonissue and accused me of being a medal while this is a geniune concern from roleplaying corpshighsec issues are often dismissed as carebear nonissues too and teeth are often grinded when 00 small gang warfare is mentioned cause the alliances seem to find this a threat to their powerbaseif there was some issue i didnt know about i read up on it and at least voted in favor if the issue had some merit even though i personally didnt care about it things like killmails for selfdestructs i dont give a  but i do understand that this matters to some people alliance csm often went we already have plenty of issues for ccp and this issue isnt important instead of doing their homework and reading up on iti dont expect an issue like move level 5 missions to highsec to pass it through the csm if there are 5 or more alliance people on the csm despite the fact that a lot of players and neutral csm want this to happen which is frustrating when i wrote a document on level 4 missions i included in the document that there were players that wished all level 4 agents moved to lowsec as i do paint the complete picture as well as i can and cover both parts even if i disagree with it personallythe csm is about representing the players even if they arent your type of player and i hope those that get elected keep that in mind
it is a noble aim and i share that sentimentbut that still doesnt help me if a topic comes up that would improve the way i and others play the game at the expense of major 00 alliances in that situation you wouldnt be able to support me without going against your supportersin the event that major alliances take 56 seats then we get no representation at all on those subjects which is one of the reasons i felt the need to run this time as i can represent the middle ground im happy to support improvements to the sov system but at the same time i and others have a fundamentally different playstyle in 00 not wanting to take sov and wish to ensure there is still a place for us
i think the main reason to log in and vote an abstain is to increase the turn out proportionit would be amazing if every active account voted even if 90 were abstains just to show that people checked the eve websiteseriously this is a 14 day voting window and is online
the time is now happy voting

this seems like a fairly obvious fix
fixing the basic balance including mixed weaponry of the npcs is all fine and dandy butit should be completely impossible to speedtank npcs in any way shape or form it is against the spirit of fw and eve itself npcs should chose a new target if they fire 34 volleys at one without doing damage be it due to range andspeed destruction of all spawns should be a requirement for capturing any plex unless defensive naturally npcs should not bother themselves with ships that are not a threat to the installation ie far away from timer while another more accessible target is in timer rangedo this and you get proper plexing as goddess intended and not he system rife with abuses and exploits that we have nowps fix the bloody timer bugs already running on their own and getting bugged by combat inside plex sometimes never actually capping
yes ankh was probably one of the worst possible csms ever nothing that was ever brought up was ever supported unless it fell within her very narrow cone of personal preference and when she realized that the caldari was fw on eazy win mode she stfu on fw changes other than the rewards systemthe entire gallente space seized by the caldari should be removed because it was only gained by a patently broken mechanicand now she has the gall to send me a mail suggesting this or that csm what a insert feminine anatomical epithet here anyone she suggests will not receive any attention from me
i propose a significant increase of the fitting and ship selection be a postdominion change priority fittings for most modules easily could have lower costoutput and higher costoutput at decent efficiencies meta 4 versions added in with at least two new t2 variants for each normal module weapons could just receive appropriate additional t2 variants ships of course would be more difficult but 2 additional ships of each t1 class and an additional 1 of a number of t2 classes or maybe even a t3 desties whatever the formula an extensive upgrade in fitting and ship diversity helps not only every player in the game but heightens all aspects by providing alternative means to the same end it is also a relatively easy and free upgrade it requires minimum of new coding and additions compared to t3 wh mechanics sleeper ai not to mention all of dominion overall more ships and modules  more fun for all
v for me
great ideas would love to see them implemented

signed  supportedccp many players have looked at the changes first put into sisi for the mothership it looked like you were finally going to make the mothership have a use other than for repping poss fighter bombers were looking good now they are all nerfedother than the ships that people ordered or bought the massive losses to ship buildersu have now taken away the one thing the mothership was ok for repping stuffplease back out these changesps whats with the way you are treating your player base now days locking a thread as spam in the test server forum relating to changes to test server is really bad pr  just plain rudelets hope the csms have some sort of way to comunicate to ccp before the ccps nerfsupercaps  sov patch is released
signedi dont fly any capitals because ive thought them to be a money sink anyway it seems that the problem is twofold however first a product that costs upwards of 14 billion isk is suddenly being made worth 5 billion in build cost not bad for people like myself but to anyone who has bought one within the past three months thats entirely a slap in the face secondly youre taking away amount bonuses from ms in the way of deployable fighters along with this ccp is doing some crazy thing with explosion velocity which is making the already decreased numbers of fighterbombers totally uselessperhaps incriment these changes in stages first allow pilots to dock in upgraded stations where they may purchase insurance for their tremendous investments then phase in the build cost adjustment so they can blow up their investment and buy 3 when the patch hits third if you decide to keep the deployable amount nerf leave the drone bay large as to allow a possible range of fighterbombers similar to furynormalprecision in regards to missiles

i absolutely support giving them back their drones triage clone bays etc i am fine with removing but taking away their drones insane also either issue a 10 billion isk credit to the current owners of motherships or mothership bpo holders or restore the previous value you are blithely wiping out billions of isk consider this you said in the econ blog that there are over 400 motherships in eve at the moment discounting bpo holders at 10 bil isk per ship thats 4 trillion isk or in terms of gtcs about 13500 plexes which at 1495 each is 200000 usd again are you insane the amount of time it takes for people to earn 10 b is huge

building cost should not be reducednon fighterbomber damage and capabilities should not be reducedreduced costs is absolutely unnecessary the problem wasis that mothershisp werent being used not that there were too fewit also makes no sense to balance supercarriers based on unrealistic fittings with 5 dcussomeone might do that but it has its downsides so thats perfectly okcompare and calculate with 2 dcus if you want to be on the safe side but not with 5

perhaps no ships in eve symbolize the majesty of the game more than the nyx wyvern aeon and helone side effect of this change is that the build cost for supercarriers will go down slightly as they will no longer require the capital clone vat bay componentsin addition to receiving their own hit point boost supercarriers are going to get new teeth in the form of the deadly new fighter bombers they can launch fighter bombers have exactly one purpose to destroy capital ships and look very cool while doing sowe are still looking at a few other ideas that will help supercarriers do their jobs more effectively and you may see those popping up on sisi in the coming weeksthe last quote sounds like bitter irony now turn back
signed
i really cannot believe ccp does not have a system of checks and balances before devs are allowed to post game changing decisions to the forums i mean shouldnt something like this be signed off on by the head designer before it ever hits the forumsand more importantly if it is then how in the hell did that guy get to be a head designer the damage nerf is bad but on its own i could at least come to terms with it but the total devaluation of cost blows my mind especially after 3 months of pumping this ship up even still there is no viable reason why the actual cost of a mothership should be dropping due to manufacturing changes thats just adding insult to injury to tell the player hey guys  off for spending way to much oh btw were nerfing everything about this ship we told you would be great and btw after we do it were going to make sure you cant get out of the ship wo a huge loss

himotivationdue to the dominion discussion and so on i thought about how the economy works in eve and how players corps and alliances get and spend their money which resulted in me thinking about the money flow in eve and how to improve it especially the money flow from empire to 00 space the more money flows from empire to 00 the more lucrative 00 will becomeassumptionsas for every sound thing i try to make some assumptions because i do not have access to any data1 i think the main reason for cash flow in eve are ships and modules on the one side we have isk faucets mainly missions and bounties on the other side we have resource faucets asteroids loot moons wspace sites the isk stay isk but as resources move through the manufacturing process they become more and more complex being modules and ships at the end however the resources move to the isk faucet harvesters ratters mission runners and the isk move to the resource harvesters basic basics of economy2 00 spacemany inhabitants of 00 space use t2 ships and modules looking at the main isk generating grind ratting the isk flow from t2 user is also the ratter to t2 producer to moon miner so basically the 00 ratting grind is financing the alliances3 empireat least from the forums it seems the l4 mission running is one of the more lucrative activities at the moment so what are the isk flows where mission runners are involved big isk agent bounties  mission runnerlittle isk mission runner  ammo producers  minersfaction ships mission runner 1  mission runner 2  lp storeobviously there are also some modules and ships involved but mission runners do not loose ships too often as in contrast pvpers or 00 rattersconclusionsas already said in assumption 2 the isk flows from 00 to 00 on its end but goes through empire t2 producers and leaves some isk therethe main conclusion i draw from my assumptions is that if you combine 1 and 3 mission runners draw much isk from faucets but donUFFFDt inject them into the player isk circulation because they do not buy new ships and modules on a regular basis because they rarely loose their ships and if they do they probably buy a faction ship with faction mods as pointed out in assumption 3 faction items do not help other groups of players than mission runners to get more isk from themproposed solutionmake ships and modules use some sort of fuel to increase their effectivenessthe buff to 00 is that resources for t1t2 fuels are only accessible in 00 space and resources of fuels for t3 ships and maybe modules if ccp introduces them can only be harvested in wspaceon a closer look the production chain should be similar to the t3 or booster production so resources can only be collected with ships that means no passive point income and a reasonable complex production chain so that people can specialize and get some profit out of itbasic examplespower core fuel increase pg output you always have to have enough of it because otherwise modules go offlinehybrid turret fuel increases hybrid dmgrail fuel increase rail optimal rangeblasters fuel increase blaster tracking summarythis proposal should suggest a concept which can be detailed later the main idea is to increase cash flow from empire to 00 space by introducing a player produced consumable everybody wants and which basic ingredients can only be harvested in 00wspacefeliaedit exchanged the worsethanbad chosen name for the consumable to fuel

can anyone tell me what advantages minmatar ships have even left after all the nerfs to thembecause right now i just came to the painful realization that even after all the training that ive done on my ships it will never ever compare to the ships of other races ive put up with the jokes about their ugliness i actually find them quite beautiful the whole scrapyard look is appealing but its frustrating as heck when you realize that youve been training for a year for the most disadvantaged ships in eve i had begun to realize this about a month ago when a 3 month old corpmate was tanking better and doing heavier damage than me on rats with a cruiser and me by then almost a year old on a battleship with a t2 fit somethings not right theregallente have drones caldari have missiles amarr have lazors all are very capable of achieving very heavy tanks matari ships are fragile as heck with nothing comparable to the advantages given to other ships at allthe only concrete advantage of matari ships are projectile guns with its supposedly capless advantage as if with enough skills the cap drain from firing guns on the ships of other races are negligible so its not even an advantage oh and did i mention that it has utterly poor dps and tracking anyway and use a ton of ammo gallente and caldari guns does too but hey they have drones and missiles which hit no matter what so who caresin the olden days they did have an advantage of speed for their hac ships not anymore yet its still touted as the primary advantage of matari ships  speed and agility as if its supposed to make up for the massive advantages of other ships a vague description that doesnt even come close to how matari ships actually are ingame their speed advantage is very very minor and limited to their smaller ships sure our hacs are some of the best but then again so are the other races hacs in their respective nichesso what else is the raison dUFFFDtre for matari ships if ccp likes it like that why not just remove all matari ships altogether all my other corpmates who once flew pure matari had no choice but to branch out to other ships that means most of us had to train for twice the time just to get an effective shipi have nothing concrete to suggest i guess this is just a rant to vent off the frustration in the hopes that maybe just maybe ccp will shower more love on the matari ships if were supposed to be the speedy race then for goobers sakes make it so our speed advantage at the moment barely counts for much we have no dpstank advantage to speak off and none of the perks other nations got amarrian armor caldari missiles gallente drones nor are they really useful except for maybe scouting or solo ganking poor miners and of course  running away and i sure as heck didnt train for a year just to become a scout or simply fleet support as most of our bonuses are for fleet support  webs scrams target paintersall in all give a reason again to be thankful i trained to be a pure matari pilot because apparently the advantages of our ships are all just talk and their disadvantages plenty rebalance please please dont force us matari pilots to train yet again for the ships of other racescompare the procon lists in the official wikiminmatar shipsamarr shipscaldari shipsgallente shipsthe first thing that springs to your mind when reading the minmatar ship advantages list is bullsh intentionally vague descriptions of advantages to mask the fact that they actully have nothing at all to compare to the other racesoh and i have no illusions i think nothing will come out of this rant anyway sigh
you know that isnt the official wiki right

feel free to contract me all your loluseless minmatar ships especially any hurricanes or typhoons you may have i will gladly relieve you of the burden of looking at them cluttering up your hangar while you train for some other races ships
ya bro i totally fit my hurricane with 6 miner 2s then someone came a flipped my can i shot him with my drones and he killed mehurricane totally needs to be boosted
can i have your minmatar ships
got any extra vagabonds or hurricanes i can have
sounds sensible to me
cripes yes suddenly having the corp deliveries spammed with dross is worthy of pulling hairthey need to make the corporate deliveries hangar sortable by systemconstellationregioneverywhere just like our personal assetstrying to recover deliveries from 100 stations is a nightmare as it is much less when a corp goob jumps into the soylent green processor
biggest issue in eve atm is lag which is cause by too many players in a system soo when groups like nc or sc go to fight your looking about 2k  people which will just keep growing in a single system which makes the fight unplayable soo remove standings so that alliance and corps can no longer blue other alliance and corps no more blues no more reds just neutralsalso put a cap on how many people can be in an alliance 1000 to 1500 would be my guessi belive doing this would reduce lag and also make the game more fun and help introduce new corps and alliances to 00 this has prolly been suggested before but it seems the most simplist way to put the fun back into the game
nothing you propose will do anything to reduce lag nothing if you remove in game means by which to set standings people will merely use out of game mechanics to accomplish the same goals limit the number in an alliance say hello to goons1 goons2 goons3 who will all still fly together putting the same numbers in a systemwhat would reduce lag would be for you to never log in again
if u remove the ability to set corpsalliance blue how u gonna deal with all neutrals in fleet fight ofc u would have to remove the alliance and corp ticker option from the overview maybe also reduce the max number in a fleet to 100 so then u go into a battle with your alliance only and u would not be able to distiguish as u say goons 23 with the enemysoo this will mean less numbers in fights alliance vs alliance not half of 00 vs the other half
i have more people than that in my corporatione well i did until i got booted
would you like to borrow a calculator venkul
i dont se how changes to sov system will encourage people to move from hisec to null currently theres nothing which can attract people messing with industrypve in my opinion whole change in dominionthough its nice to see they want to do something with it is a bit of unthinked and ccp dont really have idea yet how it all should look like
yes that is rather the point of this thread
and you think that is you reduce mineral request people will mine tritanium in 00no one of the proposed changes will cure this because there are better minerals in 00increase all mineral yield by 15 and people will still prefer bistot to tritaniumyou get offended if i am late replying lol what a egoit will be a boost for 00 producers and maybe much maybe 00 minersunless 00 producers start to sell to the big high sec market it will shift mineral prices only locally and if the producers are very honestmost 00 builder will be still paying high sec prices minus transportation to high sec cost for high ends and high sec costs plus importation cost for low ends you need to learn how market work
i generally agree that 00 needs to be made way way more attractive then it currently is compared to highsec and not by nerfing highsec but by boosting 00  give us missions and meaningful ways to improve our space that dont suck
supported some extra stuff regarding mineral distribution hisec only should spawn tri  pyer related ores lowsec should spawn only the other related ores lowends nullsec should spawn only abcm wh stays as it is various sizes of belts with all sorts of ore  exploration belts the samethis way you entice a flow of activity regarding minerals between the 3 layers of security so not any can be independent and exportingimporting is a must coupled with industrial bonus hopefully importing minerals to 00 will be more usefull than importing ships directlly
in all honesty i know you guys disagree i am pretty sure that malcanis agrees with me that 00 needs buffed in accordance with ccps stated intention to get more people to 00venkul i am not so sure that you agree with me or noti am trying to figure out more ways to entice people to 00 instead of nerfing them out of hisec which i think ccp is more than able and willing to dovenkul  is there anything that would make you go back and try 00 again if so let me hear it herethanks to everyone whos posted so far appreciate the feedback
iirc venkul wouldnt move back to 00 even if the belts were yielding supermodels because hes obsessed with the belief that all 00 corps exist for the sole purpose of making industrials miserable
as an empire manufacturer i see no reason to move to 00 with dominionnot because of the risk ive had alts in 00 for years but because of the logistics involved in keeping my assembly lines runningmoving commodities to my manufacturing location takes a considerable logistic chain that is all too easily broken trying to get through the choke points of 00 even with jump freighters and then once ive got my goods built getting everything back to markets where it will actually sell 00 markets are a laughable joke limited number of stations restricted customer base by standings ect ect is another logistic nightmareits not the risk that keeps my assembly lines bottled up in empire its that delicate chain of supplies i simply cannot maintain in 00
hi i think eve needs to bring more relevance to the shares of companies shareholders do not control a company as a matter of fact unless they hold the ceo position this should be correcteda ceo as things are now control the corporation and can kick out validly any shareholder regardless of how many shares he or she owns thus neglecting any rights of ownership of the corporation for instance it is common that a corporation is the owner of the shares a holding company of another corporation so the holding company will never control the ceo position of the company owned as it is not a character that can hold offices dont make ceo untrusted persons yeah right but on a complex corporation with lots of people owning different companies is impossible to control all the ceosi propose shareholders should be able to govern a corporation regardless if they hold ceo position and regardless if they belong or not to the corporation that issued the shares ccp should allow shareholders to enforce a shareholders voting to expell the ceo and propose new ceo without being part of the owned company also voting should be enforced once majority has been achieved without giving time to ceos or directors to rip off companieshope you find this proposal viable
im torn on this i dont mind the way it is though i agree it could be better not sure if it should be betterheres a workaround the game tries to take the next storyline agent within constellation if possible its the same corp you can block storyline agents by not doing their mission the next available one is then taken instead grind l1 missions to block him then do good missions
i can relate though i dont know of the best solutioni currently dont have much interest in storyline missions which result in increased faction standingsstoryline missions which increase corp standings but not faction standings would be nicea reward system which benefits those who play across numerous factions and who maintain standings to allow for that would be appreciatedthe current arrangement seems to reveal an underlying notion of the game design that peace doesnt pay
and for the love of eve make storyline missions well missionsnothing is more annoying than a storyline mission to get 8k of ore or move 40k m3 of cargo containers 13 jumps to some distant station in lowsec i mean what idiot dev came up with that mission what do you think their daily pasttime is hint it starts with gate and ends with campmake it a mission make it a hard mission for its type one that takes time and entails some actual risk other than transporting the aforementioned oversize cargo through the same gate camp half a dozen times
support the cause
in another game where name changes server transfers and even changing race are the norm you get the biggest asshats screwing over others time and time again with no consequences this definitely degraded the quality of the player base in eve it would make the whole point of characters being the sum of their history meanlingless
two main reasons come to mind1 you typed in something dumb to start and after youve played awhile you realize that your name l33tawesomek00lduudz is not what you want2 you purchased a character but the name is l33tawesomek00lduudz and you cannot stand thati dont see anything wrong with a name change if it is extremely limited and the history is shown im thinking it would cost 15 and only doable once per character with a history shown and that cost waived when done through character transfers this is not a whine from scammers wanting a free pass there are legitimate reasons for wanting a name change i dont see why you people are so paranoid over it if a scammer changes his name he will be easily caught via history besides real scammers have disposable characters in which to scam and are perfectly happy biomassingnot usingselling the character after he cannot scam anymore because of reputation
no absolutely not your name is what identifies you if youre a scammer and you scam a lot there are consequences you develop a reputation same with corp thievery and many other notorious actslikewise chribba noir and many others have developed a reputation based solely on their names and their wordactions should have consequences and i dont mean just clicking select new name 10 from a menu
no as some people wrote earlier your name should be your ingame id theres already character sellingbuying  you can change name that way if you want to loose your identity
the only way i could even remotely support this is that its only available once and it should cost a fairly hefty sum those two points would help deter but not remove the possibility for a scam artist to hide their identity im still not really okay with italso having a list in your bio even if its just one name means that more names will be taken up that arent being used its a pita for the newcomers to the game im surei guess the only reason why id even want this for just a little bit is because ive changed the lifestyle of my character and gone from a good little federation navy officer to being wanted by all of the empires for rp purposes that i couldnt really have foreseen when i created my character id like to change my call sign but even then i still see it as something i have to live with
in the two cases listed above only 2 seems like a legitimate situation to me 1 frankly is your own damned fault next time put some thought into your character namehowever i would support character name changes as part of character sales for an additional small fee
i say no to name changes you earn the reputation you get so if youre known as a can flipper then people will know when youre in system to be on their guard for examplethe only way i would allow a name change is maybe within the 1st month and only if youve got no negative sec status issueswhy oh why did i call myself after a painful sitting down condition oh yeah i remember i thought it was funny at the time and still do
due to the macromissionrunners being banned isk has deflated to a level relative to that only insurance propping up the value of productsstave off insurance fraud by boosting lvl 4 missions to give more isk this will have the effect of some inflationdue to the large isk sinks coming in with dominion and people more interested in pvpwe need lvl 4 missions to be boosted to give more isk to cover this hole or everything will simply be funded by insurance fraud
i am a meager child of 12 and am unsure as to what this is

im pretty sure this is negligible also if they behaved like turrets then the launchers closest to the target would be the ones launching missiles regardless so what if the flight paths are slightly different because they were launched from different points on the ship wouldnt that be more true to the way missiles work besides it would be such a small differencethat aside i support this i think its long overdue too
its been 6 years ccp
not a huge deal but would be nice to see
no there are too many other important and more pressing issues like musical instruments in ambulation to consider before ccp should even ever think about this trivial matter
too right and they need to fix missile so that they actually travel as far as they shouldcurrently if a missile has 5ks speed and 10s of flight time itll go about 45km because like a ship missiles have to accelerate up to their max velocity cutting into flight time and shortening effective range

nice twist on the sagan quotehmmm something about this idea eminds me of that toxic gas cloud mission i might have warped into in a helios a long long time ago in a solar system far far away i was pretty much immediately vaporizedthis sounds more like something that could be implemented as a special kind of exploration site
simple all major alliances join same channel become blue to each other move entire legion capital army to boarder systems of low sec and high sec lock systems down become complete 00 standing kill any thing that comes through gates from high sec we dont need high sec we provide high sec no new players will get their hands on on ours space
20 spelling20 grammar500000 idearesult really bad troll
think about it there is what 20 gates to 00 40 gates to low secif a triad of high end alliance and blue coalitions banded togetherbrought as much pain to those gates took them over with the new sov changesbarricaded the gates with around the clock support you as a player base are essentially breaking eves game by making your own rules in their sandboxkilling any thing not blue coming through those gates noob toons piracy for limited api keys if your below 20 million sp you die if you arnt 1 standing to high sec you die no new player gets to experiences low sec or 00 based on player controlits unfathomable perfect id like to try and see ccp not listen to a coordinated action such as thisbe it a week or three months if you major alliance align to fight a common enemy ccp and their changes nothing cant be achieved they will have to listen
and so everyones going to do this to get what accomplished exactly kicks destroy the game grief noobs lobby for gameplay changes i think you forgot to mention that in the original post
err lobby for game play changes thought that was quite apparent people think whiny and quitting the game will make them change something but new players will keep coming in we have a opportunity in a game were we make our own rules who is to say we cant smite all new players from and block off a large portion of the game to new entry until they begin listening to the player base
you have to sleep sometime your theory is flawed and besides the amount of distrust between the largest 00 alliances would have this falling apart within the first hour of operation
alliance 1 come sit on the lowsec gates and force ccp to take noticealiance 2 lol surealliance 1 hey where are you guysmessage from eve mail alliance 2 just kicked alliance 1 out of xxx region and stole all their stuffrest of eve lol noobsthat is why youre idea has exactly a snowballs chance in hell of working
screw it i support this idea ccp wants emergence  give it to em 
im not really sure what the op wants to do here but i felt like voting im with you for some reason i think its cause i have gas
i agreeyou should force 00 alliances who hold sov to defend and secure lowsec so i can go do missions in lowsec safely
title scimitar has a saving grace in that it is fast enough to be survivable in a roaming gang solo trading rep capacity for speed and an extender tank however the onerios can not fit a tank while maintaining enough cap mods to be semistable and be semisurvivable in addition both have a useless bonus to tracking links which is never used due to needing to use almost all mids and lows as cap mods to run all reps on the other hand the guardian and basilisks can pull cap out of their asses and thusly fit a nice bufferremove the link bonus and give either10 to rep amount per logistics levelorallow scimitar to use armour reps and onerios shield reps give both more fitting to facilitate fitting new repsandgive a 25 reduction in cap recharge time to both ships or decrease rep cap use to a similar degreemove one midslot to a highslotchange armor drone rep bonus to shield on onerios and vice versa on scimgive scimitar about 100mw more grid and the onerios about 30tf more cpupersonally id rather to see the dual rep rather than a straight rep bonus but both are here for argument theres still going to be significant tradeoffs but itd be better than it is now
oneiros for example should be allowed to fit 1 cap remote rep so it frees up highslots for mining lasers
so this must be why all fast gangs have basilisks for logistics instead of scimitars right
no because the scimitars have better mining yield

i know a great many play eve with their sound off this is largely due to eve not actually supplying you with many audioprompts that are immediately beneficial to gameplayi think eves audio environment could benefit from audio feedback on your situation i dont know how feasable this is and whether or not the voice actress that did aura is still available but i would definitely love to have audio warnings for such events aslow shields armor structure warnings user definableewar affecting your ship eg your turrets are being disruptedward disruption being applied as opposed to the warning coming up when you try to warp tell us when it is being appliedlow ammo in your clip to warn you of the upcoming reloadwarning when you are being targettedwarning when being neutedi think a richer audio enviroment would increase the number of players actually using sound as well as giving you valuable audio information that will not have to be constantly checked by eye
it would help if they would fix the sounds they already have firstever since they tried to fix turret sounds the sounds for events like weapons firing and hitting are no longer reliable as indicators of these events sometimes you can hear them and sometimes you cant and sometimes you have to move your camera farther from your ship to hear your own missiles or guns firing or the impact of enemy missiles on your ship this erratic behavior is not just bad design its extremely annoyingput sounds back the way they were with the exception of making the quieter turret sounds checkbox they added actually do what it says  currently it seems to have no effect whatsoeverand get rid of the annoying hums and doodee doodee sounds they added to shield and armor hardeners respectively i dont want to have to zoom out until i can barely see my ship just to avoid having to listen to that constant irritating droning or beeping

instead of dropping named bpcs i think that the npcs should drop wrecked modules that one could then reverse engineer to get named bpcs wrecked modules could refine for quite a bit less than their named counterparts would no this isnt a stealth ninja salvaging nerf 3
v but for 2 you have to replace that loot with some value such as bounty or less overall items but significantly of greater value
nice idea both 1 and 2 that changes would seem reasonable if they would really be small changesalso basic t1 modules not dropping from npc sounds good
irony
hmmlizza valora alt post much ironicis it ironic that you make such a claim and yet being an active leader of the united controlling how that organization was run how can it not mirror your opinions and moral standardsoh wait i understand now you have joined cry havoc yes your statement is accurate your actions do in fact not represent the opinions and moral standards of the cry havoc alliancecry havoc are not grieferscry havoc do not threaten the well being of people in real lifeyup you are being honest with us here thank youyou do not represent all the things cry havoc are known for you do not represent honesty integrity and most importantly a moral centerthank you for clearing up that confusion

if youve been lurking around the assembly hall youll know the thought and effort herschel puts into your game hes been influential on several issues and deserves your vote he gets one of mine again this year
based on your answers to the csm vote matcher i have a few questions for you you disagree that mining in its current form is not profitable enough why is that the amount of boredom they go through self inflicted true should be rewarded think of the poor miners now that moons were nerfed there is little conflict driver for 00 alliances also since holding space becomes mostly a burden with the proposed changes 00 becomes carebear wonderland though easily disruptable replacing pvp as a means to get hold of valuable assets to do more pvp with a system where you have to pve to pay the bills to pve some more why do you think this is good you are against the increase of production and research slots while i agree that research slots are one of the main reasons to put up a pos in empire eves population is increasing making the situation worse over time imho a good compromise would be to increase the number of slots but also increase and level slot fees so that it at least matches the cost of one slot of a pos youre running please explain how being against the ending of t2 bpos is not motivated by self interest why shouldnt invention become more profitable imo t2 ship prices are too high and invented bpcs are too inefficient decrease their cost increasing volumes moved increasing profits again sounds like you are sitting on t2 bposand here is another question that every candidate should answer since you have a rl job and maybe other responsibilities how can you get enough free time to do the position as csm justiceregards
zod has the full support of flames of wrath corp 1
compared to the marketing done for the previous takecare candidates i found little info on z0d tbh are there any documented public appearancesbased on your answers in the csm vote matcher here are some questions for you you disagree that suicide ganking should be viable the question leaves some room for interpretation i think it should be viable in the sense of being possible but less profitable then it is currently so if you decide to suicide that freighter it should be for strategic reasons it was carrying precious cargo to my enemy what do you think you would like to see 00 infrastructure vulnerable to small gangs if that is because youd like to see small entities being able to get a foothold in 00 imo that is fair if its purely for causing disruption with no strategic value how do you think this could be balanced how the hell does eves core combat system lack complexity pos logistics in wspace is already a nightmare why should they be exposed to more dangers now that moons were nerfed there is little conflict driver for 00 alliances also since holding space becomes mostly a burden with the proposed changes 00 becomes carebear wonderland though easily disruptable replacing pvp as a means to get hold of valuable assets to do more pvp with a system where you have to pve to pay the bills to pve some more why do you think this is goodother than those points i like your proposals though imo they only cover a part of the subjects that require love from ccpand here is another question that every candidate should answer since you have a rl job and maybe other responsibilities how can you get enough free time to do the position as csm justiceregards
i as a member of the gallente milita the villore accords mdp pseudo alliance and the qcats corp fully endorse your candidacy and have been informing others about your platformdue to previous positive interactions with ankh and seeing that you guys have been doing something about the issues we presentinform you about has earned my vote on a plus side of all the candidates you seem to have one of the most sensible stances and i like your ideasyou have shown to be nonbiased and have no obvious conflict of interest on your positions unlike others except the ticket to icelandeagerly awaiting the results
ill answer two of your questions if you dont mindunfortunately all of us erik z0d me and my brother had a very busy time irl and we were unable to produce a movie before the elections z0d has thus far not been able to schedule any interviews despite him trying seems like the interviewers are much more interested in the major 00 chestbeaters maybe something tomorrow though not sureall three of us were present at fanfest during most of the roundtablesi think z0ds answer to this question was influenced a lot by my whining about it in private so let me state my reasonsalert the following doesnt reflect z0ds personal opinion and my corpalliance definately does not endorse this view just my own personal opinion as gamer and game designer here if youre easily offended please dont read it either in my opinion eves combat model is very straightforward the problem isnt that its not twitchbased but the lack of options both to create a valid fitting and when actually flying in space the combat itself only has a few options which is attempt to get to a certain range of your target attempt to create or nullify transversal fire your stuff activate your tank if you have it and maybe use some ewar or energy denial if you have a blo uhh fleet then there is probably some maniac shouting over voicecoms who to zap first greatship fittings are limited and straight forward ships have a certain role which determines how they should be fit you pick a weapons type which is basically already determined by the race of the ship you fly and the corresponding ship bonus choose one of four tank systems and fit the modules that create the most optimal outcome in eft you can opt for some speedboosts webs scrams maybe a nos or a neut if fitting allows it and thats as varied as it gets the pinnacles of creativity are things like the passive shield dominix or fitting an oversized shieldbooster on your baitship in the alliance tournament yawnall of this means that eve core combat is actually very similar to world of warcrafts does this tell how boring i find eve pvp good enough ships are the classes and the classes have 2 or if lucky 3 optimal cookie cutter builds where you maybe vary a few talen i meant module or two to show off your rebel creativity if youre a rich guy you can fit some epic i mean faction and officer modules which pwn lower tier stuff unless youre a total clueless buttonbashing monkey and still manage to get your behind handed to you just like world of warcraft there is a rockpaperscissors mechanic which makes class a variant 1 strong against class b variant 3 to which the counter is class c variant 2 and you just pray that you dont run into your class nemesis and specced your class i mean fitted your ship to emerge victorious from your encounter with the enemy if all else fails just throw that last shred which eve calls tactics out of the window and either bring 10x as much people or wardec some noobs to claim your wellearned victoryill stick to guild wars where i can mess around and be really creative so that something insanely good pops up every once in a while not that it is a very enjoyable game after i assembled my characters fortunately im a half decent programmer and i just make bots to play them and win against natural stupitidy in pvp while im doing more important stuff
well i like most of what you did or tried to accomplish in the csm but i can only wish that you uhm were more successful at pvp so that could enjoy this great aspect of eve tempted to say gtfo while its not so common these days tactics can play a large role in the outcome of battles imho much of your whine about lack of flexibility only applies if you look at a single playership as soon as you put together a small gang the amount of permutations rise dramatically the impact can be huge which can be seen for instance when an outnumbered gang manages to prevailmacroer get her
let me state that i never botted eve i did hack eve but reported my findings to the devs immediately and they fixed the security gapmaybe something for next alliance tournament though
as far as i know z0d hangs around eve all the time even when he is at work he has already devoted much of his time helping people around him as you may quess from post around herealso hes a kind of a world runner and spender  not just someone who only hangs around chats all day long wishing things were so  meaning he does not hesitate to push his rl assets to make his eve expirience more worthwhileso from the narrow perspective of people i know he is definetly one up for this taskonly negative i can think of is that he maybe be a bit too stubburn in his views but given z0ds aims laid down here that is probably a good thing too and finaly the punch line while the story of adam and eve seems to have some rather disturbing gapsthe story of denis and eve is ongoin everyday reality vote zodvote more relaxing and more rewarding eve expierience
hey ankh i think youre sniping a lot of z0ds airtime here while im sure hes a pretty cool guy who doesnt afraid of anything im sure the people here would rather hear his opinions on issues not take cares and hence your ideas by proxyz0d while your list of issues are long and have no doubt been thought tanked to death please tell us of your personal in game experiences and knowledge ofrunning a corppvp dynamics in hiseclowsec00manufacturingpve including anomolies and wormholesstarbase management
regarding the viability of suicide ganking in my opinion there currently is still too little consequence to carrying out a gank the sec status his is laughable and people can still smartbomb even if they are at 10 recycled alt characters with destroyers is also becomming common practice while i do not think that game mechanics should prevent suicide ganking alltogether indiscrimiately ganking random targets for huge profits should not be viable there should be risk and consequence attached for the gankerin my opinion some adjustments should be made that takes in account a few different factors the ganker himself should not get an insurance return for suiciding a ship by doing something illegal be killed and then claim insurance for his deed for example concord response could be based on the sec status of a player transporting the goods whatever the form of transport used the higher his sec status the stronger and faster concords response will be to the criminal act the same is viable the other way around where the lower someones sec status is the slower the concord response should bethen with the goods transporter lies the responsibility of splitting high valuable into more secure ships and not flying autopilot totally afk to maximise his goods remaining his until their intended destination if one person chooses to transport 300 mil worth of good in a hauler afk that is worth 800k isk then he only has himself to blame for it and hopefully he learns from his mistakefor the major infrastructures being able to cause disruptions that could modify certain attributes and features dynamically would make it interesting tactically for an enemy to plan disruptive incursions which then causes certain of those effect having to be reinstated from their disrupted statusthe main reason why i want to see 00 infrastructure vulnerable to small gangs is because it is clear that many players in 00 are looking for small gang emergent pvp and not for huge blobs i hope that the vulnerable infrastructure provides incentives for people to leave the blob at home and roam around in small fast gangsit would be logical to be of more dangers as it is technically the worst type of space out there we start from a typical 10 system where concord responds immediately and as you go down towards 05 response becomes a lot slower then you enter low sec where most laws are decided by the players living there but still have an impact then you get 00 where law is usually written by the biggest guns and finally unstable space where one day to the next entry and exit could lead from one corner of the universe to the other absolutely anything can go in there and the rewards of living in it should reflect the ultimate risks taken by the people choosing to harvest the most unpredictable space which wormholes should be
moons were essentially nerfed to remove a monopoly held by the bigger player blocks having their numbers far more limited makes it easier for the few very large alliances to hold the best places and run a complete cartel redistributing the required moon based components required across a broader range of more common moons and in the upcoming required quantities will enable more smaller based alliances corporations to participate and be able to also prosper independentlysovereingty changes that are comming will most defitivelely require a lot of balancing as with any major changes brought in that dramatically changes existing systems this in my opinion will force the largest alliances to size down held space to a size they can manage this should hopefully lead to more smaller groups to come and occupy those new space either in partnership or by themselves this potentially bringing more pvp and conflict opportunities to players as well as many new trading materials having to be moved around in and extracted to empire these changes will defitively affect our game on a global scaleyou worry for pvp but with 00 carebear wonderland as you call it i also hope that more players choose to actually earn their money in 00 and the economic upgrades coming in dominion should ensure that 00 becomes more attractive to live in this means that there will be more potential targets as well and more opportunity for small skirmishes which i believe is what a lot of 00 pvpers seek
i created my current corp over 3 years ago and built it from scratch security infrastructure policies towards other corp members corporations and alliances i can say that one of the tedious part was to use the corporate ui and actually make it work building everything and testing security with alts of my own or other corpmates it quickly highlighted many points that would need complete makeover to actually properly secure corporate and allied members and assets there are a lot of places where some settings are either too little or simply way too much but no middle ground leaving areas completely vulnerable to massive potential corporate and allied damages look no further than former band of brothers and just recently cvamy own pvp experience is mostly theoretical as i am essentially an industrial and marketer i have nonetheless been in enough wars and survived through each and used them as experience to be better prepared for the next ones travel through lowsec when needed and been occasionally into 00 and wormholes with friends one of the great advantages as a market runner and industrial is that you can if being proactive and actually take the time to talk to your customers meet an incredibly diversified scope of players in all types of career paths and many solid friendship have formed up that way for me and keeps expandingon the manufacturing side which i have been running for years and keep expanding in many ways with other industrial and trading partners finding ways to expand is sometime quite challenging but is also quite rewarding when you reach a new goal then set new bigger ones in terms of manufacturing itself we can basically build anything just about in eve short of supercarriers and titans a lot of planning goes into deciding who will train specifically what so that efficiency can be maximised as a group to get the build jobs done contrary to what many may think industry can become quite complex when working with t1 t2 t3 supplies etcas far as my experience is mostly theoretical for pvp for me pve is a place where i am very strong having run myself a very extensive amount of missions ranging from cosmos l1l4 datacenters rd and make myself available when friends need a hand at handling through missions i have been in some anomalies and wormholes as secondary much less than mission running itselfpos management from as far as a couple years ago when i started using them has been quite interesting from many points there are many ways one can go about tailoring the fitting of the mods on it to suit ones specific needs of either research defences harvesting etc and is essential for industrials that do research mepe copying manufacturing simple to advanced jobs which is mostly my use for them more needs to be done for the interface which can be quite cramped especially when you have a pos system loaded with industry protective and offensive modules in terms of management
i think we can both relate to quite a few colorfull ingame debates we had and discussions that lasted into the very early hours of the morning we had around too many beers when i was in prague this summer
i support damar hes got the interest of fwlowsec in mind something i feel needs a little more representation its not all about care bears and nullsec

ive spent quite a bit of time in wormholes where there is a form of delayed local delayed until somebody talks and it makes for some interesting tacticslocal is currently an intel tool for both defender and attacker a defender is notified as soon as a hostile player enters system and can thus take action before that player has even loaded an attacker entering a system is told as soon as they load how many people are in the system and can decide if it is safe to shoot that target on gate or if it is worth sweeping through the system looking for targetsthis currently makes it tricky to sneak up on targets because even if you enter from a different gate they see local spike and bug out you cant even sneak a covert fleet in via a blackops portal because they will see you in local as a defender you cant hide your true numbers in system without springing a login trap when the attackers have committed themselvesthen there is the often complained about single afk cloaked ship in system stopping people from rattingso the question is what type of delayed local is appropriate for normal known space do we want the same as wormholes where you dont appear if you dont speak or do we want what we have now just with a delay between entering system and local updating and how long a delayit needs further discussion and testing on sisi but i think it would be interesting to try a 25 min local delay between entering and leaving a system and it would only apply to 00 and maybe later lowsec empires have better comms networks and thus can update ship beacons straight away there are other issues too such as avoiding spamming the directional scanner  maybe some kind of 1au proximity alarm instead i think this is a fair point i dont see much incentive to take space from another alliance other than lowsecnpc 00 gateways outpost systems and other logistically significant locations will those be enough of a reason im not sure it was certainly much easier to point at an r64 and have a reason to take it i like small roaming gangs 520 people fast moving hit and run style and having seen the infrastructure hubs hitpoints it is certainly not going to be bothered by even 20 bsso we are not going to be removing sov anytime soon but i would however like the ability to be a fly in the ointment to go into sov space and disrupt operations there this would keep sov 00 alliances honest as they would have to protect their ratters miners etc and create some opportunities for fights ive not really thought of any additional ideas for disrupting infrastructure though you could have hacking type modules to offline upgrades maybefor this question i mostly wanted to repeat my support the smaller roaming pvp gangshopefully that makes my position clear even if you dont agree with me
yes we know small gang pvp is an issue close to your heart and even if i disagree on some points the fact that i am asking is because i think you did very well in the podcasts and other public appearancesthats is a different problem for which several interesting solutions were proposed making local delayed doesnt really helpare you telling me you need 5 minutes to catch an unsuspecting ratter or miner seriously though i think a delay of 1520 seconds already produces the desired effect and if you want to catch people that is what interceptors are for for 00 you could actually tie the delay to system upgrades giving the defending entity an intel advantagemy question also was supposing the infrastructures could be disrupted by small gangs by any means what would you get out of it if you dont really have a chance of taking the sov even supposing the hubs had far less hitpoints why would you prefer to shoot a stationary structure instead of doing pvpand here is a different question you very probably have a rl full time job a family maybe how can you get enough free time to do the csm position justicebest regards
i felt it was important to make the effort it depends on what form of delayed local is used if you use wspace style local then the issue of an afk cloaker in system isnt the same because you dont know they are there you assume i want this change to simply go gank ratters with the directional scanner changes and new probe mechanics i would say that even 30 seconds isnt long enough to find a ratter if that were my reasoning for this changein reality there are many instances where we would like to be able to circle around a gatecamp and be in warp to them from another gate before they see us appear in local if they have catch bubbles we need time to get a covops on grid to setup a warp in currently when the covops gets in system they can see and so bug outmy point was that with the amount of hp there isnt any point us even thinking of taking the system and the defenders would know itwhat we would get out of being able to disrupt something is a reaction from the alliance which leads to a fun fight for both partiesid say im already spending 34 hours per day on csm campaigning plus running extra pvp courses at the weekends so getting voted in would probably save me time in seriousness i have enough eve time to take on the csm tasks and do them justice it might mean i get a bit less pvp some weeks but that is a price i am willing to pay
for gang vs gang the change is fine they are looking for a fight actively scanning the one with the morebetter scouts has the edge on intel im worried about soloers pvpers but especially ratters dont you agree that theyll be at a greater disadvantage than they already are they have no scout and no warnings the directional scanner doesnt really help in this situation you cant expect ratters to rescan every few seconds for hours just to see if there is an inty just about to land on gridi can imagine variations of the proposal being more balanced for instance making pilots flying covops appear x minutes later and making the other ships only appear in local after they broke cloak or even biggercrazier proposals like an intel disruption bubble while you are inside you dont appear in local but also dont see local
this is why as good as the vote match site is it doesnt give the whole picture yes there are many issues to cover with a change to local but the five options available cant convey that removal of local brings up the option of other intel tools which havent yet been discussedto specifically tackle the ratting question did you see what i did there  yes it would be seen as a nerf to 00 solo ratting if there wasnt an easy mechanism to say new in local warp to safe and cloaki think it comes down to risk vs reward as well as encouraging the m in multiplayer if people really want to be safe earning isk solo then there are other options l4s in empire etc im not sure protecting solo ratters in 00 at the expense of gang pvp is worth it but im open to other suggestions for new intel tools etc to make it fairultimately it needs to be driven by player suggestions submitted to the csm from a proposal in the assembly hall and then have on the record discussion during csm meetings there are far too many issues for one person to have all the answers at this point hopefully you can see my general opinions thoughas a final thought on this i was at one of the pvp roundtables at fanfest when the issue of local was discussed two big power blocs took opposing views on it and argued for some time by the end of the discussion both parties had swapped position on the subject there were also discussions about replacement intel tools such as sov holders having reports from the gates they pay the upkeep on and other ideas to reduce the problem of direction scanner spamit is a very tricky and emotional subject but i am not shying away to protect votes or otherwise hoping it doesnt come upall good points which would have to be considered in any removal of local proposal put to the csm the csm process is supposed to be one of engaging the community to suggest improvements discussing them at the csm meetings and finally pass them to ccpi hope with my posts you can see i take the process seriously am willing to discuss issues and if elected take suggestions from players forward i do enjoy these kind of discussions and good proposals should be able to withstand a little scrutiny
well to put it bluntly i think you are trying to fix something that is not broken at the expense of another player group ie while i am not mainly a small gang pvper when i do go roaming i dont have problems finding targetsfights with a bit of patience remember that dominion forces people to do more pve so youll already have more targets and nerfing local would be another kick in their nuts yes i can see that that kind integrity at least till youre involved in the next scandal  is something going for you you also have my sympathy as a candidate for doing teaching in eve ill be casting my 3 votes on the end of the voting period candidates should work for them  but youre on a good way even though i dont agree with your pet project
i dont belive it is working as intended but i wouldnt say it was broken as such more so i believe that improvements could be made and as i also stated the ideas at fanfest were that removing local would require new intel tools which would help sov 00 such as gate reportsi know you disagree but that is fine  there are many things in eve that cause opposite opinions and so far the game has survived dont misunderstand it isnt a pet project of mine though obviously i have an interest in such a change nothing would go before the csm without a player proposal i would however support the submission and discussion of such a proposal and add to the discussion threads etc im more interested in ensuring any overall solution local  new intel is well thought out than i am in making changes for the sake of it there are a number of things i would like to take forward from the assembly hall threads such as shared corp bookmarks assault frig bonuses rockets and the like but im not sure i would class those as pet projects either
you have my vote x2 good luck mate
mr dawnchaser nods vote gained and cast sir
actually ahs the pilot of an orca can make it so the people from the fleet can put things in the corp hangar bay but i dont believe they can take
correct currently a fleet can be configured to have put rights only on a ship that has corporate hangers id like to see the pilots of those ships have control over all corp hangers on the ship and specify which hangers have get and put rights in addition id like to see the orcarorq pilot have the ability to name those hangers and the name would be properly reflected to the fleet members regardless of which corp they are from ahs
i appreciate your positions and proposed changes im with ya
i didnt see any real issues of concern issues such as csm oversight new player experience revamp new content such as ships and ui overhaulwhether thats because the csms dont care about them or because the creator of the vote match website forgot them im not sure
i think it comes down to what you expect the questions to do a lot of the ones you list are rather boring ultimately do i want cool new ships you bet would i like to see the ui get overhauled of course the hard part would be finding a candidate thatd disagree with either of those statements when you phrase them generically this isnt designed to get at the csms motherhood and apple pie issues the ones where we all agree and the fight is just to sound more concerned than the other candidates the point of the site is to ask about questions where candidates disagree to try to shed light on the differences and aid voters in choosing polling the candidates to find out that were all antit20 and procsm doesnt help that at all
i fully support thisalso would like to see more statistics about the questions and answers after oting has closed 
ill do my best to provide this 
this was very helpful thank you
good luck korvin

youre so wrong changes to the scanner were 6 weeks before the fanfest the petition to revert the scanner nerf is august 20th check your facts before postingyou have no excuses 70 pages of people asking csm to talk to ccp about an issue and you talk about all sort of  except that only topic delibaretly ignoring requests of people that voted for you and therefore beeing fail
so now you lie to cover your ineptitude just wow scanner changes were introduced 2 months before fanfest
in the csms defence to my understanding it was the 20th of august the unnerf the scanner post was started and the meeting was on the 4th of september weekend  so that makes it under 2 weeks the fanfest was for clearing up one or two topics already brought up not for new topicsthat said however the csm has a strong history of ignoring the most supported topics in the assembly and ccp have a strong history of vetoing the topics that do manage to get through the csm filterthis pundits advice be patient but dont hold your breath work tenaciously at the foundations but do not bang your head against the wall watch the perspective and critical analysis of csm members wilt under the fury of the ccp meet and greet package as they transform into cringing fanboisnever give up  and vote abstain with all your accountsskunk
hurrrrrrapoc 15 which is when these changes made their debut was released on the 20th of august the csm summit which these minutes cover and was seperate to fan fest took place from the 3rd to the 4th of september i believe the final meeting we had where we were able to discuss issues to officially raise topics with ccp was some time at the start of august so yes while we did raise hell about it nothing was official and hence wont show on the minutesif you are going to continue to whine about the process but not educate yourself sufficiently about said process then you should probably go and stick your head in a gas oven in game and remove yourself from the gene pool in gameas i am no longer involved in the process i cant comment on it but it was brought up at fanfest and it has been raised officially i would dig it up but i cbai was just as unhappy as anyone else perhaps more so because i am by several orders of magnitude more competant with the scanner than im sure i a lot of you mouth breathers are recently i believe the delay has been changed to 13 seconds if thats as good as its going to get then i suggest you live with it the csm are not devs if the devs implement a change because of technicalserver issues scanner spamming was absolutely throttling the servers then thats their perogative if youre still unhappy then cancel your account the door is that way
you say it was raised at fansfest ok then what ccp said 
just read the minutes really glad to finally see them and there is a lot of insightful detail in there those meetings must be pretty hellish with so much to cover but anywayof concern to me is the fact that there were some action items requested of the csm by ccp wish lists for example im concerned and curious about how csm4 is going to ensure the ball doesnt get dropped on those are there internal mechanisms used and shared from one csm to the next to track such things
there is nothing about the scanner on the minutes moron thats why im asking i just want to know but you see that larkonis arrogant answer just quit the game so much for representing players thousands of people ask you to talk to ccp about 1 specific issue and after 3 months we still dont know anything and if you try to ask a simple question youre beeing a bell end about this
fyi i resigned my spot on the csm during the iceland summit and had no further dealings with anythingwith regards to fanfest there wasnt an official meeting so i dont think youll see anything official published there should have been some online meetings at some point or they are just around the corner with official answers regardless ill tell you now off the record and on the qt i personally cant see the changes getting rolled back i think 13 seconds is as good as its going to get given the choice between the servers getting throttled like a ginger stepchild or the rabid qqing of a significant minority i think ccp would rather have the tears tbh
excuse me youre calling me a moron in case you are just so you knowjust read the minutes was meant asi just read the minutes as in past tense where read rhymes with redit was not intended as a directive to you i wasnt even replying to you otherwise id have quoted you i was simply making a general observation about the availability of the minutes and the fact id just read them i got lazy while typing my thoughts and left off that apparently ohsovital pronounjeeze easy to see how it got misinterpreted but is namecalling really necessary in this discussion
bump for a good friend 
ive flown alongside darth in many campaigns throughout the years and can safely say hed be a credit to the csm
hay boz it is all part of being new not only to the game but to pvp it is the exact reason why i hold those eventsclasses see ya next time 07thank you for the post and the interview there is a bit of irony here zedrik cayne the other candidate you interviewed for that edition was the itreon of doom pilot that i mentioned in my interview the hulk vs iteron fight

signedprobs already been said but a super capital is an endgame ship designed to take 6 months to a year to construct and be ready to fly it ties up a characterit should not be avaible to young players coming into the game not that i have anything against new players they make good targets  a lot of of pilots have worked hard to be able to fly these ships and then ccp have gone you know what screw our loyal customer base whobe been with us for ages lets get everyone in these shipsincidentally i dont fly caps let alone supercaps i have no capital alts and have no intention of doing so

signedall those cap fight tests on the server for nothingdont expect the same people to turn up after thiswasting peoples time to help improve ccps money making ventureno good deed goes unpunishedit doesnt help when i see posts describing why its wrong disappearing

not even sure what to say about this crap idea stand by your original plan ccp i have long been a hater on motherships and the tools that have flown them yet now when you finally come up with a decent role for them you decide to poo yourself like dastommy at a strip club those of us that have sunk 1420 bill into the hull alone of one of these now flacid supercarriers are getting absolutly cd on i mean hell i wouldnt spend 7bil on this terrible idea so now i get to sell my twice as expensive mothership i already own at a huge loss i know i am just repeating the feelings of all those before me but damn ccp this is almost as bad of an idea as naming an alliance after bobby atlassuck on that

guys its best if along with this thread nought you also post in the stickied dominion super carrier feedback thread in the test server forum yes there is a 22 page rant threat with like 700 replies with like 20 people posting 30 timesso in the end not much whiners anywaybut post your constructive feed back in the stick thread provided by ccp as to why you think it would stink  what makes it stink what can be done to make it not stink not just your cancelling your accounts that doesnt help use your eve knowledge and experience and change their mindsalso i think a big issue is ccp programmers are lazy all it would take is a couple lines of code to separate bombers from fighters in terms of added drones per levelit used to say 3 additional fighters per level so this automatically translated to bombers they just need to cap the bombers at 10 and leave the fighters or buff bomber damage with a 10dmg and hit point increase and problem solved
brillant move ccpyouve changed them so that fbers cant even properly hit a carrierdreaddont even fly them and i think this is a stupid change

we should chat ingame sometime we have some things in common even if our play styles are at opposite ends of the spectrum best luck in your campaign 
i have yet to see any new arguments being made that havent been made many times over the last few years of struggling with this issuethe bottom line is that the alliances in fw issue isnt a new one its been one since before fw was turned on ccp has weighed in on the issue several times and in each of those times we were told that they would fix the situation so that alliances such as ours would no longer be barred from the rp war that weve been fighting for more than five years and that has since been largely usurped from usfor those who think that the currently proposed solution is reasonable consider that while ushrakhan  an alliance that has been fighting for matari freedom for five years  and cva  an alliance that has done more to reclaim space than the last dozen emperors have  will remain barred from joining the fight on the other hand the privateer alliance would be welcome to join the faction of their choice oin any case this thread isnt an issue thread its a request for information on candidates teadaze your opposition to representing my perspective in the csm is noted z0d and sokratesz your support for my concerns are likewise notedwould any other csm candidates care to voice their position
indeed no new argument for why this should be allowed past what has been agreed in principle thus nothing will changefirstly csm 3 and ccp have agreed that alliances could be allowed into fw you are therefore not being barred for any reason other than your own reluctance to give up your sov space in return youve been unwilling to explain why you think that is unreasonablepeople in factional warfare have concerns about large alliances steamrollering in should we ignore their concerns over yoursirrelevant argument uk and cva would be fully able to join fw under the agreed terms they just would have to make a choice between sov 00 and fwrp what have privateers got to do with anything have they tried to justify having cheaper war decs for some rp reason under the proposed solution any non sov holding alliance would be able to join fw providing they reach the standings requirement are you saying that they shouldnt be allowed because they dont rpif you give a good argument for why an alliance should be allowed into factional warfare as well as continue to hold sov then i would be happy to represent your position the problem is you keep rehashing the because weve been rping this war for 5 years and want special treatment linei could have taken the easy option and agreed to represent your position for free votes but im not that kind of person instead i gave my time to help you understand why csm 3 and ccp might have decided on the restrictions they did and give you the chance to respond with an updated proposal i even suggested a possible solution where youd be allowed to join if you had to open up your sov space to the militia you joinedif i get to the csm i would be happy to present this issue again as is but im honest enough to say i wouldnt vote for it without an update to explain why a sov holding alliance should be allowed to join fw and retain the benefits of both
as becq has requested that this should not become a deabte ill finish by saying the followingto me thats like asking why i should be able to run hisec missions while also ratting in 00it certainly was an outcome they would have known about full well they know who is pushing for access and they know that those two alliances hold sovthe arguments have been made by others repeatedly the question now is why should sov holding alliances be excluded ive not seen a convincing answeryou seem to ignore that we work for that 00 sov im not running for election
i see your point but it isnt comparable it would be more like the opposite fw militia asking to be able to capture your space without having to form an alliance remember you are trying to change the current behaviour but you are the ones wanting to make a change it isnt a matter of trying to find a reason not to make a change it is simply a matter of you giving a good reason why the change is warrantedi wasnt on csm 3 and at this rate i wont be on csm 4 either  but they decided that having sov while in fw was wrong and ccp agreed with them the ball is back in your court so make a strong case instead of gnashing teeth and pointing at 5 years of rp as to alleged bias against your alliances in particular again i cant speak for csm 3 but it does strike me that if alliances are allowed in fw it has to be any alliance that meets whatever criteria are required and fw people work for their sov you want to influence theirs but they cant retaliate against yours does that seem fair you gain the benefits of their work they cant gain the benefit of yours does that seem fairwhich is why i suggested an idea for allowing the militia you join to share your sov as you share their fw if anything that requirement would stop non rp alliances from joining fw so would be a benefit to your cause right im not the one trying to make a change to fw to allow alliances to join on their terms not the terms agreed between ccp and csm 3 im looking out for the factional warfare players at this point because until you as a group of sov holding alliances wanting to play in fw provide a good reason why you should have the ability to join fw while having the benefits of sov i dont see what the non alliance fw players gainat this point ive asked many times for a reason to support your aim and each time youve avoided the question im sure some candidates will jump at the chance to get easy votes and state that i am an idiot ive just been trying to point out that your case needs to be modified ill say again if you can point to one good reason for allowing alliances to hold sov while in fw then i would be happy to support youas the argument is going in circles ill say no more unless im misquoted etc or you supply that case for change
becq i think your issue is totally valid and in fact outside of csm ive been privately working on a player project to put the rp back into fw the combination of fw and rp is a great untapped opportunity for some awesome player experience not only for existing players but as a theme to bring more new players to the eve universe
if alliances can be in fw then fw corps can also form alliances i really dont get your them vs us which you keep bringing upkeep in mind in all this that we are also arguing that our arch enemies like cva should be allowed to join that would allow amarr fw corps to join cva its not all just for our benefit and i said repeatedly why i do not think holding sov is an issue eg at the top where i said one of our corps once had a sov claiming pos at a moon in one little system making us a sov holding alliancei do however respect your standing by your views lets leave it there
there is the cost and organisation involved and then it changes the dynamics a fair bit if it becomes say four big fw alliances rather than a loose association of individual players and corps i got the impression that ccp view fw more for casual players than sov 00 and thus would like to keep the two separatedfrom an rp point of view it makes perfect sense for cva and uk to represent their factions but much as i respect both alliances for what they have added to the game even though cva have us set red  i dont feel rp alone is a good enough reason to make gameplay changesif there are other ways to improve the rp that dont require game balance changes then id be happy to support those proposals we agree to disagree on this specific issue if i make it into csm 4 i look forward to more healthy debates and maybe supporting you in other matters
1 create new corp outside of your alliance2 join that corp3 enlist corp into fw4 5 profittada you can now go fw as a corp rather than an alliance or just drop out of your corp and go join the npc fw corpccp has said no on the sov holding alliance but they have still left you a way to enter fw
i cant support this as such what you are asking is to be able to do both 00 alliance warfare and fw in the same context that is from the same alliance that kind of ruins the idea of fw as a stepping stone into 00 warfarewhat i would support is a fw variant for alliances that would allow them to ally with a major faction and get lp for killing alliances loyal to the opponent alliances or something along those lines but not get automatic access to fw in its current formi cant support an idea that would allow 00 alliance of highly skilled players to go on a killing spree in fw and get lps for that without some practical barriers
what is this fw is a stepping stone into 00 nonsense by keeping a rigid wall between fw and the rest of eve you are creating the opposite effect divorcing the two sandboxes completely whats needed is the existence of player structures that cross into both spheres allowing players to test the waters in both without having to quit one to try the other in much the same way that there are currently alliances that are empireonly nullseconly and split between the two the same should exist for fw existing members of the militia could either remain independant join a friendly alliance or create their own fwonly alliance if this seems like too many people in too small a spere of conflict then expand fw to the remaining regions of lowseclps lps lps who gives a flip about lps im a freedom fighter i want to kill slavers and free my people the bottom line is this the 24th imperial crusade is attacking my brethren and im sick of being prevented from fighting back id do it for free if i was allowed to

how time flies  its term 4 of the csm and ive decided to run again for those of you that dont know me i was vice chairman of the 1st csm my main platform at that time is what it remains today i offer the eve community mycapabilities at assessing and refining issues raised by players and fellow council members in particular bringing an independent balanced view to all issuescredibility ability to deliver on plans during csm 1 i was elected as vice chairman i have a long proven experience of big changes to the game from eve strategic maps running alliances corporations and launching the first public ipos to the economycredibility qualified playerplaying eve since 2003 with 5 accounts has given me a deep knowledge of almost all game mechanics this enables me to predict sideeffects or benefits of proposed issues this includes eg pvp sologangfleetblob pve mission running manufacturing from moonroidnpc to finished ships and modules t1t2t3 pos 00 infrastructure outposts corp alliance pirating being suicide ganked wars faction warfare npcing mission runnning and research i do have a gap in my experience in invention and wormhole life but know enough players who do both these activities to gather balanced viewscapability qualified professionalwith 20 years of professional experience in it and internet at a seniorstrategic level and relevant experience to csm in the areas of leadingparticipating in committees teams and working groups mentoring and training managers and consulting on internet strategy process management and change managementduring my working time i created eve strategic maps which is used by ccp employees themselves ive also appeared in documentaries to advocate eve online to current nonplayers another perfect world for the last 3 months ive been doing private study on game design and am working on private business venture for a new mmo i was at the game developers conference europe to get the lowdown on the dust514 launchbelief in eve playersi have a strong belief that players have the capabilities ideas and ingenuity to make changes in how we experience the game through emergent play without sweeping changes from ccpeg dominion while thankfully hopefully solving the pos boredom was not necessary to break the alliance stagnation in 00 space it is possible for players to achieve this through self organisationwhat we players do need from ccp is support for game mechanic and particularly social networking tools to enhance the player abilities eg eve banks ipos alliance organisation tools spacebook api key access and of course the individual balance issues which have been highlighted by players from csm1 to csm3 this will become increasingly important as dust514 is integrated to new eden in 2010vote or do you want to know morevote serenity steele or post a questions here youre also welcome to evemail or convo me ingame

and again vote for me if your voice needs to be heard by ccp
by voting for me for csmim not going to let any of the great ideas generated in here make it to the table without serious consideration of possible unintended consequenceswhile eve has some weaknesses it is generally a great game and one that we all enjoy constant monkeying around with game mechanics and rules creates more problems than it solves this is always done with the aim of changing the patterns of behavior that players have settled into in order to improve things however look no further than other oncegreat mmos that are now garbage like ultima online or star wars galaxies to see how those efforts usually turn outim not here to push forward some agenda or advocate sweeping changes that i think will make eve more funbetterwhatever im here to stop morons from ruining the party we already enjoyvoting is now open vote today
1 vote for you logiti played swg back in the day and let me tell you forum asshats ran that game right into the ground and they used the elected player advisory council to do itterrible idea even having one if you ask me
butthat is 90 of being a politician and the remaining 10 is technically illegal

i voted for you this morning best of luck mate
you will make a good politician making statements with no reference to any examples within the gameso could we have some examples pleaseand exactly how do you intend to police the forums for ideas which are a natural part of anything in life define moron is it someone who puts across an idea you do not like or one that is unworkabledo you support patching and are they always baddo you dislike game analyses and discussionhow do you define if a game mechanic is broken or nothow do you define a great idea and how are unindented consequences established and quantifieddo you consider those that whine about whiners are whiners

yes they need some more love black ops have great abiblities that comes with alot of skills that u need to train the currenty form of black ops just dont make it worth training buying them for 800m and use them
hawt supporting this
black ops do need alot of love before they will be used in any great numbers i personaly think they should be based on more dps as they are more like hit and run ships sneaking up on someone then hitting them round the back of the head with a hammer comes to mind but but at the moment they cant do hit and run because they can only fit a normal cloak instead of a covert opsthey are stuck waiting at gates instead also i wouldnt mind them being given a role bonus od 99 reduction in fitting needs of warfare links for a second role of fc ship for a covert fleet
i support any bo boost the prenerf needs to be removed the range is meh but ok its a battleship not a cap leave it skill intensive that will prevent mass proliferationtheyre not going to be solopwnmobiles but will be useful any solo bo will remain a juicy target300350mil is a good target cost do this then unnerf it at least the sin and panther
i was honestly shocked when i looked at there combat capabilities i do not fly one but the fact that they have ess powergrid for fitting less hp makes them made of paper and less guns means they cannot even stand up to regular dirt cheap battleship in combat and they cost about a bill give em proper stats please
supporting this greatly i drool at watching old fraps movies where the blinding light tunnels totally lit up the room yes i like to play in teh dark ive also noticed amongst other that the gallente railgun effects from dreads look  compared to earlier and also the retraction effects on teh guns are not there either yes it is not needed but still cool who changed this and why honestly stupid
symbollogo would be better spelled out alliance names on spaceships are good if youre a delivery service symbols are cooler
hell yes do wantwould be nice if agony could have our alliance logo back too it is still in game but was not attached to the recreated alliance after a billing issue

yes please
would like to see ui overhaul but specifically for drones
theres really no chance this wont get changed its just a matter of when
low skilled pilots will get blown to pieces anyway if they go in alone i have no trouble with people letting lower skilled corp mates join in on the fun its just another thing that will keep them excited about eve i cant find any negatives for this im all for it
after doing some research i couldnt find any similar proposal if it does exist please provide a link to it as im curious about why its this wayi think that we should be able to see outside a station before we undock it makes no sense at all that capsuleers flying around in ships and cargo worth fortunes have to venture out in space where no law enforcement is present without even having the option to look through the stations window or give the control tower a call to see if there arent any pirates campingif the game already allows protection for player jumping through gates by cloaking them after jumping what is the logic behind leaving them vulnerable at stationsthis could be implemented by having players coming out of stations cloaked as if coming out of a gate or having the option of docking back in before they are vulnerable maybe there could be a radius around the station where aggression isnt allowed the station would assume concords role in a way im way to novice of a player to suggest really educated ways of implementing a change in the game but as it is right now it feels like eve is telling me i shouldnt be able to see or know what the weather is like before i step out of my house thats obviously ridiculousin any case id be really interested in knowing the rationale behind that mechanic of the game

supportedgreat ideas 
i suggest learning skills be remove and just add the points to everyones totals honestly it doesnt do much but act as a hassle and a turnoff for new players they have to train skills for a month to reasonably be able to train more skills serves no purposeit would also cost the community nothing if you have 30 milliion sps youll have a 315 million sp advantage on them by the time they train the skills up no difference really and we get them into the game a month earlier with a steep learning curve and a lot of training ahead of them this will make the game a little more accessible from the start and make it more likely for them to stick aroundnote before i get flamed i have two accounts both are a couple years old and both have learning skills trained already
so you want to give people a sp boost when they start but the make training in the rest of gametime much slower thumbs down
as i cant find the thread atm learning skills are good as is if you want the faster training time you train them a little or fully if you dont you can still achieve your goals just a bit slowerwhat should be banned from the game is you have to train learning skills to this level before you can do anything else this is just plain wrong and stupid and that discourages new players i tell all my friends who start with eve start a bit with the learnings and put skills in that get you new things to try so they get a new module or better module every few days and inbetween their learning skills go upnot supported obviously
no this is not world of warcraft people need to spill blood to get soemthink not to obtain it for free
oh no not again big no to this dumb idea
dead horse meet stick thwack thwack thwackthe hassle and turn off to new players isnt learning skills its the crappy advice people give them surrounding the learning skillsnew player hi i just started what should i do firstold player zomg train yur learningz to over 9000 immediatelyionenew player zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz quitfrankly learning skills need to be discussed in detail in the npe along with a tutorial on how to properly train them theres no need for a new toon to train all the learning skills to 54 or 43 before they set foot in a shipunless its an alt and then you should be smart enough to figure out what you needmy recommendation train the basics to 3 then start working on the skills you want for the game get the ability to fly a frigate fairly well or to mine to be research or whatever before you even think of coming back to themgetting all five base skills to a 3 will take about as long as it takes to complete the new player experience and the first epic arc assuming you also train the freebie skills they give you to level 1 when they hand them out at that point you have a decent smattering of base skills as well as a good head start on your learning skills and youre not even half way through your bonus periodpeople arent quitting eve because of learning skills people are quitting eve because of the bad advice given tot hem by other players about learning skills
i guess the question i would have is what purpose do they servenone that i can see but whatever
ive said this before and ill say it againeve has enough players that ccp doesnt need to act in desperation to coddle newbies so that more will stick aroundlearning skills are fine move along
dont train them if you dont see a purpose nobody is forcing you
your ghey if you dont want them dont buy and train themthey serve a purpose if a player wants to progress further he can put some time aside to train them up a level every so often
wowthe nerd rage on these forums is pathetic get a life folks log off your computers every once in a while and you might not be so angry at the worldjust sad
op is right rest of you are wrong nuff said
looks more like op cant take criticismmaking a game too conveniant just kills the motivation ive already seen that on another mmo and dont want to see that mistake againdisagree
precisely
coming from the person who keeps coming back to his alredi dieing post of bullshti only log off my computer when your mum is puttin some out which dont happen often coz shes probably deadim harsh live with it
thats right let it all out youll feel better its ok to cry
ok  it its not working lol
effort vs rewarddo you prefer instant gratification or spending time effort to train learning skills firstboth ways are good it is all about giving people choices
im against this idea im a new player and learning skills dont discourage me from playing the game i think it gives an advantage to people who are wise enough to invest in those skills delaying immediate gratification for an improved gain in the future just like it is in real life actuallyfunnily enough studies have found that kids of kinder garden age who have been able to wait before eating a candy in exchange for getting more candy later have much less chance of holding criminal records 20 years later stupid people yeah im saying criminals are stupid or those who got caught and have a record anyway cant control their urgesif anything id suggest that learning skills give more bonuses so that the effect for the long term player is even greater
no not now not ever they are not mandatory just some idiots think they should be trained right off the bat which is wrongthey should be trained at a time suited to the individual
the use of the term lubricant is worse than bad why not just call it fuelthe general idea though is fairly well thought out actually providing a rationale is rare on these forums
as part of a bigger overhaul this sounds like a good plan
more drone pilots wanting things to be done for them and have everything automatedwhy cant i tell my torpedoes to automatically fire at the nearest battleship and why wont my smartbomb automatically go off when drones are attacking me how come i cant afk jump through nullsec knowing that my invuln fields will come on automatically my ship will warp to a safespot that it generated itself and it will cloak up whenever the local count goes up by more than 2 in 10 secondsseriously i hate having drone ships in my fleet because they always refuse to control the drones manually granted part of the fault goes to ccp for having a horrible drone control interface but thats what needs to be fixed dont add even more automation to the drones just make it less of a pain in the ass to control them
a little zen to start my replyone of the biggest parts of battlecombat is the chaos that follows remove the chaos and you are left with administrative work a better and more logical solution would be to have the drones aggression lists sort by size ex a light drone targets an aggressed frigate first even if a bs is above it on the list
drones do missmissiles get massive damage reduction on moving targetstry again
pft typical ad hominems right off the bat even if its not the offical wiki i admit my mistake heh it still doesnt erase the fact that the only advantages of minmatar ships acknowledged officially are speed and versatility speed of course has been nerfed a lot of times in past revisions not to mention what use is having a level v mwd skill on a battleship or a nagglfar other races advantages continue on regardless of shipsize ours end at battlecruiser levelanything above battlecruisers for minmatar sucks and anything below are mediocre or outclassed by other ships in other races except perhaps vagas and the aforementioned cane which performs about as well as drakes and harbingers for shield tanking sure the phoon can be awesome if youre 5 years old and have a gazillion sp compare this with the range of ship choices in other races most often used effectively in pvpversatility is just one way of saying you have to train for shield and armor and never come close to how effectively the other races tank the skill requirement to even come close to achieving what can be achieved in a few months in other races ships is mindboggling sure were versatile might as well say we have to train everything under the sun if we want to be good pilots or be content being a miner or a solo pirate not to mention despite the claim of versatility ship bonuses only affect one type of weapon while still forcing the fitting of the obligatory missile launchersi do not mine at all i supplement my pvp forays with missionrunning so the comment on failfitting a cane is uncalled fordrones miss yeah but theyre capless ammoless independent only instances they miss is if you release fightersheavies on an interceptormissiles get massive reductions on moving targets yeah but they always hit when in range that is and majority of pvp situations youre always in range not to mention the moving targets thing only applies again for smaller ships since battleships and such are pretty much sitting ducks and add a tackler into the fray which is pretty much standard in fleet ops and that advantage is taken away modules meant to stop speed are far more abundantly used than modules meant to counter drones or missiles or punch through armorshieldboth also do not have the very very narrow falloff range of projectile guns fit acs and if your enemy gets too far theyre useless fit arties and if your enemy gets too close or move too fast theyre uselessand yes this is a raaaaaaaaaaageee post lol i guess i just got very frustrated yesterday trying to come up with maelstrom fit that even comes close to tanking 1000dps and still deal decent dps at all level v in eft one of the fits got at around 20 omni another averaged at 300 omni and i looked over at my 3 month old corpmates myrm with a 1300dps tank and went a little crazyhow much longer do i have to train to get that or is the answer actually never unless i buy expensive deadspace stuffif you did it pics or it never happenedi found an old thread from back in february detailing this more
your whole damn post is an adhominemill gladly take any minmatar ships off your hands being a minmatar pilot myselfobvious troll post op is 310
having fought primarily matari hulls using only amarr ditto the past year and a half i can say with great conviction that you are wrongrifter thrasher rupture claw are downright unbalanced and a grid reduction is needed to bring them in lineonly ships in game able to fit oversized buffers while being able to fit correct sized guns  tackledrivemodstabber hurricane cyclone rapier vagabond  hell all subbs ships are top of the pile odd one is being muninn compared to other racesmataris only bad ship size are bs and even there they have the mighty typhoon plus with changes coming the whole lineup receive a massive boost so very much an unwarranted complaint
cool story bro
i started to train for minmatar ships from originally being focused at flying gallente  caldari ships well i still fly those too but the secret behind my way of playing is simply being able to adapt what i want to field depending on what has been asked forthe different races surely has specific advantages even down to a single ship area there used to be a time when vagabonds were extremely great for speed and damage all together but as mentioned previously in the thread vagabonds has suffered greatly amist other ships from speed reduction they simply lost their cutting edge and instead of making a somekind of balance to the field ccp decided to do it the easy way yet again pure nerfhowever i must say that minmatar ships can dish out some nice dps volley i fly hurricanes and munins on regular basis and they are wicked when it comes to alpha strike so i cant agree on a 100 percent basis that minmatar is suffering to much and as far as ive learned there will be a boost on the minmatar damage output areaif i am mistaken i apologize but there has been a post about changes on this issueon a overall basis i must say that active tanking ingame is its not even close to what a decently setup fleet of hp buffed ships with logistics support can do on the fieldalso note that ccp has made several nerfs that has inflicted greatly on the solo pvp scene positive effects of this is forcing players to act on a group based idea instead of flying about on their ownthe downside is that alot of the unique advantages alot of the shipshave had is gone and tends to make the game alot more dull and less difference in how ships stick out compared to one anotherthis is however not an entirely 100 percent accurate comment but still it has some coverage to what has happened in eveit also worth mentioning that the result of each major nerf has only resulted in players finding new means of what ships and formations tactics is the i win tactic in combat this is a pretty natural development but its unfortunately that the common result has been that it ends up with ccp nerfing because something sticks out and is actually effective and puts a challenge to the game for others to break i hope for more balancing terms of problem solving in the future instead of simply making ships more crappy because they have a good advantage in certain situationsits simply a situation of improving or the other way around
you dont have to rent an office to get things out of impound its been a while since ive had to deal with this but i know that you can simply pay an impound fee without renting an office its usually significantly less than the value of whatever has been impounded youre essentially buying their assets and a very reduced price an option to just trash it would be nice though if i remember correctly a director or ceo will have to fly to the location where the assets are held and attempt to open the corp hangar youll be told that the corp doesnt currently have an office there or something and youll be given the option to pay the impound fee to retrieve the items like i said its been a while but i know you can get the items without paying a rental fee
i believe impound fees are based upon the office rental fee which makes it extremely high in places plus the requirement for a director or ceos physical presence is annoying perhaps the change to allow the corp the option to transfer these items to either the trash or to deliveries would work just somewhere where the items can be disposed of or moved easier
see limting napfestssadly it seems people dont want to discuss possible changes to the corpalliance standings methods
trolls they never learnalso sort by corp ticker
i cant see ccp ever beeing able to put in the hardware to deal with big fleet fights so im just trying to suggest something
unfortunately what youre suggestion wont handle the problem people are far more adaptable than you seem to be giving them credit for and they will find a way to do exactly what they want to do regardless of the system limitations ccp puts in their waythis is especially true where it concerns standings and the like heck i could put together a webapplicaiton that you could run through the igb that would let you type in a pilots or corps nameticker and it would give you back a shootdont shoot  it would probably take about a day to write it at that point its the same thing  an in game method of seeing who you can and cant shoot shrugs
currentbattlecruiser skill bonus 10 increase to drone hitpoints and damage dealt by drones and 75 increase to armor repair amount per level99 reduction in the cpu need of warfare link modules change to battlecruiser skill bonus 10 increase to drone hitpoints and damage dealt by drones and 75 increase to armor repair amount per level99 reduction in the fitting need of drone control unit modules someone with advanced drone interfacing 5 which is all of 3 people in all of eve because the use of drone control units right now is just a terrible ideathis change would make myrm lose 5 highslots to the drone control units so less guns but you get to control 10 drones  75mbit 5mediums 5 lights
this is an incredibly insightful proposition that is sure to at last fix the myrm
no i would suport this if it was about givin back the myrms 125 mb band width as well as the dcus but with just the dcu bonus and 75m3 bandwidth u dont hav enough drones 2 fieldnot suported
perhaps this would make up for when it lost its 5 heavies finally
my dislike for a lot of the politics of 00 aside you dont have addressed the points i raised about the effect of reducing the mineral need in any meaningful wayalmost no one will ever mine veldspater in 00 unless they get the same return that they will get mining bistot but if that was implemented in some way miners will protest about the low value of bistot not be happy about the high value of veldspater the only half feasible way to do that would be the 500 yield veldspater that someone suggest increasing 00 asteroid yield by a reasonable percentage could help miners and indirectly help industrialists as more high ends will be available but it will not remove the need to import tritanium if all the asteroids are boosted the same wayreducing mineral requirement for items production in 00 will fatten the industrialist wallets but will not help 00 miners probably it will damage themalmost certainly it will not increase the number of ship produced in a significant way unless the number of pilots increase you can use only 1 ship at a time and there is a limit to the number of ships most people will want to keep in reserve to asurii disagree with most of your suggestions moderate increase in mineral yield is acceptable for me even if i think that ccp approach with access to more hidden sites with better ore if you install the upgrades is a better way getting more than 100 minerals from refining no as a corollary allowing 100 refiningreprocessing in pos and stations with normal level of skills yes reduced mineral cost to produce ships in 00 noreduced production time could be a good option  invention bonus i dont like it but cant decide if it a bad idea or not i think it would squash empire invention with plenty of people researching in 00 and then moving the bpc in high sec to produce probably instead of making life in alliance space easier it will make wormhole invention the way to go with hundreds of almost invulnerable research pos in low level wormhole systems  missions changes another uncertain idea i dont like much your suggestionsif ccp get over the problems of putting agents in conquerable stations or in space they already have them but apparently there is a problem with allowing them to give a range of missions today they have only one specific mission and scripted follow up an upgrade adding agents to 00 space with missions better tailored for 00 would be goodnote that ccp is implementing pirate storylines with missions tailored for interceptors af and hac with level 4 or more rewards but storylines have a limited usage as after completing one you have a several months cool down period so those mission can help but arent the solution
i think this deserves a bump
this doesnt need fixing theres enough agents who send you to oncorp storylines that anyone can do it that way if they want to
i would like to tie issue 2 to tactical overlay for 2 reasons1 currently it is not of much use anyways so improving the feature should be alright2 as i imagine it the sole purpose of tactical overlay is display of tactical information like who is warp scrammingjamming what and thats not what is currently happening so when i click tactical overlay all the remote effects and ewar should be highlighted adn displayed using hud
im gonna say signed but only as a one time thing that should balance it
not signed  thats why ccp gives you 2 alts
i support this just to give players who created silly names another chance and so i dont see as many of those names floating around space i think limiting its usage or if you like charging for its usage would counter most ill effects
not supported my name is annoying as people read it as  you twenty two but you just deal with itwant a new name do what others have suggested and sell ur character and buy a new one via the char bazaar forumcase closed imo
title says it allid like to be able to right click  show info  and get the cargo  fitting  drone bay of my docked ships in the assets panel
supportedstealthwhineand while were at it make the assets panel actually show us all our assets not just the fricking containers holding themstealthwhine
i believe that ccp has said that this was something that theyre going to do for ships in the same station as you but that it was impractical for ships in other stations not perfect but its a start
i like this idea a lot
yup they dont offer enough reward for the immense risk thats involved with doing them death from boredom
as a level 4 mission runner this idea is laughablenot supported
sorry having done level 4s i think the risk versus reward is about on par with what it should be doing them with pretty much no threat to me and my afk dominix i can earn close to 70 to 75 as much as i do killing rats in 00 with loads higher risk to myself seems about on par for solo money earning to me
if boost you mean boost the difficulty of a lvl4 mission then im all for it

the problem with mining is the boredom not the profit mining isnt great money in highsecand its total garbage in lowsec which i think does need to be fixed but its quite nice in 00 for example mineral prices are really low right now but i think thats a temporary state of affairs if they come back up which i expect will probably happen the incomes are reasonable for a lowintensity activity like mining id prefer to eliminate boredom not pay players to bore themselves even more most 00 players already need to pve sometimes as it is the thing is right now their best bet is to do it with an altjc in highsec because 00 income is actually kind of weakand certainly way more annoying than highsec missions id like to see 00 cater to the risktolerant not just the risklovers 00 will never be a carebear wonderland nor should it be but it should offer a nice big incentive to bring people out not just the promise of getting bubbled popped and podded every once in a while to spice up your day the natural way of relieving pressure on npc lines is to set up your own at a pos the problem with that right now is as much as anything that pos mechanics are terrible if they were fixed such that you could sell lines publicly for example the lack of npc lines would be nearly irrelevant the problem isnt the lack of lines its the lack of ability for players to create their own for sale i dont own any t2 bpos in fact im an inventor myself  if you look on jitas market right now the stack of 26 broadswords for sale is mine the reason it doesnt need to become more profitable is that its already plenty profitable for most items theres a lot of workskillmoneyexcel involved but if you have the ability to do it right the rewards are substantial its not in any need of a buff just about every candidate has rl responsibilities as well as usually some big ingame ones that doesnt prevent them from doing the job csm is a big responsibility but its not a huge time sink in the grand scheme of things  im not running for parliament here ill have to keep up with the forums and talk to players but i do that right now anyways and thats most of the time needed i can spare a few hours every sunday for a meeting  i spent the same amount of time this summer playing baseball and it hardly ruined my life
ive known herschel since before i was a csm candidate let alone a delegate while we do tend to butt heads on some issues he doesnt endorse or reject anything without thoroughly thinking it through he is also very active in the forums and interested in making this game better for everybodyi must admit that i did not vote for him because another candidate fit some of the issues better in the voter match and has a platform that appeals to me but this should not be interpreted as thinking herschel will do a bad job or anything of the sort of all the candidates running i think he is the most devoted to boosting this game
a fair point but what do you suggestas with the current changes there is hardly such incentive what do you think should be done about it imo the moons were what drove 00 at the strategic level made it tick thats mostly gone nowsounds like a great solution that ccp will never implement as they are afraid to touch anything related to pos and acl codelets see we are on the same page here setting the owners of t2 bpo aside for a second there is no reason to keep them it would be better for everyone else to get rid of them sure invention took its place and people will start talking about volumes etc but there still are some low volume markets dominated by t2 bpo holders where they do cope with the demand other legacy isk faucets are also being touched why not t2 bpos so the question remains how to reduce the pain to the holders id say turn the bpos into bpcs with 12 years worth of runs thats nearly the value of what they are being traded forim pretty sure youll make it to csm and i wish you good luck there
the moon rebalance was overdue for several reasons some of which you mentioned but together with dominion there are some pretty negative sideeffects also your answer shows that you never really lived in 00 like you said yourselflike many pointed out in the comment thread from the devblog on the 00 system upgrades the problem is not so much the nerfing of moons or the necessity to downsize the space held and player numbers the problem is that it changes how life is lived in 00 changes the goals for leadership to something much less dynamic and interesting as well as for the average 00 grunt yes there are lots of complaints about the income possibilities of the alliance being greatly nerfed while income possibilities at the personal level being increased a little but still not on par with empire  most upgrades are a joke but that is not my beef most 00 dwellers have an empire mission alt anyway to be able to sustain them being in 00what was good about the moongold is that you could do pvp to ensure your alliances income now you have to do pve to accomplish the same i think that sums up what the problem is with the changes the large scale conflicts and strategic fleet fights die with dominion there wont really be fights for space there will be so many unclaimed systems so well have only the fungangs roaming around that is if everyone is not set bluewhen you say the increased amount of ratters will mean more targets for pvpers thats almost a troll and not fun for either sidenow onto a different subject like larkonis i also think it seems ankh is still pulling the strings id like to know on which subjects you and ankh disagree if there is any
this guy knows what hes talking abouthes got my voteviva la zod
it was long overdue and will open up lots of opportunities to others off course as it may please a lot of people who dont have access to those high grade moons it has the opposite effect as you mentioned on those that do have them much less demands via the global components required to build t2 ships essentially anything below jump freighters on a global scale across all empire racesas i have seen from all the different patches on sisi which i have spent time on in the last 2 months i did a lot of number crunching comparing bpos material requirements and the time to build for some new highly increased components which has changed on bpos between different builds as we are getting closer to dominions release we can also see the mass market panic with many moon related products spiking up in anticipation as well with every build on sisi which have so far been slowly introduced to avoid mass market speculations on global needed products on tranquilityi have some friends in a few major alliances that have essentially told me the same thing regarding those costs as being prohibitive even so just for basic sovereignty it is meant for massive changes and may also force people out with its prohibitive costs and still be very hard for smaller groups to maintain sustainability for sovereignty hopefully those costs will get rebalanced to phase the major changes so they are not so hard for current residents and over a longer timeankh and erik are both helping me in the campaign as we all have in the previous elections we have a lot of different experience on different areas of the game we have different views on the same things that we commonly know but seeing them from different point of views enables us to come out with more constructive ideas when working as a team
why are all take care candidates always proxies for ankh that have no real experience with pvp centric aspects of this game
maybe because there is more to pvp that pewpewing starships in spacez0d seems to realize this maybe that is why it is with ease he gathers support
calling z0d a proxie for ankh really shows youre clueless about the guy if you are into silly conspiracies it is more likely that ankh and erik have been a proxy of z0d all along that would make much more senseeven though ive been with major 00 alliances and fw ive still voted for z0d there is always an overabundance of 1337 pvpers on the council i rather have someone there that sees the big picture instead of only their tiny niche playstyle
awesome guy perfect for the jobhe actually denied running pres for out country last year
just on general principle im not voting for anyone named elvenlord that is ridiculousno i did not read the candidate blurb nor will i
i just wanted to say that ive already voted for teadaze based on the planet risk interview i think your platform and comments were spot on and represent my own position regarding the direction of the csm best of luck to you and all the candidates lastly im looking forward to the fc seminar on saturday
vote for teadaze  because he cares he is intelligent and he is not in anyones pocketstea you got my vote
it would indeed be a good idea to get the information hosted somewhere where you dont need registration facebook and other such sites wax and wane with the times and the competitors are too numerous to assume that everyone in the world has an account on it public information like this should be well public
smae here i ran into the wall of facebook registration so your information isnotpublic please change the op to include this info or link to a real public page
this is a useful tool for some candidates but not all i would like to use it but it doesnt cover alot of issues that i am promoting and it will not correctly refect my viewst
i view it as kinda sad that only 49 accounts out of 300k are willing and eligible to run for csm
if you take the time to go through the list and click the links of the candidates as i have done youll discover there are not 49 web sites to look at most of the links go nowhere or nowhere that provides csmrelated info about the candidate a quick hover with the pointer over the links will reveal this i discussed the signal to noise ratio in my blog when the candidates list was announced after eliminating the obvious jokers followed by the ones with uninformative campaign statements and no useful web link there are maybe a dozen candidates i would characterize as serious and worth considering
the main effect that weve seen over the last few years is that its not so much a matter of people reviewing the candidates as the candidates campaigning to the voters not in the forums but actively via alliances corporations podcasts and being known for previous activities and accomplishments in the game eg look at the past people running universities leading communities making fansites blogging making media videos this isnt a lot of activitythat said if 1020 of the player base read the forums then theyre probably not reading this section that would amount to 30k  60k votes which typically arent seen

the formation of the sandbox preservation party is seen by some a ray of light in a dimming universe while others view it as an extremist organization if not utter bsand thats coolbut what they fail to realize is that there are players and csm candidates out there looking to do away with what is viewed as criminal practices in evecase in pointin the latest episode of planet risk the hosts interviewed several csm candidates one of which was stormaxe titanothere5148 into the show quivering palm poses the questionwe have seen a lot of suggestions being posted in the assembly hall has there been a single suggestion that made you think to yourself boy if i were elected to the council thats the first thing that im going to push and if so which one suggestion is that and why5600 stormaxe respondsone of the things that i know that i really would like to see kind of at the top of my list is salvaging thieveshe then goes on to talk about how he thinks that salvaging in its current implementation is really just a relic of a mechanic from several years ago should be considered akin to can flipping and thus salvagers gain aggro from salvaging mission wrecksthe sandbox preservation party supports salvaging in its current implementation meaning the salvage found in a wreck belongs to the first person that gets to it for the simple fact that it is more conducive to an openended universe we do not support mission runners having ownership of the salvagepersonally i pray to be shot at when i am salvaging a mission as i loot every single mission that i scan down thats my playstyle though and not all ninjas will loot i just like to kill mission runners some ninjas will only collect salvage from the wrecks  again salvage that has no legal owner until it is in your cargo holdthe fact of the matter is that given the opportunity 95 of mission runners will not shoot at a ninja salvager even if they do have aggro rights they simply wont do it i wouldnt expect them to start shooting if the salvage ownership mechanics were changedanyway yes csm candidates are working to change the mechanics of salvaging stormaxe is not alone in his thinking however hes just one of many that think the same way all you have to do is browse the eve o forums a bit to find an instance where someone is working to take away your options in the sandboxsave the sandbox power to the players logit probit for csm4
it is important to remember that the only functions that alliance mechanic provides are easy management of standings  consolidated wardecsand later the ability claim sovereignty access to jump bridgesprior to the implementation of the alliance mechanic there were many functional alliances within eve stain alliance  bob to name a few almost all alliances went further to create holding corps to manage alliance finances as there is no supported game mechanic for alliance wallettake all this together with the introduction of treaties soontm and we have a mechanic for dealing with this without allowing alliances into fw setup an alliance holding corporation which is the alliance provide treaties to all the fw corporations and manual management of interfw corp standingslooking at this whole description its a workaround so the question becomes what could be done to make it easyeg by providing a supporting feature mirror standings of corporation x ie the holding corporation you would have alliances in fwif a lot of alliances are structured in this way it would show its important to eve players and therefor get support for game mechanics to make it easier so 2 options  the csm as i would can support mechanic solutions now and there is a way to achieve it today to show support from a player perspective

good points please see my response below1 clear communicationevery csm since csm1 has asked for ccp to address this issue there are several distinct areas that imo need to be made clearer and particularly fasterday to day working publishing of minutes clear list of issues tagged categorized indexed and searchable voting history of council members on issuesmulticsm continuity final prioritization agreed with ccp for agile backlog working methods used eg the submission template i created in csm1 candidate scores participation and if relevant previous issue voting historyccp has historically been unable to provide the tools with the reason being given that the web site does not support it in reality it is most likely needed for the csm themselves to organise a tool and present the data this is what i hoped the wwwevecsmcom website would be used for it is probably the case that i just need to do it myself and if elected to csm will put in the time to do this hell if not elected im tempted to do it anyway for the benefit of the community2 bountiesbounty hunting as a profession in fact the whole bounty system is indeed a flawed game mechanic it has long been the case that any serious bounty placed on a character is simply recovered by one of the players alts or friends furthermore the tools available for bounty hunting vs the rewards are fairly limited yes you can use mission agents to find the intended target but it requires cooperation of many peopleaccounts to score the hit this is particularly a profession i would like to get more love as it also provides a marketdriven solution for industrialists who are on the receiving end of piracy or aggression generally but dont have the social network to motivate punitive measures market based systems imo are a great solution to these kind of issues3storylineim not sure if you are aware that in 2008 there was a massive amount of work done on the storyline arcs which was leaked by a volunteer and the whole 115years work had to be thrown away to stop the potential insider trader effect ccp have been working hard to restore a storyline arcs but iirc arent there yet what i would personally prefer to see is more player development of storylinesarcs with the support of ccp for example in the early days of eve it was fairly typical to see a gm played character performing in live mission events for players based on realtime events of player alliances within the game there are many opportunities to develop this in line with faction warfare and i support these developments personally i dont read the chronicles as im more interested in the social networks and developments of the players what we need here is more tools ambulationwis promised layer scripting of npcs in stations with missions which sis something i would like to see soon
hey hey50 mil and its yoursill also name drop you in corp and alliance multiple times during any csm candidate discussions   buy buy buy 1st 50mil to either hit my wallet or csm candidate to reply to this thread with payment and you get my vote and as many as i can entice
sorry i just spent 10bil buying everyone elses votes
eve is a cold dark machiavellian place  buying votes fits perfectly in the universe we call new edensend money now   
always a possibility however in my opinion if this is implemented everyone should get the same bonus and not get a new skill you have to train before starting to fly carriers
adding actual support in digital thumbs since the first post was lacking in thumbs for some reason
if this can be done without increasing lag do want
im totally not supporting this cause verone will pod me otherwise  nope i actually have thought something like this would be great forever
yes pls
yes please i can see ccp going meh but i dont care
confirming i am one of few not a veto memberalt that is responding hereoh and i support aswell pretty amarr logo on my vexor plz for sheer irony factor
its a good idea  not sure why its only veto supporting  have a thumbs up from jericho
seeing as this was promised about 2 years ago and still not delivered  i fully endorse this idea
this would be so cool
would be a nice addition to eve
i cant remember the last time i heard such a simple and effective idea to improve immersion
olooks like this is happening
thanks for posting that link rachel it was quite interesting to get such a well documented glimpse into the csm  ccp interactionid like to add one clarification here the current proposal seems to be looking at adding a meta tab to the detail and list views specifically what i am requesting is the addition of a sort by meta option to the right click menu of the icon view note the right click menu for the icon view does not resemble the right click menu for the list and detail views ie clicking on a blank space in the hangar anywhere not on a module itself produces a context menu not available in the other views appologies if ive overcomplicated thisa very small distinction but nevertheless one that i hope might be brought to the attention of the dev team while they are engaged in implementing this feature
aye i am in support of adding a sort by meta level functionfeature

heres to the most awesome suggestion ever published about pos improvements  and the most mortifying way of the addressee to ignore it for yearsone of the very rare responses ccp coughed up was that it would be way too complicated to create a system of modular pos structures including all necessary graphics and design efforts even though admitting the positive effect on the numbers of seperate entities to be loaded upon warpin   and that was just weeks before they brought modular ships into the game so a moving patchwork entity is feasable but a stationary is not i wont hold my breath for another 3 years but i wholeheartedly support this threads entire original idea
if there were any csm meetings left i would raise this issue entirely on the grounds that requiring gankers to train certain skills to get into a plex to kill the people inside is a stupid idea it is just another form of plex key and makes the people that do manage to get in all the more invincible when they ratthat said if they are going to do the lookingat of all the static plexes if they remove plex keys this is likely to get axed

lol i had the same idea about a week agosupporting the looking outside the station part makes even more sense once incarna is upon us not the undocking cloaked partunfortunately i see ccp weaseling themselves out of the proposal with excuses about the technical difficulty different engines used for space and interior rendering

i agree
i like the idea of these links but i would not like to see them replacing the existing iw links rather having them as additional link options some of the existing iw links and the new links could be redistributed to the other link classes so that each has 4 instead of 3 in the endsupported conditionally

hybrid turret damage instead of falloff maybe at least thats what i would prefer resistances are incredibly powerful bonus damage would be on par information warfare has nothing to do with gallente is nearly useless and i strongly dislike itcomplete and absolute support
boost gallente
im of the opinion that everyone should start with all basic learning skills at lvl 4 the skill learning excluded
most new characters are forced to train learning skills to level 4 tier 1 and 2 which eats up 950000 sp before they train anything else soon after this the 2x training bonus ends making it seem like they train at the same speed as 2x with no learning skills and the 950m sp they just worked for made no differencehuge turn off for newer people ive tried to get some friends to play but they dont want to spend their entire trial getting learning skills to 4 and sitting in an ibisid like it if they started at 4 all of them getting to 5 is optional completely id finally be able to persuade some of my friends to playand for you s who think ccp doesnt need the extra players they may not but we players sure as hell do new players are rare now as most of them are really just alts and im pretty sure they do as every patch they improve the newbie tutorials and interface explanationsthis is not a cry post all my learning skills are trained although i would like to redistribute a million sp to another skill category
first of all the entire point of drones is an automated weapon system that requires minimal pilot interface secondly this is primarily for missioners who are busy with their main weapons and dont have time to babysit the drones so they dont accidently trigger the next 10 spawns on you while your still working on the first 5 battleships
aye i am in favor of making it so the items do not end up in impoundinstead are dropped into the deliveries hanger
i would like to propose to introduce some mechanics to allow sp redistribution we can draw parallel between attributes remapping and sp redistribution remapping was introduced in response to the fact that when players created their pilots they were not fully aware of implications for skill training when they gained more in depth knowledge of game mechanics they realized that choice of attributes was by far not ideal for their goals however they could not change it by the same token new players would often be very confused by attributes composition and may be discouraged from continuing playing the game because of that choice hence attribute remapping is a very handy tool allowing players to be more flexible there is a similar situation with skills veteran players have an assortment of skills which they on the second thought would not have trained at all however at the dawn of eve due to lack of information they were a necessesity for example at the begining players had to train certain industrial skills just to be able to earn money even though at the moment the players is pursuing a pvp career he still retains those industrialist skills from the past and vicaversa in addition certain skills are becoming obsolete due to changes in game mechanics imagine you were a pure amarr combat pilot and only trained cruise missiles specialization for the purposes of stealth bomber now that sbs utilize torpedoes cruise missiles are useless in that way ccp should introduce some mechanics to compensate for those changes i suggest that restrictions on such redistribution should be quite severe example of those limitations could be the following only allow redistribution once per specific time period same as attribute remapping only allow redistribution of specific percentage of total sp for example 510 penalize amount of redistributed sp at some rate for example if a pilot unlearned 1m of sp then only allow 50 500k of sp to be injected into another skill only allow sp to be redistributed within parent category in other words skill points from spaceship command could not be redistributed to engineeringin order to make that game mechanics trully useful and prevent abuse such as complete shifts from industrial to pvp specs for instance this is not wow after all the extent of those limitations should mirror the extent of changes introduced to game mechanics as well as allow for certain error margin within career path what i mean by error margin is that players are bound to make some decision with respect to training which they will subsequently find unwanted current system penalizes those decision with maximum severity in a sense that it does not allow any ammendments at all however if we introduce skill redistribution mechanics it will allow to take corrective actions with respect to skill sheet over sufficiently long time horizon veteran players will be able to alter mistakes of the past and convert unwanted sp they learned due to inexperience into something they deem more useful and younger players will be able to correct there miopic decisions made in the short term alternativelly ccp could introduce some mechanics which would allow to change skills with respect to specific ship which they change in the next patch however i would say this would be too cumbersome visavis system which will work in generic way as outlined above and will allow players to correct their skill sheets at will again this by all means should not be a complete wow respec but rather a very restrictive corrective mechanism
this is not wow this has been discussed to death before you made the decision to train that skill eve is about decisions and consequencesnot supported
this is not bul thread so those ppl who cannot read my last sentence please do yourself a favour dont make yourself look like illiterate monkeys
is it that time of the month again alreadyno eve is all about making choices the choices you make will have consequences even though you may not realize it the skill you may not want may be useful sometime in the future
well you could argue same way about attribute remapping in a sense attribute remapping is even much more agrresive change than what im suggesting thats not to say that im arguing that since we got attribute remapping we may as well get skill redistribution every game mechanics modification should be justified on its own i bring previous experience only to draw an analogy here i dont think im being unreasonable here when i suggest system which is extremelly restricted one of severe drawbacks i see here is that there are people out there with extremelly focused skill sheet and certainly it makes their chars valuable assets should that proposal be accepted it will dilute their value however if it will be implemented with set of severe restrictions which i suggest this dilution will only be marginal and overall social benefit as we put it in economics will outweigh marginal cost of focussed character value dilution hence according to costbenefit analysis this change should be implemented but again this is all in theory and needs to be discussed are there any real arguments based on set of reasons not just that it was like this for ages because thats the game model so it will stay that wayin every decisionmaking process one should weigh costs vs benefits if benefits are higher than decisoin should go through so far i see a lot of benefits in this system and relativelly small costs opinions 
stop being a tard and go back to wow
why when we can fly around in our internet spaceships do we have to go knock on the door of our agent to see if theres anything he wants us to doonce youve built a bit of standing up with an agent so they know you why cant you get on the phone and ask him instead of having to go there buy him a coffee and ask him if theres anything he needs doingiirc i think it was coh that had a similar systemi know it would speed up mission turnover and that people will cry about mission farmers but meh its supposed to be a futuristic game yet theyve not invented the telephone yetthe proposalonce youve run a few missions for the agent not the corp then have the ability to call the agent up instead of having to go grovel at his door
from my experience with mission running the agent are quite paranoid and wont tell anybody unless they are in the same room no communication is safe not even in eve it would seem thats the only logical reason i can see behind this mechanic and i think it makes sense
ore hold that it mines directly into and corpmatesfleetmates able to pull the oreice out and haul it back to the stationthis new mining barge might be tech3 which has much larger ehp but similar tank to the hulk so it cant be suicided by a single personthe best part is the blackops capability of the miner the ability to have a cloak while mining at similar levels of hulkdom

hey look jason edwards is trolling again yawn
i belive this is a great idea its not fair that combat pilots get all the t3srs post is srs btw
i am not sure i support everything he said but i am all for tiii mining barges
he thinks that is cool
i was uncool before uncool was cool
you realise how expensive and huge dcus are right
glorious idea supported
micro dcu can be used in all drone boats  ok i know this dropkicks balance but if your using turret slots to field more drones then that helps balance it out quite a bit
your idea is interesting but i think giving it back its 125mb bandwidth and decreasing the number of turrets to 4 would do the trick better
pretty much this its amusing but completely impractical better to just make it into a proper drone ship again
how about battlecruiser skills bonus 10 to drone damage hitpoints velocity tracking and control range then gallante will have their sniping bc
although it would be very interesting to see in game i honestly like myrm the way it is i cannot say i am against this i would like to see how it would work out first so far i can see it being use to  small ships but giving it no real advantage against other battle cruisers if you give it 125mb bandwidth but take away turet slots it will simply become t1 version of ishtar in battlecuiser sized hull
battlecruiser without link bonus is not a battlecruiser sorry you either give up armor rep or drone bonus for it
uhh okay in that case i want to fit battleship guns on my harbinger there is nothing wrong with the myrmidon right now learn to fit if youre actually having problems the ship has enough medium slots for heavy ewar and its got enough low slots for a heavy tank high slots and drone bay for decent to heavy dps
a sign close to your velocity that shows you how hard youre being target painted and webbed and sensor dampened something like this noobie mspaint picture ftw of course it would be more fancy than thateditim thinking more than just knowing who is using ewar on you im thinking about showing how much its effecting you if you were being target painted it would show your signature radius red with a 30 or we the strength of the painter is in smaller font next to it showing you the actual signature of your ship without ctrlshiftf in mid combat
venkul i seriously think you should stop talking about what 00 corps want and would do
current paradigm in ship fitting is to cram as many plates as humanly possible onto a ship slap a remote repairer on and fly around in uber tanked blobs  it is effective but tedious and buffering becomes downright broken as you go down the sizesome ships are able to fit oversized plates correct size guns full tackle and drivemods and with the now ridiculously cheap thus mandatory rigs and the dpsehp ratio gets so out of whack in cruiser and down that you need gangs to kill anything  the blob has come to small scale warfareproposal increase fitting cost of all buffer modules platesextenders by 50 across the board  decrease remote repair modules efficiency by 50 either double cycle time or halve repair amount add a rolebonus to logistics ships doubling rr efficiency same as now in other words double the effectiveness of rigs designed to boost active local tank ex t1 aux nano pump gives a 30 increase to repair amount tweak cpu on ships to cover difference between platesextenders and resist modswhat it will do very little effect in bs class instead of a triple plate a double plate  resists canwill be used  logistics will see a lot more use when bs can no longer reliably fill their role opens the door to breaking a circle tank before the sun sets bsrr without logistics is still possible if ships mount a local tank to help out  gives a legup to the tank bonus ships particularly the repair bonused gallente hulls if they use the tanking rigs that is lets subbs ships choose between active tanks and buffer tanks ending the reign of trimarks limits ehp of buffered cruiser and down hulls and should make active tanks more common couldshould reintroduce the active tank solobs of oldand yes i hate buffer tanking with a vengeance not the ship and want it dead or hamstrung
1 you wont have remotely enough cap for 2 repair systems and guns2 your local tanking boost wouldnt be remotely enough to replace the repair capabilities of a gang3 there are so many ways to break rr tanks ecm cap warfare range manipulation just to name a few4 also rr is still highly based on player skills and defeat also takes player skills and fcingnot supported
nerf neutsthey should only work if you have more cap then the target
i kinda like the idea esp since i find rr a snoozefest but i fear that done on its own this solution would lead to 2 things1 even more stupid amounts of cap transferring read even more unbreakable guardians to fill the gap created2 increase in player dissatisfaction with the blobfocus firerr and focus fire go hand in hand the former being the logical response to the latter without rr bs guardians will be everywhere and gangs that cannot field them or at least enough of them will find them selves getting even more pd off at their ships disappearing in secondsi really want to support this especially the aspect of bringing personal active tank more to the forefront but without a parallel solution to focus fire i cant yet
i agree the entire spiderfest has gotten completely out of hand but its hardly the sole issue that has made combat in eve a complete borenow its blob or hide there is nothing in between thats the true nature of all combat honestly be it mice wolves or capsuleer pilots so nothing ccp ever does will shift things back to smaller gangs being more effective than a rolling mob of miceand then there are the complete asshats sitting at stations randomly repping people for lols
oki do apologise if this has been said before i tried searching but failed to find anythingwhy can we not have mobile agents basically these guys fly around their relevant space ie serpentis agents in serpentis space etc and dock at player ownedbuilt stations they maybe stay at that station for a week before they go off again to another station this would allow us 00 dwellers who dont want to fight our way through 40 people to get a poxy level 1 agent it would allow us to earn a few lps with faction whose space we live inpretty simple really no standings would be required the agent would be simply docked up for 7 days and you get do mission for him normal combat or even varients such as forward scouting for him say he wants to goto system 4ep this is random numbers you would have to travel say 10 jumps in 00 to get to destination where you mission would complete you return and inform him details of the route missions that require you scan down a complex in the neighbouring systems that have a mission only scan frequencyjust a thought to change life in 00 from jsut killing ratsmining or pew pew  any thoughts or comments appreciated and apologies if it has been added beforecheers
having lived in 00 for many moons now i still get frustrated with the lack of use for a force recon ship please hear me outok the ship i fly in particular is the arazu i love the concept of this ship jump behind the enemy fleet uncloak on their support shipships and cause havoc whilst the rest of your fleet ganks the unsupport bss however now the however by the nature of the ships name recon it should be able to do reconascancesp but this is near impossible and pratically improbableif we consider real life scenarioo its like asking the foroward scouts of the army to go behind enemy lines but have no forms of equipment to find where the enemy lies so what i am asking is why can the recon in particular force recon ships not have a bonus to fitting expanded probe launchers or even better their own version that depending on your level skill in either scanning or recon ships which reduces the amount of cpu the module takes on the ship yes same way as covert ops cloaks workthe ship current standard fit is 3 small guns with a cloak now what is point of the small guns because this usually means you have to get close to your enemy to hit him which makes the sensor dampening effect pointless also if your in a gangfleet then you are not there for dps so why not allow us to fit recon probe launchers that allow us to warp in cloak and scan down an enemy in a system whilst also keeping our offensive sensorwarp scrambling abilitiesapologies if this is long winded but i wanted to get my full reasons acrosslook forward to opening a discussion on forum any issues please shout out in the post
instead of giving us one measly launcher and a handfull of snowballs why not temporarily make the launchers and charges cheap market items seeded by npc christmas tree shops this way players that havent been here for 5 years or more can make a decent snowball drake
supporting this not mainly because of your proposal but because the share system needs a complete overhaul as well as requiring a proper stock exchange
do your homework look up where important agents are and what agents of the same level as the missions you are running are keep track of the number of missions youve done for your 16th mission go use an agent that is so close to the desired storyline agent that you are guaranteed to get a storyline from the corp you wantif a certain corp doesnt have important agents theres a reason for it youll just have to deal with it

i think you are getting things mixed up its liiza who has posted with alts crying about lark and the csm stuff123he posted in all the threads about lark several times but i just cba to link them all
no hes not serious at all about this now hes not engaged the community in a meaningful way or engaged in any public debates hes simply not trying because he knows he has no chance of getting elected i personally asked some valid questions on his csm website last week the comment has yet to be approved in fact there are no comments approved on that website now that hes been called out on this fact i am sure that there will be several dozen comments that will appear on their i wonder how many of them will be made by people other than liiza valora trying to cover his butt its not like he has any method on their to validate whose posting a comment like intensedebate or anything my goodness that would just bee too much something to ensure truth and honor that would be a big step for him i doubt he has the integrity to do such a thingone more thing for those of you wondering who i am yes i am an alt and yes i used to be a member of the united not neo spartans i am not this gaylen as he puts it in that lovely in game email he sent me ive blocked you so you can stop paying that 1 million isk for each email you try to send i deleted the other 10 or so without reading sorry i got to know galen in real life hes an odd sort of fellow in that he likes to see the good in peoplei do read galens blog as its an interesting read i bought the old web domain that galen registered for sandwich back when they were friends i bought it to blog about sandwich and how he harassed people i thought it was wrong what he was doing to people scamming them out of ships stealing isk from the corp wallet and how he pursued people out of game to harass themive tried to get galen to comment here or blog about liizas run for the csm he simply wont do it he wont say anything for the same reasons i am posting with an alt he doesnt want to have to deal with the in game and out of game harassment as i had to deal with from liiza valora how did galen put it oh yes i dont want to bait him into harassing me it would not be fair to do such a thing he wont be able to stop himself and i shudder to think how far he would take it this time aroundsorry galen you didnt say off the record

ive proposed a thread on making lowsec ore valuable before  i think a few new ores that dont derive most of their value from nocxium should do the trick nicely how to make mining interesting without ruining it for the people who like doing it now im not so sure about its one of those problems without an easy solution i think the one proposal that ive seen and liked is multiore asteroidswith crystals going from just increasing raw yield to changing the composition of the yield  i think it keeps the core of the current system intact while adding some slight measure of player skill and interaction into it without ruining semiafk mining its not perfect but i think its good i dont mine a whole lot myself so id check with people who do before i pushed that too hard but its the sort of thing im thinking about yeah thats the biggest reason im annoyed at the proposed dominion changes as for what id do here is my commentary on the proposed changes and here is my somewhat crazy list of proposed changes to upgrades in practice i dont expect half the stuff i posted could or should happen but id rather maker sure that its still worthwhile even after all the insanity gets cut out but basically give people a nice big incentive to move out and give alliances the ability to protect those people a little bit and build infrastructure to support them a lot yeah i know its frustrating one of these days theyre going to have to bite the bullet and recode poses but they keep putting it off and piling more cruft on top of the bad code instead but still it feels totally wrong to advocate a bad solution just because ccp is reluctant to implement the good one im not convinced that t2 bpos are a bad thing im thoroughly unconvinced that theyre such a bad thing that its worth screwing over everyone who owns one those lowvolume markets you talk about are junk modules  how does it help anyone for the price of junk to go up also t2 bpo prices have been going up kind of insanely recently  they seem to routinely sell for 45 years profits considering that it still takes a fairly large amount of work to build off of it youre going to be telling them that they have to work for years and still only break even i dont like screwing players over who acted in good faith i certainly hope youre right and thanks for the good wishes
thats something ccp is not afraid of doing screwing players over sure id like to reduce the pain for the owners but imo the bpos should end really it sucks that such a bad game design still causes headache other isk faucets like moons at least can be conquered they are not a jackpot and they are being nerfedi wouldnt exactly call interceptors junkspeculation is riskyit just requires a hint that the bpos will be nerfed and the market will adapt
youre right ccp is more willing to screw people over than i am but still its not like the bpo lottery was just here have free billions the players did have to work for it it was poorly designed and reward far exceeded effort but i dont think it was so bad that we should just try to wipe it out of the histories and pretend it didnt exist right i was thinking more of the modules market yeah but why would you manipulating the market for the sake of it isnt my idea of a good time and manipulating it in order to lower the amount you compensate people for a game change is just crass

you have my votesimpressive wellorganised manifesto and i really appreciated the excellent work you did commentating on the recent alliance tournamentbest of luck with the elections and perhaps more importantly should you get elected i hope you have an enjoyable term of office
teadaze i really appreciate the efforts youre putting forth in your campaign i think you have a solid understanding of what your role as a csm delegate will be and will be able to work well with other delegates besides that i agree with most of your opinions about how things should be changed so you got one of my votes good luck gooooo teadaze
the one thing that jumped out at me in this thread is where you saidfor example ccp wants more people in 00the main reason that 00 space is so sparsely populated is that unless you belong to a big corp and bring a battle fleet with you entering 00 is suicideif you want more people in 00 then you need to reduce the chance of people getting killed unncessarilythere are many ways this could be done but i am certain that the people that control 00 space at the moment will not want it and so it will not get changedthe simple point is this this situation has come about because of the way the game is and to change it will upset many even if it pleases even more ccp will not risk alienating its top players to try to get more top playersone possible solution would be to create a npc corporation for freelancers belonging to this corporation could allow you access to 00 space to trade and do missions you could even dock at player owned stations to deliver or collect cargo or get given player created missions that would increase your standing and the standing of the player corp it would massively open up the game and the games economy attempting to attack a freelancer would cause a warning to the attacker that killing this ship would cause loss of standing for not just themselves but their entire corporationpersonally i dont believe anything like this will happen too many top players like the idea that they can kill anything that moves in their space bullying the small guy is great fun for the bully that is for example i took a newbie alt into 00 space in an ibis sure enough it was not long before i was caught and destroyed and then pod killed why because ccp lets it happen can i retaliate or complain  no i cant even put a bounty on the killing pilot as they are above 10 sec status i am the victim  tough will i venture into 00 with my main character and risk my expensive ship  not a chanceccp has created this situation i doubt they have the guts to really try to resolve it people like myself will take what enjoyment we can in high sec space then leave for another game its as much a loss for eve and other players but they are not willing to give up anything to stop it happening either ccp need to make big changes or they need to stop whining about the low population in 00 space it is their own doing after allall that said i think it is a good idea to have npc corps represented in the csm even if it will not achieve anything specific for usgood luck
i agree that nearing a notblueshootit area is hazardous if you arent bluebut i think the mystique that 00 is suicide if you arent in force comes from the fact that there are some nbsi alliances near the low sec empire gates since any player wanting to get deeper into 00 would have to go through territory between or go around which probably means more systems to crossbut the notreddontshoot areas are differentas to freelance npc corps in 00 there are already pirate corporations in parts of 00 additional npc stations arent going to fix 00 and an npc 00 corp for players is just going to be abused the corp would become the de facto place for hit man alts a way to wage war on rival alliances without fingering their true alliance especially if these hit man alts apply to join other rival corps to get them on their employment historyand that doesnt even address how counter it runs to the concept of 00in the end 00 and to a lesser degree low sec really does require backup there is no reason several corporations couldnt alliance up it doesnt even have to be a we are all going to help each other type of thing just a we all commit to mutual defense and retaliationthe only problem is paying for it and i think one way to do that is to expand the taxation system to include an option for static dues so instead of taxing x it could be y isk per cycle and maybe they would still have a  tax but it could be smalleri havent noticed yet but i wonder how the new sov system will effect outposts

thanks a lot for making this i wasnt really planning to vote as i dont have the patience to read all the csmcandidate profiles this however gave a me brief overview of what the different candidates are trying to achieve and then presented it in such a way that making up my own opinion was easy i really think this needs more publicity and should help csm get more relevant votes
there really should be some sort of aptitude test before someone is allowed to vote in any type of electionim not going to kiss any 4sses and im not trying to cultivate a band of groupies im putting myself forward as a csm candidate because 1 i want a free vacation to iceland and ccp headquartersgoes to show you what happens when one idiot gets backed by a larger group of idiots anyways enjoy your tripoh and link for those too lazy to research who they vote for

i am very happy to provide him with a free vacation to iceland personally i think they should move it to amsterdam
got my vote good luck
im not exactly sure why youre running or why i should vote for you im feeling underwhelmed by the lack of even a simple mission statement dont need a lot of planks in your platform in fact one of my favorite candidates has only one real plank it sounds like if you become csm youll be off taking a nap while everyone else is trying to do some good

1 post with your main2 recalibrate you sarcasm meter3 try to make it less obvious that you like to troll logits threads4 if you can deny the quotes from the competion in the op then you are either a a carebear and in favor of wow in space or b you didnt read the article im guessing the later
i agree wholeheartedly except for your last line 
i killed one of your guys he lost a pilgrim got it on video  since then then not a single tears pilot has engaged my ship while on a mission i did have one of your guys scan down then loot a wreak he warped off before i could lock never to be seen again its quite unfortunate i love killing pirates who think they found a sucker only to be suckered themselves i even boughtskilled for a proteus so i could draw the flies but that did not work even sitting in a mission with an mwd running got no results too be fair i saw that pilgrim pilot undock in a navy mega and figured wth i was gonna go cheap and use the  0m bug to disable his guns but the closest i got was 167m unfortunate since i would have beaten him handily if i had just kept up the range

technically wouldnt a faction rp alliance be a splinter faction as far as game organizations are concerned from an rp perspective why should concord support an independent faction to take part in a wardec sanctioned between two other factions from an rp perspective shouldnt the opposing npc faction send their npc capital fleets to shoot at your poses and disrupt your sov and infrastructure rp as an argument for an added game mechanic can be taken to any extreme the imagination wants how about game mechanics that are good for the game ccp has said very explicitly they want fw to be casual pvp suddenly doubling or more the size of a faction would not only invalidate everything the fw guys have put in but the influx of capital fleets supported by sov holders point income sources would render the current fwers obsolete if i was in fw id probably be pretty upset if my faction strategy got completely taken over by people i dont even know and who havent contributed to the strategic goals as a new player wanting to join fw having large sov holding alliances dominating fw would probably put me off from wanting to join my votes for csm have been based on the principle of the candidates creating opportunities for either new people or people looking to experience new playstyles fw is broken no doubt about it letting alliances in at all would probably hurt more than help until fw can be fixedbtw to the op and your alliancemates you seem to be looking for a completely selfish nearsighted agenda not realizing that following through on it would seriously damage the entire eve community without regard to anyone else i dont care about your politics but im disturbed you all seem be so willing and eager to sacrifice the entire eve universe on the altar of your political agendas

no hes not serious at all about this now hes not engaged the community in a meaningful way or engaged in any public debates hes simply not trying because he knows he has no chance of getting elected i personally asked some valid questions on his csm website last week the comment has yet to be approved in fact there are no comments approved on that website now that hes been called out on this fact i am sure that there will be several dozen comments that will appear on their i wonder how many of them will be made by people other than liiza valora trying to cover his butt its not like he has any method on their to validate whose posting a comment like intensedebate or anything my goodness that would just bee too much something to ensure truth and honor that would be a big step for him i doubt he has the integrity to do such a thingone more thing for those of you wondering who i am yes i am an alt and yes i used to be a member of the united not neo spartans i am not this gaylen as he puts it in that lovely in game email he sent me ive blocked you so you can stop paying that 1 million isk for each email you try to send i deleted the other 10 or so without reading sorry i got to know galen in real life hes an odd sort of fellow in that he likes to see the good in peoplei do read galens blog as its an interesting read i bought the old web domain that galen registered for sandwich back when they were friends i bought it to blog about sandwich and how he harassed people i thought it was wrong what he was doing to people scamming them out of ships stealing isk from the corp wallet and how he pursued people out of game to harass themive tried to get galen to comment here or blog about liizas run for the csm he simply wont do it he wont say anything for the same reasons i am posting with an alt he doesnt want to have to deal with the in game and out of game harassment as i had to deal with from liiza valora how did galen put it oh yes i dont want to bait him into harassing me it would not be fair to do such a thing he wont be able to stop himself and i shudder to think how far he would take it this time aroundsorry galen you didnt say off the record

supportedmedium and large blasters specifically seem to be pretty lacking these days tracking  damage boost seems like the most reasonable suggestion leave range in its nicheim seeing less and less medlarge blasters on ships these days and its a real shame
support
from my understanding of racial balance blasters are supposed to rule within the short confines of their optimal  but now they only do so in medsmall level in particular if you gimp your buffer to the point where youre much more fragile then ships with 3050 more ehp then you making your ship a glass cannon to get 1520 more dps sucks when youre already outranged by a factor of 23a blasterboat landing within his optimal should have a heavy advantage to compensate for its in comparison horrible range along with locked damage types and capusing weaponsnow that isnt so because either the ships suck which they sort of do since rep bonus is incompatible with doing dps the guns suck neutrons dont but everything below that doesnt have a real dps edge over competition and gets a horrible drop in range and neutrons have horrible horrible fitting requirementsthese are the problems which need fixing in some way give me some incentive to kite a blasterboat or train for one if i want to do shortrange ganking
dont fly them but this seems a damn good idea
this could use some more support as i do think it is an important issue and will improve the explorer as well the salvager professiontogether with the reduced requirements for dominion this would be nice update for dominion too
there are a lot of things that could add immersion to eve but none of them are better or simpler than this

hii would like to ask it its possible to get backing for a multiplyer option to be added to the loyalty point screen ieyou have a nice ammount of loyalty points so you decide to buy some lp ammo you scroll all the way down the screen and click accept now it takes you back to the top and you have to scroll down again and click accept etc etc grrr could we have a option when you click on accept it asks you to enter how many so you type in your 30000 rounds and done in one istead of scrolling and accepting 6 timesthx
yeah this is something that needs doing that said im pretty sure its already been raised by the csmedit hrm couldnt find it in the csm pages which makes me think i might be remembering wrong i dont support issues that have already been raisedsince i dont want them raised again but if it hasnt been then ill support for sure
if it hasnt been raised can we get it supported and raised ops right this is just annoying
if muad dib says so then oh wai
quoting someone who like me meant to check the support box
the gas harvesting career needs some serious work right now all that can be used for it is any ship with at least 5 turret slots and even then its painfully slow to harvest any reasonable quantity of gas from a cloudi would think at least in the storyline of the game that ore would have come up with some kind of mining barge and exhumer for gas harvesting they have them for mining asteroids and mining ice why not gas they could even stick with the original harvester turrets but allow the ship to equip more than 5 of them andor give bonuses to their yield and cycle time or they could follow suite with the other barges and exhumers and make gas stripmining modules for themanother possible addon to this is that since units of gas arent extremely big like ice gas harvesting drones are also a possibility anyone else feel that this is overdue
overdue usually means they are too humiliated to deal with it now so i doubt it will happen but support1
more gas is always a good thing oh wait that just sounds wrong ok more drugs for everyone can only lead to good things um nvm but yes better harvesters for the fluffy stuff
i have seen many petitions on the poor quality of amarrian drones and i think i may have the solution that gives them a purpose and fits in with racial status i propose to give the amarr drones self regenerating armor this fits in with their technological prowess and would finally come up with a drone that although it does less damage than all the others it can survive longer in hostile environments
ive proposed similar threads a couple timesthough focused more on raw hp than tank because in my experience drones taking a bit of dps over a long period of time is rare but i dont think they ever actually got raised by the csm so yeah supported
i am focusing more on a low dps drone that can actually tank so you can sacrifice dps in order to leave them out withpught worrying so much about them getting popped and to possibly take agro off of you
supported as well
this needs to be implemented yesterday
i wonder why we even have to bother on asking this one should be part of core design tbh
yup please do
with so many nerfs and the caldari being a primarily missile based race i belive that the word kinetic should be removed from all missile damage bonuses the entire purpose of missile combat is to provide damage versitility and to restrict a ships bonus to only one type of missile is a unbalancing nerf for any pvp fit i propose that missile bonuses on ships should be universal
i certainly agree with that people going against a known caldari ship can easily tank against kinetic a lot which negates the bonus make it universal all of the other damage bonuses for weapons on other ships are universal regardless of the ammo used with the exception of the stealth bombers
supporting own post
not supported you still got the versitility of diferent damage types if someone know they facing a caldari ship  how they know and then have time to refit is another question  and harden against kinetic then they got a hole in another resist so swap missile type and hit that hole missiles already have diferent types of damag are capless and an option when jammed to keep firing at something which a the turret ship pilots would love put up with it if youre target hardens towards kinetic swap missile type and in effect you still hitting for a bonused amount as you be hitting a resist hole
people going against a known amarr ship can tank em people going against a known gallente ship can tank thermal etc etc the caldari already have the choice to choose between primary damage types unlike any other race the small penalty that follows not doing your races damage is a sacrifice youll have to decide oneditall other races dont get penalties because their ammunition types do the same types of damage with a different ratio excluding the minmatar which they fall out in damage per second in exchange for their omnipotent damageeditand kinetic is the caldari primary damage type notice how their drones do kinetic and their doomsday too i would be pretty sad to see explosive drakes with heavy assault missiles
better avoid looking at the rook or the raven if you dont want to be sad
uhm im aware of their bonusesi didnt say that all caldari ships focus kinetic damage but it is the primary caldari damage type amarr would have em caldari kinetic gallente thermal and minmatar explosive the drake reference i made was to combat mission runners because the drake already has a ridiculous defense rating that defense combined with free selection of damage would make it a little too good for missionsalthough the raven can do most level 4 missions alone with its large active tank and damage potency while holding onto its range it does have a heavy weakness to energy neutralizersdont condescend to me its humiliating

someone should also start a petition to stop ccp from making drastic mega changes to whats being tested on sisi 2 weeks before the release if this is what they wanted they should have presented at the end of september when dominion supercarrier testing begannot in the 11th hour

this would also be greatperhaps we can at least create this stuff we already have commodities spirits and dairy products cant the people with manufacturing skills makes this i think even the amarr would not mind

ok the only way i would look at this is simplecan you learn to walk when your 2 years old then first thing you do is walk straight into a job as computer programmer nope you need to learn things first but before you learn how to program or fly a bs and for that you need to learn the basics and in my opion the learning skills are these basics that we learn in real life at schooland the better you do in school the faster you will be able to pick things up in real life and yep i know this isnt always the case but im sure you get my idea
my character went to the federation navy academy so i assume my character learned something even if she just learned how to learnbasic learningskills to lvl 4 are so elementary that i doubt theres many in eveonline that do not get these skills respectively they do not add a lot to the game in the beginning apart from getting skills quicker you do not gain any gameplay value from training learningskills and its incredibly boringadvanced learningskills although still dirtcheap are expensive and exotic for new players because you have to earn them more or less same goes for implantsall basic learningskills bar learning itself standard to level 4 will let you train learningskills right off the bat if you want to but it also gives a lot more room to train other skills while earning your isks for advanced learningskills basically it makes you bleed a little less as a new player but on the whole scale of things it doesnt really leave an impact it just makes the game more enjoyable
let try a reasoned postgiven the choice i would choose not to give up my learning skills even for double the amount of sp i invested in themi invested in them for a reason i want faster training i would not accept the free skill points in return for significantly slower training on everything from losing my learning skillsif instead youre proposing to boost everyones attributes as you remove learning skills then why all you are doing with that is lowering training time across the board if you want to compare this to wow it would be like saying i want levels to take half as long wellwhy blizzard would laugh at you they want people playing thier game for a while ccp is no differenti reiterate your post is asking for one of two things both of which dont belong either you want to slow down the training of everyone who learned any learning skills by removing them and giving some piddly amount of instant sp or you want to speed up overall training time by giving everyone the benefits of all learning skills to 5 either way i support neither of these options
lets not and say we did
actually since almoast all new characters train their learning skills to max before even starting their main skill chain i think removing those skills completely and just giving the characters the extra 10 sp in the begining will save training time and remove a complete waste of time although if ccp does impliment this i hope they will give the missing points to existing characters as well as new players
thanks for the hint i am not a native english speaker so i do not know how things like engine oil or coolants or other items who are supposed to supply the operation of a machine are coined correctly
lubricant is the right term for motor oil and such but most people hearing the term think of the sexual variety of lubricant not the industrial variety hence youll get a lot of people interpreting your proposal entirely the wrong way as for the proposal itself its not crazy but i dont like adding new objects to the fitting screen without a good reason eve ships already routinely fit 2030 items plus overheating ammo types implants gang bonuses and all the rest i dont like making things more complex without a real need for it
please yes

i actually support this if said high sec upgrades would actually buff high sec to the level that null sec currently enjoysi wouldnt mind 18 mill isk bs rats 100150 mill per hour mining would be awesomefinding high end officer mods the kind that goes for billions would ruleso yes i would love this ideaedit to saynull sec corp members you are not poor because null sec underpays you you are poor because you are lazybuff null all you want your still lazy and im still richer then you
ok then i will use a real scenario very similar one i used to discredit the removal of learning if you want a job as i do as an archaeologist you have 2 options1 you start by doing the job as a volunteer and work your way up until you get sufficient skill that someone hires you or2 you goto uni which im doing and spend 5 years doing bsc and ma then you get hired to work in a field of expertisenow assume 5 years time i work in arch for 2 years then think i dont like this i want to be a doctor can i simply change my degree and go work in a hospital well no of course i cant ive gotto go back to uni to study another degreenow to me eve is like this if i want to fly a caldari bs i have to train caldari bs to level xx bsc then the skills that it requires to fly it well ma now i get in ship have 3 fights think omg this ship is st and i want to fly in gallenete bss i now have to put in the time in training to fly this ship so in fact having to retrain makes eve skills more like life than any other mmo i have playedobviously most people have played wow and because the majority of the kids who play it didnt like having their talents being permanent they allowed you to change the talents for cost of a few gold the reason being that most people who play wow have little to no long term attention span which we obivosuly know that you need in eve the remapping was brought in because of the complexity of creation new toons 12months ago often meant people chose otpions that had very very little effect in their game abilities but also when they dumbed down the character creation they had to compensate by offering the older players a bonus thus the remap was born
nevah
hahahahahahahahahaha wait youre seriousno not supported
so basically you are saying that those ppl who had focused training in gallenete or amarr and who had cruise missiles specialization trained now that sb mechanics changed should shove those sp up their   cos now cruise missiles is no use for them at all since they cant fly bs which utilizes them and equaly do not want to train them because it requires also a lot of other additional training such as shield  other type of guns etc
your tears are lovely but go back to wow
another anologyi go down shop buy a mars bar eat said mars bar then think urghhh i didnt like i would rather of had twix if i went back to the shop would they let me exchange the mars i have eaten for a uneaten mars bar nopebasically eve is like life in that once you do something it stays in done each action has a consequence and yes i am gallente who started to train missile skills then thought that given it was only going to be for one boat it would be useless so i decided against training missiles any further and also if you have cruise skills then use them somewhere else ie raven etc because in theory you will have some other of the skills neededjust my tuppence
stealth torpbomber whine detected basically yes too bad so sad suck it up torps 4  5 is only a 2 week train the bomber change was months ago and cruise missiles are still in the game and still useful the new stealth bombers are so unbelievably much better than the old ones that i am simply baffled that anyone using them could complain about a couple of weeks training timeskill respeccing inevitably leads to everyone flying fotm builds and it also means that low sp players are at an even greater disadvantage to high sp players make your choices and stick to them stop trying to ride the fotm wave and crying because youre not in the uber ship every second you play

the myrmidon is one of the most versatile ships in the game with the crazy good slot layout awesome drone bonus and the fact that we can fit any guns neuts nos warfare links into the highs theres hardly anything else this ship needseven the useless armor repair bonus on this ship isnt so useless when one considers that it is also a perfectly viable pve ship
technically speaking the proper analogy would be dread guns on ur harby
either swap out the armor rep bonus for hybrid damage bonus or for the old gallente 10 armourlevel bonus still

currently the overview will show you who has ewar effects on you on the far right side of the view pane unfortunately its not a dedicated column so if youve got anything in the far right half inch you wont see the ewar icons which pretty much renders the entire utility pointlessall they need to do is enable an ewar effects column to fix it

hurf durf didnt read your second post
seeing how the post you commented as nothing about what the corp want but it is about the players things like no one will mine veldspater industrialist will seem clear enough your comment has missed the target againedit this can be considered a comment about corp behaviourprobably instead of making life in alliance space easier it will make wormhole invention the way to go with hundreds of almost invulnerable research pos in low level wormhole systemsbut it will be most empire corps that will be doing that so again it is not about what 00 corps want and would do

noplayer skill is required to make a rr gang work effectively and it is one of the best examples of nonblob teamwork in evei dont understand why you think buffer tanking is wrong tbqh
i think it just boils down to ships being able to cram too many ehp with buffer fits especially bsbc classes and few cruisers fitting plates should be punished more by increasing fitting cost and comparatively local reppers should be easy to fit iUFFFDd happily flip 500  2000 grid on them

or how about instead of an agent which means you have to go back to station and hand inacceptskip missions you just spawn mission rooms lets call them cosmic anomalies and as soon as one room is completed you spawn a new onethen add an upgrade to the infrastructure hub which increases the number of cosmic anomalies which will exist in a given systemthe advantage here is that you have no deadline in which to complete a mission you have no mission item which some prankster will inevitably come and nick from you and you have no agent to lose standing with when you fail a mission due to completing the objectives before picking up the item due to being blown up and podded throw in the utility of being able to enter and leave an anomaly as required to answer ctacan it get better than that why do you need level 4 missions when you can just spawn infinite numbers of casthe cas can be scaled in riskreward between level 1 mission ie dumb frigates up to level 5 mission ie hordes of battleships neut towers web scram damp smart ai to the point that you can keep people occupied in any role while they are waiting for some more pvp actionno more jump cloning to empire space and missing all the fun
i agree
they dont even have to dock just sitting on the gate would be enoughi saw such agents in sansha space and also in highsec
aye these agents usually cosmos are doted around 00 but often their systems are highly populated because of it but if with the changes that comes in with dominion and your quality of system improving then also as a biproduct your quality of agent improves as it gives the agent reason to come visit your system to check on how your looking after his space 
wrr i too fly an arazu have never had fitting issues with it if youre setting up to probe with it you can just not bother with guns if youre not fitting probes on it you can get a full rack of 200mm rails on it its not built for dps its built for use with a rapier on the side so you can essentially pin some poor sod down until backup arrives solo work in an arazu is not really smartto be totally honest the force recons are fine as they are boosting damps would be nice though
ccp is terrified of any ship being able to probe down another and actually have the ability to deal damage to it once locating the targetnow they dont mind the support being cloaked bombers anemic cloaking recons ect but they are dead set against any probing ship being able to engage
ok both fair comments but lets look at it from slightly different anglearazu has 440 cpu the combat scan probes takes 220 cpu thats 50 of your cpu doesnt leave room for much else thats why my practicle improbality reasoningnow given that you can spend 80mill less and buy a sb which since it can now warped cloaked the main reason i did all the painful training to get into recons can have more uses on a battlefield in my opinion at the moment i struggle to see the benefit of the arazu i just feel that if not bumping the force recon then making a recon ship that offers versitability of scanning whilst behind enemy lines with some proper form of defence for arazu its dampeningapologies if my logic is slightly flawed at moment its almost 2am lol

sorry to break the current posting trend of huggykissyness but whilst i believe ak is very knowledgeable about the game and surely competent he appears to have no respect for other players he has boasted about griefing players out of the game turned guns on recent employers and would likely campaign for game changes to make his organisations position in the game more powerful seriously nerfing indys cloaking ability maybe not everyone wants to throw tii ships into your quasipiratical gatecamps or even be forced into unsurvivable situations 1 vote
teadaze just wanted to say after reading this thread you have my vote too i think youll take the csm seriously and work hard in the position and not just push your own petprojectslocal could use some tweaks a 1 or 2 min delay wouldnt be too bad to test on sisi i think
i have another question which is somewhat off given your focus but maybe you have an opinion on it do you have experience with capital ship warfare do you have ideas about how it could be made more relevant and fun in a postdominion contextand lastly am i right in assuming you indulge in tea culture
you got my vote mateydont know if you started putting yourself into the public eye in advance of the csm but you play it like youre born to it bon chance
i was also like 64  63 between alek and helen the two big differences i noticed from the vote match site are that alek agrees w making local delayed which is a horrible idea unless you want to constantly get ganked by cloakers in your own freaking space while trying to raise pvp money  it just further reduces 00 profitability besides thats what whs are foralso alek is against converting tech ii bpos to high run bpcs not directly relevant to most people but i agree with iain in erasing all remaining traces of that ridiculous lotto anyways i voted for helen w my accounts and you should too especially if you are in any way interested in 00 besides the more goons we can get busy w csm business the less time they will have to spamcrash tpar local
i can state that you are by far the most interesting goon candidate imo your stance on different issues are sound and you did fairly well in the podcast you dont fit in goons tbh but the problem has been pointed out already even if more people feel the same about you they just wont vote for you because that might result in 3 goons in csmharsh but true cut all your goon ties and you might have a good chance in csm5
im getting this
just try again server hickups sometimes
you can read my interview with eve tribune at
everyone complains about lowsec and no one goes there which leads to people discussing issues they dont know enough aboutso im curiouswhat would you identify as some of the core problems with lowsec and what kind of remedies do you suggest
i was going to vote for you until the dental hygeine comment on your latest podcastthis might sound like sour grapes but i hate stereotypes and if you exhibit them in real life i feel you are likely to do the same in game that said i wish you good luck if not success
as a trader i love low sec great profit to be made there as is the issue that i speak to is getting missioners into it my idea was for fleet missions missions where you need to be in a group and in which pvp setups are ideal in them the ai needs to be able to re target to include pirates that may show up in the mission site this would even out the playing field where the missioners may not have to tank all the mission dps plus the pirates and the pirates have to worry about the rats

seriously i feel like people who are interested in exploration content are pretty underrepresented do any of them have any agenda regarding exploration content
as much as i would like to say i am the only candidate with an interest in seeing exploration increased i think you would be hard pressed to find any player that is against expanded explorationbear in mind that exploration is already getting a much needed buff with dominion in decemberso the question becomes after this coming buff how much additional dev time will exploration need that is where i think the difference between strongly agree and agree comes inedit i ran this question through vote match only two candidates didnt vote agreestrongly agree those are logit probit who declined to take a stance and lizza valora who disagreedi recommend you check out csm vote match to help narrow the list of candidates to check outor you can just vote for me jonathan fearn he said half jokingly
this i cannot imagine anyone being radically against the addition of new exploration sites wormhole content etc because they add to pve as well as pvp opportunities for everyone

really appreciate anything that csms can do to put this topic on the front burner eve is such a pretty game overall the font is the single ugliest thing in it whyowhy cant we just have a simple elegant readable font is it really asking so much

i made a slight revision to your proposal and with that revision i would support your proposal damping the signature radius of wrecks would not be enough as illustrated by the impact of a set of drones in use by a target being probed your suggestion as written would mean that pirates or other hostiles would no longer need a combat probe to probe missionrunners which would be a ridiculous change to the system

just bumping this because the delay is still a funkiller
create gas strip minersproblem solved
yep gas harvester i and gas harvester iiand add some bonus to the skiff for that and its ok
sure gas strip miners would work just fine too and maybe the gas harvesting drones i also mentioned they at least need something better than what we currently have
really good and unique ideaid love to see it happen especially if the amount of regeneration they get is actually viable against smart bombs and drones of a similar type for example small amarr drones should be able to overregenerate against small smart bombs and small drones but die to medium and large ones if they can hit
seriously no unless you are speaking of a 1 vs 1 drone fightif i send my drones against your drone he should not survive unless you kill them faster the general idea of giving some different advantages to the different race drones as a way to balance them is good but your proposal would make light drones way more unbalanced so support to the op even if i prefer a larger hp buffer or more armour resists
this sound reasonable and interesting
i have to say i give you points for your inventive take on thisbut ill be honest with you even if they regenerated theyd still die rather fast and the lack of proper dps on them would still have me picking another type of drone in 999 of casescaldari drones are similarly unimpressive i might add

supporting the idea of more keyboard shortcuts in generalif its problematic to add shortcuts to the warp function due to people macronavigating then id at least like to see approach orbit and keepatrange being given the option of a keyboard bindingalso the idea of tabbing through targets and maybe shift tabbing through overview settings is really nice
yes
definately in favour of more hot keys for constantly used actionsmake your voice heard
third time luckyissue many minmatar ships suffer from the affliction of nothing bonuses unlike the other races which have clearly focused concepts and bonuses that match minmatar ships seem to have been given a hodgepodge of bonuses that are incongruous with the nature of the race and are practically redundant given the alternatives for instance active tanking bonus to the race with the poorest capacitor and cargo bay sizes double damage bonuses where in reality a single larger damage bonus would do given the merrigo round that is minmatar skill training and the fact that certain successful racial traits ie speed fail to transfer into later ship classes i propose a new solution that would aim to solve the throw away bonuses issuesolutionlets throw away throwaway minmatar bonuses in exchange for slotsthe traditional mantra has always been that minmatar ships where  versatile well active tanking and remote active tanking bonuses see nidhoggur more than any other kind of bonus destroy that ideal and in the case of shields unlike armour can be replaced almost exactly by an additional tech 2  shield boost amp 36 from the module vs 375 from the ship bonus before stacking is applied so an extra mid slot in almost every case would directly compensate for the removal of the boost bonus in some cases various ships would have an early advantage at as relative tank compared to caldari ships at bs iiiv would be better however is is racially counter balanced by the dual tanking nature of minmatar shipshel bonus removed  5 bonus to shield and armor transfer amount per level  new slot layout  775nidhoggur bonus changed  10 bonus to shield and armor transfer capacitor power use per level naglfar  who knows wtf is happeneing to this ship is right nowvargur with the new projectile changes considered im happy to keep this as is although the power grid of this ship even with standard fittings considered is no where near on par with the other maruders 1500 power gridmaelstrom bonus removed  75 shield boost amount per level  new slot layout  875 50 cpu agility modifier changed to  012 mass reduced to  101000000 kgtempestalthough most ships with dual damage bonuses work somewhat the tempest most certaintly does not barring a full gang fit of which it has no where near the cpu to successfully fit it has almost the same the slothardpoint layoutdrone bandwidth as the myrmidon although its already faster than a drake it also has the same sensor strength all battleships with the exception of the scorpion are designed to tank and gank to varying degrees of difficulty the tempest does neither substituting performance for utility that has gradually become irrelevant over the years this combined with the way that rigs tend to improve specialised ships the most the introduction of the maelstrom and the speed nerf has seen the tempest fall behind radically in its real world effectiveness  10 bonus to projectile damage per level  100m3mb dronebaybandwidth 50 cpu agility modifier changed to  0117 mass reduced to  100000000 kg new slot layout  866 speed increased to match the typhoon missile hardpoints changed to 1 shield recharge rate reduced by 15the tempest can now fit a moderate shield tank  gank or participate in armour rr with increased utility although it loses a bit of turret dps it gains 25 more alpha  20 over the maelstrom and additional drone bay

so you want no skill bonuses on most of the ships
there will still be a single damage bonus or role bonuses for most ships but now you just have options your not condemned to fit a specific setup everytime
im ok with this but maybe give 025 medium slots per level so you need at least bs level 4 to use this bonus slot maybe even 02 so you need bs5 to fully utilize your bs like other races otherwise they will cryedit this will also satisfy the guy that posted below me palso dunno about the tank bonus on sleipclaymore theyre very powerful already and can tank better than marauders until you run out of cap booster 800also nidhoggur is very good as a triage ship please dont take away its logisticslike transfer bonus nidhoggur is fine imo maybe just needs a touch more cpu so it can fit a shield transfershield booster and all other gear normally so you can use it as a shield tanker properlynot commenting on hel because on sisi it now has a 5 resists for drones bonus but all in all this is probably the best idea ive seen so far to fix tempestmael drop a bonus and give one more slot bonuses just give one thing while a slot can give versatilitysupported
if youre not going to follow the most basic principles of eve ship design why are you even trying t1 ships get two bonuses t2 ships get four thats malleable at the level of capitalsright now carriers get 3 motherships and titans 4 but if your t1 battleships have one bonus go back and do it again
suporting this proposal ps also i c now why they keep nerfing matars
i didnt realize csm proposals could include redoing a whole races ship lineup wow thats ed
that would be interesting if it was possible although satifing the needs of herschel yamamoto has never been my aimlittle changes in there active tanking performance however they can now do other things such as fit tackle or passive setups as well as other commandshipstriage is the only thing the nidhoggur can be concievibly thought at being useful at and even then cap stability and personal tank  25 more remote repping even for triage as if youve run out of cap or die a few minutes earlier whats the pointbut all in all this is probably the best idea ive seen so far to fix tempestmael drop a bonus and give one more slot bonuses just give one thing while a slot can give versatilitysupported tyvm
interesting idea i like it its a different solution to the problem and should be given a try question  do you think the ships will have enough powercap to support an extra slot
making it need more rep mods fitted to do the same amount of rep does nto help capstability eitherits a good ship with a useful niche
they really should just be one weapon type or the other make the phoon a missile boat and the pest a projectile or vice versa i think the maelstrom would go from one of the worst ships to one of the best if the shield boost bonus was both local and remote tankas to the hel  hog im not sure what the complaint is with the current bonus it makes them the most desired carriermom in a cap fleet everyone desires a little hog lovinas to the nag aka worst dread aka fcs call battleships primary before worrying about these dreads  get rid of the missiles and double up on projectile bonuses the end
signed and bump
why not retain current bonuses on tempest but redo it to be the minmatar armour tank rrbs with 7 turrets  4 mids  7 lows and 100m3 dronebay that gives it competitive dps output free highslot for rr and a passable tank on top the typhoon as it stands is a effective shortrange rrbs why not make tempest the same only using projectiles
this not supported
if you remove the shield bonus of maelsleipcyclone cyclone is awesome you just need slaves claymore so on you need to give them 1 extra mid slot not low slot
10
as an minmatar enthusiast i have to say big fat no on this onewhy the hell is everyones solution to ships is to put more slots on itif you got a problem with bonuses then fix the bonuses the minmatar need much loving but this is a little overboardwhats next add slots to all the other races yeah like ccp will go for that let alone thisnot supported
a weakness to neutralizers you obviously didnt use a large cap booster setup on one before with the cap booster and shield booster properly timed against the enemy energy neutralizer the neuts would do nearly jack squat to it
honestly if anything the kinetic bonus should apply to all missiles as per the wording of the bonus itselfbattlecruiser skill bonus 5 shield resistance and 5 bonus kinetic damage of heavy missiles and heavy assault missilesit doesnt say 5 bonus damage of kinetic heavy missilesit says 5 bonus kinetic damage of heavy missilessure id be happy if they just worded it correctly but only boosting kinetic missiles is edit should just add that percentage worth of the main kind of damage on the missile in kineticso if you have a 150dm thunderbolt heavy missile missile it would do 150 em damage plus 375 kinetic at battlecruiser v 75 kinetic at lvl i
confirming thisi once beat the curses big brother cant spell it with a cnr on the test server by using that trickhe ran out of boosters first
great my first few days on the forums and a bunch of kids who obviously cant read decide to reply to me i was talking about missions if you use cap boosters in missions you need to have a hell of a stock of them in your home station and i cant be bothered to go pick them up in a hauler especially when i can just pack in capacitor flux coils and rigsoh and if you want to get gay and technical you need the cap booster to sustain the defense on your raven without being neutralized after a proper neutralizing ship is on you even if you can get a single boost off every time youre able to cap boost you will still deplete too soon to defend against more than 75150 dps also your invulnerability fields will sometimes fail to activate in time in before you decide to say no im pro i time it too good sometimes your connection may not be
spergin
back in the day i never used more than 5 or 10 cap charges even in the direst situations 2 full loads you dont need to keep your booster on as you should know most of times distance  shield  cap recharge rate is enough to keep your ship going the booster works wonders against heavy dps  neut situation without resorting to flux coils which gimp your damage potentialalso if youre running missions in any given mission hub you can always bring a cap 800 bpo with you and refine useless junk to craft them its often cheaper than buying them even with 0 production efficiencyas for this proposal either swaping kn for rof raven  rook or giving 5 kn damage bonus to all missiles as someone mentioned in this thread would be just fine
not supported what arwen said
now this i actually like a lot
the way i see it then 5 of 0 kinetic damage on an explosive missile is still 0 kinetic damage so applying it in the way you said would still only work for kinetic missiles also your race shoots capless weapons which can shoot without needing a lock and can always hit at their range even for reduced damage of any damage you choose you just get bonused to kinetic because thats your races flavornot supported
that sounds a lot like drones to me anyone up for making the domis bonuses only apply to thermal drones
max heavy drone dps is 475 and thats with all thermal damage switching damage types drops you to 431 with kinetic 386 with explosivesooo in a way the dominix actually cant do as much damage with explosive and kinetic drones as it can with thermal caldari missile boats would be doing just as much damage with all types of missiles dominix cant do that unless you of course just reduce the damage on all missiles besides kinetic thats the way drone damage works or actually boost drone damage
but there are also amarr ships that get a drone bonus does it make sense for the curse to be pushed into thermal damage
i dont see your pointships without drone bonuses are pushed into thermal drone damage too the drone bonus doesnt push amarr into it the different base damage of drones does
you seemed to be saying that its fine for missilebonused ships to lose one of the primary benefits of missilesdamage switching because they have other benefits too in a theoretical world where drones were balanced drones would have all the same power but amarr dronebonused ships using explosive drones or gallente using em would be commonplace and while 475 dps doesnt sound like a lot its more than any realistic fit on a kineticbonused shipbar the phoenixleviathan gets remember the torp battleships all get rof bonuses not kinetic so i guess my point is missiles have benefits so they dont really need to be able to use one of them is a bit of a silly argument
first of all you are not losing the ability to use the benefits of missiles you are totally free to switch damage types whenever you want however caldari are the kinetic damage dealers so they get a bonus to kinetic damage sure as hell id use em and explosive drones if they all did the same damage before bonuses explosive damage on armor could potentially outdamage bonused thermal drones same with missiles ive flown the nemesis several times and id switch to explosive missiles on armor ships and i found myself doing more damage despite my bonused thermal missilesand i was not aware of the only bonus of torp spewing ships to be rofif you look at it that way then you cant compare battleship dps dominix to battlecruiser or cruiser dps drake or whatever ships youre talking about youll find the myrms sucky drone bandwidth severely cuts down from the dominixs 475 dps eh well technically the ishtar can too but im sure some caldari kinetic bonused ship can easily reach the ishtars dps
which would still be the case after this proposed change you get your base missile damage of whatever type and then a bunch of bonus kinetic on top of that theyre still clearly kineticprimary but they can switch a portion of their damage just like projectileusers yes using explosive drones seems great until they bring a shieldtank ship to the battle admittedly some shipslike the domi can carry enough for both roles but most have to choose before the fight as for the nemesis was this before the change to torps they get 6075 dps on thermal missiles the guy would have to be very very specifically tanked for swapping to explosive to make any sense typhoon gets rof ravennavy raven get rof and velocity golem gets a flat 100 damage and velocityprecision bonuses proposed navy scorpion gets rof proposed rattlesnake gets velocity and any other bses that use torpstempest scorpion etc are doing so with no bonuses the bombers are the only torp ships with damage type bonuses okay lets compare onclass well assume allv skills t2 drones no sentry rigging t2 launchers 2x bcu and cn kinetic missiles  myrmidon does 315 dps with dronesme grumbles at ccp for nerfing it drake does 368 with heavy or with 462 heavy assault advantage missiles  ishtar does 475 dps with drones cerberus does 351 with heavy or 440 with heavy assault advantage drones  vexor does 315 dps with drones caracal does 189 with heavy or 330 with heavy assault advantage drones though only slightly  ishkur does 99 dps hawk does 128 with rockets or 105 with standards advantage missiles though only slightly sum up the four classes drones deal 1204 dps closerange missiles deal 1360 and longrange missiles deal 1013 so when we compare classbyclass insofar as thats possible we see that the kineticbonused ships are roughly on par with the dronebonused ships when it comes to the dps they get from their main weapon system
my helios gets a thermal bonus to drones theres a lame example but a true example of another race having to deal with stuff like this i still feel that being able to change missil types is powerful enough without having the kinetic part carry over to all types of missiles exactly we have to choose what type of damage to bring most ships cant pick what damage they want to use on the fly caldari can already do this so they shouldnt get bonused damage to all types of missiles just kineticyes this was before the change but this demonstrates how the small bonus difference can be overruled by just changing missiles to a hole in resists your ships dont get 6075 bonus to kinetic damage now do they sooooo the rof already makes up and bonuses all types of missiles while other races really only get bonuses to their damage type since they cant change it at all this is fair how especially since the dominix gets heavily penalized in the dps department for switching drone damage typesi could argue that youre using the wrong drone size for the ishtar if youre comparing cruisers as many times cruisers just speed tank heavy drones however just as often as not actually more often than not heavy drones work perfectlythey are perfectly onpar as you said so why change the bonuses around so that caldari can do as much damage with all damage types as drone users can do with just one damage type thermalor should we look at just how much dps is lost by switching to the lowest dps drones
drone boats get damage bonuses to all drones not just thermal  the dominix gets 10 bonus to drone hitpoints and damage per levelgunboats get dps bonuses to all weapons in their race specialisation rate of fire range trackingmissile boats get kinetic bonus on missiles or a rate of fire increase the rook only gets a velocity increase meaning it can hurl heavy missiles about 90kmam i reading it wrong when i see lasers listed with a base armour and base shield damage  does that damage apply in addition to the emthermal damage or is that an indication that the emthermal damage is scaled differently versus shields and armour
not sure which side youre arguing forjust gonna point out that yes drone boats get bonuses for all drones but drone damage is not consistent gong from thermal to kinetic to explosive to em a  ton of dps is losttbh i dont know what those base armor and base shield damages are for
as much as i love the support ccp took a dump and named it dominion and much like everything else related to this patch they skipped all the good stuff and put in a bunch of crap nobody really wants to playno af lovin cause they wanted to get the rocket crap in at the same time ect ect
as i said before i cant begin to suggest mechanics of how that idea would work but i certainly think that any and all ship info should be available within a certain radius of the station the same way boat captains have access to information about ships surrounding port or aircraft captains can have information about aircraft within the control zone of the airport theyre about to takeoff from
lol its funny to look at all the people that are upset at the changes to ships values and effectiveness come on people we all know that every skill set and every investment in eve is going to change the only for sure thing about eve is that if you train for a skill you will get to use it until people start whining if you get a ship that is uber you get to keep your ship until people start whining i support this change or the change back i will buy anyones ms for 5 billion just mail me kbut look on the bright side ccp is waking up to the mistake they made in the first place capitals honestly resistance is futile i can remember the missle nerf changes that had over 100 pages of people signing to stop if they decide to  it will be done kanyhow good luck with getting it all fixedsignedbcsignedbc

currently applying 3 trimark armor pumps or shield extending rigs increases armorshield hitpoints respectively by 50 trimarks have low calibration cost and penalty isnt all that sever especially on large ships bc size and above ass those usually do not speedtank now lets look at weapon rigs you can only apply 2 of these rigs as there current calibration cost is 200 points they are only half as effective as a damage mod and have severe penalties fitting 2 of them will increase fitting cost of your guns by 20 which will  most fits and only is as effective as one damage mod  there is no point of having them on if you already have 2 or more damage mods on your ship due to stacking penalties to clearly demonstrate inferiority of these rigs i will demonstrate there application no drones as there damage would be currently irrelevant dps 821 effective hp 120571now lets see what happens if you place hybrid rigs instead notice that i had to drop heavy cap booster for a medium one meaning ship would become more susceptible to capacitor warfare dps 919 effective hp 90kthat is 30000 effective hp lost for about 80 dps it is clear that they simply arent worth it my suggestion on how to fix the situation upreduce calibration cost of the rigs allowing 3 of them to be fitted andmake them receive stacking penalties from stacking with eachother but not with damage mods already on the ship trimarks only increase in efficiency when stacked with plates and plating and eachother why shouldnt the damage rigs at least be just as efficient pros 1 allows for more diversity on the field in battleship combat rather then having every single battleship fitted with trimarks except for utility ships and very specialized setups making battles more fun 2 allows you to achieve 30 more damage output from your ship if you are ready to pay the price of having 30 more powerconsuming guns meaning you probably will not be able to fit much more on your ship 3 now when fitting your ship you have a choice of either getting 50 more armorshield buffer or having 30 more dps at the cost of powergrid still isnt perfect but it at least becomes a viable option in certain circumstances if someone thinks that they need even more of a boost i would agree with them but i would be happy even to see these changes

its very mediocre as it is sorting does not work properly ie sorting courier contracts by payoff and its probably largely why there is no really good business in hauling contracted stuff around for people since 90 of the contracts are traps and you cant filter out lownull sec systems or have such an excessively large collateral and tiny reward that its probably just not worth the riskbeing able to sort courier contracts by distance payoff collateral as well as some system of validating the contract issuers likeebay let people who completed the contract rate their employer and allowing filtering of lownull sec originsdestinations would invigorate the hauling mini profession and be attractive to newer players as wellanother idea is to introduce variable rewards ie pay more the faster its delivered to encourage smaller faster haulers to pick up contracts rather than fat freighters collecting them for a week before moving them

do you researchi mean really do it dont just google and be finethere is a very good proposal already on hereminmatar ship balance revisedif you are so worried about minmatar ships support that one rather than just complain how they lack in something that all together is just to vague to attract any serious attention and will just result in trolling
finished writing a revision to that proposal based on a compromise
so what we should get is a ship that is able to project a reflector shield around a teammates ship which is able to reflect missiles at 1020 rate back at the senders so 8090 still hits but every so often the missiles turn around and head back to their owner defence against this make sure the round trip on your missiles wont make it back to you kill the guy projecting this effecti suggest we call it the corbomite reflector
its called remote repping or shield transfer this would only make verbose something that is technically already in the game in a better formsure it does deflect entire missiles but deflecting 20 of all missiles is indirectly equal to deflecting 20 of all missile damage
adding artificial limits to the social aspect of the game is contrary to the sandbox concept ccp bases their marketing strategy on
something needs to be done to curb the ammount of highsec ganking going on jita is especially bad with a minimum of 20 gankers at any given time sitting outside of station there are several ways to curb this problem ill start with the overkill solution which i dont support but have herd people say concord anyone who targets a nonhostile target before you start fllameing me for that i dont support it another way is to make cargo scanning a concordable offence i have herd people counter this with a real life example of its not illegal to look at someone granted that is true but then again go open a womans purse and see if its worth killing her over and youll wind up in jail and my last thought on this is to make a rig or module that will counter the cargo scanners that can only be fitted to industrial class ships that require industrial ship skill this in effect will lower the major market hub population of gankers looking for easy isk rewards the problem of gankers in highsec market hubs is out of controll and something needs to be done to adress the issueas a recap here are my two ideas that i support for this topic1 cargoship scanning is concordable offence2 module or rig that will counter cargoship scanners to hide you cargomodules
jitas sec makes it aweful hard to gank in2ndly get in logistics ship and rr those being killed if succesful they lose isk gain nothing3rdly go steal the lewt before they can you gain isk they dont earn isk they wont suicide if they arent the one making isktons of options
i spend a lot of time in jita and move valuables in and out routinely  nobody has ever even attempted to gank me thereexcept one time i was an idiot and autopiloted a covops with half a bil in it afk the gank fleet outside jita 44 is usually privateers and similar groups hitting their war targets the freighter rotation point has concord on it like 1 of the time the actual station not much more the gates maybe a few percent stop throwing 20 bil into an untanked hauler and youll be fine

many thanks before applying i had the benefit of having taught a few pvp basic classes with agony unleashed which helped me gain confidence in public speaking and that then lead to me applying to be one of the at7 commentatorsif you had told me last year that i would have been standing on stage at fanfest for 90 minutes and actually enjoying it i wouldnt have believed you but little has changed im still teaching classes and still pvping when not writing campaign posts my aim with this campaign has been to encourage people to vote to show ccp they support the process of course i hope they think i am the right candidate to represent them but as long as people vote for somebody then i will be happy
this is a great tool dierdra and although i wont be using it as it doesnt cover alot of issues that i am covering i hope to see this tool developed further and used for future csms i wonder if theres someone at ccp we can bribe to adverte your site on the eve startup screen tamber
not sure how i missed this thread but i felt i needed to respond to thisno opiniondont care can also mean it is not important or fine as is you can abstain
no you cant  csm2 decided that and we continued this rule in csm3
csm2 didnt decide anything it was all rather dubious with just the loudmouths deciding that it was agreed upon which it was not plus its the most ed administrative thing the csm ever decided every normal council or parliament allows its members to abstain should be one of the top administrative things csm4 should fixand your vote match is very useful but your interpretation of neutral is fundamentally flawed as it always counts as a nonmatch thus it is always better to list a for or against opinion because then no matter what the players tick the candidate cannot lose more than you lose with a neutral but you can win 50 or 100 if the player happens to tick the same box a neutral is always counted as a lossnot my problem though z0d already optimized his spreadsheet i noticedin my opinion the amount of points should be decided based on how far away your opinion is so if you list neutral and the player ticks for then its 1 equal to if you say very for and the player just lists for for and against are two boxes apart because neutral is in between so thats 2 not 1 or whatever it is now
bah pyramid quoting my full post was eaten by the forum and i did not think the abstain comment needed further definition i guess i have to retype it first though the idea that you can not abstain from a vote is plain nutty i have never heard of such a thing i agree with ankhesentapemkah in that this should be something that is corrected with the first csm4 meetingany representative should have the ability to abstain from a vote simply at a basic level not everyone can know everything about everything an uninformed vote chosen with a flip of a coin is not beneficial to any sort of elected body now the response to this would be that every candidate should make the effort to understand every issue so they can make an informed vote it is always possible that a csm issue is of an arcane nature and you can not really come to a justifiable position on it i would rather have a counsel member abstain then make an uninformed vote in that situationthere is also the issue of having a conflict of interest there could be a situation where a consul member would abstain because their vote would be seen as self serving while this is a bit less likely within eve it still existsas to your valuation of the neutral position in your survey i have already stated my issue with your stance but i will requote ankhesentapemkahif you can game your survey then it is not functioning properlythanks for your timeashinaedit my comment about z0d is not intended to be a negative comment about him or what he did it is simply a statement that the survey as designed has an issue
you seem to have missed the pointyou are expecting people to come into low and zero security space on your terms and a lot of us are simply not interested you want us there you have to meet our requirements firstmany of us are tired of being cannon fodder for the current residents of low sec space this is as much your problem as it is ours if you get voted into the csm will you fight for more fairnerss or continued ganking by the bullies you need to represent the whole eve community not just the ones that control things at the momenttheres no mystique its fact you enter low sec space and you get ganked by the bullies it happened to me a couple of hours ago in 04
first everyone comes to lowsecnull sec on his or her own terms we each control ourselves and no one else if someone doesnt want to go to lownull sec he shouldnt go decline missions that send him there filter lownull sec from his market pretend it doesnt existbut when a person goes there will anyone else be there probably will they shoot at him or her probablybut that is because the default assumption in low sec is that strangers are going to shoot you rather than ignore you this destroys the threat of retaliation retaliation as a deterrent relies on the assumption that not hindering a person wont draw ire if that ire is coming regardless i have more incentive to ruin every nonfriend then to ignore thembecause of that i dont go to low sec unless1 i am in an agile ship or one of my covert ops ships2 i am in forcefirst there is no argument ccp will accept to enact a game adjustment to fix what you want changed that is making low sec policed by concord so that people dont gank indiscriminately that has to be a player driven change specifically start a roving player managed policemercenary force that sets known pirates to red and goes after them that is the emergence ccp wantsadditionally there are nrds alliances in null sec i recommend you get in touch with them about the policing of one or more routes through low sec to connect them to empire space i am sure those alliances would be thrilled if someone would step forward to organize such a groupwill i vote for bully buffs i will vote for things that i think will improve the game so they must make sense to me i think that insurance shouldnt be paid out if a player has a global crimes timer going that is a huge bully nerf i am for sharing aggro to the active fleet mixed corp fleets and fleets with nonplayer corp members could now share aggro this would reduce wrong global crime timers i am also against low sec warp bubblessimilarly i think firing on a player with a global crimes counter should be fully legal i think this should still give a yellow timer though this would encourage good samaritan behavior you see someone getting attacked the game shows you who has the gc timer you attack that guy because he is the aggressori think it is important that people understand and accept that high sec is opt in on pvp low sec is opt out that is to say in high sec you take action to engage in pvp barring suicide ganks in low sec you have to take action to opt out if you want to avoid pvp in low secnull sec you have to stay mobile andor hiddenevery ship and the one pod i have lost in low sec were cases where i didnt opt out actually i was part of the sak wolfpack so we were looking for pirateseve is fair if a group is picking on you there is nothing innate to the game preventing you from getting a bigger group to pick back when you enter low sec the only authority that matters is the authority players create and enforceif you are asking me if i will vote to make low sec into high sec policed by concord my answer is nothere are two types of game issues ccp issues and player issues ccp cant solve player issues
i am new to the game and had the pleasure of meeting ahsekuaw in the help channel he set me up with some of his crew that took me on missions and spent time showing me things from manually piloting my ship to setting up my training q to maximize the bonus period i was hardly able to complete a level one when i met ahsekuaw and flying a merlin now thanks to his crew i am flying level twos and threes in my almost t2 thorax this game is very hard meeting someone like this made it doable and enjoyable thank you ahsekuaw and crew much apreciated
cool my vote for yourebalance dictors pls
o
signedbut i think we should stay calm ccp obviously has some good reason for it to do soso ccp please give us response on this change to the supercarrier
congrats yes it is possible to blow people up who loot your missions whoda thunk and it promotes player interaction as well as a sense of accomplishment when you do so good show mate it beats just whining about it ehnow as for a csm candidate bashing my my thread and the people i support with stories of epeen wagging now that just shows poor judgement hopefully you will show more should you be voted into office
is this just an fyi post or is there a point to itbesides the vote for logit bit at the end which could have been posted in the other thread suspiciously lacking content that you created recently
alt posting anonymity ftw amirite hmmmthis is a fyi post that pinpoints a candidate whos core ideals are to remove your options from the game this is what we  and what everyone including you  should be fighting againstid say that it contains plenty of content
noso wait your against logit orthat was the problem lots of content couldnt find a point in it though i was under the impression that ccp had the say in the direction of the game not the csm was i wrongedit spelling annoying teh
wait i think ive got ityour against stormaxe titanothereand for logit whosisnamerightwhy because you think if the other guys get in that there going to remove ninja salvagingit seems odd that you would devote your time to something such as the sandbox prevention urm preservation party even though it will never serve the purpose it was formed to its not like if ccp decide to change something this drastic there going to run it by you firsti guess i can see what you were trying to do but obviously little to no thought went into its endgamethe numbers are against you anyway more people dislike ninjasalvaging than like it so if it ever came down to that youd still loseas for the whole csm election thing people will vote in who they want your creation of vote this person or else this happens threads is yet another waste of timewhile your dedication to logit is admirable to a degree continous posting of vote logit threads simply makes you look like his alt and therefore nullifies your support of himi wont be voting because i just like to play the game as delivered by ccp but some people obviously care a lot more so good luck to all the candidates and there supporters
unless your in an alliance your an altalso isnt every forum post on the interwebs no matter the reason made in anonymityedit post with your main
first considering my post included the follow up fight where i lost my ship to that pilgrim pilots navy mega i dont really see it as epeen wavingsecond people of differing viewpoints will read this thread some will take umbrage with your position and candidate i have no stance on you candidate i do have an in game issue with your position a reader that does not agree with you may like to know of a counter vote for the csm you promoting your candidate would not have gotten that vote in the first place and this discussion keeps the thread bumped which gives more exposure to everyone involved even the csm candidate that you are railing against as to the last bit part of the reason i posted about the tears pilgrim loss is so that readers can see that you can fight back even more important is that if you fight back you will not be bothered again since the intention of ninjas and can flipper is to kill easy targets not have real fightssorry to harp on this but one of the main things i do in eve is teach people to not be victims with a little guts and some skill you can get the piratey types to leave you alone some people learn this others dontpersonally i luv ninjas there arnt enough of them too few to rack up any decent number of kill mails ok now that is a bit of epeen waving 
bwahahahahaha i cant believe you actually suggested that vp and logit probit are the same person they run two huge competing ninja salvager operations how long have you played eve
on a 1  10 scale how well do you think the new csm and past csms performed according to all their promises of what they would do and what they accomplished during their termpersonally i thinkcsm 1 4csm 2 2csm 3 1csm 4 2 imo ofc 
you think csm1 was really the best one way too much drama for my tastes im more a fan of csm2  aside from pattern going awol it seemed to work fairly smoothly all told and its the one that got us our skill queue so thats worth at least a point on its own and while i dont think any of them earn 1010 ratings i think youre being far too pessimistic as for csm4 ill be on it so itll clearly be a 10 if not an 11
wasnt going to post in this butmarlona sky that sig image is hysterical
friend of mine made it for me
so here i am again im maybe the only independent candidate not related to a megablob hopefully all voters vote whatever they want rather than following the needs of their alliance leadershipirl im from norway and im the youngest csm candidate at the age of 21ig im in my early 30s and im a citizen of the caldari state my current position is as ceo of northern intelligence i spend most of my time in 00 space but have also been spending some time in lowsecurity i and we in northern intelligence have been involved with the following alliances stain alliance stain empire veritas immortalis smash alliance and a few roaming alliancesi run a nobull policy as politics in general revolvs around walls of text with no real answers ill simply give you a yes or no with reasoning behind it that a normal person can be arsed to read
not wanting to be picky but even a cursory glance over the candidate list shows your opening statement to be false yes i see the question mark but you are still insinuating that it is trueif you look at the candidate list you will see at least 1520 candidates not in an alliance or such as myself in a small alliance with a little more research on the people in alliances it could be that 13 to 12 of the candidates are also independent and not related to a megablob i wish you luck with your campaign but if you truly are running on a no bull platform then you might want to check your facts before making such sweeping statements
i think i see teadazes point of view while i dont agree with it in one of his posts above ref privateer post he cuts to the heart of the matter he notes that fw may be i think i understand if not allow us into fw how about allowing us to war dec the 24th imperial crusade then while i dont at all speak for my leaders i think they would welcome the ability to grease the wheels of justice for the privilege of fighting slavers in empire space without concord interference
omber zombie mentioned something along these lines but ccp wont let that happenedit i still think roleplaying should be able to fully participate and be able to capture complexes as well with the hefty standing requirements to prevent lolster alliances from ruining it then again we have established already that ccp is totally clueless about fw matters and just dabble around throwing darts at a chart and tweaking random things which surprisingly dont work

id love a font something like twentyone or abtechia though it would want to support the full gamut of european alphabets including punctuation and numbers
fully supporting the idea of activating repping modules counting as aggression and preventing ships from jumping or dockingbut pitboss just one question  if you have to divide your attention between two ships doesnt that mean that the guy youre shooting gets to shoot you for free anyway along with any drones that the logistics guy will now be deploying since hes already got the aggression timer
supporting discussion but not supporting modification to reduce chance of probing wrecks in deadspacejust make wrecks hard to find overall so that it will be faster for a carebear tears hunter to simply scan for dronesships folks who are genuinely only interested in abandoned wrecks can happily probe for wrecksthen theres the issue of abandoned wrecks implying that wrecks are at some point in time claimed in most cases the mission runner will complete the mission then come back with a mwdcapable salvage boat  unless the wrecks have already been salvaged inmissionjust leave out the discussion of abandoned wrecks leave out the issue of intent with respect to wrecks both from the mission runners who create them and the salvagers looking for them and the outcome becomes clear simply allow wrecks to be probed down regardless of where they exist just make wrecks harder to probe than drones or ships since both of those entities are active and must logically be easier to find on the same order as wormholes or the highervalue gravimetric sitesid also make wrecks probable using core rather than combat probes or perhaps they can be only detectable using deep space probes but then im also of the opinion that combat probes should only be able to probe ships and drones so one has to make a decision about what theyre looking for the old system of questsifteretc probes made life interesting for explorers you had decisions to make and those decisions would affect the outcome of your game these days there is no decision  just deploy combat probes and start with the first thing you get a 100 resolution on this is arcade style gameplayanyhow ive probably ranted enough
big thumbs up from me
 and adding a neat search box like in your items list aswell while ccp is at it
you can use the filters to partially achieve this
its just annoying
put it back to the zero delay please it sucks in its current state
i agree a strip harvester to use on the skiff would be excellent gas harvester upgrade modules for the low slots on any ship would make it even better
we require more vespine gas

starting to consider buying a console seeing that all pc fps games are now cheap broken ports of console versionsdust 514 will be the product that tips the balance and sends me towards consoleshowever i am unable to make the decision to purchase without a clearer understanding of how servers work for these gamesdust 514 specificallylack of local australia dedicated servers or lowplayer count p2p mp will likely be a dealbreakeras such im very interested in more information on how this all worksclear information on this point will make the sale
more fibre does help as we have a lot of satellite in our bandwidth mix however the speed of light is constant and distance is the real factor in the latencywith the restricted amount of international bandwidth it also means our local bandwidth is somewhat restricted by telcos not wanting to break the bank with users who download too much internationallyas such southernhemisphere fps players must play with other southernhemisphere players on dedicated serversp2p servers dont work well at all with the limited upstream local bandwidth provided to home usersan australian or new zealand player connecting to a us or uk server would be 250500ms behind the other players this amount of latency in an fps which relies on reaction time is completely unacceptable to players as such these users only play on local dedicated serversremote centralised or p2p options will fail for users from our end of the world and the product will be completely unusable to us
i think the changes being made warrant reintroducing the following ive posted it before and its gotten good responses but the problem is ongoing and will become worse in the next expansiontldr read the quote box belowbackgroundscenario my corpalliance is at war intel has indicated that one of the hostiles is camping a particular station one of our members engages hostilities commence in both directions both sides are warpscrambled we send in reinforcements and the battle swings our way the hostile stops firing then docks a short time later he undocks a few seconds later fully repaired and engages again then stops waits out his timer and redocks repeatwelcome to docking games 101 a tactic that allows players to exploit a mechanic to engage in virtually riskfree pvp who needs stabs when you can simply dock at any time traditionally this tactic is most common in empire wars and is one of the key factors in making empire wars far more dull than they have any right to be it is also not uncommon to see such docking games played with dreadnaughts or carriers in lowsec systemsbut with the changes to sovereignty in the upcoming dominion patch the problem becomes magnified under the new system a challenge to sovereignty requires the attacker to disable any outpost in the system among other things this requirement will bring the art of the docking game to new heights or more accurately depthsset aside the scenario above where each side has perhaps a handful of battlecruisers and battleships the dominion docking game will involve potentially hundreds of battleships capital ships or even supercapitals on each side except that now the defender can simply fight in the shadow of their station docking up when they take aggro to repair the damage and the repairs are free since the outpost owner can control the repair feescan you imagine the results the defender is fielding a titan which cannot dock along with a sizeable fleet of carriers the carriers repair the titan until they are declared primary by the attackers dread fleet at which point that carrier deaggros docks repairs for free then undocks and resumes repairs meanwhile the titan is destroying an attacking dreadnaught every few minutes motherships would also fare well in this environment being able to dock to repair as neededsovereighty wars in such an environment will be one of the least amusing features of the game in a long time and i include lag on that list
no i like my matari ships the way they are especially my 1kdps permatank claymore p
do you realize that you are making the best carrier into the worst carrier by doing this
maelstrom can tank easily over 1k dps for a long read longer than most fights time by burning cap boosters while still outputting upwards of 800 dps without overheating guns this is comparable to a hyperion etc does not need fixing the only thing in this whole thread i support is to remove the sleip active tank bonus i prefer to run them passive but then again many people dont so best to leave that alone too
the active tank capiblies of any previously active tanked ships will not changethe active tank capiblies of any previously active tanked ships will not changeive made no changes to the archoni assure you that this is not true also have you seen the new bonuses to the helhigh slotmid slotlow slotall those ships receive an additional mid a cruise missile phoon will still be better than a 1200mm tempest even with 847 that and the fact that there is already an abundance of turreted battleships with 7 lows the 866 slot layout would keep the tempests current performance in armour however now it is able to shield tank to the same effectiveness as the raven whilst keeping lows free for tracking mods nanos andor gyros whilst the phoon and maelstrom become the tankersshow me a cap stable nidhoggur with 2 remote reps even a triage setup and itll show you a cap stable archon with 3 reps as many cap mods and more ehpbetter personal tank theres no use repping 25 more if you die or cap out pretty early an extra mid would help in this regard
what the tempest really needs is 1300 more base grid then if its still crap maybe another turret hardpoint if yes then it also needs another 2600 grid on top to fit said turret or up the damage bonus to 7510 per level for some reason ccp doesnt want to do any of these simple fixes though so people come up with a ton of different and sometimes dumb ideasthis idea is new and doesnt do anything to overpower said ships just gives them more different fitting configurations it should give medium slots tempestmaelstrom but for example only when you have the battleship skill at level 5 this would also be something unique to minmatar ships now that theyve nearly completely lost their speed advantageyes vagabond is still speedy compared to other races cruisers but its the only exception and also not in this proposal also itd probably be best to limit this change to tempest only and do some maths and see where it takes it other ships mentioned are already good anywayalso nids are the best triage its their tiny niche and it should stay that way imoi do like the extra mid on tempest and no rof but instead a 10 damage bonus this gives a huge alpha and you keep the 2 utility high slots if it also gets a little bit more grid just 1300 itd be a lowish range but high alpha shieldtank sniper decent not op like an apoc not awesome like a rokh but still usable and with a nice alpha niche
supported although im a bit cautious regarding the tempest changes and the removing of ship boni in general though the mid would open up versatility i admit i somehow would miss somethingimho the maelstrom should stay the alpha boat leaning more toward arties and the tempest should be the damage over time aka dps boat leaning more toward acsimho the tempest shoud be the most agile and fast bs on the field and dictate range among the bs a high agility speed and decent shield tank and acs
all ships have 2 bonuses for each skill stop being stupid in the name of making your race more flexible dont touch my ships as i for one am happy with minmatar and will be happier after dominion
signed 1000x the minnie bss struggle to do anything well and the active tanking bonuses are singularly useless in all races above cruiser and even there theyre dubious since most simply dont in pvp
all the nidhoggur needs is some more cpu so you can swap those faction mods with t2 ones and maybe some more ehp so its more inline with other three carriers
unless they already had a shield boost amp equipped of course but who cares about the third module you equip on an active shield tank its not like any of these ships had three mids before right
quoting stupiditymaelstromxlarge shield booster iiheavy cap booster iiinvulnerability field iiinvulnerability field iishield boost amp iishield boost amp iiwith active tanking bonus at lvl 5 xlarge shield booster iiheavy cap booster iiinvulnerability field iiinvulnerability field iishield boost amp iishield boost amp iishield boost amp iinow however if you dont want to active tank say you want to passive tank or snipe you have an additional slot instead of a wasted bonus
yes it does pvp fit especially sliepclay with its active tank need that tanking bonus more than the extra midslot which would likely be used for some other utility purposepve sliep or clay means the change is irrelevanti can kinda see your point with the mael mainly cos active tanking pvp battleships make me cry but again for pve purposes the change is irrelevantgotta consider the whole field here
i like this idea the thought of not wasting a bonus on a sniper maelstrom is appealing
is it really that hard to understandwhen you put a shield boost amp in your new mid slot your as effective as you where with less mids and the tanking bonus plusminus a few percentholy  what is wrong with people
the archon might be the best carrier for lowsec docking game bull but for fleetwork the nidhoggur is outright superior because of the remote rep bonus and the ability to rep both armour and shield at range an archon in a fleet is of limited value if the hostiles have primaried a shield tanking ship and is worthless for repping pos shields
in most fleets with rr support shield tanking ships are set to armour even chimeras these days are armour tanked the pos shield is one situation id use the nighoddur over a an archon but even then with the extra mid the ability to either fit eccm cap recharger sensor booster or point offers a lot more flexibility especially when you put into consideration the natural cap benefits the other ships have over it
i think your missing my point while the extra mid with a boost amp would theoretically have the same effect there is no point in changing the bonus into the extra midslot because its a waste of coding and developer effort that has the exact same result
the difference is instead of being forced into active tanking setups you now have a choiceadded effectiveness in other setups that do not use a shield booster eg sniping passiveshield rr support etc
what if i dont want to active tank my mael
actually you are wrong moving the ship bonus to an extra shield boost amp as shown in your example would not provide the same bonus due to diminishing returnsnot supported id rather replace  bonuses with good bonuses
due to stacking  stacking penalties it works out to be 3 less which can be overcome with better modulesfeel free to come up with better bonuses btw seems like people like to fly the ship in different ways giving people the slots to better utilities the ship in they matter they choose is what change accomplishes
wrong again  the stacking penalty on the third sba reduces it to about 205 bonus from 36i will refrain from insulting your intelligence as you have been so quick to do to others in this thread
in ccps thinking a single 10 damage bonus is equal to two 5 damage bonuses see the claw so its likely that in their view the tempest proposal would not fly as in their mind it would keep the equivalent of two bonuses at the same time as gaining a slotsecondly giving up a bonus in return for a slot seems like a unequal exchange on the one hand using the slot for tanking will often incur a stack penalty which ship bonuses do not on the other if it is used for utility then surely it would be just as poor as you suggest it is on the tempestsba example on patterns maelstrom fit xl booster ii  ship bonus  lvl v  2 sba  1473 shield for 360 cap or around 41 shield to cap efficiency xl booster ii  3 sba  1291 shield for 360 cap or around 351 shield to cap efficiency its less bad for a 1 sba fit which would become a 2 sba fit under your proposal true but other potential uses like trying to emulate a rokhlike buffer fit also fail the stack nerf test
apologies it appears to be a 104 difference in active tanking abilities however i wouldnt lose sleep over this fact if given the slots 840 8 slot shield tank vs 938 7 slot tank  boost bonusi try not to design ships and bonuses based on what the ccp might think as there perfectly capable of breaking there own rules when given the encouragementthis is really a compromise i know exactly what lots and bonus id like on my tempest so does the next person but overall there really isnt any agreement on what the slotsbonuses should be so the best solution seems to be to give the players the slots to decide how best to use there shipslike i said to the last guy feel free to come up with your own bonusesslot layouts get universal agreement that it doesnt suck and campaign for the changes
i think you are confused
change the bonus to boost both local and rr for shield and armor reps
i just think you are heading in the wrong direction by removing bonuses and replacing them with slots imo bonuses have more to do with a given ships viable roles than slots although slots certainly have an impact as well by cutting bonuses from ships we would indeed make them more versatile but we would also lose ship individuality i believe it is intended that given ships be cornered into certain rolesfor example your proposed changes to the sleipnir would probably make it a better passive tanked ship than the nighthawk while still retaining superior speedfirepower your sleipnir would not just gain a new viability it would replace other ships that currently fit that roleoften a given ships limitations are as important as its bonuses
in the instances you just mentioned im pretty indifferent however the restrictiveness of an active tanking bonus when compared to resistance based bonuses is astonishing that combined with capiblities that provide absolutely no synergy with either the ship class role or racial traits the actual ones not the perceived onesso 3 bonuses thenalso without first reducing the cpu usage of shield rr so that t1 hulls can first begin to contemplate fitting these modules good luck with a decent fitas it stands with more than double t1 battleships are armour tankers without increasing the number of shield tanking battleship platforms shield rr bonuses on a battleship hull will be even more situational than a local tank bonus like i said what works for you probably wont for everyone else
maybe but as weve proved in other venues you have a much more optimistic view of how they handle ship design and balance changes than i do ill admit that i can be harshly negative in my opinion but considering recent events ive seen nothing to reignite my faith in that part of the dev teami was thinking more generically for my second point one test would be to extend the idea to other races for example im dubious that rokh pilots would want to give up their shield resist bonus for another midslot i cant say that with any authority thoughive been doing some thinking and i think that the key to doing it would be to take a leaf from the amarr and caldari books and give the tempest and maelstrom their own roles as opposed to what we have at the moment which are two ships which directly compete with each otherat the moment the typhoon more than adequately fulfils the close range tUFFFDtalhelldeath machine role as i think that neither ccp or minmatar players would be happy with the idea of electronic warfare or other support roles with their battleships it suggests additional combat roles perhaps one being a lightweight midrange kiter and the other being the longrange alpha sniper leading to thoughts oftempest 757 7 turrets 1 launcher 5 rof  n falloff n being a balanced value in line with how autocannons will perform postdominion reduced mass boosted speedmaelstrom 865 8 turrets 5 damage  5 optimal enough grid to fit 8x 1400 ii  mwd without grid mods the ship will still have to use more mods to achieve fleet range than an apoc or rokh and in return shouldnt have to fret about fitting modsniddy doesnt need changing seriously hel and naglfar are in a limbo of being messed around with by multiple devs although id like to see the nag changed to 5 turret rof  5 turret damage with capital projectiles balanced for competitive performance at dread iv as at the moment the oversized bonuses impose too large of a dps difference between iv and v vargyrs value will change with the autocannon changes so its tricky to say how that will pan outregardless of what people might think about my specifics i hope ill get some agreement on the statement that unless proposed changes are composed with specific roles in mind then consensus will be impossible to gain and the hulls will be doomed to mediocrity ill certainly think seriously about supporting other proposals that fit that criteria
thisalthough i would add that vague ship design can also lead to ships that infringe on the roles already held by other ships as in my example of the nighthawk vs the sleipnir theres a reason ships have bonuses rather than being blank slates diversity is a good thing
not really sure myself yet the dominix with t2 wardens does about the same dps as a raven with wrath cruises thats with drone dps only two sentry damage rigsto be fair garde sentries have much less range but higher tracking than any other sentry on the flip side most npcs which is what i have most experience shooting have weaknesses to kintherm expkin or emtherm where thermal is a weakness its only a secondary weakness most t2 ships have weaknesses to explosive or em with thermal as a secondary weakness although thermal drones have more damage output by the time you take resistances into account youre far better off using the right drone or missile for the specific weakness of the enemyand now that i think of it i should take my rook and drake out for a spin to figure out if the kinetic damage bonus isnt already applied to all missile types anyway
thats not a bonus thats a trap for the unwary the only noncal ships that are like this with actual usable bonuses are the bombers you have to know about a hole far enough in advance to bring the ammo just how many people flying cerbs or kestrels in pvp load up on alternate ammo in advance of the fight itd be handy for lowend missioners but thats not a field i care much about balance inas long as its doable by new players and not worth farming for cash by old ones im probably happy drone and projectile pilots can both switch damage types both take a hit to dps doing so but they both get compensationsdrone speed drone hp if another issue of mine ever gets taken up by the csm gun range missile users also take a dps hit but they get no compensations except pure typeswitching as above you gain things switching drone types  actual stats not just typeswitching if explo missiles traveled 25 faster em missiles were immune to smartbombs and lol defenders and thermal missiles got 10 dps 10 speed and double hp id be fine with kin missiles getting 25 dps and the others not of course thats crazy for other reasons but you see my point they dont get anything like that at all so i propose this change instead
you are the only onehowever i do like the idea of making the kinetic bonuses apply to all missiles so can fit assaults etc
i always bring different ammo typesits really not that hard youre not being penalized for switching damage types youre just not using the bonused damage type i dont see why you think youre getting penalized for switching types it doesnt say 5 explosive damage per level or anything you just get 5 extra for kineticprojectiles start out with lower base damage than other systems and are many times forced to fight in falloff these are drawbacks for using all types of ammo along with losing dps by switching ammo typesone thing i cant believe ive forgotten about but you just reminded me of until 15 of your damage can be almost instapopped by cruisers and below dont say that getting speed and hp bonuses to drones in place of dps is an advantage drone users are at such a disadvantage in the fact that drones are very very easily poppedi think you got it right when you said lol defenders as above drones are very very eaasily popped by all sorts of ships so that kinda makes up for the fact that they all get bonused and get speed additions instead of the dps and such i havent seen anybody use defenders plus missiles get bcus drones are purely skill based i personally think both systems are balanced disregarding the myrmidon of course but were not talking about that
on an unrelated note i have always found it odd that missiles specialize in kinetic damage and bullets specialize in explosive this seems at least a bit mixed up to me
ccp makes me frownfor some reason they need like 9 months to make a minor change to any ship
i dont even fly amarr ships but the retribution is one i could possibly fly with a couple of weeks of training if ccp is not going to add a mid slot and remove a high there is one other possibility which would still drive many to emorage tears but you cant please them allremove the optimal range bonus and add a neutnos bonus this would solve the lack of tackle problem nicely since with a 50 improved neut bonus at af 5 you can turn off other ships abs mwds scrammers webbers etc quite quickly and drain their cap fast enough to prevent them from warping off it would of course remove the retributions ability to snipe but would make it better at 1v1 pvp
grath telkin have you ever flown the ret as an avid flyer of the retribution i can say that beyond a shadow of a doubt it is clearly one of the best assault frigates in eve your standard fit with the retribution will usually have around 70 sustained armor defense with around 200 dps and an optimal that makes interceptors shudder with fear at just the site of one of these bad boys the retributions power doesnt come from dps or tank alone its a subtle mix of the two adding up to one kick ass little frigate many say it needs one more midslot but in all honesty an addition like that would make it so overpowered it wouldnt be funny the retribution isnt a heavy tackler or whatever you said it should be its a god damn anti frigate platform 1v1 no af in the game can beat it and that is the truth
supported i can handle a nerf if you can at least let them do 2 fighters per level and allow the super carriers to dock having a character wasting away in space in a ship thats no longer worth jack scrap is not how people are going to want to play the game

thats not a bad idea
im downcurrently the ew the bonuses apply to make the target either boned or they are fine so what is the point of making them 10 more screwedat the moment you could probably count on one hand the number of gangs that use information warfare links in a fight they are simply 100 times better off taking one of the other three gang bonusesits time to see the eos shineop please put this in the ideas and stuff thread as well so maybe ccp will comment as i dont think they comment at all really on assembly hall
i support this the one problem i can see though is that this has the potential to draw large alliances out of nullsec into the fw arena along with all the problems that nullsec warfare entails massive blobfests of hundreds if not thousands of ships capital heavy fleets lag even more epeening than is currently the case etci agree that the lag problem must certainly be fixed first

or just remove the stacking penalty from both damage rigs and damage mods as it stands tank beats gank 910 times which is pretty lame poor game design imo wheres this risky universe where you can get get killed anytime anywhere hm it most certainly aint eve thats for sure
somthing i would like to see would be a tec 2 destroyer that would be a match for a assault ship somthing between a as and a hac perhaps called a medium assault ship current tec 2 destroyers while moderatly useful for their bubble gimic are no threat to assault ships and only a moderat threat to most of the other tec 2 frigs
yes with a damage bonus and assault ship resists more grid and cpu as well
while ive always enjoyed my destroyers for level 2s ive always wished they would be more useful than just for salvagingits a bit hard to justify training destroyers to v for interdictorsthis would make it more likely
while a cloaker is cloaked and immobile or at constant velocity not speed he dissapears from local chat that means if the cloaker wants to keep the system under constant alert he himself must remain alert or at least at the keyboard as soon as the cloaker moves ie warps changes speed andor direction etc cloaker reappears in local chatthis should be a somewhat winwin for everyone involved while at the same time forcing all players to remain actively on keyboard the cloaker can still go afk for bathroom breaks talk on the phone change the babys diaper etc and since the cloaker is afk he no longer and rightfully so has no influence in play as soon as hes back he can continue his terror spree but must remain at the keyboardthread
1 i doubt ccp will be willing to implement this  the coding will be too weird 2 people dont want cloakers disappearing from chat  theyd much rather know about the stealth bomber coming to gank them than not 3 find object orbit at like 212km your vector is constantly changing so you stay in local but theres no chance of you getting caught sorry man i dont think this is a good solution at all not supported
ill address points 2 and 3 as i have no idea what kind of coding would be required to implement this changethis in particular is what needs changing it is perfectly fine that cloakers influence and terrorize a system keeping it in a high state of alert that is their purpose however i believe this should be the case only while the cloaker himself is at the keyboard as soon as he goes afk to do whatever his ability to influence the activities of active players should cease basically if hes not actively playing he should not be able to actively influence others keep a system in high alertand even though the cloaker still has zero risk while cloaked he would now be forced to remain active there is absolutely nothing wrong with forcing the cloaker to be at the keyboard while still being able to keep a system under active alertand to answer your question as soon as the cloaker becomes active again he reappears in local chat allowing everyone to go into a high state of alert once again it would be no different from a hostile jumping in through a gateas an added bonus to the cloaker he now has the ability to be completely incongnito while not in play as for the system itself as long as the player is inactive afk they dont have to suspend their normal daytoday activities for the entirety of the unwelcomed visiti dont think this would be difficult at all you could add an exception as a code that removes the cloaked pilot from local chat if the orbit command is activated
not supporting tt
not supported for the 10235658th time
not supportedhowever when you state and since the cloaker is afk he no longer and rightfully so has no influence in play would you agree that afk empire haulers also would not have any influence in play
what is a real shame is that afk empire hauling carries greater risk than afk cloaking i should thank you for proving my point further you see in this case the ones acting like carebears are the 237 afk cloakers by keeping systems in high alert while they themselves are not even required to be in front of a screenim not even asking to have the risk increased to afk cloaking so you can relax your profession will remain riskfree  im proposing a change that rightfully invalidates influence when the player has gone afk if the cloaker is afk then he is cleared from local chat the cloaker remains invulnerable and the system has no need to remain in a high state of alert for 23 hours per day while the cloaker is presentto answer your question more clearly yes the afk hauler is still influencing eve and heres the kicker the afk hauler is still susceptible to the influence of others suicide ganking etcmy proposal is attacking one problem only if a cloaker is going to intimidate a system for 23 hours per day 7 days per week then he shall be forced to be at the keyboard for 23 hours 7 days per week that is all
you can choose to be intimidated or notit wont matter either way
working as intended
hmm i can choose to love i can choose to hate i can choose to wear red but as your response it is all irreleventhaving active hostiles heightening the security of a system is a valid tactic the ability to do this while also being afk is unlike eve i dont expect this to sit well with some of you and the fact is you as a cloaker can still go afk but not only would you like the ability to go afk for 23 hours you also want to continue to degrade the security of your enemy all while watching tv or sleeping and your response is they can choose not to worry the choice youre referring to of course them slacking their security  profit for nothinganyway just thought id offer my 2 cents on the matter
i wrote a nice mature reply to your response a few posts up and you follow it up with this
so what youre saying is your argument is irrelevantok makes sense to metry making sound arguments before you start coming up with counter arguments you just shot yourself in the foot if not the leg as welldont look at me pal you chose the words i just responded in such a way to get you to realize that your arguing over something pointlessi mean think about this how do you know they are afkthat is entirely an assumption for all you know the guy is sitting there watching waitingyou might want to put a little more thought time into this before you come down here and emorage about something as simple as mind warfare
so im in my nyx in a ratter system i sit 13km from the warpin of the middle belt not on a warp in direction ratter comes along im cloaked not in local ratter warping to belt as shown by directional scanners i decloak immediately hes either given a heartattack seeing a nyx appear suddenly on his local or landing into a belt with someone when he knew 3 seconds ago wasnt even in the system my shadow serp sebo is going my 30km point has him dead to rights hes doneif this is possible nobody will ever go do stuff in 00 anymore
i dont know what youre arguing however i can tell you what i am proposing or at least make it clearer to understandi am not i repeat not proposing to nerf afk cloaking you can still afkcloak for 23 hours per day if you wish you can afkcloak without worries you will still remain invulnerable p what i am proposing is that while you are afkcloaked you do not have influence over your surroundings i am not acting out of line here and i am not proposing an outrageous idea if you are not at the keyboard then you do not get to deprive a system from mining and pvea parked cloaked ship has a purpose it keeps a system on its toes and why not it should be on its toes there are hostiles on the system what i do not agree with is an afk player influencing an entire systemi know what youre thinking if hes afk what does it matter and my response is if hes afk youre right it does not matter the problem manifests itself when trying to distinguish whether a player is at the keyboard or the player is afk not even playing the game my proposal allows the cloaker to go afk for as long as he wishes while allowing the defending system to run business as usual if the cloaker wishes to disrupt business as usual then it can still be accomplished the only difference is that the cloaker must be playing the gamei know an outrageous proposal p how dare i suggest the cloaker be at the keyboard playing
fair enough but your proposal is entirely based on an assumptionyou cannot and will not beyond all reasonable doubt prove said player is even afk let alone cloaked or any of the abovespace is vast lots of places to hidetry spending 3 weeks in whs and then youll figure it out real quickthe point im trying to get across to you is this is not a problem its only a problem when you make it suchif there is an afk cloaker in system then there is how you react and treat him is entirely up to youany good operation in mining or pve requires constant attention and observing of your surroundings it dosent matter if someone is afk cloaked or notwhile your proposal seems fair there will never be a solution granted to it because we cloakers here i fly covert ops frigates frequently and stealth bombers now cant just sit there and remain cloaked all of the time we have to make sure people dont get too closeyet we cant be too far away or we cant get any good intelligenceits not as easy as it looks it just seems that wayits all mental warfareyou keep pointing out that its free reign intimidation and as ive pointed out to you you choose to be intimidated or notyou call it irrelevant i pointed out you said itis it a problem not to me if we have an intruder we act accordingly and just pay attention evetaully we may call it as an afk and go back to work but we make sure people understand there is a riskbut in reallity the risk is still the same with or without the afk cloakerwhich is why this is a whine postso while you dare to call the afker to be interacting with the computer will i think its fair that all afkers be required to be interacting with the computerso that includes 1 haulers on auto pilot2 miners who afk mine3 afk missioning yep they do4 5 you open this door people are gonna demand balance to the systemso while i respect your position keep in mind that your not going to get very farps i know what its like to deal with afk cloakers so i afk cloak right back difference is in whs you still have to leave some time granted in low sec00 your dealing with gates but still set up a nice little trap
i still fundamentally fail to see how people can be intimidated by one person cloaked in a safespot afki mean honestly harden the  up grow a spine and get on with playing
bumping a proposal with no negative replies
i like this i see no way in which this would adversely affect game play and it should improve it for some
support of highsec nerf
highsec nerf are you high manwere going from frig rats to battleship ratsfrom low cost veld to that high end crap null getswere going to get awesome probe sites now with a chance to drop awesome faction modsyes give hi sec the improvements null sec is gettingat least the ppl in highsec are not too lazy to use them
high sec can have the same isk making potential if i can take a roaming gang to jita and motsu and continuously kill without any concord retribution or criminal timersmutant if you have more isk than me it is because there is almost no risk to what you do to make money
faction who cares about faction bring in the officer mods and you have enlightened me i too support this idea
okas im sure that most who are in an alliance that there is nothing more annoying than getting an alliance mail of importance to then find every tom or harry replying to that mailyou box flashes then its upto the alliance ceo to delete all the crapcan we not have a system where either you can set who can post in corpalliance mail or a simpler answer is an option when sending an alliance or corp mail you can tick a box to not allow replies to be sent to alliancecorp mailboxwhat you think
we have this its called fines from the directoratebooted from corp if you dont pay i think it costs 100m to send alliance mail for most big alliances
go on singularity they have a new mail system on there its freaking sweet  finally bringing evemail into the 1990s i havent tested it too thoroughly but im pretty sure it solves this problem
or just fix defenders so they affect any missiles targeted at your ship
a better solution would be to target missiles from any of the targetted ships that way a ship set up with defenders could act as a missile shield for a team mate by targetting the ships firing at itsince youd need a lot of defenders firing to provide enough of a defense it means an fc who wants this kind of missile shield is commiting a ship to a defensive role to protect a higher value target a drake with defenders shooting down citadel torps fired at a carrier nice protection against the tops but the moros will still nail it
why is jita laggy because people keep going there until it lagswhy are fleet fights laggy because adding more people to a fleet brings an advantage right up to the point that the server collapses under the load ie because people keep going there until it lagsthe way to prevent huge fleet fights is to reduce the benefit of having huge blobs reducing the number of people you have in a corp is not going to have any effect at all on how many people get involved in fleet fightsif the processors were fast enough blobs could be nerfed by using lineofsight rules weapons hit the first solid thing in their line of fire as opposed to 1400mm shells passing magically through the hulls of friend and foe alike until they magically hit the targetfleet fights are big and laggy because by nature fleets get bigger until the lag happens
as one of so many new players who didnt know their cyclones behind from their thrashers nose who originally happily carebeared away doing mission after mission to buy more shiny or rusty in the minnies case i ran up huge positive standings with the closest minnie agents and massive negative standings with the amarr and caldari factions the result of this is that this character cannot enter amarr or caldari hisec and has no realistic way of regaining standings with those factions diplomacy trained up already no go one of the only ways i can see to do this would be to join an amarr losec corp who would be willing to mission with me in losec until my standings got to the point that i could reenter that faction hisec or perhaps find some corp in minnie or gallente hisec who would be willing to mission with amarr agents in minnie hisec until my standings got high enough i dont see many corps doing this at allfor normal sec standings one can raise ones sec standings by ratting in 00 or low sec but for factions this is very difficult and in some cases impossiblei propose that ccp please include some functionality that allows one to similarly raise ones standings with any faction i know that game play wise it would not be easy to implement given the current game mechanics but one possibility could be a bribery skill that would allow one to pay agents with whom one has a deep negative standing less than 5 to mission for them and thereby raise ones standings for that agents respective faction this would only be possible until the standings rose above the 5 level the payments would be based on what your standings are with that faction ie the lower your standing the more you pay another option would be to lower the standings requirements for missioning in losec since hardly anyone does it and it is hard gank risk this would perhaps give some riskreward that the game requiresim not asking this because i particularly want to mission but it cramps ones options in game for wardecs or hauling etc to not be able to realistically enter faction space where you have very low standingsi know that thousands of players have the same problem and suffer from the same lack of resolutionplease take a look at this csm and raise the issue with ccp
i support fixing this but for you personally id suggest that you use the workaround  assuming your standings to them arent too badly shot go work for the royal khanid navy or the ammatar fleet both have standings to amarr and caldari and they should eventually let you work yourself up to missioning standings both also have highsec combat agents
make that 25 or 2 to match the diplomacy bump so a person intent on recovering standings can get back to 0 standing with the skillsystem
ive always felt it was too hard to get back in good standing with the empires considering the severity of the consequences for having such a sec status are so severe cutting off 25 of empire access the bribery skill is an idea

the really sad part is i cant tell if youre serious or not though given your past history i am going to assume this is a troll and give it 210 for making me think about it
the worst part about jason is that 23 of the time hes a massive troll 13 of the time hes serious and when hes serious hes actually a fairly good poster this proposal for example seems utterly reasonable to me at the moment faction guns are what you fit when you have too much money and not enough sp for t2 but they should have a role as pimped fittings on a vets ship not just for plexselling newbies i dont want too major a buff but it really is kind of silly that t2 weapons can do better dps than officer weapons
i was wondering about the same a few days agofor faction launchers vs t2 launchers the faction launcher win dps wisethe t2 launcher only get better if you use t2 high damage ammo furyragefor turrets t2 turrets are always better iirc after training the spec skill to 3so bringing faction turrets in line with faction launchers would be a good idea imho
im too scared to not support its the internet tough guy guys ok but seriously i agree as long as t2 guns arent nerfed that would make me a sad panda allthough caldari navy rails have more range than the t2 ones which makes them different but not better the other stats are pretty much the same as the prototype gaussmight be worth looking at other options like that but tbh i think the extra range is a joke so they need a boost and i think they should have more damage in addition to the range
there is at least one civilian module missing from that section of the item database and that particular page has been locked to editing so i cant post anything about it there this seems like the best place to make note of itthere is a civilian analyzer module for archaeology sites i know for a fact it exists since my main char owns two of them i recieved them from agents in either cosmos mission agents or agents from the lvl 1 epic mission arc i forget which one it has a 2 chance of success each cycle to break open the can and it does not need any points in the archaeology skill or any other skill for that matter to use making it a slow but viable option for people who want to do archaeology without the required skills i wouldnt be surprised if there are civilian versions of the codebreaker and salvager as wellcan someone please put this into the database or at least unlock that particular page so that i can do it myself
not a chance i think it would be good if ccp got rid of some of the more grindtastic skills and refunded the sp to be distributed as one likes but that is it skills like learning skills jdc advanced spaceship commandcapital ships and leadership remove and apply the effects as basebut moving around any sp you like hell no
never underestimate the power of an illtaught newbie more seriously there does exist two useless skills so far as i can tell  battleship construction above level 4 and industrial construction above 3 also theres the four rare skills that never got implemented but can still be found if youve got a spare billion but if youre training any of those skill levels youre not a newbie so im hardly going to cry if you walked into wasted sp with your eyes open
this is a dreadful idea
tbh and imho we all know that this is a stupid idea thus please stop posting in here yes i did too to comment this but rather look for good proposals than needs bumping and let this one die the death of page 2if you feel the rage burning bump something usefull up rather than pointing toward the obviousthanks 
i am supporting the discussion but my preferred solution would be to remove meta 0 items ie unnamed t1 from npc lootas for making mining more interesting i actually like mining being boring because its something i can do to be productive ingame without paying 100 attention the level of attention required to make isk currently progresses on this scalelogged off  station spinning  slow sell market  ice harvesting  mining  mission running  001 isk babysittingi like activities that produce more return than station spinning without demanding as much attention as mission running

in the end however pvp is what makes the economy run and therefor i believe that promoting either pvp or industry wont work it needs to be done in conjunction that is why because of a personal lack of experience in industry im actively asking for input about it from more experiencd players rather than ignoring it
your idea for asking other players for input is hardly new sokratesz this is what take care has been all about since ankhesentapemkah founded it and we have taken true representation to the next level take care is a diverse group we got all types of players onboard ranging from newbies and casual players to lowsec pvpers and 00 players we have industrialists and fw players in the team in addition every player is encouraged to mail us and propose issues and gets a personal reply back i have been a part of take care since it was founded back in 2008 and am running as their next representative but will continue to build on the teams experience i think i can put forward a more holistic view than other csm simply because we have a pretty solid group with which to debate issues and to make sure that we look at an issue from as many sides as possible ankhesentapemkah and erik finnegan have proven to be holistic and unbiassed and have proposed issues which affected all playstyles not just their own niches you have seen that ankhesentapemkah wrote a lengthy issue document for 00 changes which contributed to the dominion expansion as well assisting with a major 00 issue even though she wasnt involved in 00 at all surprise someone from your very own alliance was one of the players which assisted her with thisyour insinuation that we are ignoring issues due to a lack of personal experience is a laugh as one of the main goals of take care is to prevent just thathowever during our meetings with ccp and our internal csm meetings we have to rely solely what we have in our heads at that time i can and i will gather as much as i can from my advisors beforehand but once we step into that room with ccp we are on our own the good thing is that so far the csm has had a nice mix of people on it with different specializations as industry and market specialist i believe i can contribute greatly to this mix it is a big ecosystem all aspects affect and stimulate each other on a global scale regardless of living in 00 from pure pvp or as a pure industrial someone has to build what you use in your day to day activities
you seem to put a whole lot of effort in appealing to a certain target audience though and i cant help but taste a bit of but were better than you in the whole message
you got my votes
that makes a bit more sense
youve got my vote our answer profiles on
i should explain that those answers were a best match for my feelings and i agreed with part of the question but not necessarily all of it mining for example does need a boost while exploration is in quite good shape at the moment you can make money from mining if you are macroing or if youre running a big mining fleet the first way will get you into trouble the second splits the profits too many ways to compete with mission running or ratting as a viable profession miners have to compete not only with other miners but also with the vast quantity of very cheap minerals that flood the market from reprocessed mission loot and drone regions ratters that needs to be fixed either by reducing the amount of minerals from nonasteroid sources or by giving miners unique resources to harvest other than ice making mining less boring and harder to operate as an afk macroed activity would be gravy on top of thatthere are a lot of variables in combat and its certainly not as simple as targetactivate turretswait for one side to die however i do think that there could be more depth added and more tools added to help fcs in large battles operate with more finesse at the moment a large fleet is a pretty blunt weapon and id like fcs to be able to easily manage that force with a little more granularity than simply gang warping everyone to the hostile fleet and shouting primaries over teamspeak
as mynxee said you can get the list down to a dozen people fairly quickly after that or even before that you can use the match making site to confirm your choicewhat i wanted to add to the discussion is that a person with good ideas will still be able to voice them even if not elected to the csm thats what this forum is for on the other hand a person with a to narrow mindset will not make a good csm imo im certain well get candidates with different points of view electedbut to the op youre correct a fair amount of new players ignore what the csm is about 49 candidates is discouraging at first sight but you have 2 weeks to go through the entire list i would think that discussing your vote ingame and the reasons behind your vote will encourage more players to voteand by the way i didnt vote for a spinning kitty or a girl in a bikini but im curious to see how many votes those candidates get
i do base the points on how far away your opinion is scoring is explained in detail in the 2nd post of this thread and was open for discussion at the time of posting the survey cannot be gamed although you can get futher into the extremes higher and lower scores with less dont know  no opinion but if someone has that many issues that dont know about they really shouldnt be on the csm to begin withas for the abstain issue  we had the debate in csm1 and it was just tricky should an absolute majority vote be needed for an issue to pass or only a relative majority so do you need 5 explicity yes votes or just more yes than no with the former people argue abstain is just a fancydressed no while in the latter an issue may end up being presented to ccp with only 3 supporters and the rest of the council not supporting it andor not caring for it  hardly proper csm support

it definitely needs a boost to make the ship more worth while at the moment its just a expensive battle ship with jump drive attached
yes this we need i would also add usage of buff moduls like sensor remote sensor booster and eccm for the same reasons as remote repping you interfear in the fight you have just steped into the arena deal with it and take some risk with the rest of eve

currently when you drag someones name from a chat channel like local to the text input box you get popup that asks you if you want to link plain text show note for that character send evemail to that character or show info for that character the default is plain text i have never seen anyone do anything but show info except by accident show info should be the default actually i would like to just eliminate the popup altogether and make show info the only option the others were good ideas but they just arent done in practicealso when dragging the system name to the chat channel the same thing applies generally people just want to link show info
agreed similarly i will only ever want to link contracts when i drag a contract into a text window and exact searches are utterly redundant when the thing you searched for always pops up first
perhaps for the seven or eight people that dont always use show info when linking peoplethings you can put an option for it under where it asks you what to do when you doubleclick somebodys nameas for the rest of us linking an asset should be a oneclickdrag thing

fix it please
tsk tsk this thread was on page 3 time to send it back up to page 1 again come on ccp do we have to storm the office to get some comment on this
um yes current pos setups are fugly so why not implement the idea i know there are considerations on the amount of design involved and with walking in stations and dust 514 ccps designers got alot on their plates but i do feel that compared to some of the other things added over the past 2years this shouldnt be horribly hard to implement maby after tec 3 frigs and battleships
 so no one is up for more diversity in modulesship types
would be awesome especially as most ships are fixed with very similar fittings due to pgcpu issues or slots are already used by must have modules
uhm  and you balance that howwe have tons of shipsmodules already which need to be somewhat balanced to each other
balance for for the waek and feeble besides when you say balanced what excactly do you mean what is in your opinion balanced in eve a bs costs 100mil a frig costs 500k a frig can kill a bs thats balanced how excactlymore stuff and option and variation ads flavor and its cool join the cool club and support this topic
variety can also act as its own balancing the more modules and ships there are the more viable fits to perform the same task with varying pros and cons this creates its own balancing effect of giving you more options to pick where your ship is weak and strong ie common tradeoff you have a badass active tank but low cap but can fit a nos but lose some dps to do soby expanding variety we just expand the many tradeoffs you can make possibly helping many unbalanced ships or modules now by making them more viable or useful
more modules and more ships doesnt exactly mean betterand we will already get new stuff from the fanfest presentation1 t3 frigate2 t3 modulesenough new stuff imho
im sure all of us are looking forward to more t3 goodies but overall i think my point is eve as a whole will benefit first overall diversity has an effect on everyone from the newest to the oldest player t3 does not whether it be as an issue of player choice or purely for balancing benefits diversity helps everyone when it comes to the rl marketing of eve complexity and variety of options ships modules and career paths seems to be one of eves biggest draws when it comes to pve or pvp players more choices and substitutes in the market mean more new ways to increase your stats at a lower cost due to more substitute goods traders get a more competitive market because more substitute goods means a shift towards a perfectly competitive system overall it becomes a better game for everyone the more useful stuff you have i agree useless mods or ships would not be helpful but i really think ccp is much smarter than that and could easily diversify the choices and provide viable new stat tradeoffs enhancing the game for us all
solutionthe basic mechanic that needs to be modified is the docking timer which prevents performing those actions within a minute after the last aggressive act was committed a common suggestion has been to simply increase the docking time but that is a bad solution for two reasons first unless the timer is fairly long it doesnt address the issue of capital ship docking games especially the lowsec version where the capital ship has plenty of time to deaggro and dock second the longer the time is the more irritating it will be to legitimate attempts to dock for example after a fight is finishedhere is a better solutionthat third bullet point represents the change in a nutshell let me clarify that pointcurrently the timer to enter the station resets itself each time you attack and only runs down if you abstain from attacking for the duration of the timer so if you stop attacking for a short time you can reenter the station regardless of what your opponents do what im suggesting is that the station timer be reset any time you fire or any time someone fires on you so long as you have an aggression flag active to themthis means that if you leave a station and see a camp there you can still dock again so long as you hold your fire but once you return fire you are committing yourself to the fight and the station will not shelter you if you fare poorly if this happens you still have the option to flee away from the station assuming you arent scrambled or can outrun your pursuers and if you can avoid combat until the docking timer runs down you can return to the station and dock it also means that as long as you are flagged aggression flag not the docking timer you will regain the full docking timer if anyone you are flagged to fires on you it also means that if you hold fire long enough for your aggression flag to expire you are free to dock even if you are attacked again on the wayin short this is not an nerf it simply plugs a hole in the game system to prevent exploiting a technicality to engage in fights with zero riskconstructive criticism or other comments are welcomeedit ive been convinced that the mechanics i proposed should apply only to docking timers therefore ive edited out the references to gate timers unlike stations ships can be engaged on the other side of gates and therefor gates dont offer the same exploit potential the one exception to this is gates between highsec and nullsec systems allowing nonwt combatants to deaggress and flee to the safety of highsec in such cases the 15 minute aggression flag should probably be retained to allow the other side to continue the fight in highsec but that would be the subject of a different proposal
after reading all the failed attempts at changing the mechanic i am very impressed by the proposal its balanced to not favor those who want to exploit the mechanic but to at least provide some way to redock if you undock into a station campthat being said this should be extended to jumping as well its not as bad as station games but playing pingpong with wts isnt exactly a fun timesupportededit now with more thumbs
an end to docking games indeed wanabee pirates beware
ccp would be idiots to let dominion roll out with the current system in place with your proposed ideas we could have a fair and eloquent solution which does not favor any one side
docking games are terrible the op is right it will only get worse with dominion please listen to this idea ccp
supported docking games blow so does neutral remtoe repping but i see that that would be added to the list of aggro items wich would help the problem at least a little
ive seen several solutions to docking games but this one is one of the better and more balanced ones ive seen
supported
excellent
op makes much sense why would station docking personnel risk letting somebody dock when theres shells flying at them
this is worth logging in for to say 1
the only thing i dont like is that sometimes you will land 8001300 meters off a station so you have to approach it before being able to dock and a frigate especially an inty could easily agress you thus preventing you to dock
how will this not just turn the docking games currently into an overused and abused agro with a tank and just have everyone blob in from next doori also think making logistics actions aggressive with have much farther sweeping role killing changes than just docking games
note that while i use the term docking games frequently the modified timer mechanics i suggested deliberately apply to gate travel as well as dockingthis is definitely not a nerf to piracy in fact for the most part it has no impact on the usual pirate tactics except those that involve exploiting gates or stations to attack superior forces in safety in fact enterprising pirates and nonpirate pvpers might take note that baiting becomes more dangerous under this system the bait ship cant escape if it engages but also become more powerful as well the target cant either once it engagesi should rephrase that it becomes harder to escape interceptors and other particularly fast ships for example could burn away and evade until the timer expired allowing them to escape which is fine certain forms of ew might become useful in breaking away from combat stabs would still behave as normal in general combat at gates and stations would become the same as combat at belts
not at all if you have no aggression flag you never get a timer in the first place you only get a timer and an aggression flag if you make an aggressive act and you timer is only reset if you attack or are attacked while you still are flaggedin the example you gave you could sit outside the station as long as you wanted and so long as you dont aggress you may dock freelythe point of this change is not to give free ganks against unsuspecting people its to make the decision to engage a commitmentim not really sure how to respond to this yes its absolutely true but keep in mind that the mechanic is only initially triggered against a pilot by that pilots act of aggression until he attacks he may redock at will if he chooses to attack without proper intel then he may have to deal with the consequences but how is this different from almost every other aspect of evei believe that logistics actions already generates an aggression flag allowing those hostile to the ship youre assisting to attack you as well note that this is an aggression flag not a criminal flagso yes this would also address the issue of neutral logisticsrr assisting wts and using docking games as a means to eliminate the risk of doing so they can still do so but are making a decision to commit to the battle when doing so
this is the cleanest solution to docking games ive ever seen i love it
i like the solution thumbs up from meambushes might take a different tone for empire wars low sec fights and even 00 station defenses and anything to get better fights is a major thumbs up hereedit this may also mean guardians wont have to circle gates during rrgangs which is a major plus as they wont be able to use stargates as a getoutofdeathfree mechanismedit please devs take notice that remote repping here is a major concern and should be an agro mechanic
i for one dont wish to see the carrier blobs of dominion under the current mechanic
nocleanest solution would be to remove docking timers entirely
hell yeah good idea
logging in to say that becq makes sense listen to the man ccp
big 1 time to get rid of some of this silly risk free pvp
so long as rr is included i see no reason why this shouldnt be implemented immediately especially with dominion less than two weeks away supported
i am in favor of this proposal
sounds good i only see one problema player can exploit the aggression timer to hold the target indefinablypilot a unlocks and engages pilot b pilot a can not kill pilot b pilot b keeps a point on pilot a so he can not dock pilot a is stuck sitting on station till downtime its a simple example but you could extrapolate a number of other ways to exploit the mechanica way to fix this issue is to have an extended deaggression timer so pilot a in the example above stops attacking and say 10 minutes later he can redock if pilot b can not kill a within 10 minutes he never will you can also add time to the docking timers based on ship size
i hate the docking game it makes empire combat so dull  supported
soldi definitely support this proposal and look forward to seeing the truly talented pilots rise to the opportunity
worstcase you always have the ability to selfdestruct and get away or log off and have your ship disappear after 15 minutes still i think thats a reasonable amendment
actually i think that this issue is already handled the stationgate timer will renew with each new aggression by or against the pilot so long as there is an aggression flag the aggression flag however is unchanged and will therefore only renew with each actual aggression by the pilot so in the situation you describe the pilot could wait out the fifteen minute aggression flag once he is no longer flagged the stationundock timer no longer resets which means hell be able to redock a minute laterso in the case of the situation you describe pilot a can simply drop aggro and wait 16 minutes if neither side manages to destroy the other or call in reinforcements to help during that time the the fight deserves to end in an analogous case where player b can kill player a at any time but is drawing out the process player a is free to give in to the inevitable and selfdestruct to speed the process as suggested aboveoh and if one player in the above situation logs off or loses connection then theyd stay in space for the 15 minutes then emergencywarp as normal so technically you could shave off a minute via loggoffski but i think that the 15 minute timer is generous enough that this isnt really a serious issue
simple and elegant i hope the code can be equally well implemented
i think this is a good idea i would however like to see changes to docking radius as wellsome stations are ok but some stations have docking radius that is way to large
gets my vote
i and my other account both support this good heavens an end to having an aggressive force that you outnumber and can outfight but cant actually do anything about because theyre sitting up a stations undock chute please yes this isnt even looking at the sovrelated issues brought up by the op just the masses of groups who use this as a substitute for ability
supportedlet docking games die
supported
a simple solution to something that is very broken
very much in favor of this proposal by becq
very nice
this is a nice simple solution good idea and thumbs up
what about the size of the ship determine how long it takes to dock ie interceptor 20 seconds to redock after last aggression and say a dread being like 2 minutesthe bigger the boat the longer it takes to negotiate a dock righti mean i really hate docking games as much as the next guy but then with said proposal it would be people just baiting ships on a station to agress and once they do they are boned because the ship that caused them to agress is a bait super tank and they are screwed and local spikes for the gank or a ceptor tackles you after you shoot him and your there for the 1020 minutes till a gank squad xs up and travels the 20 jumps to kill you again the docking games need to be fixed but permaaggression no matter what you do seems a bit too far on the scale of balance
i like this initial impression sees it as fairly balanced and yes docking games should die
this is good please make it happen

for stations this sounds goodfor gates jumping to escape a losing battle should be part of mechanics allowed as the winning side who cannot place tacklers ready for the otherside deserves to miss the kills 
well i would sign this aswell but theres one issue which bothers me1 im a freighter pilot undocking from a station i suddenly find 20 guys warping to the station as i undock i pass one of their battleships which activates a smartbomb and hits me2 im a lone pilot in lowsec in warp from a gate to a station inbetween sits a pirate with a smartbomb rokh and his mates he smartbombs me while im deaccelerating from warp into docking rangein both cases im royaly buttered as i cant dock due to new aggrotimeri must say the redocking thing is annyoing if you want people to comit to the fight the only argument speaking against this idea is that you loose the ability to safe your ship if you dont intend to fight in the first place
in both cases youve not aggressed so you can jump  dock as normal reread the proposal it covers this 1 support from me i do think that perhaps its a bit too harsh on gates but by and large i support it and it fits with the htfu mentality

well thought out solution1
an elegant and simple solution to a horrible problem id like to point out that docking games arent only played by pirates but really by any side of a war that considers itself outnumbered this gives them the ability to believe they are in fact very skilled because they are staying in space while still being outnumberedhow many times have i seen someone brag you are x people against just me but you wont even engage at a stations undock chute in a maelstrom  docking games are even worse with the usage of neutral reppers especially in high sec instead of it being the already complicated matter of we need the dps to kill that battleship before it deagresses and redocks which usually is more than 3 battleships at point blank it becomes we need an incredible number of battleships to cancel this neutral battleshipss repair there is no point at shooting the neutral repper since hes going to dock when you make him go into half armor and then hell have done a better job at removing dps from the primary than by repairing and massive eccm keeps it from being jammed easilyby the way i believe the op did not mention anything about gate games which is very correct gate games are more a matter of skills and organization and having the right ships so they dont need to be changed
do this now
supported for stations im not sure if this is appropriate for gates but still gets my vote

nice one
agreed should be implemented as soon as possible
1 great idea
agreed 100 very nice solution
you should make that applicable for all stations you dont own your own station should accept you no matter what just makes sense but to solve the problem just put a global countdown on station repair and a time meaning if you do it it takes the time 45 sec lets say and you cant do it again for x minutes 10 15 allows normal everyday repair to act fine no issue and even the realistic mechanic of hiding in your own station but not instarepair sillinessedit spelling
great idea supported also how about making the docking areas of a station external so that you can just target and shoot people when theyre tradinginventingmanufacturing or any other non combat things
thats the case because not only is a shield resist bonus pretty good its congruent with the nature of the raceim i the only one who thinks a 7 low slot tempest with 7 turrets and a single damage bonus would be a bad idea if we care about diversity sure its projectiles its practically a the macherial but with 25 less damage o but then again another 7 low slot battleship one of the problems with shield tanking is that so few ships are designed for it this combined with the fact that armour tanking is firstly incompatible with projectiles and it has poor synergy with speed and agility its for this reason most forget that the tempest is actually already faster than some battlecruisers and the typhoon faster stillas for the maelstromyour condemning minmatar mission runners and everyone who valued the maelstroms active shield tanking potential to a ship that barely tanks and ganks more than a raven in a tier of battleships ships with specialised tanking bonuses i mean if you do believe that the dev team are unlikely to make a 7 mid slot minmatar battleship due to the dogmatic approaches they take with ship design then you may need to rethink your slots and bonuses on that ship a little
im not hugely wedded to any specific idea including mine at the moment so im not going to bother defending the examples i gavehowever the point i obviously failed to make with you is that i want to take the approach of working out what roles they can do first then proposing changes to the hulls that would let them excel in that role its the common denominator all of the most successful battleships have and something that none of the tempest  maelstrom changes ive seen have managed to capture
wait a minute  you dont understand what a stacking nerf is but my post is stupidity youre trading a 375 bonus for a 36057  205 bonus and calling it identical thats a difference of 193 dps tankedassuming overheating a dc ii and no tank rigs which last i checked is a fair bit and the reason you waste an active tank bonus on a fleet sniper is that the tempest cant hack it give it a seventh turret so it isnt wasting a bonus just to get up to the dps of an 8turret ship and maybe mess with some of its other stats like targeting range and thered be no need to make the mael the fleet sniper in the first place but of course this is all a moot point you fail at eve ship design 101 and youre busy scurrying to solve exactly the wrong problem the problem isnt that the ships have too many bonusesbecause they dont they have exactly the same number as everyone elses its that the ships are incoherent lumps of stats instead of clearly envisioned ships with roles the ones that arent  the maelstrom sleipnir vagabond rapier and wolf come to mind  are great ships ccp just seems to think that minmatar should be versatile and that 44 highs on the typhoon is versatility thats the problem with minmatar not that they occupy the same design space that the other three races inhabit comfortably
what i was trying to illustrate that it isnt just that easy unlike every other race you just cant get 10 minmatar pilots to agree on what one ship would do along with this your trying to second guess the developers by tiptoeing over rules or trends that may not matter whilst trampling over others that do instead of just asking for exactly what you want and leaving the devs to give you what you need i am also the last person you need to explain the value of roles and niches to its something i tried to adhere to in my last iteration to mixed success this is a new idea i want to see what people think if unsuccessful their will be moreeither way in this iteration the tempest and maelstrom all provide distinct roles that avoid not only conflicting with each other but with ships in other races maelstrom heavy fleet sniper close range shield tanker tempest small gang high alpha hit and run sniper or utility rr it a 104 difference in active tanking abilities 840 dps 8 slot shield tank vs 938 7 slot tank  boost bonus on a more realistic fit with a mwd the stacking penalties are reduced unless you want to argue that maelstroms are used exclusively in the role of station dockundocking games and with the less slots you devote to active tanking the better the 7 mid slot ship performsas for roles see my first response to the above poster
updatesnidhoggur bonus changed  10 reduction to shield and armor transfer capacitor power use per level
got my vote id love to see a tempest like that tbh
bs making op matar race even more op  most ships have equal or more medium slots as the caldari ones  wtf if you want to make this then make the same with caldari remove stupid resist bonus  1 med slot cpupg to be able to fit it cap to be able to run it  then lower signature  move 1 utility high to another med or low slot  add drones and more pg thats what should be done too
they arent bullets they are projectiles ffs
fully supportedoras kinetic bonused ships only gets that bonus for 25 of their ammo types i think ccp should make the same with guns also like 5 dmg for nuclearphased plasma ammos except the usually 5 bonus to medium projectile turret damage per level now this would be similar  if matars want to use out the choosable dmg type of their guns they can still do but without the dmg bonus especiall with the new changes in projectile ammossame could be applied for hybridslasers but they choose between rangedmg not dmg typesand as others said drones get better speedrange for lower dmgwhen you use different types not just lower dmg for altered dmg typeanyway this change would make missile ships able to use out their weapons advantage of changeable dmg type  which is an intended pros for missiles in the first place
minmatar get the bonus to all their guns but get damage and range and tracking changes for being able to switch damage typesyou get no penalty for switching ammo types no reduced range no less explosion velocity you just dont get bonused for that damage type perfectly balanced if not overpowereddrones can be easily popped they are balanced hybrids and lasers already get penalties for switching ammo its the rangedamage relationship you talked about there is nothing wrong with it they are forced to use the same damage type while missile users can switch
new patch notes make this even more important
your still raging about skills that you should train you funny do you also want concord to escort you into the 1010 complex where death hell neuts torps webs and guns are waiting for youno so go train your skills and come back when your a real capsuleer if you think 6 days is too high you dont understand why a 1010 is a 1010

there is no denying that out of the ew the most powerful is jamming several things have been done to try and bring them down in effectiveness with the other ew but at its current state they are still by far the best ew against targets because the only thing they can do against you is fof missiles smart bombs or drones if they were able to put them on you before you jammed themi guess the fact that ecm can turn any player no matter how old or experienced into a one week old noob with very little effort all the other ew a player can still do things even though it be at a lesser effectiveness but they can still do things get closer turn on a propulsion device etc if your jammed you are pretty much screwed for 20 seconds and hopefully they dont get another cycle on youanyways to my proposal when you try to lock anything while jammed it says you cant because you ship can only lock zero targets so that got me to thinking how about if a jam is successful it takes away a ships number of lockable targets instead of it taking it immediately to zero in an examplelets say a racial jammer if successful in a jam removes 4 or 5 lockable targets from the enemy ship so if a rook hits a megathron with one jam then the mega can only lock say 34 targets then gets hit with two then it drops to zero i am not sure about the numbers but you get the ideayes this is a nerf but maybe that will bring it down to more in line with the other ew without messing with the other aspects of the success of hitting a jamso in closing depending on the jammer used if sucessful on a jam removes a specific number of targets locked on the enemy ship maybe even if when a jam hits forces the target to unlock everything and then it can only lock a lower amount of targets depending on the shipflame away
great idea finally a sollution to ewar being so overpowered
i hate ecm and how it makes you die without a fight but i dont think this is the way forward with it
no problemo except that you neglected to suggest what nifty secondary ewar will caldari ew ships be getting long range neuts webs and warp scamblers are all pretty awesome so i assume youll be posting what equally useful ability the caldari ships will be getting to match once their ecm is more in line with the other ew perhaps some kind of antidrone ew which would be consistent with their racial opposition  allow caldari ew ships a module that they can fit to steal other ships drones each module allowing them to preempt 25mbit of bandwidth
leave ecm alone its fine wear it is and dosent need any more fixes yes its powerful and dosent let you do anything but have you ever had a curse dead cap you while your flying a cap dependant ship what about a dampener ship cut your targerting range down from 125 km to 20 km i am feeling pretty nerfed by that but i dont complain when it happens the counters for ecm are adont fly alone most ecm boats have a buffer tank made of wet tissue paper all it takes is 1 or 2 vollys and they go piff wich means all it takes is one target lock b eccmprojected eccm one modual makes a world of difference c friend or foe missials see the thing about paper matchet tank oh here is another thought when your buddy gets a lock on that ewar boat assign your drones to assist him just one guy with eccm can can make a world of difference if yah get pwned by a falcon or rook dont complain type gf and admire a pilot who found a gimic other than lots of big guns that actually works
i have to agree with mr henik hes covered most of the important points there is already balance there and ecm is not the end all be all in a cruiser fight a caracal that limits your targeting range and then forces the engagement range with microwarp drive use can be an unexpected bit of nasty you have to target in order to start jamming in the first place modules cannot counter target painting etc i tend to carry eccm modules as standard equipment on test matches and often feel like a fool when my opponent doesnt use ecm at all but when they do its worth it everything in new eden is a cat and mouse game the trick is just making sure youre the cat
qq htfu ecm is fine if you are so afraid of it fit eccm problem solved
agree on the grid and cpu its definatly a bottleneck for a good fit infact transfering all of the assault frig bonuses over to a dessy hull up the grid and cpu add som shields and blammo u got a viable t2 destroyer there may need to be a few tweaks here and there for example i do not see the upcoming speed boost to afs being useful on a destroyer so maby some added base tank there would be some tweaking needed but not to much imo

because you have not yet properly identified the problem the problem is determining whether the player is afk or not if it is an absolute truth that the cloaker is afk then he is not a threat i thought i had made myself clear on this  if he is not afk he is a threat the problem is determining whether the cloaker is afk or actually playing the gameconsider the followinga mission runner at his pc makes 50 million in 5 hours one day he decides to create a macro and instead of being at the pc for the whole 5 hours decides to go afk while still making his 50 millionis it fair hes away from the game and still able to meet his goal after all he would have still made the 50 million isk if he hadnt created the macro why is it important he be at the keys to make his isk if youre honest in answering these questions then youll understand why afk play is against the spirit of eve if your goal as an afk cloaker is to degrade the systems security and face it you know it is  what is wrong with requiring you to be at the keyboard to accomplish this goal
omg stop whining empire is that way 
yet another thread that shows why wspace style local is better afk cloakers have zero impact on wspace operations do people spend large amounts of time cloaked afk and at the keyboard in wormholes yes do other people stop doing what they would be doing because thier might be a cloaker no fix local problem solved
nope you went on a rant i responded in kind i drew a line between what you are suggesting to what is currently in practice afk is afk your arguements are shifitng to justify your sandy clam whine
on the same note but a different stance to get rid of the afk cloakers my idea involves simply that the cloak uses 101 of your cap recharge rateso if you go afk then after say 10mins your cloak will disarm because you have no cap but the 101 cap usage rate is 101 of anything so if you happen to use a cap booster 800 then next cycle it will take 808 cap awaythe only way for the cloak not to use cap will be if your in warp speed so even orbating objects uses the cloak cap rate whereas whilst in warp you regen cap at normal warp rate this is how i would work the afk cloakers
another solution looking for a problem first find a problem than you might try to apply your solution to it
people i dont think you understand why afk cloaking is a problem its not the little minus sign in local or the fact a hostile is in your space no those are very common phenomenon in 00 space and they dont bother me a bitthe thing that does bother me is that someone can come to my space and decide when where who and how he will attack there is absolutely nothing you can do about itits not what they can do while cloaked its what they can do when theyre not edit let me clarify as a ratter you shouldnt care about a solo vagabond or a bomber both can be fended off with a decent setup andor a friend however afk cloakers and especially bombers are mostly only after miners because they know miners cant survive 2 bombs there is a counter for all ships except bombers
oh please grow a damn backbonethe same could be said for a covert opsblack opsstealth bomber death squadcloak or no cloak anyone can go anywhere and do anything they want the cloak just makes it harder to find themafk cloaking is only a problem when you make it one either you man up and deal with it in such a way that you dont shrink in terror or you ignore it to the point where you deal with security breeches like you would normally deal with them in 00 or whs or low sec for that matterfor crying out loud you people must live paranoid lives or somethingeve is eve its not supposed to be easy or pleasant its supposed to be challenging this argument has been beaten with a bloody stick and has been shot down each and every timewhy people think theres going to be a change is even beyond my abilities to rationalizewrong again bombers are glass cannons you target one he cant cloak then shoot them the only thing you have to fear is when you decide to fly in a straight line if you do expect a bomb thrown in your faceotherwise your ok for the most partdont mine solodont flyroam solo work in teams
and what makes you think bombers will hang around long enough for you to lock and shoot them if you align to a planet or moon you can decloak attack and warp away with 2 to 3 seconds ive seen it plenty of timesworking together yeah right how exactly will stacking 10 miners together help fight bombers when one bomb can kill all 10 of them at the same time
ever tried sling bubbles on the belt so bombers get sucked into it on warp in that might give your miners time to warp out
ok i have highlighted my issue i do agree with what you say in princaple however you say it sholdnt be easy or pleasent and yet a guy can come into a system at 1130 or whatever time the server comes up cloak and stay there until 1059 the following day now unless im mistaken this is a very easy way to cause havocagro or even play the game as it wasnt meant to be played my personal issue isnt with sbcov ops or black ops its with people that use the cloaks on any ship and sit their cloaked up for hours you assume that everyone who afk cloaks is a sb i have many times found myself in this situation when a bsbs warps to me and guess what he had cloaked for hours in that system without me being able to probe him down ot his cloak deactivating and yes im a pvper how many hulks would it take to shoot a bs downanother counter measure against cloakers is how about an ability that allows the scanning of faint traces of spatial disruption that will with the right skills and talking max level scanning or new skill so this way there is the ablity to find the cloakers obviosly if they are not afk then they will simply warped claoked and not be foundin this game and its mechanics there is always a actionreaction scenario all ships etc have their nemesis on the battlefield and yet people who cloak have complete immunity from being foundthis isnt rightfairput in your expletives herethe work in teams scenario is great in theory but not all of us are in large alliancescorps or are you suggesting that unless your in one or other you should be
i and a fleet of ten other stealth bombers sit 50km from a gate for several minutes a scout comes through and we place our hands on our f1 and f2 keys an entire fleet comes through thinking the system is empty because we have all disappeared from local and we uncloak and fire our bombs and then pelt the people that are still alive with torpsthis is a stupid idea if somebody is logged into a system they shall appear in local chat afk or not
oh nothere is someone in my local who is not blue and who might not be afk quickly i must dock up and do nothing until he goes awaythat summary has nothing to do with why people want afk cloaking mechanics changed being afk while logged into the game is a completely different ballpark to creating a macro to make iska cloaker comes into your system cloaks and goes afk hes not making isk hes not mining ratting running missions anything hes afk hes gaining no advantage over any other person in eve hes doing nothing wrong hes causing no problempeople want it changing because theres someone in their local who isnt blue and theyre too scared to undock and run a mission or play the game in case they get probed down and lose a shipeffectively the people who want it changing are pretty spineless and want it changed because theyre too scared to undock if theres a hint of risk involved theres no sense to it at all someone whos afk in space is not a problem neither is someone whos sat actively probing for mission runnersthe problem isnt the cloaking mechanic its working as intended the problem is that people are too spineless to undock when theres someone whos not part of their napfest in local and they dont know where in space he is
verone you asked a question i answered it you now lock caps and put words and my mouth whythe cloaker is accomplishing something otherwise why is parking a cloaked ship in hostile territory even done afk cloaking serves a purpose you dont have to admit it to me but you know it  it will do no one any good arguing about itif nothing is being accomplished then why do it if the cloaker is afk why not just log off and the honest answer is because it is an effective way to run down the security of a system stay afk cloaked long enough and the system will eventually lower its security alert to normal and the problem i have with this is one side has to work hard to maintain the status quo the other side can literally fall asleep and just wait for the other side to eventually wear downlisten dont get upset at me because im telling it how it is you know it i know it i would have more respect for you if you at the very least admitted this is psychological warfare and it is a perfectly legal tactic i take issue with the fact you can do this even while sleeping or at school ie not playing the game that is my problem with this tactic anyway you can pretend like you really dont understand what the issue here is i cant speak for everyone else but the umpteenth time i want it changed so that if youre afk ie not playing the game youre unable to influence the security of a systemagain i cant speak for everyone else but i can tell you that in my case it has nothing to do with spine or with me being scared so you can stop it right there with the youre too skerred or chicken childish nonsense im talking about a player being afk virtually 247 namecalling wont change the factsagain it has nothing to do with spines or napfests if you want to cloak yourself for 23 hours per day i am not asking to have this nerfed i am asking that you be in front of your pc stop degrading the problem into something that isntso again before you throw it out there again what i am asking for is if youre going to afkcloak for 23 hours per day then be prepared to be in front of the pc for 23 hours per day
the afk cloaker is influencing nothing but the people whore staying docked hes doing no harm to anyone at all in the system and gaining no benefit or advantage over any other player at all for being cloaked doing nothing in any systemthe basic fact of the matter is that the people docked have no control over this individuals actions and cant make him go away and they dont like itwhether hes at the computer or not is irrelevant people want this changed because they want to feel safe in their claimed space nothing more if hes not at the computer then hes not playing the game and is no threat if he is then hes playing and is an active threatwhat people are annoyed about is not being able to distinguish between people being afk and people playing why should you have the ability to do sothere is no rule against someone being logged into the game and being afk as long as theyre not profiting from it by making isk or using any form of automation to get ahead of any other player people cloaked afk in a system are gaining no advantageits the people whore in the systems choice to undock and take the risk or notthese people are committing no crime by being logged in and the mechanic needs no modification
all the goon tears that ive tasted lately have been delicious i am sure this will bring even more and thus i am in favor of this suggestion
mr sun im having a difficult time seeing your complaint about the maelstrom whilst i admit i am completely unskilled in matar ships and in artillery the maelstrom immediately reminded me of the raven if the raven used guns the slot layout matches armor shield and capacitor are similar the raven has slightly more cpu but the maelstrom has an amazing power output by comparison the only reason most shield tank in a raven is because they wish to retain low power slots for ballistic computers ravens can armor tank very well but unless youre in a fleet youve little use for so many free mid slots i could easily envision a well armor tanked maelstrom with plenty of gun assist modules doing nearly the ravens job so far as cross training one does not simply hop into a raven skill wise if you expect to get anywhere youll need a great number of missile skills medium rail and supporting skills dont hurt for smaller targets and youll need an exceptional level of capacitor and shield skill to be capacitor stable and still have enough boost to survive ive run the numbers though there are differences between shield tanking and armor tanking in terms of final output  time hp to power ratios etc  but they can be made very similar with the proper rigs and modules i wont bore you with a detailed comparison of shield tanked ravens swapping out three capacitor control circuits for armor repair rigs but i assure you it works fine im just not seeing your complaint
agreed
i agree the empire portion of the game needs some kinda upgrade maybe based on how much the players invest in that system trade  pos  transit  missions

ahh ok thanks will need to at one point sort it out
hmm might have to go check that out was just going to start formulating a proposal for a better email system
not suppoted this would mmount to a massive nerf to caladari and relegate them to status of ecm only defenders are already deacent i use them as a life extedner on my ewar boats all the time a single rocket pod can negate a ton of incoming damage i use one on my ferox and moathough admitadly i havent flown either in forever
just a driveby in my opinion the only reasonable fix for defender missiles is to make them toggles like hardeners instead of activated items like weapons you should be able to turn them on then have them automatically attempt to shoot down missiles that get launched at you instead of having to activate them after being attackedid like to say they should be able to be used against missiles targeted at a member of your gang rather than only those targeted at you but i think that this might be hugely overpowered in large fleet combat
cva already has something like thatthose are dead easy to work withevery time you limit something people find ways around it alt alliances alt corporations alts for market orders or for rd slots etc etc etc build a wall and the people will build a latter build a bigger wall people will build a longer latter get it yet

i would be interested in what you plan to do for low sec because it does seem to be criminally under utilised spacebeing part of a smallish corp that is too young to have capitals we are pretty much barred from 00 unless we break up our own corp so weve been driven to worm holes and low sec my experience of low sec is that you can go looking through an entire region and find only worthless drone anomaliesinfact its so empty thats theres no way to even bait yourself a bit of pvp because no trap is ever going to be believable theres lots of talk about how much null is going to get buffed but nothing that shows how this will be of use to corps who cant join in
giving unique resources or rewards in lowsec would be a good start to tempt people out of empire the new navy battleships only available from factional warfare stores being an example of thisone of my platforms is risk vs reward and so far the increased risk in lowsec has yet to result in better rewards if there are cool things to find stuff to shoot and a reason to risk pirates and pvpers then everybody gains including the pirates and pvpers id love to say i have all the answers but i dont and that is where you and others can help if you want to live in npc 00 then you can survive without capitals though they are handy for logistics there are other ways if you restrict your activity to npc 00 with fast moving raids into sov 00 then there are still fights to be had but you have to keep looking out for and avoiding the mega blobswormholes are great but can be tricky to live in especially for more casual corps they can yield great profit and when t3 frigs roll round i hope that temps more people to try wspace we regularly head into wormholes to earn money and get pvp kills in equal amountsa buff to exploration in lowsec might help out some especially if there are some unique drops from complexes anomalies and the like there are some nice features of lowsec that need to be built upon but it must not be seen purely as a stepping stone to 00 it needs to be worthwhile in its own right to help with piracy and the like it would be nice to revisit the global criminal countdown of course it would be even more awesome to use some of the new sov mechanics activity indexes to implement the corruption system discussed in vegas this is similar to large areas of 00 too hopefully this will changeit does look like the 00 changes are aimed at medium to large alliances and there is still not much to tempt corps and smaller alliances deeper into 00 yes you could become pets of a larger alliance but that means all the political stuff and blue lists the physical size of the infrastructure hub needed to improve space means alliances without titan bridge access are going to have to escort a freighter through 00  a fairly large barrier to entryid like to see that at least fit into a jump freighter which is within the reach of a smaller alliancethen there are the hitpoints on the sov structures which will likely cause capital blobs on a scale not before seen in eve tldrbuffing lowsec to contain unique rewards would hopefully tempt more people out of empire increasing the population and thus giving more chances for pvp as well as chances for profit

what direction would you like to see the game go in are there any holes in eve that you would like to see filledmy personal favourites are the possibility of branding and a better variety of industrial skills as someone who was there back in the day when even battleships were new i think you would have good insight into the possible effects of changes to the gamei already voted for you by the way
i would like to strengthen market pvp one major issue since launch have been the factor that you really only have two valves to adjust on when it comes to the competitiveness of your product price  availability how cheap can you make it and where do you sell itas things stand now the most complex factor is price and there is a lot you can do to affect that but in the end it is about optimization of the process not the product itselfwhat i would like to see is the possibility to differentiate your product from other products this is of course a complex issue how do you make an effective market system for finding and comparing products when they can suddenly be a lot more different than today how will this affect large volume traders etcits a scary process to start and change what is the very core of eves market and economical system but i believe it needs to be done eventually if you consider ships pvp a lot of new aspects have been added to the actual game play over time adding complexity to the individual battles that just were not there to begin with in the mean time market and industry game play have stayed largely the same sure the material chains have become a lot more complex but once the actual end product has been created your product is the same as everyone elses and the end consumer has no reason to take your product over the competitions besides price and where you choose to sell it price  availabilityi have played around with ideas of my own for some time on this subject but really i am not here to sell my own ideas and presenting them here in their current form would just turn this thread into an ideas discussion which it is really not

i have three suggestions for improving the star map that is the map of all solar systems in knownspace1 in unflattened mode allow the camera to zoom in on a target much closer than it currently allowsif i target aldrat on the star map and zoom in at maximum the camera is still far enough away from aldrat that other systems that arent in the vicinity of aldrat are right in my face for example otsela colelie avenod or eoazc depending upon which direction im looking at aldrat from the camera should be allowed to get in onequarter the current distance i imagine that this will only require a parameter change2 there should be an option to not select a system on mouseover only on clickright now if i select an entire constellation or region and use leftclickanddrag to rotate the map to study its jump lines then as soon as my mouse cursor hovers over any solar system then the game removes the highlight from the constellation or region i selected even while im doing a clickanddrag to rotate the view this makes it very hard to study stargate connectivity i know there are flat pdfs available for various regions but i havent been able to get the hang of using these particularly because they are flat if ccp were to implement this then it would be much easier to study stargate connections right on the ingame 3d map3 this may actually be a bug fix request instead of a suggestion releasing the mouse button on top of a solar system should not select that solar system unless the mouse button was pressed on top of that solar system to begin withright now if i start a leftclickanddrag on empty space to rotate the map and i just so happen to release the mouse when the mouse is over another solar system then the game interprets that as a click on the solar system if auto frame selection happens to be on this results in an unexpected recenteringthank you for your time and considerationedit  20091126 0508 eve time zorvoz in post 7 made some good suggestions i think i understand what hes getting at and have elaborated on his ideas in my post 15
seems to make sense
amen brother signed
ability to not select hasnt been an issue for me but i can certainly see it as an improvementbut a very big yes on being able to zoom much much closermaybe also having a fully spherical range of angle drag instead of the wall at topdown or bottomup
yes pleasealso please please please fix the actual color setting for coloring the stars  the colors have been washedout with white since apocrypha and it looks ugly  you can barely tell the difference between the colors anymore reds and blues used to be distinct and easily differentiable they both just look white now
heres an additional proposal take it or leave it just an ideahave an entirely different interface but keep the star map how it is id like to see some sort of drop down menu system or a selection system that allows to showhide low sec and 00 also have the constellations in a dropdown or something similar to how the contracts is setup with specifying the types faction space and such something a little bit more specific that will show only the regionarea that you want it to show making it a little bit easier to find agents that high sec runners want to use this way when you have something selected in your dropdown such as only showing caldari space the map hides the entire other bit of the map and zooms into the caldari space and fills the screenjust a thought
oh yes i remember suffering from some of these
i do find the controls weird i mean the scroll wheel seems to control zoom instead of controlling the 3rd axis in 3d mode i often find i need to get closer but it wont go any closer

audit log containers i hear is messy at best and can be quite the pain in the buttthis is just a simple journal log for corporation ceodirectors with full api key data dumps to view nothing more than thatim hopping this is something acceptable as far as ccp is concerned
this is a good idea which would be useful alsong as it could be done without using too many resources server end as the devs already have a similar tool it could potentially make this idea achievable if having a complete list like your wallet journal caused excess server load  being able to query one item or hangar at a time with a timer on queries could fix this potential problemi have added this idea to my agenda thanks for the headsuptamber

the moderation of this forum has always been out of control and heavyhanded and it has never been accountable to anybody

the csm needs to not go to iceland and state to ccp that unless things are uned right now the csm stands dissolved the csm and sisi had no small part in making what was supposed to happen in dominion possible everything just got thrown out it needs to be fixed and it needs to be explained now
that comes from letting untrained rookies doing the forum moderation they totally freak out at the first sign and then smash everything as hard as they can thinking they can get control over things again  of course they cantdeleting some crapposts is one thing mass censorship and deleting 50 of the forum thread is something completely different and shouldnt be allowedi do not have much trust in the csm any more but i give you the benefit of doubt and say yeah go on
many countrys in the rw have democratic in there official namesof course they are anything butbecause they have no freedom of speechdemocracy and freedom of speech go hand in handthe recent censorship in this forum is somewhat concerningquestion to cccpjust what kind of democracy are you trying to support in the creation of the csm

i am curious and the csm probably needs to know if they are going to communicate effectively about it what sorts of things are being censored
aye been live in the new dev blog capital ships in dominionthreadposts worth for at least 10 pages have been deletedadmittedly quite a bunch of them were just quotes with little additional content  buteven these empty quotes serve a purpose they carry on valueable arguments to players not reading a xx pages thread most skip to the last pages  and there they see the quotes from others containing usually solid points and suggestions
the moderation was out of line although i do see the need to keep a discussion civil and constructive i think that many of the previous postings were correct in their conclusion that the moderators instead of taking the correct action created a classic example of mass censorship i do not have a viable solution to the problem that has arisen but i would ask the devs on all levels to at least answer the complaints and questions on the forums a bit more intelligently than introducing a completely unrelated blog into an already dangerous minefield of upset customersplayersagain this is just my two cents and support of the original topic
this i can not support the forum has rules if people dont want to follow them then they can post elsewherethe rules are made clear and if you fail to follow them then your post should be deleted to save anyone else the trouble of having to read it if you want your point to be heard then post within the rulesif anything i feel the moderators are too lenient in their enforcing of the rules
there are very simple rules to using this private forum posting requires payment  go figurewe all agree to them when we sign up and post yet some idiots cant seem to grasp the concept of decency and are hit by the censorswhat needs to be done is for the posting rules to be made more readily available so the aforementioned idiots can have a say as welladd them in a condensed form with link to full text on the signin pagecommon sense common decency both are essential in internet communications where accountability is moot and one has no access to read a persons body language rather big one that when you think about itnot supported in the proposed form

signed
yep
definite supporti really like the idea of allowing gate  station aggro to be extended by shooting at players doing station gamesi would settle for a simple extension to the current aggro timer 35 mins however if it meant we would have a change sooner sick of risk free pvp on stations
supportedif the change requires an rp excuse for the error text trydocking permission denied your ships shields are in a state of disruption due to recent combat station authorities would prefer it if the spatial distortion surrounding your ship did not tear a hole in the station interior have a nice day

docking games are poo  so most definitely yesthe only thing id suggest adding because from an immersion standpoint its very cool is that docking timers and the like from stations should be affected by the pilots standing with the station owner and in high sec and in some low sec stations by sec statusit makes sense that the caldari navy are going to cut some slack to the guy with the 95 standing with them and try and let him in faster if they can hes a staunch ally after allconcord or the spacelane patrol should probably think twice even in low sec from allowing some notorious 10 sec status pirate to dock
docking games are teh fail supported
a simple and elegant solution gets my full supportalso on the subject of the problem of being indefinitely held by someone whom you cant kill while being unable to dock i dont really see the problem this can and does happen in asteroid belts all the time and has never really been a serious problem beforein such a case if someone cant outrundestroyjamdampneutpersuadebribe the person who is tackling them or call for friends to do the same then they must face the reality of the situation theyre doomed and have the option of self destructing if their assailant cantwont finish them off
good stuff
signedgiven the simplicity of this it should be on sisi on monday and shiped to tq via hotfix on tuesday next week
excellent solution
i like this i would add 1 thing though the ability to look out the windowit is truly unnerving to undock with no scouts outside and to see 10 reds wave at you then shootwhile you scramble to hit the dock key and pray you get back in b4 that wallomissles hitwho designed the stations without them transparent aluminum panels
your solution does not fix the scenario you were complaining about in your original postcarriers repping a titan would not get an docking timer to start with so shooting the carrier would not extend timers in those casesa better solution would be for rr to get a docking timer  60 secs  as aggression currently doesyour solution is very bad for reason some have pointed outonce you fire on someone  if they have a scrambler you wont be able to leave everyour stuck there until downtime or until they run out of ammo if they dont have the dps to kill you or you kill them
supported nothing more boring than docking games tbh
awesome proposal i wish i had more than 2 thumbs 
this question was brought up previously the timer resets for as long as you have an aggression flag once the aggression flag drops 15 minutes the docking timer no longer resets which means that 16 minutes after your last shot you will be able to redock alternatively you can logoffski and your emergency warp will occur 15 minutes after your last shot shaving off and entire minute regarding remote repair and aggression its possible im misunderstanding the current mechanics i believe that repairing a ship that is aggression flagged including for example a war target in empire space gives you an aggression flags you against your targets opponents thus allowing them to for example shoot at you for the next 15 minutes without risk of concordassuming this is true then my suggestion mechanics will work as follows1 ships a and b are fighting2 ship c otherwise neutral begins to repair ship b thus getting an aggression flag with respect to ship a no timer is current set as no real aggression has been made3 ship a fires on ship c since ship c has flagged itself its docking timer is reset to 1 minute4 as long as ship a continues to fire on ship c the timer will continue to reset until 15 minutes after the last repair cycle ship c makesits been mentioned that ships in nullsec do not get aggression flags i had thought that they got aggression flags but not criminal flags and that the aggression flags were irrelevant in nullsec if the current mechanics dont set an aggression flag in nullsec then the simple solution might be to change that so that they do
simple change seems easy to implement going to be desperately needed in the age of docking supercapitals easily supported
currently  when you shoot someone there flag is reset to 15 minutes as well as yours iircor i am i thinking of something else me scratches headand yeah there are no aggression flags in null to much calculations for the servers me thinksrealy even 15 minutes if its made to work like that is a bit much to have someone else dictate your own game experience1 minute should be fine for killin something if you have appropriate fpits only rrrs that can insta dock and its only rrrs that need fixin imhoi have another objection as wellexamplestarbuck galactica this is starbuck were down to throwing rocks at the bastards were coming in hot request clearance for combat landings to the port flight podgalactica actual sorry starbuck youve been engaged in hostile actions against cylons please wait outside for 15 minutes before we allow you to landok enough of the bsg analogiesany docking timer should only occur at npc stationsan outpost is a very expensive corporatealliance assetas such it should be a position of strength to fight froman outpost should never refuse docking request from a member of its controlling corporation  alliance live fire rr or whatever that pilot has been doing
great idea
can you imagine any means by which a large alliance one that can field a sizeable capital fleet could ever lose an outpost system if the defenders can play capital fleet docking games with 100 free nearly instant 30 second repairs frankly i see this as a far more important problem than the current docking games highsec docking games are boring and annoying sovereignty docking games will be in my opinion gamebreaking
make blocklists tradable with export and import functionsyou would need the ability to revert to your last ban list or to be able to load an old banlist in the instance that you imported an undesirable banlist the maximum pilots allowed on a banlist would also need to be increased past the current maximumfixed the name of the thread and changed all references from ban to block  thx i hadnt noticed there is one flaw with this idea and i will be reposting with solutions to make this a viable option for playerstamber
what about banlists that you could subscribe to moderation options to allow certain people to add to the list and whatnot so people could maintain scammer lists spammer lists and whatnot that could be subscribed to much like real life antispam servicessupported in whatever form

considering the latest devblog about capital ship changes it seems that ccp has left the good path it was on for changing capitals with the upcoming expansion and has rolled back almost every good idea there was and not only that given the new stats given for xl turrets and the change of bonuses for the naglfar on sisi the ship will become useless againdreads only purpose is to shoot stationary or almost stationairy objects the only thing that matters here is dps and tank naglfar wont have any of that if the changes will be implemented after years of being the suppar dread the naglfar was brought in line with the other dreads with the last expansion please ccp change your mind and leave the naglfar its current tq stats

agreed
but come on  projectiles with a gyrostab are competitive with unbonused railguns now and all you have to do is paint the dreadnought youre shooting and those missiles will do their full paper damage doesnt that mean the splitweapon projectile ship will be better than the focusedweapon hybrid ship
i fully endorse the above statementproduct

the naglfar was almost perfect after the first capitals change during the all level 5 event and now its a lot worse than revmoros again

resave the naglfar
reiterating points ive made before with respect to this changeit is really unnecessary to reintroduce split weapon bonuses when if balance was required reducing the focused turret bonuses could have done the job just as wellminmatar dreadnought pilots from many diverse and opposing alliances supported the original motions calling on the csm to bring this matter up with the content developers when he finally looked at it chronotis did an excellent job of taking the original idea for the ship and blending it with player requests for change creating a compromise that left the ship competitive without overpowering itthe naglfar requires the most training of all of the dreadnoughts two three with dominion capital weapon systems and for optimal fitting flexibility both styles of capital tanking the tanking flexibility was balanced by not having as many slots to tank with as its peers phoenix has 7 mid slots moros has 7 low slots and revelation has 8 low slots if training time is not a factor in balancing ships with their peers it should beadditionally nozh is reinflicting the old problem with split weapon bonuses  that is it takes two bonuses on the ship to achieve the damage boost that other dreadnoughts do with one and it takes two damage mods to get the same effect as one this was debated with chronotis when the previous round of naglfar changes were on the drawing board and he willingly concede the pointthis change appears illinformed and disrespectful both of the player base and of nozhs coworkers it must be reversed
nulldont screw over the naglfar again it just finally surpassed the fact that it was considered little more than extra ehp for the moros next to it it doesnt need nerfing again

supportedhaving a bonus to only 1 ammo type completelly interfers with damage switching combat tacticsgalminiamarr always get full value of the bonus they have trained on there hulls whatever combat tactics they usecaldari should too
i fail to see how gallente and minmatar and amarr do the same amount of dps with all flavors of damage as you claim they do  and as you claim caldari should be able to do and as many of their ships already have the ability to do
are you smoking weed i made no claim about flavour damage from gma
i have tried it before yesim sorry i cant really provide an argument against your proposal since its just so unfair that i dont know what else to sayill just say this would you say its fair if turrets dont have to worry about optimal range and dont get dps reduction for using longer range ammo types oh and ammo can be replaced with different damage type ammos for the exact same damage amount
gallente ship with hybridsamarr ship with lasersminmatar ships with projectilescan switch damage type to increase dps no   somewhat in case of mini can increase dps by lowering tracking  flying parallel  to target yescan increase dps by lowering engagement range and switching to high damage ammo yescombat tactics required include lowering tracking and optimising range  combat manouvers are gallenteamarrminmatar damage bonuses  rof and dpl  compatible with combat tactics yesgalamarrmini pilots will always get 5 dps per level for time spent training ship hull skills combat manouvers do not clash with gun rof and dpl caldari ships with missilescan switch damage type to increase dps yescan increase dps by lowering tracking  flying parallel  to target nocan increase dps by lowering engagement range and switching to high damage ammo nocombat tactics required include finding  anticipating resistance hole  damage switching are caldari missile damage bonuses  5 kinetic  compatible with combat tactics nocal missile pilots lose damage bonuses if they use use missile combat tactics 5 kinetic is not compatible with damage switching
missile users can increase dps by having webbed painted targets missile users can do their same damage throughout their entire range something other weapons cant do so do your damage from range where guns cant hit or dont hit wellyour race is kinetic damage please explain to me why you should get bonused damage to all types with no range or other weapon mechanics penaltiesturrets sacrifice range and damage type and damage to switch ammo types you sacrifice nothing
gun users also get damage increases from webs  painters in many circumstances thats rather irrelevantyes missiles do the same damage throughout there range as you point outbuta that raw dps is probably equivelent to lead ammo at optimalb damage beyond 24km is largelly irrelevant without the ability to stop your target warping offyour race is thermal  please explain to me why you get the kinetic proportion of the damage you deal from rails bonused at 5 through rof and dplexplain why mini get 5 per level more dps from emthermkinexp depending on ammo loadedexplain why amarr get 5 extra thermal damage through dps rofexplain why expkinem drones get damage bonuses in gallente drone boatsthe only race that currently gets lumbered with racial damage bonuses are the caldari  thats why it should goif kinetic flavour is important to keep then it should be applied to the missileseg 100 em becomes 75 em and 25kin etccurrentlythorax pilot level 5 verus thorax pilot level 2thorax pilot 5 gets 15 more dps against opponent for training level 5caracal pilot level 5 versus caracal pilot level 2caracal pilot 5 get 0 more dps against opponent  because both fire em caracal pilots hull training is wasted because the hull bonus and the combat tactics required clash with each otherthat why it should be changed
you made it seem as if theres no way to increase missile damage i pointed out the ways you canwho solos these days get a tackler and i can assure you hybrids are so messed up that your dps will be higher than leadmany of your ships get rof bonuses too so that negates your argumentthorax only gets damage per level so no rof theremini get range and damage reduction mini has less base damage amarr only gets to use 2 damage types if you notice drones dps is reduced for using different damage types gallente only get to use 2 damage types in their gunsamarr only gets to use 2 damage types in their gunswhat about that useless mwd bonuscan i get that changedyou get bounsed to kinetic

as ecm has in recent times seen changes based on the assumption that it was too powerful and been reduced significantly primarily by way of a range reduction allow me to first briefly clarify why i believe another nerf to ecm is appropriatein short a single well fit ecm boat can realistically jam 34 tech 1 ships with little regard for how well those ships are flown or fitted as a result it is very hard to do anything about ecm in low sec in particular as no lock mean no scramble while the range nerf to ecm certainly made things more sane as you can now more easily get into range of the ecm boat getting into range with a few ships does not even guarantee that the ecm boat is at any severe disadvantage i have been in combat situations with two to four ships at 10 km from an enemy falcon but unable to even force it to warp out let alone kill itin addition to the effect of ecm being very powerful and hard to counter it makes for very boring fights  in essence most of your highslots and med slots might as well not have been fitted once you get jammed as you probably wont get a chance to use them for anything for the remainder of the fightlastly there are some curious details attached to ecm modules themselves which separate them further from other ewar namely enabling ships to ultrafocus in using ecm i am referring to the offrace jamming chances of racially focused ecm multispectrum ecm and the ecm low slot modules none of which have equivalents in any of the other ewar and serve to make ecm that much easier to use and makes it quite easy to set up an ecm boat that is reasonably effective against any ship it could square up againstnow let me assure you that while i think ecm spoils much of the fun there is to be had at the moment i am not out to destroy it the two main problems with ecm as a whole right now is that it dumbs down most combat scenarios it is introduced in and that there is no good counter availablemy solution is based on the following assumptions1 ecm boats should be in trouble if too close to hostile ships and without significant support additional ewar or logistics2 altering the current ecm mechanic to allow other mechanics already in the game to have more of an impact would be desirable3 allowing players under jam to have some inbuilt options for counteracting the effect would be desirable4 a simple solution would be easiest to implement and easiest to foresee the consequences of and thus be desirablemy proposed solutionthis change will not make ecm impotent it still prevents a good portion of gunmissile dps ewar and tackle of the target ship while keeping intact its range based defense however anyone fighting under ecm is now only limited by their own locking time rather than their locking time and the 20 second jam thus an ecm boat can no long just hang out near a small number of enemy dps ships without significant backup and permajamming becomes hard to achieve using only ecm as that would require quite a lot of coordination permajamming should still be pretty easy to achieve on a few target ships if you employ a combination of ecm and sensor dampening which i think is fair for such a powerful effect
yeeeeswould make sensor dampeners  scan resolution used on something other than a damned stealth bomber
sensor damps arent useful anymore not since another cough nerf coughon topic though supporting this
corrected a few spelling mistakes in the op added bolded text for emphasis and supporting my suggestion 
2 for bad idea the old ecm worked 2k4 ecm that is this current ecm has already seen several nerfbats which i agree with the cycle time on the current ecm is 20 seconds which is reasonable the jamming time is the same also reasonable the descri
i am not aware of what the ecm mechanic was like in 2004  i started playing in 2006 you state that my idea is already in effect and that the 20sec cycle time  20 sec jam time is reasonable but you offer no explanation id like a little more to work with here than statements you linked the ecm burst module which is not the module i am discussing  that would be the targeted ecm modules granted ecm bursts and drones would also be affected but they should be able to work with the same base mechanic your numbers also seem to be missing some factors  what is the target namely assuming your numbers are correct and were talking about a decent combat ship here you are talking about fitting a single module on a falcon that has a good probability of denying locking for a full engagement for an enemy ship a falcon is capable of fielding quite a few ecm modules and racial jammers do have probabilities of jamming offrace ships additionally the argument that your odds are diminished because you forced your opponent to fit a mid slot specifically to counter ecm is flawed youve basically forced your opponent to dedicate a med slot on each of their ships to try and negate the effects of ecm and you still have a decent chance of your ecm working also mind that not all ships have the luxury of that 4th5th med slot they dont quite know what to do with  the majority of the ships i fly in small scale pvp would perform much worse if i had to dedicate a med slot to eccm and i dare say that would not affect the outcome if i ran into a small gang with a falcon yes an arazu or a keres would actually be able to do something in this situation provided the falcon doesnt jam them first or  god forbid  bounced out and into the fight again incidentally it is my impression that sensor dampeners are not good for anything but trying to keep stealth bombers alive these days so the odds of running into that perfect counter is rather slim
stop whining and fit eccm which you seem to totally forget in your topic too bad that you cant go allout damage with tracking comps and the like in your med slots thats the whole point of ecm ecm is fine as it is
you dont go all out damage with med slots you go all out damage with low slots all small gang warfare ships need their med slots for general combat stuff such as1 tackling gear 12 slots2 speed mod 01 slot3 capacitor injector 01 slotallow me to illustrate the problem with eccm as it is currently by comparing it to capacitor injectors as a counter for neuts if you fit a capacitor booster you will be able to keep some modules running for a limited time given that youre only up against one bonused ship neuting you or a few unbonused if you fit an eccm a single falcon with a standard fit is still perfectly capable of keeping you jammed for an entire fight regardless the module literally make too little a difference in the sole situation it could possibly help to warrant fitting it
3 med slots is all i need in small pvp mwd scram and seboeccmi can agree that eccm needs a boost but i definitely disagree that ecm needs to be nerfed
some ships have room for them yes myrm or domi for instance other ships too take heavy a blow from missing that extra bit if tank or that cap booster injector lets try to narrow down our disagreement here shall wedo you agree that a falcon has a good chance for jamming 34 tech 1 bcbs who have not fitted eccm for the majority of a fight do you also agree that it could do so outside of tackle range and thus be able to get away should the dice roll come up short do you agree that a ship that is jammed has little recourse in a fight if it is also tackled since jam is often permanent and there is nothing much to do once you are in that situation
yes i can agree on all of that now lets look from the other sidea falcon virtually no damage output has no tank ecm range already nerfed drones on it  dead sniper on it  dead keep some ships in reserve  deadthere are plenty was to deal with a falcon besides eccm it just requires some strategy
your description of ecm is slanted if ecm were too powerfull we would see many more ecm boats out there right now about 1 out of every 510 ships is an ecm boat that is pretty balanced ecm does not need to be balanced with other ewar the idea is the races need to be somewhat balanced for pvp ecm is caldaris best weapon if you nerf ecm caldari are just pathetic ecm pilots have many downsides you are never top damage dealer not do you ever get a km we have ecm bursts already and they are almost never used for good reason ecm is and should be a powerful weapon in the game it adds complexity to how you set up your gang instead of just saying lets bring allot of shields and guns so i vote no
a sniper than can go beyond 100 km is rare in low sec pvp but that might be a viable option yes im pretty sure i dont like needing a sniper in every gang for the sole purpose of countering ecmyou only have a very limited window to get drones on the ecm boat since if your drones aggro something else and you get perma jammed you cant get them back on to the ecm boat even with drones it takes a long time to actually break an untanked boat if you dont have particularly large drone bays and i have personally had a falcon simply speed tank my ogre iis while jamming my geddon ships in reserve works ok if there is only a single ecm boat you can warp on top of them and thus compromise their situation somewhat still in all three scenarios there is nothing preventing a well prepared falcon pilot from escaping so dead is a quite big overstatement as i see iti would have no problem with ecm boats getting a bit of tank for this change and the rook has a good bit of damage output actually oh and of course they can all field a very heavy shield tank they just usually dont since ecm is all the offense and defense they need it is true that their range has been looked at and i am not proposing changing that here  i think the range they operate at now is fairnow answer me this do you agree that the best counter for ecm at current is either ecm of your own or a significant amount of ships on your side
what he saidnot supported
nope because of the high sensor strength of recons ecm doesnt work its superior tactics that win fights against ecm a bigger fleet yes i mean the ecm boats use 45 jammers so its easy to overcome a single one a brutix with eccm fitted has a magno strength of 356 enough window to send a pack of medium drones at it dead might be an overstatement and so what if it gets away gone is gone you just need to rethink your strategy and not try to gank a falcon with 4 battleships furthermore i completely agree with cearain
i think 15 of the ships you meet anywhere in eve is quite a lot when you take into account that they cant really kill a lot of stuff on their own i also dont agree that ratios says anything about quality  i see a lot of cerbs in pvp but i still think it is an underpowered ship i agree that ecm is the sole brightspot caldari have at the moment but the fix for that should be making missiles viable in pvp aside from the drake which does fine atm what youre saying here is that it would be alright if all gallente had was crap ships and the dominix but the dominix gets 50 to drone dps per level of gallente battleship  you cant take powerlevel over an entire faction of ships is what i am getting at and yeah you never get top damage but i cant say i see why you wouldnt get any killmails i dont really see the great drawback to this  all recons interdictors and logistics have that problemecm should be powerful yes as i see it ecm is capable of settling every small scale fight at the moment small scale being less than 10 people on each side the best way to counter it is bring your own ecm not fitting eccm needing to field a bigger fleet to overcome ecm basically means you dont want pvp in groups of less than 10 to be viable as i see it and that is the effect ecm has atm again as i see it so i just need to pay that 120 mil for a t2 cruiser that requires a good few mil sp to just fly and then i have a chance so pvp should not be open to people that havent played for say a year then again i still think effectively loosing that medium slot in fights against anything else is too much of a disadvantage but ive already made that argument and we apparently just dont agree about the assigning drones to scare them off not being good enough to kill them well what is if i want to kill any other ship in the game i have a pretty good idea of how i would do it but an ecm boat all i have available is ecm or blob is that really the best solutionalso i do take a tactical approach to fighting ecm boats in fact we discussed it in this very thread a few posts back so no need to go assume i just ran my head into a wall and came here
i dont think its one fifth of ships i really dont know and admit i have no way to tell in the fleets i fly in its usually around 1 in 10 is an ecm ship but i have nothing close to a statistically relevent sample to base that on but even if it were 1 in 5 consider this there are only 4 factions and caldari is the biggest faction the best weapon the largest of 4 factions has is likely to appear allot so no i dont think that is too many i would think if gallente were the most popular race we would have 15 to 110 of the ships being drone boats heck maybe 110 of the ships now in a a gangs are drone boats ok here there are numerous ecm ships in caldari not just one ship bb falcon rook scorpion griffin i mean its clear that ecm is a big part of the caldari lineup its not just one ship like the dominix nerfing ecm to caldari is like nerfing drones for gallente or nerfing speed for minmatar im not saying the epeen hit is a great drawback but some people do look and care about that for those players it is a drawback your right its a drawback for logistics and other ships as well but its still a drawback bring your own ecm you have to bring your own mix of ships to succeed yeah eve forces you to strike a balance with tank gank and ewar it seems you want to be able to have an effective 10 man gang while completely ignoring the best ewar in the game that cant be done and i hope it never can be done
an arazu virtually no damage output has no tank damp range still waaaay lower than the nerfed ecm range drones on it  dead sniper on it  dead keep some ships in reserve  deadi see some similarities
i was using an exaggerated example to prove my point my point was merely that just because part of your lineup really really sucks another part does not get to be ludicrously better than anything else in the game blasters are underpowered atm but i dont think droneboats should be better because blasterboats are bad i am going to be a bit cheeky and bold a flatout contradiction in this quote so you think it is alright that in order to get any kind of success in small gang pvp i need to include a ship from a subset of 5 ships all from the same race in my gangs how is that bringing my own mix to any extent if that one ship determines if i have any chance at allfurthermore how is having to retarget your target every twenty seconds loosing tackle and ewar on that target in the process going to be ignoredwhat i am proposing here is not a nerf that makes ecm something you can just ignore  which some of the other ewar is in a lot of situations mind  but something you can actually do stuff to counter you got tracking disrupted you can move closernegate the opponents speed to react you get sensor dampened you move closer or just hope the extra locking time isnt too much of an advantage for the enemy you get target painted but that hardly matters most of the time you get jammed and you sit there waiting to die you probably wont get your lock again certainly not if you have no friends that are unjammed or untackled you cant even direct your drones and there is probably a ship agressed to you that is close by that can tank those fof missiles just fine is it so hard to see why i would like there to be something anything to do about being jammed once you are actually jammed
no theyre already called lockbreaker bombs
wow you can use those in lowsec and empire
i think ecm should get a sig radius penalty  tracking penaltyecm verus big slow ships works well  versus cruisers is moderate and is poor verus frigateskinda the reverse of damps where range damping is more effective against smaller ships with smaller lock ranges
solution to getting jamed 1 warp outwarp back in 2 find out who can get a lock on that annoying ecm boat and assign drones to assist him 3 get your own ecm ships infact get your own ewar ships no offence but i can hit a falcon with a big fat no bat with a couple targeting range damps eccm is also a great fix because it greatly increases that falcons chance of missing a cycle each jammerh has to focus n you is another jammer he cant use on your buddy non boosted gang 34 ships jammed depending on what ships are on the field boosted gang maby 2 simple equasion i can fly a scorpian or i can fly a rokh scorpian has no real dps and is a high target priority for any competent fc rokh in blaster config can push 800 dps with my current skills has a ed buffer tank and can reach farther than most other blaster boats so tell me what is the point of flying a jam boat if it cant do what it was ment to do effectivly why sacrifice 800 dps and 250 k effective hp from my fcs lineup unless i can bring somthing to the table that is worth the sacrifice
this is very sensible
nah jujst delete ewar altogether it distracts from tanking and pewpewingkthxbye
sure but you can still shoot them with projectilesmissilesdrones  point is you have a hell of a lot more options then you would when you cant lock themyou have played the game postdamp nerf right i mean logged in in the last oh say two yearsi love it when people use this one as their main argument isnt that the answer to all problems bring more people your missing the pointriiiiiight that is why soooo many people fit them because they are worth fitting everyone must be altering their loss mails and altering them its a conspiracywould be awesome if they always went for the ship jamming you so everyone train for missile boats tooi really wish i felt as strongly about eccm being viable to fit as much as you do you still fit the eccm if the jamming boat that you scouted on sisi is not aloneyeah i was hoping for people that play on tranquility but have fun with those test matches mateand you can still shoot those pretty awesome guys while they are neuting webbing scramming you i am not apposed to a secondary ew for caldari i think that would be interestingjamming ships are always primary 99 of the time for a reason ask anyone that if they had to pick which ew they would like to have used on them are they gonna pick being jammed you can even take the argument to ew drones if anyone packs ew drones it is always ecm drones 99 of the time
if ecm were too powerfull we would see many more ecm boats out there right now about 1 out of every 510 ships is an ecm boat that is pretty balanced ecm does not need to be balanced with other ewar the idea is the races need to be somewhat balanced for pvp ecm is caldaris best weapon if you nerf ecm caldari are just pathetic ecm pilots have many downsides you are never top damage dealer nor do you ever get a km there is no need to make caldari any worse than they already are for pvp
ok so eccm is useless alright since i am fair mded i decided to take a little time out of my day and do some number crunchingi will pick a fairly common middle of the road pvp boat the dominix and place it under a falcon with a perfactly skilled pilot whos one mission in life is to jam galente ships feel free to double check my math but this is what i got with my horribal american public school education the formula the chance of one module to jam one ship on one cycle is p  ecm strength  ship sensor strengthhence the probability that the jam fails is 1p the probability that at n jammers all fail is 1pnbaseline domi sensor str 22 boosted 431 overheated booster 495 falcon jam str14128 baseline jam chance 1 modual jamsensor 64 36 chance of faiure chance for 5 jammers to suceed is 893now baseline bosted jam chance 1296ok jam baslines str22 p64 str boosted 431 p32 boster overheat p28what this means chance of faiure for each modual is baseline 36 boosted 68 overheated booster 72 chance of faiuremultiple jammers chance all failining base line 1 36 2 12 3 4 4 16 5 6boosted jam 168 2 46 3 31 4 21 4 14 5 9overheated booster 172 2 51 3 37 4 26 5 19
this is with a tec 2 fit falcon vs tec 2 fit dominix what the results mean is that even with the most perfactly skilled ewarpilot flying the most ideal ship for jammning and prefitted to target that one dominix the dominix still has aproximatly 1 in five chance of getting a lock on that falcon and sicking his drones on it in my entire time flying jam boats i have only run that kind of set up once and that was to counter station humping games played by a guy in a hyperion now lets also remember that that is the result of one booster on one ship2 eccm moduals jump the sensor str on tha domi into the low 100s and the chances of that falcon pilot missing a cycle on a ship is going to increase exponentially with each aditional target on the field god help the poor falcon pilot who trys to get a jam on a boosted ship without racials now i should also point out that this dosent factor things like projected eccm and sensor backup arrays oh and dont gime any crap about i dont have the slots for it thats a domi set up with mwdscram and web and it still has 2 med slots to play with end result dead jam boat end of story
so in closing eccm is a good thing if your worried about jam boats i recomend to any fc that is worried about jam boats to get a ship with impressive sensor str and assign its pilot to deal with jammer ships that show up this is not the end all tactic either stealth bombers particuarly those who shoot em are a massive threat as are other ecm and ewar ships snipers and competent fcs can a good ewar pilot turn the tide of a 10v10 or 5v5 fight yes is ecm powerful yes is it unstopable no can ecm be countered and factored for by a psudo competent gang leader hell yes can ecm be countered with good fitting hell yes

i like this idea not only because it seems like it could be very effective while minimizing collateral damage but its also sort of humorous in a twisted ironic kind of way the isk spammers would succeed in identifying themselves and then removing themselves from the game like the previous posts say if you arent aware of whats going on in jita take just 60 seconds to peek at jitas local chat then try to petition one or more of these incessant and probably automatedmacrobacked spambots and watch just how quickly they return to local
i support the basic idea but also propose a minor modificationif a trial account tries to link this site the chat comment should fail to go through and a warning message should appear on the screen saying you attempted to post a url to a known illegal iskselling site the use of such sites is forbidden by ccp and mentioning specific such sites is also forbidden if you post a url to a known iskselling site again your account will be suspendedif its a clueless noob then fine theyve been given fair warning and they probably wont do it again if its an isk seller and they try again then the account gets shut down
rather than the chat system having filters looking at every line spoken i think a better approach is a more agent based onethus ccp would have a modified automated client that monitors the chat rather then having the filters hardcoded into the main systemthis probably wont be needed with the new reporting system users should be reporting quick enoughi imagine theyll be toying with autotempgag after x reportsstill believe there needs to be a gm in the process before any ban has been handed out
i think youre right that there needs to be some sort of gm confirmation before any character is banned it does seem that the more valid spammers ive reported the faster their text seems to cease from local but then they just pop back in with another characteri think that ccp more or less has the notification and immediatedealingswith down fairly well but what seems to be lacking at present are preventative measures
yes its not very hard to implement an ai filter that categorizes messages just like an email spam filter really have it sort out messages that are potentially spam and have a gm look over the flagged messages so that he can then gagban the offendersupporting the modified proposal
the original proposal is good this modified proposal is better i also propose that one of thes agents would sit in every newbie system as well as the main market and mission hubs in order to nail them asap
i 3 this idea
i too 3 this idea been in jita 3 days didnt have no one on the blocked list now its practically full 
yes 
please do it  yesterday
i agree that something should be done it does ruin the local channeli think autoban may cause problems for noobidiotdrunk genuine gamers thoughi think a more subtle approach would be an advertising charge for posting in local10000 isk for standard post100000 isk for post with contract link1m isk for url link or for link with identifyable url in text  this would make isk sellers cry  
just a thought i had would definitely require some work on ccps end but perhaps less work in the long run in regards to having to spend manhours looking into and rectifying account hacks and less headaches for those that have been hacked and their possessions liquidatedperhaps add a feature in the account section of eves website that allows the player to log and remember their home ip address that being the one in which they will log on from the majority of the time in addition allow the player to set up a bank of say 56 security questionswith that done whenever the player logs on from his home pc which many do there will be no change whatsoever but if someone were to log on from a different ip they would be addressed with a random question chosen from the previously established pool if this is the user no big deal but it would be my hope that it would deter would be assailants that have acquired your password via key logger as you would have no reason to normally put in the answer to those security questionsmind you i know this would be useless and an extra step for those of us with a rotating ip but i think the majority of people have static ips from their isp and would benefit the masses more than the inconvenience it was to the minorityand for those of us who have experienced the grief account hacks it would a nice piece of mind that there was at least a lessened chance of it happening again
your assuming everyone will have a static ip addressthis is not the case
i agree the current mechanic where faction war pilots have to watch fleetmates die while thrid parties attack certain members of certain corps out of their fleet needs fixing but the op suggestion is a very slanted way to fix it i would be more inclined to vote for something like one of two different solutions1 you cant war dec faction war corps its a very simple solutution and easy to implement faction war corps cant join alliances therefore cant hold sov and have various other limitations like standings requirements that you would like to avoid but fw corps have to swallow perhaps this is a decent balance not really surean alternate 2 if you war dec a fw corp then you war dec everyone in effect you stand in the shoes of the militia you are fighting for so if you wardec amarr you also are in it against caldari and any other thrid party entities that have decced either minmatar or gallente if it were like this you would still be able to be in an alliance and have no standing requirements that fw corps suffer from accordinly the fw corps alone should get the lp bonuses and the ability to do plexes and fw proper things etc if you are third party war deccer you can stay in your alliance but you do not get the fw proper benefits a potential problem with this is oo alliances may just completely overwhelm fw i dont know but at least it has some semblence of ballance the problem with the op solution is you may be in a big enough alliance where you can be pretty sure you can bring enough forces to dominate a single fw militia you may be able to bring your 00 resources such as cap ships in order to camp their hq preventing their t1 ships from getting any pew pew while it might sound like fun for some i think it pretty much sucks so i vote against it if you want to get in fw for the pew pew with out getting in fwwell at least offer something that isnt so slanted at least make your proposal such that you need to deal with the same number of conflicts those in fw have to deal with
not supported primarily for the reason that in a mixed fleet lets give minmatar and third party will be split on who can engage what when caldari come to join in splitting up the militia forces is badthe csm meeting notes have ccp saying they will allow alliances in that do not hold any 00 sov sounds good to me
1 seleene for president 2 every time nozh logs in to target paint sieged dreads he must suddenly appear in the drone regions with his autopilot set back to the caldari nub starting system and have the tutorial automatically pop up this is a good start to the long journey of nozh actually learning something about this game
i think your focus may be too narrow i dont think you should look at rigs in a vacuum you need to consider whether there is too much gank or tank in the game as a whole if there is too much gank in the game now then the shieldarmor mods including rigs should be buffed and the weapon mods including rigs should be nerfednow i think the game is fairly well balanced and the rigs gave a nice needed boost to tank as a whole this is because i personally like pvp to have a bit more strategy and be less twitchy if you have more tank there will be more time to switch ammo and range etc there will be more strategy in a fight if its all gank then you just hope you were lucky enough to fit the right ammo and choose the right range when you start because you wont have time to adjust so for these reasons i would prefer they do not boost the gank in the game not rigs or any other gank mods for that matter but specificially i do still use gank rigs on some of my ship fits if you have the powergrid or cpu you can fit those rigs for no penalty at all plus they are much cheaper than trimarks or shield extenders the armor rigs do indeed slow you down allot and that is why i sometimes prefer the weapon mods dictating range is often important so is the ability to burn out when you need to 3 armor rigs really hurts that effort as far as the negatives for the shields its harder to measure so while i agree that i usually fit the armor and shield rigs i dont think that is a bad thing and weapon rigs are still used as well for these reasons i would be against your idea
i agree with all of the above
dictors still have tactical advantages over hics  the bubble doesnt go away if you shoot the ship for one on the actual topic of discussion supported
supported i too want to afk my gang until we disappear from local and then gank people
simply add an afk timer if your character doesnt interact with anything for 5 to 10 minutes he gets a small marker that shows he is afk that way we know if someone decided to go watch a movie while in your space or if theyre actually playing the game
only for his corp nobody else deserves that much intel
its not intel if hes afk so dont make it sound like its some kind of ingame advantage to know hes afk if hes afk he isnt playing but because hes still logged in a system has to function as if hes still active and playing because theres no way of telling whether he really is playing or not the best solution is if youre character is idle and in space for a certain period of time youre automatically logged off but i wont suggest that because i dont want you to have a  attack p
of course it is intel you know he is less dangerous that is a valuable information for you as you dont belong to his friends you should not have that information
sure then the evil cloaker will just sit there long enough to get the afk marker everyone will go back to normal and then hell strike then the whining about this new tactic will start a bunch of silly new threads the solution isnt adding more free intel its the removal of the intel that already shouldnt be there fix local and suddely an afk person can terrorize no one because no one will know they are there
many valid points against this few for it look at my alliance and see how i feel about cloaks i think its poor form to reply to your own suggestion and then support it lol also you suggested that activating orbit would remove you from local you obviously dont pvp
i mean this forum is supposed to be about communicating with ccp via the csm right the mods here are aware of that purpose one would assumemaybe ccp should just give us a list of approved topics that theyre willing to listen to based on the changes that theyve already decided to make rather than just continuing with this charade of player involvement

normal game developers delay releases all the time ccp should try it and stop with rushing an expansion which obviously still has many faults everyone who follows the dev blogs spends time on sisi is part of a 00 alliance reads the discussions knows theres an incredible ammount of things wrong with dominion im not gonna detail that here im just gonna assume people who agree with me have more or less the same informationreleasing dominion within 15 week from now with so many obvious flaws will have the potential of bringing eve closer to mmo deathmaybe the corporate owners of ccp dont care maybe their marketing guys whispered in their ears that there absolutely cant be any delay maybe competing space mmos are rushing towards the limelight and ccp has to block their moves with a highprofile highpowered pr buffed expansionccp dont be tempted by external forces to ignore things you should fix internally also go back to twoway feedback between developers trusted by the community and the community itself maybe in your opinion it wont affect the bottom line much but for us players getting a warm and fuzzy feeling about the devs and what theyre trying to do is very important regarding our consumer behaviour do we continue to buy this product or not are we pleased by the companys service do we have the feeling the company is taking his clients seriouslyat the moment we the consumer are not being taken seriouslyccp make a good expansion and communicate with your clients more effectively recognize the fact that ing off your longterm subscribers whove been with you for years can be the ultimate recipe for mmo death for killing your own childanyway i could rant a lot longer im under the impression a lot of people know very well what im talking aboutnowim simply calling here that the csm put forward to ccp as soon as possible the very simple idea of postponing the release of dominionand let ccp developers without  or at least with less  time stress get it right you made us wait for wisincarna for like 3 years we can wait for a better 00supercap patch a bit longeredit if you dont believe this is not a troll check my posting history i never speak up on eveo unless i have something to say which i deem to be important so please treat this post seriouslyanother edit this is my personal opinion and doesnt reflect what my corp andor alliance thinks this is me as a paying customer i pay for 5 accounts bringing this issue to the csm
supporting this product or servicein all seriousness i approve of this 15 weeks to dominion and allot of key features are untestable on sisi or obviously dont work im thinking military and industrial level display growth and decay calculations which even when they do seem to work dont account for small systems with only a few belts etc an oversight with a simple fix with time ccp need time to get this right before release it affects far too much to implement now and fix later

thats pretty much true though of all elections its all selling via advertising im actually disheartened at the number of candidates that are being pro active and looking for other avenues of campaigning past the forums i think it says a lot for those that are taking the time and effort to get themselves out there and seen theyre putting in the work already which i think is a good thingvoting for the council of stellar management is now onlinemake your voice heard
hmmm for the first time i have not participated in this forum in the runup to this election i was planning on voting for issler and very disappointed she wasnt allowed to run so i quickly got to your vote match site once i saw the dev blog about votingtoo bad its so little help more than half the candidates are somewhere between 55 and 65 per cent matches with the closest at 67 and several major issues in diametric contradiction i dont know if others had the same problem but i reckon this might profit from some clustering of issues into more general ideologies several statements could then position a candidate at a certain stance between two fundamentally opposing concepts as for examplepvp vs pvesandbox vs theme parkrealistic consequences vs fun gameplaypro solo player vs pro group player figuresfix the game vs add cool new stuffboost endgame vs improve npeetcnow if i just knew who issler endorsed

i was surprized to see a question at
wormhole poss arent exposed to dangersure they dont have to worry about a cap fleet showing up to curb stomp them but there are logistical issues for poss in wspace that dont exist in kspacefor all practical purposes wormhole poses are cut off from known space supply lines each time the located wormhole collapses and is replaced the next wormhole could lead to a distant part of kspace or another wspace system this means that corporations moving into wormhole systems have to plan to be selfsufficient i have no idea how to get the fuels that arent manufactured reliablyif the pos consumables run out the starbase will offlineyes waging war on a pos directly is very difficult the same as fighting one in high sec but there are obvious alternatives attack the ships that operate out of the station eventually it will offlineas long as poss are effected by the same system phenomena that targets player ships like some buff or debuff aspects of the game i think it is fine how it is it would be potentially ruining to plant a pos in a system that halves the effectiveness of shields but if it is a profitable system that seems like a fair trade
well it appears your knowledge of worm holes is limitedjust an observation no one can know everything about evethe class 5 and 6 worm holes people do have to worry about caps showing up as they can have worm hole opennings that allow at least one cap in and back i know of certain corps that make it part of their game play to go into other worm holes and kill off other peoples poss for the fun and games and the isk that drops so yes it can happenthe fuel must be carried inside as there is no ice inside worm holes to mine so one is always looking for a way to high sec to get your stuff to sell out and your fuel and other stuff insome people want to have the sleepers come and attack poss in wormholes and somehow kill them i could sorta see this happening if you had a small pos with no defenses but any pos with defenses should be able to take out bssthanks for your responses

i support giving blackops a little love they could handle a bit more jump range a bit more ehp a bit more dps without becoming overpoweredi dont think many people will frontline them preferring to bridge a fleet into battle and remain safe in another system but if they are a little bit better than their t1 hulls that might happen more ofteni have a bo pilot trained but ive not yet bought the ship
i think ccp summed it up best and drew the wrong conclusionif there are so few black ops ships in the game less than even the titans then that is not the reason to let is sit in the corner alone like some ugly stepchild    that is the reason to go back and give it some loving to bring it back into the foldif they are so committed to making ships begin to have specialized roles then ask what role the bos should have and address the question of whether the current design does make someone look to this ship for that role or notyes they need someone looking into this
supported up the jump range so that it can fill its intended role cov ops cloak would be nice and for gods sake please bump their base stats up so that they can be a match for their t1 counterparts either that or mke a drastic reduction in the overall price of the ship i think the main thing that is killing black ops is the billion isk price tag for a ship that has a nifty trick for its size compaired to what else i can get my hands on for that amount of isk carrier marauder some of the cheaper dreads and the capabilitys that these ships offer compaired to their simarly priced counterpart its just not worth the investment
ops logic is incredibly flawed despite his very nice pvp stats and seniority in the game did he get his account hacked just trolling for kicksflawed from the start all other races are locked into using weapon systems that deal specific damage types to deal a different damage type they fit nonracial weapons and forego their ships bonuses minis sort of an exception please say theyre overpowered though so which race was it again that is actually able to deal straight em straight exp straight therm and straight kin damage oh right the missilespewing caldari all other races have to stick to substandard damage due to mixed damage types from their races weaponsyou think thats bad try dealing straight explosive damage with a gallente or amarr ship quit complainingunless hes dealing his races damage like all the other races are forced to caldari has a choice at leastjust plain wrong no other races can discard their damage bonus cept mini sort of im sure they would if they coulda yeah umm everyone but amarr deals kinetic damage so at least multiply out the numbers for everyone pleaseb 13  where do you get that figure from why is it relevant to caldari but not to other racesc yeah drones are totally the equivalent of dealing damage across all types totally no really im being completely serious panda here totallyd more reasons dont care enough to type them outall the races except caldari use a certain type of weapon system that is limited to specific damage types if they want to deal damage besides their weapon types damage they have to mount nonracial weaponssince hybrids only deal kintherm dmg gallente effectively have almost every ship that deals their races damage type the exception would be the myrm which doesnt have a turret bonus the difference though is that theyre locked into it and cant switchfailthis threadchoose 2 pleaseexcept that there are a couple of noncaldari missile ships which shouldnt be kinetic bonused sacrilage etc
very much supportedolder caldari ships raven caracal kestrel get a universal bonus why not the rest
well in principle i support this topic but there are some details one would have to considert2 ships we already had the discussion about khanid ships they get universal damagebonus but only to shortrange launchersmissilesshould caldari t2 ships get their boni only for heavy missiles or should the kinetic bonus be exclusive for caldari t2 for all those peeps that complain it would be unfair how about you get only leadstandard chargeslenses but get them in all 4 damagetypes and your ships get only boni for your racial damagetype

some proofas a first step  and this would just be a temporary bandaid  reduce all insurance premiums and payouts by 2533longer term we need a better system
or just remove insurance after all it would make ships cheaper which should make up for the increased cost of loosing ships to some extentbut yes a reform would be a good step in the right direction however mining would need some form of boost to keep mining profitable
make insurance marketbasedaka platinum pays out 100 of market value not 100 of base price and lowereliminate the drop rates of unnamed mineralequivalent loot itd be more complex than that to transition the market over but thats the basic solution
insurance pay out based on market value is too easy to manipulate but yeah insurance in general needs a look at but for now reducing stuff by 5 will be sufficient no need to do 33
definatly supported because loosing a faction friggate worth 70m is bad enough with out the insurance company rubbing it in with a payout of only a few hundred thousand

great idea 
overzealous moderation stifles onlinecommunitiesthe heavier moderation is the more moderate people leave this creates a community consisting purely of yes men the result is a community with an increasingly elitist feel where new members are shouted down by those who feel they are closer to the moderators it starts small and becomes a massive issue down the track
the posts being deleted are for the most part well deserved and relevant ccp needs to address problems rather than ignore them i remember some star wars game that failed utterly did the samewhere is it now
signedthere is a huge problem you cannot simply censor people who try to point it out
ccp is terrible at pr and interaction with playerbase
there are moments when ccp is terrible at pr and interaction with playerbasethis is one of those moments
im thinking this mass censorship is reflected in ccps name crowd control productions
forum moderation on eve is usually pretty light handed very much of the stuff you can post here would be censored on other games boards that said the amount of censorship i saw today with no other apparent goal than to keep thread size low when they ran out of troll posts to delete they started deleting on topic posts makes me support this issue

you want to discuss moderation isnt that against the ed forum rules or something
not supportedif you want to be taken serious choose your words accordingly if you cant youd better stop playing this game and relieve this community from yourself your time is better spend in school where you could learn all those noninsulting words which would allow you to formulate your issue in a mature mannerto be honest if i had something to say in ccp id not only kill those messages but terminate their accounts and happily pay them back any outstanding subscription fee just to get rid off these kindergarten kidsits a shame for everyone who is seriously articulating a very valid critic but gets buried beneath mountains of swear words seriously guys grow up

supported effective and simple as all good solutions are
supporting this great idea
oh thats easy you stick 27 titans outside the front door and nuke any ship that pokes its head out cap or no cap itd be like the camp of pr except youd need a couple trillion of ships and youd have to do it for every single outpost you want to take that sounds like fun right
fully support this solution
make an exemption for jamming and ecm bursts as these are primarily defensive measures used to stop someone from scrambling and do not deal any direct damage
clearsimple and probably easy to implement
simple elegant solution not sure if it should really apply to gates as well though
very simply the timers that control station docking and gate jumping after aggression should be modified as follows so long as a ship does not commit an aggressive act weapons drones ew remote repair of a combatant etc no timer applies to docking or gate use beyond the usual session change limits if a ship acts in an aggressive manner that ship gains the usual aggression flag and the stationgate timer is set to one minute until the timer runs out the ship cannot dock or use gates once flagged any hostile act whether its by the ship in question or against it will reset the stationgate timer to the full one minuteon one side i hate docking games like most of eve but the gatecamp engager in me is screamingjumping into chokepoints engaging and killing x number of campers before deaggressing and jumping out when the reinforcement blob arrivesi have a ship capable of tanking 3 dreads worth of dps jump into the typical gatecamp of 1 tackler 2 drakes and ofc the mandatory falcon end up sitting on the gate permajammed for 25 minutes while they bring in enough reinforcement to take me downunable to get a lock due to falcon unable to outrun the tackler and the refreshing 1 minute timer that will not run down with the new mechanic a less mobile sitting duck have not been seen in new edenfor station games i think the mechanic would work fairly well since you cant dock in the station and boobytrap the enemy pilots hangarfor gates i do not think the idea is well enough thought out as there is a way to lock down the hostile by 1 ship holding aggro and follow the jumpthen again gatecampers would benefit from this as well someh why not idea supported

censure pronounced sU025Bnr is a process by which a formal reprimand is issued to an individual by an authoritative body in a deliberative assembly a motion to censure is usedas an addition to the welcomed issue raised by former csm member lavista vista i believe the incarnation of the csm that will next meet ccp should deliver a censure to them on behalf of the eve community for recent actions regarding their censoring of the comment pages to the mothership devblog it would be no more than a gesture but i think ccp should be brought to account and encouraged to explain themselves
when a thread has been discussed by the csm1 place the meeting minutes for the item at the top of the thread in a special highlighted section using a custom forum feature2 place the meeting minutes in a standard post within the thread to mark the time it was updated in the conversation flow3 include links to related devblogs or ccp commentsthis will allow more detailed discussion of raised issues while letting newcomers to the issue know it has been discussed
great idea unfortunately it would require ccp to give moderator roles to csm and so far they have not wished to do so despite being asked for it for over a year
this could prove to be very use full even thought being able to park in the pos bubble while red fleets are in system is very use full or when i move my pricey hauler like the orca down the bridge to work like a feri so if i see reds and cant enter shield i would have to turn around and run fast also if im to pay for my jump it would be nice to have a pre pay option and or consume from hold on the fly also i would need to knoow how much im burning to know what to put back in one last thing would be awsome is to be able to chain jumps through the by selecting next jump
i worry slightly about the annoyance value of making people remember another password also id be curious to see just what kind of superhighway goonsplnc put together to span most of 00 if this goes throughthough of course your blocs will be nothing to sneeze at either but of course that latter one is good in the context of what dominion is trying to do  allow alliances to fracture while keeping their bridges intact overall i think i support this
also when clicking jump and you have fuel in your cargo bay the following popup should appearwould you like to use fuel from your cargo bay use cargo use stored fuel
it makes all the sence in the world
it should never take 10 minutes to warp even in a ship as slow as a bustard but with the apalling trafic conditions in jita this has happened to me on many occasions and i am sure i am not the only one who sometimes has to wait for minutes on end because the noclip timer is too short and people start colliding with you as your trying to allign i propose that ccp either increase the no collision timer when undocking from jita and or disable ship collisions within 1  2 km of the station
ship collision changes wont fix thispreventing station camping and ships parking themselves in the flow of traffic however willive said it before if im undocking gtfoomw
i routinely warp off jita 44 within half a second of hitting the warp button in a freighter warp to jita 4planet or station whichever and youll get out of the traffic jam basically instantly in an iteron v i dont even have to use that trick it can warp to the perimeter gate without any great difficulty 95 of the time also the number of times ive had my model superimposed over other ones at the jita undockwith all the weird and amusing chimeras that produces id suggest that theyve probably done this already
take a fast small ship undock and fly 300k from the station in a straight linemake a bookmark next time you are there with a slow ship warp to the bookmark firstbenefits you warp instantly and dont get into the jam you can align to the gate without getting bumped from the bookmarked spot scanning you is rather hard and people wont see where you really warp to
just a list of stuff that could be cool comments and critic please1 dronefighter formations since you are adding fleet formations add formations to drones too2 fix stutteringshaking of capital ships not sure how to explain other than look at this video

allright let me redefine my idea then the biggest sellingpoint for me on this idea would be to make nice movies so a simulator would let you setup ships around space the way youd like define actions then take some footage but the combat simulator part would be to actually have any gameplay reason to add this allthough i dont see any negative aspects with having it the fact that you are against it tells me there might be reasons to not have that  either way the main point would be to have a 3d envirnment to setup movie footage wihtout having to take them live on tq or sisi this would allow you to do things you usually wouldnt be able togood suggestions other things like stations needing supplies currently players can buy up npc goods at one place and sell them higher somewhere else expanding on this feature you could actually setup a station supply list and storage each station would have a certain amount of goods that are consumed on a daily basis every so often npc supply lines would deliver goods and the supplies would rise again here players could be ahead of the npcs and deliver goods to stations earlier and make a small profit or you could have players attack these supply lines and get some of the goods themself high sec would have concord at you however this could create a shortage of supply for a station or certain stations that could open up global mission content to help get the supplies needed etc things like this could happen with pirates too creating local events so to speak players could choose to interact but not requiredother idea would be to have npc factions have a manufacturing supply of ships you could essentially thin out navy fleetsconcord in certain areas by destroying these ships and depending on a factions manufacturing capability it could take a certain amount of time for it to recover to have any significant impact on npc space would require a huuuuge amount of effort tho again this is only a minor part of what could be added to the game to make things happen out there and not all be behind the scenes and these are just genereal ideas without having thought them through properly well i was pretty much looking for noncombatmining ships in general allthough for instance you could have a ship that could locate space anomalies comets phenomenon gather intel on them get some kinda research and data that could lead to new technology maybe a new production tier or special items or something just one example you could have a very specialized probingscanning ship that could say give you the site types right away grav ladar wormhole etc uhm anything really that doesnt directly have a combat or mining purposehow about transport ships like shuttles just for us leet capsulers  like owning a ferrari in space p
this would be cool but ive got to agree waste of coding time
third party addons for all your random everelated needs
yes i fully agree
to me walking in stations aka ambulation aka incarna seems like a great move from ccps part when i first started my trial i was struck down by the fact that is this all i mean i just fly in a ship thats it back then i didnt know how great eve was mind you p and the fact that they are adding some secret agents where you have to get offline to aquire these missionscould be drug transportation to saving some politicians life whos best before date has expired or just some actions that the faction in question does not want anyone else to know about etc etci cant understand what people mean when they say that wis is only a five minute hype it brings alot of content imagine the amount of new players who start playing eve to me thats a huge sign with an arrow pointing to a bucket saying fresh meat ready for picking i for one do appreciate the rp aspect that this brings in makes the eve lore more appealingnew player experience any way that could be improved to make the newbs more comfortable with the learning curve well heck incarna certainly gives me ideasand now for some small talk why not make eft eve fitting tool in game a computer you can access in wis that allows you to plan the fit of your ships that you ownwould certainly help us mac players since there is no eft available for mac at least not to my knowledge more mini games i would rupture my colon if there was texas holdem in eve xd heck if the copyrights allow it even a eve version of monopolyisk used of course  i cant honestly see why wis is being spoken as a bad move from ccps part i just cant
having seen wis at fanfest last year i wasnt too impressed i feel most of it will detract from the actual gameplay
and if it does is that such a bad thing i would imagine wis to bring in more players compared to the amount that are actually derailed from the actual game by wich i presume you mean pvp and lowsecnullsec fighting and how it affects pve and mining not at all i would say solo pvers will still solo pve and fleet pvers will now have a place to gather up a fleet and go pve and minerssuch as myself well they wont change we never change we just mine xd
a lot of time in eve is already spent doing peripheral things by this i mean activities like buying mods and fitting a ship flying to a certain destination managing assets etcto me these activities become boring rather quickly and i know of situations where i myself and others said meh and logged off when there was a call for an op because we werent in the right spot didnt have the right equipment or were waiting for a skill or job to finish adding another huge set of activities that draw away from eves core activities namely generating and acquiring resources and materials and destroying them pve and pvp if you like but the distinction isnt so clear will not improve the game im afraidbut i would be delighted if proven wrong sok
is it saturday already
you got my votes keep up the good workjag
thanks for everyone that supports z0d you vote for the right man
for me its not a case for not voting for you because you get a bit upset in local sometimes or even for the times you have accused me of using exploits  which anyone who knows me will know a im not that good b i dont cheat in computer games for me the main problem is your inability to see the massive inbalance in the soverignty system between caldarigallente and more recently the same imbalance allowing you guys to do lev4 fw missions in a stealth bomber while we must use very well fit bc or hacs its fairly simple though while you guys were capturing systems anyone who can fly a t1 frig could go and do any plex which enables multiple alts to be used after a few days training i imagine and even if alts are not used allows many more people to be capturing more plexes at any one time secondly that you think damps are anyway near as effective ewar as ecm is just rediculous any pvper knows how much more effective ecm is and when this is used by rats in caldari plexes its even more effective i have regulary been jammed ie unable to do anything and still being shot by missiles at 150km from npcs all you have to deal with in gallente plexes is blasters uber short range and a slightly slow locking time oh noes
i hope you will stand by your words damargood luck 
of course he wont hes a selfish fraudnot that i give him any chance of being elected maybe be becomes some low alternate if hes lucky though so he can sit there and be quiet while z0d fixes the real fw problems
page one with you
it seems you would be the ideal candidate representing smaller groups and in general the more carebare inclined sadly there is not alot of self promotion going on as indicated already by the other posters well you got my votes anyway wish you good luck
it will be interesting how many votes the no show candidates garner out of sheer randomnessthe good news is a wide field helps spread the random factor out enough that there will be little chance of an accidental electionthe one thing i wish ccp had done was put a shuffle on the candidates list so it was not the same person at the top of the page each time i know some folks had to f3 to find specific candidates in the wish to vote for themmikemike azariah
if you have already made your mind up what are you using a tool like this forthis is the first attempt ive seen to correlate candidates opinions in a framework for comparison its flawed like every other thing on planet including every system of government in existence but it is better than nothing i want to see moar of this stuff going on
abstaining was not removed by csm2 just enforced by it that rule is in the original csm documents prepared by xhagenpersonally i agree with it  either you want to bring something up with ccp or you dont if you dont know about the issue part of your job is to learn about it if you cant be bothered to do that or dont have the time to do that you shouldnt be on the csm
this is actually something i was thinking about in the early design  but the feature didnt make it into the website maybe the next version though 
been hearing about you son been checking out the things that you say been looking real close real real close dont want no more bogus we can do wonders for the game then nothing once they get in there types well word is in on you you do what you say your going to you seem to have as much love for the game now as when you were in your first ship burnout not in your vocabulary elite  not you yeah its true show me someone with your time in and you get elitist arrogance almost every time i wasnt going to choose hell was going to bag on each and every one of you candidates if i could however damned if i can find one person that knows you that doesnt think you are a whole lot better than even you say you aremeh fine you got my vote thanks for ruining my day nice i dont do fragthisbooyahh baby
i will not vote for any of them because of the crap they pull that is imo over the line just one ill mention is the recruit scamanyone else feel the samei went and spent the time and read over the candidates pages and pitches but totally skipped over any goons info how can anyone take them seriously
theyre all made out of ticky tackyand they all look just the same
i dont see how anyone that plays around in highsec and lowsec can vote for someone in a massive 00 alliance be it goons or otherwisefortunately there are some independent candidates in every election and that must be why dierdra won the last elections
im running this revieuw black ops topic in the assemly hall and im curious about the csms candidates toughts about this subject i do need to vote yet and i have a few friends that need to vote aswell
some of the reasons why i have not yet flown them in combat are listed there im not sure if giving them a huge boost in jump range would be the solution however maybe up to 6ly max so they can outrange jump bridgeszz joe makes some good suggestions there to improve their t2 skill bonuses but to make them more combat effective you can go two ways with those adding t2 resistances on par with hacs would be an easy way to give them more staying power but i have also seen requests for better dpsi would like to cooperate with a few people who have more experience with them to formulating a proposal to buff them if you help me get elected sok
you might want to edit the thread title to review but to answer the question i do agree that black ops ships need reviewing againthe fuel bay was a great start but as stated in the thread it suffers from being worse than the t1 hull in every other way technically it one higher resist but with the lower base armourshieldhull that doesnt helpa slight buff to ehp and dps may well get more people to frontline them instead of leaving them behind once the fleet has been bridgedup until recently i was only flying bombers and recons so im well versed in covert gameplay probe drops bombing runs etc and weve used blackops bridges a number of timesid like the clocked ships decloaking each other bug fixed too  at least for people in your fleet
i support the idea of reviewing black opsthe ships should not be just another tick on the i can fly that too checklistmike
they are fine as they are right now it should not be easy to move around in a blackops if ccp wants to give them some love then i would recommend the followinghp buffed to at least the same as their t1 hulls what zz joe mentionedimproved jump range 4  65ly base with jump drive calibration vmy 2 isk
ive been able to fly black ops for over a yeari was bored one month but ive never even seriously considered getting into one they just have too many drawbacks im not sure what the right fix is though all of the above is tempting but i do know that ccp really needs to stop prenerfing things
you have my voteU043EU043BU043EU043EU043B    U043CU043EU043E  U043A
there were no csm issues meetings during the fanfest so no context for us to raise anything at the csm raised the scanner issue direct to ccp in the csmccp meeting afterwards so rrrrraaaaaaaaaaage more sorry i cant say their response due to nda and all that but i think the minutes to that or raw chatlog will come out sometime soon
my vote fly safe
ashina is exactly the kind of person that ccp should be seeking out for feedback by forming cas combat day ashina has shown infinite patience teaching abilities and has helped keep a nonplayer corporation together and remarkably loyal without the benefits and mechanisms provided to help player corps succeed there should always be a strong voice for the many of us that love playing eve but for various reasons time desire etc dont wish to have their playtime dictated by corporate needs i can think of no better person to represent what i want an eve experience to be than ashinaboig
what can i say about ash she has bee supportive of a group of us younger players moving to npc 00 provides help and advice to us especially in the form of the now infamous cas combat days these are exceptionally well organised fleets alowing even the newest of players the ability to keep up and even get killsone player i can think of was days old on his first ccdyou really cant say more than thati suppport ash all the way for csmwe are in your debt
naps are good i like naps   us old folks need themmy point was that the csm is supposed to represent not write and champion their own agendas but help the player base get messages through to ccp the more planks i put in a platform the more lumber that is building a fence between me and that very same player base i propose the be standing up forthat being said have you been to my website have you listened to the planet risk debate read the latest copy of the eve tribune or are you just throwing sand in the air hoping to obscure the issues and the candidates i did say what i believed in but the most important thing is that i believe that the players need a voice many voices that is why we elect 9 candidates so there will be more than one idea and one group represented im not the one for you fine i accept that but i am the right person to represent other folks and theirs are th votes i hope to get the ones who read do research play the gamemike

insurance reform has been a long time coming and needed as the game progressesthe ability to break an empires back by destroying their ships needs to be possible and insurance always seemed a guardrail for newbies getting used to the game anyways please do something follow the t2 lead and only partially insure ships remove insurance on anything larger than a cruiser etc no risk battleship and drake gangs are commonplace in 00 insuring capital ships seems asinine and insurance fraud as linked to by that post is only bound to increase as prices of minerals slides furthera sensible solution would be preferred and hopefully a well thought out means of presenting the problem and solution to the community to avoid mass hysteria
it is evident that the prices of t1 ships  and therefore minerals are wholly determined by insurance values in the past ccp have removed mineral price ceilings reprocessing npc items and floors npc buy orders but insurance is the elephant in the room earlier in the games evolutionary progress i believe it was valuable and necesary now it is become a giant hinderance to the emergence of a true player economy not to mention a vast isk fountain not to mention antiimmersive behaviour like suicide ganking a legal absurdity made possible and necessary by the economic absurdity of negativevalue battleships and the gameplay absurdity of omnipotent concord policethe one real value of insurance is to protect new players however simple schemes like simply reducing insurance payouts by x per loss are susceptible to farming with alts it is also worth noting that without further change a reduction or removal of insurance would lead to a freefall plunge in t1 ship value so the absolute loss suffered from ship loss would be considerably reduced in any casethe other issue of course is that at the moment insurance is essentially a huge demand subsidy to miners the industrial economy is at the moment capable of producing many more ships than the war economy requires an alternative or even a companion to insurance reform might be to consider methods of increasing demand which is to say ship loss at the very least some dicussion as to why supply so outstrips demand is merited
you could take the route that has been discussed before remove insurance from selfdestruction or being killed by concordfaction police people will still use alts to kill their bs for the profit but theres really nothing much you can do except reducing insurance payouts
some reform is needed

believe it or not i dont think this would be a good idea as a miner myself im all for advancements to the miningmanufacturing field but this is one thing im gonna have to say no toboosters are highly discouraged by concord just look on the billboards by stargates and the harvesters are based on archaic technology this makes them kind of a black market industryi believe ccp wanted boosters to be a somewhat expensive onetime boost hence the exploration sites and limited harvesting methods if a mass harvester were introduced the price would plummet and they would be used for more than an edge
i think youre forgetting that t3 production requires gas from wormholes solely because of that fact the demand for a dedicated gas harvester is rising and will soon require a dedicated ship for the job i dont think its a matter of if we will ever see a gas harvester but when

the chinese government alt was just demostrating the attitude that becomes more prevalent under overmoderationthe users start to act more like moderators whenever a thread isnt removed instantly turning themselves into a social policeforce making sure no one settles who doesnt already agree with the established community groupthink
sadly im guessing a lot of people here all happy about the deleted posts dont realize just how many of them were not trolling swearing or otherwise obnoxious and contained solid ideas with real data backing them up yeah some troll posts were deleted but unlike is usually the case this time they were the in the minorityhtfu ccp
i know how to get the crowd under control well shoot the loudest peoplemothermoon is seriously ededitfor the record im in supportof the changes made in that dev blog so its not just the people that disagree that think this mass deletion is wrong dude in the past they would simple edit the post and add a reason like dont quote without content or please keep your posts constructive and it worked no one got mad
while noise and emorage is high censorship is not the solution
putting on my tinfoil hat based on the amount of the posts deleted one has to wonder if the flensing of the boards is due to potential investors reading the forums as part of their review process
supportedreading viewpoints from all sides of a discussion is important to me since im currently waiting to see just what dominion does before resubbing this account already closed my other 2 out of sheer frustration i want to see what others think and feel about these issues i too am havingif they are deleted before i get a chance to read them
deleting posts is the first sign of a company in trouble and trying to hide the facti have seen several mmos that started to delete threads they all slid into obscurity having their servers reducedpeople dont appreciate having such tactics been used in a public forum such as this it is terrible for public relations in fact i wonder if the ccp headquartemrs is filled with neo natzis hrm hail  you scum assed islanders  i will insult you any time i please why because its only ever in response to your own disgusting actions and i cant express myself with my fists too damned far away
i especially dislike the overly aggressive word filtering that picks up those words that contain syllables that might otherwise be considered profane if used as a separate and all too familiar obscenityobscenity as in a certain recent video featuring just about every employee in ccp enthusiastically fbombing without restrainthell did that get censored i loved the video it was cool sure lets just exercise some tolerance and call that liberal usage of everyones fave fbomb and applaud the artistic license ill agree 100but lets see ccp grow a pair apologize and drop this hypocrisy right now with all this heavyhanded censorshipcheers
no supportccp should serve out mass temporary forum bans for all the little children so they can take a timeout the exaggerated whining in recent dev threads was fun and satisfying to see at first but then it just turned into boring rant spam people need to cry more creativelyoh and ban the op for poor judgment
i agree with much of above as my frame of reference appears very similar to the quoted poster but my take on the situationsimple response to this would be if you were in deep space and this was occurring would the situation be acceptable by all parties that is deemed fair based on gaming mechanics i do not see why gates and stations should be safe havens for many acting as a saving grace and tactical object in many situations the scenario far more relevant to me is flying a guardian in an rrbs gang using the gate as my deaggressor when too much firepower is on me in which i decloak and burn back to the gate come back in and get reps before the enemy can reprimary me if im stuck on this side of the gate im forced to use nonsession changing game mechanics to find a way to survive or escape during a fight rather than rely on getoutoffightfree methods due to no aggro from repping already supported above but profix

agreed this is imho as perfect a solution as it can beeven the but a player can be kept there indefinetly issue is imho a nonissue just dont engage stuff you cannot kill if you get caught in such a way then you seriously deserve it
gets my vote cmon ccp even pie and cva is supporting a uk proposal d
no it does not solve the problem of boring gameplay ie station camps and benefits an aggressor far more than his victimclientcounter solution disallow use of any offensive moduledrone within docking range of station make rr count as full pvp aggro ie an offensive module disallow staticanchored bubbles covering docking portswhat this does prevents the lagtastic constant skirmishes outside empire hub stations prevents rr gayness at docking ports prevents rr gayness jumping gates when targeted removes neutral rr gayness in highseclowsec removes permanent camps of stations still possible but you have to risk at least tackling ships gives 00 station defenders ability to get out and engage in proper combat provided they can clear the docking tacklemeets your goal and solves a whole heap of issues associated with it on top

i do think this would be an intersting deal if they did make the gui userfriendly and fully customizable far too long have i wanted to see something updated with the overview i think it would be awesome if you could have multiple overviews not just tabs more along the point of having a seperate overview that has the stations gates and bookmarks in the system that would make it a little bit better but just being able to customize what you want on the gui i have learned like most to simply adapt itd be nice to have some sort of view when you mouse over something on the overview window that it shows a bubble info deal similar to when you hold over a file in windows and it shows properties instead of having to have a 4 inch overview to see if it is a medium or large wreck something along those lines but i am just blabbering right nowfully customizable interface would be awesome i support this thread

i have to say as i have started many new characters that the learning skills do not set a character back 1 month if no cybernetics are plugged in the current time to get a learning skill to level 3 is maybe 5 hours and level 3 to level 4 takes 18 hours then advanced learning skills take less than a day to get to level 3 thats plenty enough for a new character this being said i do not support this thread as they are optional skills which has been mentioned and they do not set a character back more than a week to a week and a half to train to main4adv3 stats they still have 2 weeks remaining to train other skills to a good level and get organized i hope i do not come across this issue again ccp did a good thing by making it a 100 training time multiplier for new charactersjust a side note with cybernetics i and 3 implants in right off the bat a new character can have all of his starting skills to level 4 and be in a good position to get the advanced learning skills to level 4 keep the skills as they are no changes needed
dumbest idea i read today learning skills are fine as they are patience is a key skill in eve those learning skills dont alter that a bit
eve is a complicated enough game already explaining the learning skills to new people  when to train them ecetera its just entirely pointless is a skill to learn over skills quicker perhapes we should introduce another skill to make the learning skills train quicker then you have a skill for a skills group for the skill set good ehccp made a huge mistake adding learning skills and the sooner they get booted the betterjust change it to a system where your stats increase overtime quickly at first slowly laterim a old char and have maxed learning skills get rid of them please
edited after commanderdata211 rfchey alli had an idea reading the last csm minute about the crew issue particulary they dont want it to be too dependent on npc lets create a market then i usually have few thoughts generally confused but this one seem interesting and very low effort for ccp possibly creating unique players flying around new eve needless to say it should be released with incarnageneral purposes1 find a use for corpses2 give crew to the masses so they stfu3 create a new industrial process with already existing items4 further differenciate ship fittings and overall player performance without really tweaking ships much5 create a new contract market for original human truly named officer mods6 enhance solo capabilities making pirates happy while not releasing a single wtfpwnd ship7 generally enhance ship rolesmy idea requires 1 skill points data at death time used to calculate a corpse class 142 corpses to have 5 implantable slots3 4 bpos  4 bpcs  4 modules4 calculation done at industrial level5 calculation done at pvepvp level6 ships crew number tweakedgame integration 1 pvp players find a use for their beloved corpses and sell to the market 2 skill data at death time is used to calculate a new class attribute 14 set on corpse 3 corpses are implanted existing implants effects by scientists trained in cloning stuff in a biochemical reactor at pos an thus revived4 implanted corpses can board shipsbe sold contract or may be reversed engineered to obtain bpos which can be then copied into bpcs during this procedure bpos loose the original implant set bonuses and acquire a new fixed general name see below and a generic bonus module timer depending on skill level at death time  implants used as required materials automa  015m sp  2 implant  02  efficiency module timer enhanced automa 1530m sp  3 implant  03  efficiency module timer humanoid drone 3060m sp  4 implant  04  efficiency module timer human drone 60up sp  5 implant  05  efficiency module timer all percentages and stuff can be tweaked with  bonuses chosen but it is imperative to keep bonuses low in order to allow for large crews on bigger ships  more realistic 5 bonuses are stackable with a heavy malus if original corpses are used conflicting with yours or other corpsesbecause crew would fight over control of specific ship subsystems while normal malus for standard crewmodule stacking6 it would really make sense to have a staff bay you can load and interact with it could be divided into racks highmedlow slots in order get some balance crew could be fired away in some sort of pod jettison to emergency warp if not interdicted to be recovered later7 preventing people from suicide farming their own corpses by recycling them to the market is not needed because the cost of mc is generally higher than the price paid by random contracts since boosting effects come from skill class but most of it from implants used by scientists it wouldnt be economically convenient to suicide8crew is dropped as a module fighting to stay alive in the wreck till it pops depending on your luck you may find a new good mod or an original named the original name eheh human officer mod flame on or support
if we had ship crews id like your client audio notifications to change depending on what ship crew you haveexampleyou have a crew of exotic dancers thus your audio notications are uber sexy husky woman voicesnotification your hull has been breachedregarding ship crews sign me uptamber
hehe nice one
this idea seems very interesting and i like the idea of making them into items that you can place in some sort of hangar within the ship as opposed to new fitting slots or rigs to enable a crew however i am a bit unclear as to what direct function you propose to make the crew do it seemed to me that what you are proposing from the corpses is to reverse engineer implants out of them this does not seem to have anything to do with the corpse turning into a member of your crewgetting back to the crew idea specifically btw i love the idea of being able to either animate a corpse to become a crew member or melt them for implants what relation will they specifically have with the ship that you are piloting and have them in you also mentioned something about the crew fighting for a specific subsystem in a ship did you mean to say that if you have a human drone crew member in control of your offensive subsystems that you will get a 5 boost to offensive modulesid like to hear a little bit more about your idea so i am reserving my thumbs up but you have me on the hook i think that creating a valid market for corpses is an awesome ideayou mentioned also that the crews will fight one another for control over their specific

there is no contradiction in what i said you have to consider ewar in order to have a good fleet thats eve and i hope it stays that way you have to balance tank gank and ewar if your proposal went through you could certainly ignore ewar and just play a simpletons game of tank and gank but that is lamei certainly think its a good thing to have some ewar and ecm in any gang but you cant just fit all ewar ships you also need some dps and likely some tankyou can use ecm bursts in low sec few fit them becasue they suck
ok so if i bring tracking disruption that would be as powerful as ecm what about sensor damps or target painting no id say it wouldnt id say youre talking about ecm specifically there is a contradiction in your statement as it can be rephrased as you can put together your own gang as long as you have some dps tackle and one of these 45 ships specific ships that get a bonus to this specific ewar in my opinion it should be possible to make a good small gang without including any specific empires ships  be that caldari gallente minmatar or amarr there should be more options than that if ecm only breaks locks rather than preventing them for a set amount of time thats not something you can ignore your lock breaks web and scramble is disabled allowing whatever was subject to their effects to maneuver till you get it again thats important  could very well win a fight so if i have a small gang and i choose to fly without ecm i will be at a disadvantage in some situations but not all ecm as it stands is the nobrainer choice  it makes it possible to negate damage allows ships that are in trouble to leave the fight and denies your opponent information there is no situation where it does not apply in small scale low sec pvp you always need locks to keep people scrambled and use your highslots for anything at all now that you mention tankgank being a simpletons game lets look at what it takes for a pilot to manage ecm shall we heres how i believe it usually goes1 come into the fight at decent range ie outside of most damage that could possibly be applied to you2 activate your racial ecm on choice enemy ships this probably means everything that threatens you in any way oh but if theres only a few just jam em all yeah dont worry if you dont have enough racial jammers  if you use an offrace one itll likely be jammed through 23 of the fight anyway also within a minute the rest of your gang which is unopposed due to noone on the other side having locks should have at least fumbled their way to killing something or tackling the lot meaning you have nothing to worry about 3 be proud of yourself for not playing a simpletons game but rather this highly complex equation of activating 45 mods on 23 enemies while not managing anything else like drones capacitor tank range or tracking also i never argued 10 falcons would be a good gang  noone is saying they dont need other ships they just need any damagedealer and any tackler from any empires navy not one out of a specific 45 ships
currenty they are too powerfull its too easy with the use of other game mechanics to bomb and killing a whole fleet of battleships with 6 coordinated bombs bombing combined with a prober that probes out the location of the battleship fleet to get a warpin point within 10 secs is too powerfull its the new dd and it need to be looked atit gos as followed squad leader of a bomber gang is in a cov op and lay down probes around a gate on such a way that he covers the gate perfectly at 05au a med gang plays for bait at the gate no batteships allowd enymie battleship gang warps in prober runs scan and warp or squad warp bomb squad at 30km bombs are launched and battleships die is it intended that 6 bombers can take out an 12 batteships with bombs
if your bs cant stand 6 bombs then learn how to fit one so that it has at least 48k ehp im told its not hard
its called sniper bs and they are used alot in 00 fleet engangements u fit them differently than your carebear bs

yes you dont need a 70k ehp minimum on a carebear bs but you do on a fleet bs titans are wonderful like that because of the fact that multiple bombs blow each other up after a certain point a ddproof fleet battleship is proof against any number of bombs coming in a single wave in other words a proper fleetfit bs should not die to a bomber run itd take two separated by several seconds and if someone is willing to risk half a billion worth of bombers on a double wave to strike your fleet and pulls it off you should probably take a bit of a hit in the process bombs are finally usable after two years of waiting this is a good thing
they work as intended as glass cannon vs blobsand it takes much more than you are describing to get a proper hit on a fleet and then getting out without getting killed yourself you need to get a warpin with a good exit option for yourselfnot supported
its a good idea and will probably work beautifully on the large scale bcbs and large fleetshowever it does nothing for the small scale cruisers and below have so few lockable targets and sensor strengths that they will not benefit from a reduced lock count mechanicnor does it address the fact that ecm is gamebreaking read overpowered when gangs are max 56 people or that practically all frigates very few slots overall so no eccm possible can be permajammed with a single rigged jammer on a bonused shipi hate the cinematic mechanic behind ecm and would love to see it gone but it has to be in a way that allows for ecm to do its job without being overpowered on any scale

great idea
cannot agree those builders who vent the excess minerals and pass the profits along to entrepeneurs are removing the heat from the system much like a really big hurricanethey are moving the economy back to equalibrium if the excess ships are not removed they remain stockpiled to gamebreak alter or they reduce price of playerearned labour supply v demandit was forced out of equilibrium by macro accounts and then they unloaded cheap mins after unholy rage years of cheating hit the markets the natural order is that more cheating will redistribute the wealth to the clever and resourceful capitalism at work greed is goodthis insurance fraud can only be maintained if the macros were to return im sure ccp will not let them so enjoy it while it lastsedit cosmo says so on 2nd paget2 insurance needs reform after dominion supply changes
they could just remove the top level purchased insurance and see the resultand while they are at it remove all payed insuance payout on suicide kills only pay base fee
no insurance company in the present day world pays a dime when you are carelessreckless with the insured property duplicate that in eve and issue is resolvedno payout on pvp kills ie player on mail or selfdestructs if ship is insured and it is lost to another player you do however get a partial 5075 refund on the premiumthere is no reason to penalise new players who are more likely to lose boats starting out by making the initial grind all the more difficultcannot be supported in current iteration
removing insurance just on suicide kills would necessitate a concord nerf thats a whole different issue
um how is proposing a change to the way insurance works not supporting a proposal that insurance needs to be changeda straight reduction in insurance value would actually benefit new players
this is different than concord if concord kills a ship then there should be no payoutself destructing keep as it is let them do itmore ships blown up  more need for minerals  more demand  higher mineral prices  relief for starving minersmore ships blown up  more demand  higher pricesboth being about a market equalibrium
in other words insurance is effectively an npc buy order as i said in my post above hardly what we would normally think of as a market equilibrium the market has little to do with it ccp have  rightly  been progressively removing npc market buysell orders as they encroach on and distort the price levels the market sets its time for them to remove or amend this one toothis is not about suicide ganking this is about a player driven market
yes insurance is a floor you do understand if you remove payouts that the price of ships would plummet before actually begin rising again i dont need to explain why do iinsurance is not a commodity its an incentive to place a ship in harms waydont get me wrong mind you i rarely if ever fly a t1 ship these days nature of the business
i agree with malcanis the current insurance system is an artificial price floor which has no place in a playerrun economyfor the solution id like to see insurance payout based on actual market value the base prices made sense 6 years ago but they are out of date
who said anything about removing
root mean square price aggregated by volume of sum mineral requirement would seem to be the simplest method
be careful how this gets implemented from the way you described this i believe youre thinking about some sort of built in autocalculation of the insurance rates based on the market average people could take advantage of this by posting sell orders for t1 ships at ridiculous prices hundreds of billions of isk each in order to jack up the average market value and this way they could potentially get autocalculated insurance payouts worth far far more than they should bei support the idea of tweaking the insurance system but do not use an autocalculation method based on the average market price otherwise well have an even bigger insurance fraud mess than we already have
thats why i suggested a root mean square style calculation based on mineral prices that will even out the effect of outlying valuesalso motherofgodjpg at ankhthingy supporting one of my proposals

this would indeed fix alot of issuesno more carrier  so you can actually start a fight and have 1 side win instead if 1 side just docking up and laughing
wow terrible idea and im amazed to see so many people supporting it has the general consensus over eve changed that much since i played regularlythis would remove a massive tactical element from the gameplay the moment you agress anything youre 100 stuck in that systemsituation till the fight is over and either you or the guys agressing you are dead now either people are failing to understand that and how serious a change it would be or you seem to think its a good idea which it is notall it would mean is that people are even less likely to fight in small gangs due to being stuck and totally vulnerable to larger gangs the moment they enagage anything there would be no such thing as a retreat and fights would generally end in one side being 100 obliterated assuming people are competant with points as theres no other way for the fight to end this would especially be the case in situations where youre fighting people near their home they can keep trickling in greater numbers until you simply become overwhelmedsolo pvp is dead small gang pvp is on its way and now you want to make anyone who fights on a gate stuck there until hes killed the entire other gangjesusedit this is also especially insane as all you need to do is make stations spit outs by default
dont engage a gang unless youre sure you can kill the entire other gang before help arrives and you think this is a good change for pvp words cant describe the facepalm
this is a realy good idea 100 love it that is all
docking games are maddening i like how this proposal pushes commitment to the fight but doesnt seem to force it on those who dont aggress in the first place
i support this idea for stations but not for gates the simple reason is that you have the option to put tacklers on the other side of a gate should the target try to deagress and jump out but until there is a bribe scotty option there isnt anything to stop them docking repairing and undocking again in secondsi agree this is the outcome for gate fights should this station concept be applied to gates not only do you have the option to put tackle on the other side of the gate but there isnt any instant repping ability with gates to prolong the fightleave gates out of this changethat is an even worse idea as it promotes lazy bubblecamping of stations just have enough dps in stationoutside to pop a bs in under 1 minute yes you can argue they shouldnt undock without intel and that is a fair point but lets not give people more reason to play station games
oob
seems a pretty sound simple ideaanother idea could be for ccp to sort it so that you are out of docking range as soon as you undock read fix the silly docking ranges on some stations lets see them try docking games when they end up 5km from the happy spothal
problem is this would tilt the balance in favor of pirates camping a station so its a less elegant solution than the ops idea you pop out they scrambleweb and youve got a long crawl back to safety on the other hand the discussed solution nerfs docking games while still preserving the capacity to disengage if not aggressing in the first place overall supported for stations not for gates
simple effective im supporting this but only if it applies to stations rather than gates as the reasons for that have been said before
did you even read the thread or at least think through the op its been explained before so i wont bother but seriously read and understand then post
dock ging is not a tactical element besides there have been plenty of times i have engaged targets more warped in and we gtfo without using a gate you see i call it a system scanner i spam it and when suddenly a horde of intys hics and dictors shows up on it i usually call out gtfo and then we warp awaysometimes someone gets stuck cause he wasnt aligned like he should have been and then he dies and we make fun of him mercilessly for days sometimes that someone is me
i really like this option brings back the fight only if you think you can win stuffbarqs
excellent suggestion supported
having been living in npc 00 i cant but to support this proposalthis should have been implemented a long time ago even without the upcoming sov changes 1 to op
1 we are talking about tactics to increase damage  while flying is space   everybody can fit mods to there ships to increase damage2 people with skill3 yes mini has less base damage  because they can choose damage types  there ships hulls get rof and dpl bonuses not 5 per level to exp damagedrones  drones with less raw damage get better tracking and range as gallente train ship hulls up they get 10 more dps whatever flavour they choose4  5 yes i know this is why they have the highest base damages in game6 start a thread7 yes we knowthe concept your having trouble grasping is that especially solo its not very wise to only fire kineticcaldari missile boat tactics and bonuses clash with each other  they are not compatiblethis is not the case for other races ships or caldari rails boats i might add
supported selectable damage on missiles is one of the inherent bonuses of the weapon youre supposed to be free to choose whichever damage type you like you shouldnt be expected to forfeit this advantage just to take advantage of your ships inbuilt bonuses or vice versa caldari are supposed to be missile specialists yes kinetic damage is basically their hat but this seems like an arbitrary and silly limitation why are caldari ships only bonussed to kinetic missiles
until all other weapon systems can freely choose different damage types with no penalties that are not based on skill this would be a little bit overpoweredgallente get bonused to kinetic and thermal amarr get bonused to em and themalminmatar get bonued to all but ammos have dps issues and optimal range issuescaldari get bonused to kinetic but have option of using any ammoif caldari got bonused to all types of ammo it would be a little unfair to everybody else
number 3 needs more work but support for all elsesolo pvp caldari is what i want to seemore nublets to teach that you should use drones morenow if only ecm drones worked tooalso add caliber size flexibility for launchers and you have some interesting engagements with shieldtanking shipsas passive tankrun awaybring 2 falcons will not be their only option for pvpeditmissiles sacrifice range for dps or dps for rangespeeding up the missiles ruins countermissileboat abilitysaw a hmldrake at 15km vs your vexor if hes using fofs and you are not tanking well you would leave but with the faster speednever mind that helps missile sniping more than affecting skirmish pvpyou guys need that badlygood luck man
so in other words homogenize missiles to be turrets no support isaac
missiles should constantly accelerate as they race towards their targets that way you could engage even targets far away without having to wait half a minute
controlled burst 5 per level reduced capacitor use for gun turretuse for projectile guns none 5 homogenize t2 skill training of missiles to those of guns no more specialization in torps without specialization in rockets and hams and you get both short and long range t1 missile of each class with one skill6 no assault missile launchers make it use medium sized missiles with the target size drawbacks like the undersized guns 7 instant acceleration and miss chance when your missile reach max speed it is hard to turn to follow a target if you want to homogenize guns and missiles you get the whole package not half of it not supportededitforgot8 no fofb guns dont have the option to fire when blinded
actually  i t seems to make sence to me 1 yes2 add a mod that has effect equivalent to that of a tracking enchaser for missiles3 alright although maybe making defer missiles usefull would be more sensible but whatever4 actually i licke the idea of them constantly accelerating but yeah missile sniping sucks
missiles need a serious revamp not sure those are the best changes but heck its about time someone addressed them

ok i thought the first part of this post was a little overly harsh but i absolutely agree that training the learning skills does teach people about the role of patience in eve and for the exact reason i think the learning skills are a good ideadavid
yes they are dumb get rid of themthere only worth training if your going to stick with the gameand when your new to the game you have no way of knowing that yetend result is those that do train them are more likelly to quit as there slower getting there ship skills etc up and start doing more interesting stuffor they dont train do interesting stuff quicker and then get ed off because everything starts to take ages to trainof course you wont get much support in these forumsmost people are of the opinion if they suffered with them so should everybody else who ever joins the gamelets not bother trying to make the game betterqftso eve would be better of not having to rely on players being lucky enough to get good advice when they join would it not 
nuff said
well heres my opinion as a new player to eve 25 wks or from the mouth of a babe if you willlearning has beenis still a pretty big buffer between my entrance into the game and getting to what i want to be doing no i am not stupid training to the exclusion of all the things i find fun but its still been a bit of a monkey wrench thrown into my plans of enjoying this game especially since i love pretty much everything about it obviously if everybody new or old just instantly got a 111010 point boost to all of their stats as op suggests all of the agony endured by the older players would be rendered pointless srsly no pun intendedinstead i was thinking that every million skill points until 5m spbase stats could get a 1p static boost and 2 more points would be available for the dynamic remapping adjustments to point distribution cap would be unnecessary the lower value of the primary would be offset by the fact that you can boost the secondary higher 5m sp works out to about two months of play of course the frequency of these upgrades could be tweaked but the magnitude of improvement once maxed is roughly in line with the strength of the current learning skills oh just occurred to me would be nice when you got the new points if you could do a full remap and would simplify code implementation i butchered one character when i was starting out because i was out of remaps with a horrible distribution what do you guys think
starting againguess i haveto explain this in more detail and slowly for the thickos

new type of refining array only for wh systems 100 yield depending on skillsand much more holding space hauling all the ore from wh space to a station is much faster then refining inside not considering the loss of 25 for the advanced refining array so i think its time to overhaul the refining arrays all togetherat the moment and especial when dominion gets here refining arrays are obsolete and totaly uselessjust my two cents
as per the titlewhy is it needed
if you want the intel from look at get closer
during my term in the csm we suggested this very thing ccp said its logical and theyll make it happen when they have the manpower to devote to the coding change in other words soon sometime or often never

because being 43 aus away from a gate and pressing the look function to see which ships are around the gate is a good ideaif not 100km range then what maximum range otherwise youll just have a new and improved scouting tool basically anyone hanging around an object that shows up in an overview would be able to be spotted from anywhere in the systemlowsec pirating warp to a safe and click look at on all the planets and asteroid belts in the systems congrats you just scouted the system inas little as 110th the time it would have taken you with the dscannernot supported
your quite rightmost people assume that were only talking about stuff on gridis look at an option from the scanner never mind i have fixed it anywaysfunction canlookatif targetdistance  1000 then return falseelse return trueend function
supported the number 100 is probably in ccps infinite wisdom hardcoded but to give the hard working developers some leeway it might also have something to do with the original rendering engines zoom function being coded to not load textures on models over a certain distance or something to that effect i know that this was the case in some other games such as the homeworld series that said if you want to look further than 100kms its fairly easy to zoom out further than 100kms and swing the camera around 180 degrees and the textures and models are certainly fully loaded there these dayssometimes i get the feeling that the eve code is a royal mess

sorry i think ive been unclear about it my post was written quickly and english is not my mother language the idea is you get bonuses from the implanted corpses aboard each one giving out the bonus of the implants it was revived with as if they were on you full effect or good percentage reverse engineering gives you either nothing failed job or a bpo successful which can be then copied into a bpc so if instead hes a copy made from bpobpc that effect should be generic and lower see belowthis distinction originalcopy allows for the creation of a double market  precious unique personalized exhuman very officer crew member or standard market module to give out fixed but generic bonuses 5 reduced module timer or similar the relation with you and the ship is basically additioned implant sets giving out unique expensive bonuses or general cheaper efficiency ones your crew helps you take care of subsystems allowing you some more power balance is to be thinked about carefully ofcyou would have two choices for your ship if its uber  you put unique bonuses given by dedicated implant sets used to revive subjects  lets say hg crystal set used to revive nathan revs corpse you would put my corpse in a shield boosting ship not on a armor buffered one your player has his own implant bonuses  would acquire full or good percentage corpse implant set remember stacking penalized on a specific subsystemif its not intended as a uber ship you would most likely buy standard crew my corpse made by bps loosing its name and unique bonuses but aquiring new general ones 25 subsystemmodule effectiveness timer for example depending on skillpoint class of the corpse and implants used 2345 attributes they are generic they can be used for any subsystem while the unique ones are likely to be very subsystem focused crystal slave and suchstacking 1 if you stack bonuses by either using yourself the same implant set one of your unique corpses has or you put 2 same implanted unique corpses on the same ship you would get very low bonuses because they would ideally fight over control of the same subsystem ie shields thus being highly inefficient2 if you instead use the standard moduled corpses you could have some stacking on the same subsystem example normal penalty for gyrostabbcu but you could also assign 4 to 4 different subsystemsbalancing is all related to the staff bay slots bay could be divided for 123 rack where you put your max number of unique obviously you would assign them to the relevant rack because of their specific bonuses or moduled corpses in this case you stack em or distribute em where you like in order to get a generic bonus on 1 or more specific subsystemi hope i made myself somehow clearer and pls anyone feel free to contribute as well more brains more logic the idea it to keep it simple as simple as possible to have ccp look into it pls look 1st post changed some
yeah the word i had in mind was zombies how cool would it be having to recover your zombie from your worst enemy or having your worst enemy fighting for you together with other mixed crew i think id put my worst enemies on mining bargez ehehhe
still not quite clear on what you mean by the reverse engineering to get bpos out of the corpse to then produce copies from that bpo what will these blueprints be for if you are talking about seeding implant bpos through the reprocessing of corpses then there are a few things to consider first of all i dont think it smart to seed bpos of implants like that specifically if instead they dropped bpcs and created a type of alchemy system to facilitate the production i think that would work a lot betterthe idea of the class system for the corpses intrigues me but i had an addition for them in mind in terms of getting materials for building the implants how about class 34 corpses have a percentage chance to produce a bpc and the class 12 produce a new raw material with which to build the implant from these numbers would have to be looked at to balance bpcmaterial ratio but the gist is therethe thing that i notice is that in the explanation you dont describe what exactly these bpos will be for exactly and if they are for building implants you havent outlined a means to get the materialsalso i am not too sure i like the idea you have laid out for the corpses to become crews that affect you in a way that implants do if you resurrect a corpse that had learning implants what will happen to those implants and what kind of affect will those have on you as a whole or the ship you are flyingneed some answers to those questions but again i like the idea of adding corpses as a viable market i think this would add something specifically to pvping that it desperately needs there are not many markets that can be groomed solely with pvp i think also a good addition to the idea would be to make the process of getting bpcs out of corpses and the manufacturing of implants take place only at poss in either low sec or null sec this would give another incentive to explore 00 and elsewhere which is something that those places severely need
the idea of bpos is to give those willing to take chances with reverse engineering on a billion isk worth revived body by pirate implants set for example a safe way to then make some serious money either by selling copies bpcs or directly producing copy cat individuals for the large market the idea of bpos is because you risk a lot during reverse engineering a it could fail and you loose your unique revived bodyb even if it succeeds original bonuses are gonereplaced by standard onesits a good idea a corpse could have a double use  a being reprocessed to get material to be then able to implant other bodiesb being implanted and then sold unique or reversed engineered to get a bp bpo or bpc to be balancedanalyzed depending on this the whole concept may change the best balanced solution should be chosen but remember that the more you ask to implement the less you may get from ccp my idea was originally point b while your brainstorming could lead to solution a a corpses are both source and final destination of specifically created implants  you use the good corpse to implant and the bad ones to melt for raw materialsb corpses are just receivers of already existing implants pirate sets when unique but once reversed engineered raw materials to be used are bodies and normal learning implants which would not give out learning bonuses but generic module timer reduction as per schema 1st post
they are not for building implants they are meant for crew replication at a standard level lets say you have my corpse revived by implants bought off the market crystal setunique bonuses you could put it in your ship and get the unique bonus or you could sacrifice it in an industrial reverse engineering process by which if successfull you get a bp which you will then use to mass produce a standarded bonus crew member that was the original idea to allow a double market uniquecontracthighpriced and a parallel standardmarketlowpriced crew memberas for unique bodies they can revived with a some grade pirate set giving out full or good percentage of bonuses if instead you build standard crew members you would use the learning sets 25  1st post schema not to get those original bonuses but a generic module stackable bonus ie harvesting timer or missileturret timer or again shield boosting armor rep timersi agree pvp needs some reform without unbalancing the game by working on single ships and pvp needs to be community supported professions as scientist and industrialist in a wordintegrated with the gameabsolutely the industrialscientific process should take place in low sec and now im guessing original unique crews could even be illegal in hisec because you revived a real player body ethically wrong concordesome may say instead of using scientific researched products copy catssorry for the long post i had to split ill try reorganize the first post

this would make ecm as impotent as dampsif anything the cycle time needs to be 10 and the victim needs to go blind to all targets for 15 secsthis would encourage 1 cycle bursts of regular mods on more targets that actually disrupt fastlocking enemies in rr gangsa nub ecm specialist would be annoying and a micromanaging starcraft player would be a god among menthis would also finally counter rr blobsthe 20 sec cycle is still too long when an unarmed ecm ship gets ambushed should be shorter than that to give them selfdefence ability since range is shorter for the best shipif damps kept targets blind for 5 secs after they stopped we arazu pilots might even get to use that 2nd script that sorta goes in that timeframe the one for when the inty tries to relock and stop you from cloakingwhat is that called damn if only i didnt need to use 34 damps on one targetonly way to op that would be if multiple ship blinding you for the extra time were to stack additionally on each target leading to real unbalance ecm is nowhere near thathell being outnumbered means you are doomed as you have to hold down 34 guys all the time while 20 players primary youdo not cripple what remains of ecmdrones  ecm btwintiescruisersfrigs  ecm boatsecm  ecm boatsreinforcementssniper shipbombercovops decloak  ecm boatseccm might be broken but i would not know ecm has never been efficient enough for me to fit it
why were sensor damps nerfedits strange that gallente get to use 34 midslots on one target without getting much result while caldari can jam multiple targets with a t1 cruiser for 20sec at a timeanswer is to buff sensor damps again insteadreduce the cycle time on ecmcurrently i have skills for several gallente ships that i refuse to fly until buffed
ok so your cunning argument would be to boost ecm instead you do realize all ecm ships are capable of abominable shield tanks which supported by logistics is quite hard to break only traditional ecm ship fits are all ecm no tank while your proposed buff does incite the behavior you say it does it also makes permajamming way easier lets keep damps out of this for the most part shall we this is a thread about ecm and all of my arguments are based around ecm being overpowered even without comparison to the other ewar drones having more people having your own ecm and having more people arriving later is something people bring up a lot here i have already stated i am arguing ecm is overpowered in relation to small gang pvp which is to say mostly something like 5 people versus 5 people or less drones work unreliably due to the range ecm can operate at and only serves to force the ecm boat off grid  it can enter the fight again relatively fast and regardless 1 minute without a hostile lock is a completely insane advantage in terms of controlling the situation ecm being one of the only good counters people can cite for ecm is not an argument against nerfing it  its an argument for nerfing it having more people in a counter for everything much like ecm solo gank arazu  double damp put it outside the targets lock range then it just stayed there basically it could lock out a solo belt ratter permanently due to 40something km point and 2x 60 lock range and 60 lock time damp combo the nerf was well reasoned but sensor damps are pityful now
damps were nerfed because just one was overpowered they were eventually thrown on everything noncaldari and no ship could get any lock also i believe there was no chance to it working you damp someone they lose lock rangeresas to the second part of your comment lets look at a good falcon fithighs 2 200mm rail ii or amls covops cloakmids 12 of each racial jammer sensor booster iilows disruption mods maybe a dc or even a platesorry im at work no eftwhat you need to realize is that a falcons ecm is its tank if the jam fails the ship will fall to anything larger than a bantam also each ecm is for only one target maybe 2 would be needed and if someone gets a lock on an ecm boat its all overnot supported
now please tell me why does half of pvpers have to fir eccm because ecm is overpowered we have counters to many other forms of ewar but yet people are forced to fit eccm because currently jamming is the largets threat all ships below cruiser size are unable to counter ecm because there base sensor strength is so low adn they do not have many slots any way it is not even feasable on cruiserit is also the only type of ewar that does not receive stacking penalty solution introduce ecm tracking that way you cannot permajamm 6 septors with 6 jammersthat way if someone get up close and personal to you you are in trouble2nd give ecm stacking penalty like on sensor dampeners that way you cannot place 50 jammers on eccm fitted carrier to permajamm it therefore large ships can fit eccm and they can effectively counter eccm with high sensor strengthsmall ships can get there transversal up and be out of ecm tracking and free of the jam that way ecm stops being soloupmobile
why should people fit resists oh because weapons are overpowered maybe some eccm needs a boost maybe instead of stacking 3x gyros tcs or mags you may want to toss on something else
weapons constitute a much larger role in pvp than all ewar combined  if you die you will have been subject to damage there are far more ships capable of dealing damage than will realistically field ecm and be effective should half a dusin ships dictate all low sec pvp fitsthe problem with balancing ecm with eccm is that it becomes a rockpaperscissors scenario1 the side fighting the ecm has no eccm gets jammed and gets dead 2 the side fighting the ecm has tonnes of eccm and thus does not get jammed and win theres no interesting mechanic at play its all just fitting i would think a solution based on how you fly would be better take the mechanic of tracking disruptors for instance if you use it to kill a gunnery ships range it can try to close that range and it wont matter if you try to kill its tracking it can try to webscramble its target and attempt to maneuver in a way that minimizes its targets transversal velocity at current if you get jammed literally the only counter there is like that is to try to get out of range of the ecm boat a counter like that  a counter that is enabled via good flying rather than relying on having enough people or having to fit a certain module to every ship  is what i was hoping to accomplish with this proposal
its not purely chance based though its also based upon skills what youre flying what your opponent is flying and their skillsin beginner small gang pvp you can get by with just targetting and slapping a multispec on someone when you start getting to roaming gangs in 00 its nowhere near that easyif you want to introduce tracking to ecm you must be prepared to do the same for nos scramswebs drone control rrs and even eccm then is it fair to an inty pilot orbiting a tackled bs that the bss web and neut can track him with ease and how would you skill the tracking along with gunnery how would you handle the current bonuses to ships like the kitsune falcon widow and scorpionthen you realize that if you do it to all nonturret weaponry as i listed above exactly to the scope in which you need to modify the gamesee making one little change affects many other things
i honestly see no point of introducing tracking to points rr or nos nos drains certain amount of cap it is nowhere near being overpowered in its current state ecm is ecm currently has no viable counter i suggest tracking as 1 way of doing it against nosneut you have boosters you simply would not skill tracking you cannot skill disruptors range you cannot skill painter range yet you can skill ecm range why should you be able to skill its tracking it is chanse based and skill dictates that chanse as i had a bs permajammed by a set of light cm drones
first not all ewar has to be equal  nor should it but if that is a problem for some i would much rather see the other ewar get a boost than nerfing ewar into some sort of novelty item in eve your proposal would definitely make ewar an after thought and turn the game into gank and tank monotony i would say that the other ewar is more or less a novelty item now and thats not good you want to bring a gang that has none of the 5 or 6 best ships from the largest of the 4 factions you dont feel you can do this and this is the problem we just disagree on there being a problem here yes they are powerful but they are always support roles you need other ships and likely ships from other factions its not like you can just fill your gang with 10 ecm dedicated ships consider logistics ships the alliance tournament had to actually make a rule limiting them because too many could make you darn close to unbeatable they didnt need to do that with ecm why because although its a good idea to have some you can overdue it and lose there is already a natural balance in the game that you have to strike with how much ecm is in your gang if you want to train caldari thats fine but you wont have much in the way of decent dps and tank ships the drake is the only real exception to this rule so if you want to train caldari for pvp its generally going to be for the ecm ewar if you give ewar this massive nerf your proposing there will be no point in training caldari for pvp yeah ok your response might be well then lets start completely reworking all of the caldari shield and gank ships so they dont suck well again if eve is just gank and tank it loses allot but also that is a big undertaking and i would rather ccp do other things like make it when i hit the dock button i actually dock and dont have to spam it or get sov figured out after the dominion patch nerfing ecm because some people dont want to use it and would like to pretend its not there is not something i support
this is not true ecm recieves the same stacking penalties that shieldarmor resists getan ecm strength of 5 vs a sensor strength of 10 gives a 50 chance to jam2 ecms strength of 5 vs a sensor strength of 10 gives you a 75 that the target will be jammed each cycle just like stacking resistance mods
not true they do not get penalised the 75 chanse works out because that is the way theory of probability works the same way 2 50 webbers do not make your speed 0 and two t2 webbers do not make your speed 20 of what you have they are independant modules and tehrefore have two times independant 50 chanse to jam which coupled together according to theory of probability results in 75 chanse to jam the given target same way 3 sensor dampeners with just an example 25 targeting range reduction do not result in target getting 25km targeting range out of original 100km instead each sensor dampener works with whats left after the previous one first dampener cuts it to 75km second cuts it by 25 from the 75km resulting in 5625km targeting range and after third one you get 42 targeting range however that isnt the case in game atm as they are subject to stacking penalty meaning that they work same way as your armor hardeners 1rst sensor dampener gets 100 effect second gets 835 i do not remember exact value third gets 50 and forth gets only 25 making putting more then 45 of them on the target impracticalcearain has a point that maybe stacking penalties should be removed from all other types of ewar i see no reason why you should not be able to get a target to 4km targeting range if you have 8 dumpeners on it that has effect somilar to permajamming but you still do not have arazu as usefull as falcon you stil cannot prevent 4 people from doing damage and if they get up close and personal you are in trouble maybe introducing distance where if target is closer the 20km to the ecm ship the jammers strength starts falling and at distance 0 from the ecm boat jammers effect drops to 0
lol you have never fought against a curse have you yes new neuts only drain the equiv of the ship but its per neutcurse vs falcon  dead falconoh so tracking would only apply to ecm nothing that you would ever use so webbing has no counter and makes intys sitting ducks no counter to it but trying to fly out of range neuts can destroy cap in secondsbut no only ecm is the bad bad boyecm is caldaris pvp tank its viable on 3 ships those three ships are known as one thing primaryits not overpowered
yes i have cannot see curce being overpowered still curce is only usefull at relatively close range against capdependant ships falcon is usefull against everything except maybe supercaps because they are immune to ewar webbing has very short range a smart intie will not enter webbing range unless absolutely necessary
ecm already has a falloff long range ecm was already nerfed now you want to nerf 20km thats essentially removing ecm out of the equationsimple solution boost your own strength instead of looking to gimp a shipfor example lets look at a sample cane fit off of shcthere is a simple way you can swap the damage control with a ladar backup array it boosts your strength 48 from 16 base to 2122 base or solets say i have a typical named ecm at my current skills my str is 9916100  56with the backup array we have 922100 thats a 40 chance that ill jam you each time if i have 2 ladars i can roll the dice twicenow this doesnt include falloff my question to you is does your canes armor tank only work half the time because my falcons wouldbut let me guess you shouldnt have to put a module in against ewar right i mean its not far that you might need to put a defense up guess what my tank against you still only works half the timethe only time it becomes that much talked about 8090 is when you go against a max skilled falcon specialist running rigs and with recon v and dispersion v approx 2 months of dedicated training if you go against me like that then yes you might actually lost your t1 bc sorry eve happens throw in the smartbomb and im still dead jam on you or notedit to avoid 5min timer no cap means no jam no cap means no tank for any ship i guess my light missiles on a falcon will do much against a curse when i have no cap nowebbing is short range throw in a loki with bonuses in the gang or faction webs and youre webbing at insane ranges 3040 km
can we just make a ship that has an antifalcon dd give it the exact same stats as the falcon otherwise we should also invent some sort of antifalcon dd eccm module using this module would reduce the chance of you get instadthat way we can just spew back out all the tripe that the ecm protectors throw from their assa falcon dder virtually no damage output has no tank drones on it  dead sniper on it  dead keep some ships in reserve  dead it has no role outside of killing falcons
well other than the last one this would fit that list completely
ok ill post a nontroll response truth be told ecm is a very bad mechanic for eve its unfun for both parties and i think the chance based element is stupid in a game like eve where pvp is often based on fitting strategy etcpersonally id like to see racial ecm always work and reduce the targets max locked targets to 2 1 on bonused ships make multispecs reduce to 3 max locked targets 2 on bonused possibly 1 on tech ii ships like falcon etc this improves alot of things i personally despise about ecm in its current incarnation it makes fighting against ecm bareable espically for the solo pvper it reduces ecms effectiveness in blobs ecm is no longer a get out of jail free card its frustrating when you are solo pvping having a 1vs1 or have a high value target tackled with a small gang only to have it saved by a falcon coming in at 100km its also annoying when pirates uncloak their falcon the second they start losing their camping ships to a solo playersmall gang they underestimated ecm remains effective against rrlogistic altsrr bss with 1 max locked target they have to choose either to rep or shoot this also makes such gangs way more vulnerable to target switching as they need to unlocklock new target to get reps on sensor dampeners now have increased synergy with ecm and scan resolution scripts are way more valuable to ecmd targets currently its better to just bring another falcon than a dedicated ecm ship
while i understand your frustration this solution does nothing but make any ecm ship uselessremember an ecms tank is its jammers its offensive capabilities are limited with the exception of rook and scorp but the ecm is much less of an issue with them as they use mids to shield tankyour idea would make falcons completely worthless because theyd be primary and unable to do anything to withstand any fire instead boost signal boosters to encourage their use give a secondary bonus to scan resolution or somethingpeople stacking 3x magstcsgyros is overkill anyway
id be all for buffing the ecm ships defensive capabilities if ecm changed from the current mechanic 250km range 25 shield resist bonus an 8th mid you name it youve got it its not like the arazurapier have great tanks either which is usually just dual lse  damage control
a well buffered bsbchac with a cap booster can vaporise curce end of story obviously curce will be a nuisance to a cap dependant ship that makes ecm useless against the majority of combat ships its a bad idea there is the problem if you are sensor dampened adn you have no sensor booster it does not make you useless on the field ecm does half the pvpers fit eccm but barely anyone fits sensosr boosters and if they do not because they are scared of dampeners but because they need faster lock time
i think it should be 1010 or even 55 it will be more random that way 20 seconds is a long time in pvpit also means a failed jam is not as bad the target unjammed has less time to do something if a jam fails before the dice is rolled again it also makes sensor dampeners more viableheck even a 9 second jam time and 10 second cycle time would be nice to try out
a falcon isnt a well buffered bsbchac and other recons or t2 ships are hard to jam study your ships and look for highgrav str ships create a falcon killer falcons die every day on tq if youre set up with long range and you get damped by a beagle you will become useless on the field if arrays are boosted even just slightly to say 60 for t2 and best named 40 base give a 5 bonus to scan res for that tradeoff you remove a dcii or bcutcmaggyroplatecpr thise are lows right crap i forgot loleither that or set your drones to protect use rr you are looking for a 100 defense that is not game balancing the role of the kitsune falcon and blackbird are ecm they are not solo ships they put out crap dps and they are almost always primary ok not the lolkitsune but i digressyou are talking about the falcon as if its an instantpwnmobile or that it will always jam you it doesnt it removes your offensive capabilities just as the curse does just as a rapier does to a vaga inty or other fast ship just like the arazu damps the removal of targetting is much more random than the other ships if you neut a falcon they are dead simple20 seconds on a failed jam is a long time to sic drones on a falcon 
no
bombs are finally usable after two years of waiting this is a good thingbombs were improved in dominion
there is a serious lack of skill implied herebe happy your not subject to space bombs in low sec or high seclearn to fit properly and you might just be able to deal with itas a stealth bomber pilot i have to deal with the fact im flying a stick with a nuke strapped to it sticks burn easilysniper bss is a poor excuse they are in themsleves glass cannonsif you cant survive a bomb impact maybe more depending on damage typesto get hit with 6 of them at once hell you should be honored its rare enough to find a coordinate strike with such skill
actualy its not i have seen them being used effectivly alot in 1 single afternoon disrupting any sort of fleet engagements and killing dozens with ease
have you seen anyone using damps tracking disruption tptrs ewar drones en masse in organized squads know whyecm is the only ewar besides neuts that actually does its jobbringing it closer to the others is not an option for gameplaywith nerfed ewar we will simply fit bigass guns and tank and be back to attrition which gets boring superfast
ecm may not be fun but it is in no way overpowered you need a bonused ship to be able to use it effectively and those bonused ships die whenever something looks at them funnythe only times i have been in a fight where ecm has been a real problem granted there are many of those are instances where the fc for some unknown reason has figured that a bs or hac or t3 was a better target than the ecm shipslusulphur is right its not ecm that is unbalanced if anything its the other ewar that needs to be boosted although i am not entirely sure of this maybe better optimals or falloffs but thatd be itanyway as being able to target one or two ships at a time is more of an inconvenience than anything else unless youre a logistics ship what you are essentially arguing for is to make ecm worthless plus if it was valuable it would be damn sure that the one target they choose to shoot would be the untanked ecm ship brilliant
small gang warfare issues yes ecm can be a problem if you have fewer ships in your gang but again the problem can be solved with a good mix of ships yeah a tec 1 sub bs roam is gonna have a bad time of things if a falcon showsup but then again if you use tec 2 you have some choices a combat reco ship with 1 slot in eccm will fill the role of ewar killer very well alternativly use stealth bombers a purifyer can inflict alot of pain on any ewar boat just time your uncloak
ok now lets take an example and have a t2 faction ammo topskilled geddon vs a caracal that has no tank at all and no resistswhat happens oh crap nerf the geddon if youre going to make common middle of the road pvp boat falcons consider only 1 racial maybe 2also your 14 str jam is based on recons v two sdas and rigged and you also would likely need weapon disruption to v that gives you 146 maxoh and that falcon will cost what 120m compared to the 90mil insureable domiwith recons iv and no rigs your str is roughly 9so heres the point  if youre going up against a maxed out ewfreak yes you will get jammed damn that sucks however how many of us are out there im not even maxed out oh and if by that chance i miss a jam your neuts will drain my cap in seconds and your drones will eat me alive i will die
which due to the introduction of medium rigs and the fact that recon v is one of those things that is just so damn useful that every recon pilot should have it are not unreasonable assumptionsand i believe its signal disruption you want weapon disruption is for tracking disruptorsanyway it doesnt matter as before the falcon locks him the domi will have deployed sentry drones set to aggressive the falcon will die very quickly jam or no jam
good catch
i agree with the idea of increasing low sec mission rewardsive read the forums which basically break down into two groups mission runners who got ganked in low sec and think it sucks and wannabe pirates who cant pvp anything except a pve fitted noob mission runner saying hey this is great ccp shouldnt change a thingi think the wannabes are hoping to one day get a destroyer on their killboardscould happenbut seriously level 1 and 2 missions in low sec i think ganking noobs is a great way to make sure new players who arent invested in the game leave and decided to find a new game and i think it hurts the entire communitythere is no way the reward for a level 1 or 2 mission balances the chance of loosing a ship and fittings or getting pod killed even after insurance payouts what do level 1 missions pay 100000 plus the new player than needs to run around finding the gear for their new ship put yourself in the position of a new player they probably just got killed for the first time by another player they are shocked and ed now to add insult to injury they need to run back and forth buying new gearlevel 3 missions or even high quality level 2 mission i have no problem with them in low sec but level 1 and 2 there is a chance a noob who just got ganked will just say eh whatever i learned something but i think there is an equally good chance they are going to say thats how this game works eff this im going to play planet of hordecraftmy 2 centsdavid
i think corp taxes should be a percentage of all transactions from every player in the corpim not that experianced in the game playd about 5 months so maybe im not thinking of somethingeither way i think this is something that should be discussed
would kill trader cause they buy and sell much stuff you would tax their sell prize and not their profit
you cant tax all transactions players would be locked out of many professionsthe tax would eat into any profession that is margin based making it impossible to profittax is currently only applied to rat bounties and mission rewards not bonusesif a corp wants to make its isk from the trades made by their members then the method is to bring that activity into the corp hangerswallets and have them work from there

thats what i do
you have my vote 
z0d for chairman
ank i like you as a person but youre being awfully weird itt
its academic by now that i am weird right i am merely expressing my confidence in z0ds chances of becoming elected i definitely expect him to end in the top 3 based on the overwhelming amount of support take care has mustered for its representative in game and the success z0d has had rallying his vast personal networks him becoming chairman is not that unlikely at this point and i think he has a decent diplomatic personality for it and thus it would be a good thing for the csm as a wholeyeah it may be a bit american to talk about victory before the election is even over and it is premature but i just have a very good feeling herehow do you estimate your odds i personally think you are one of the better 00 choices as you try keep the big picture in mind and your pdf is concise and to the point yes i read most candidates stuff and like us you appear to share your influence with other players unlike some other csm weve had which are unfortunately much more dictatorialwill you be in the utrecht meetup 12 dec
we spoke briefly at fanfest 08 which is why i can say i like you as a person i have not followed the entire drama nor the reasons why some people have a strong dislike of you but simply from what ive read here it appears as if you favour z0d more than he does himself and occasionally you even sound protective which isjustweirdthen again you are a girli have no idea about my own chances and yes i will be in utrecht 1212 
as a market trader myself i like your ideasyou have my votesjigga
signedyou all need to check out this guys music too its amazing
this is also fairly common even for those of us living in non sov 00 level 4s are so easy to earn isk with that a couple of days keeps you in ships for a month if you fly fairly cheap anywaymore exploration content that can be cleared with pvp fit ships would be great in both lowsec and 00
just used this system worked very good
supportcool to have the french version btw
its always been my biggest beef with eve so youll get my two votesif youre that person please speak now and provide some links to you contributions toward ui improvements or posts or whatever about them as evidencehere is my ancient thread with some improvements in case youre unfamiliar with any of the problems scant few of which have made it into the game despite there being no downsides to ui improvements and all of those improvements were as a result of the devs directly polling players not my machinationsif youre in favor of improvements its a quick couple of votes and a chance to advocate something that helps every single player and nerfs no one and nothing
inanna zuni runs to be honest the csm raised many ui issues but usually got this as answer from ccp yeah we want to redo the whole ui some time
why are you pimping another candidate
the ui issues have been raised time and time first on the forums and then by the csm when it was introduced im fairly sure ccp are aware of it and we will see improvements soontm
well keep it up if they eventually fix things just so youll stop bringing it up then all the betteri love how they extol the virtues of the sandbox nature of the game yet via the ui they only allow you a solitary immutable tool with which to interact with the sand
theyve been saying that for almost three years
just like they said alliances will be allowed to join factional warfare in empyrean age 12 err november 2008 err q1 2009 err first thing after apocrypha and we will have an interbus station and storyline agent soon and 90 of the other things they promised to the csm were added to the backlog and be dealt with soontmthe reality is that ccp is rushing one expansion out after the other and before they even patched out all the bugs and missing features with the last one theyre already on the hypemobile for the next expansion there is no time to fix much of the existing content because the moment one expansion is out the deadlines for the next expansion are already rapidly approachingi told them this in rather strong and uncensored words half a year ago but there isnt much the csm can do about their business decisions until the players realize what is wrong and demand of ccp to change their strategy
this is one of those topics where nobody will disagree thus as a differentiator between candidates it isnt that usefuli was at a roundtable during fanfest where ccp hammer stated his wish to throw the ui away and build it again from scratch thus it is on the radar and apparently has been for agesthe csm can bring it up again and maybe ccp will finally put some time into the development we can only hope
hey get back to your own campaign threads but in all seriously please do listen to all the candidates that put in the effort to participate in these debates it shows dedication to take the time to do them especially for those in timezones where the debates didnt happen after work hours these are your serious candidatesvoting for the council of stellar management is now onlinemake your voice heard
but being able to pull malicious crap is what makes eve enjoyable goon antics are good sport

my wish list for black ops given they truely suck as isincrease fuel bay to 4km3  what is the point of being able to fit a jump portal mod if your gang exhausts the fuel the first time you jump these ships should be able to work in 00 without having to be refueled every time the gang needs to move somewhere asis you either need a gang member to bring along a transport ship or you fit cargo expanders either is a poor choicetanking  none of them can do this effectively unless it is all they do and even then it is subpar compared to their t1 or even faction equivalents tanking a redeemer is an effort in futility tanking sin  panther require the use of crystal implants and deadspace modules to get anywhere near being effective the widow while able to tank sacrifices all of its ew role in doing sofitting  this is another barrier to those who might have been wanting to fly a black ops using the redeemer as an example you need to waste your rig slots on reducing the cpu usage of your guns if you wish to fit t2 weapons and anything resembling a tank at the same time even then you must use faction mods if you want to have any form of tacklecovert cynosural field generation  do not reduce the skill requirements for using these mods not everything in this game should be available to the random pubbie at a weeks notice what does need to be changed though is the inability of transport ships and strategic cruisers with the covert subsystem to fit them if a ship can go through the portal it should be able to light a cyno for it as well should this be changed some of the transport ships would need to be given an additional high slot so they can still fit their cloaks while filling this role
if nothing else bo need a longer jump range at least on par with a dreadi would like to see it warp cloaked as well but the jump range is the main complaint i have about my sin
5 to all damage typessupported because i fly exclusively caldari missile ships and extra dps across the board would be awesome for me not because it would be balanced by any means
this argument is fundamentally pointless since those against it are like climate change skeptics completely set in their ways and will not change no matter how much sense you make but for my 2 cents anywaywhy are so many people taking the line that missile users get to switch damage types they should be grateful for that since hybrids and lasers dont so stop complaining about the damage bonus only applying to kinetic this is fundamentally flawed reasoning and a completely indefensible position to take missiles are supposed to be able to use all damage types its one of the integral advantages of the weapon along with the lack of cap usage if caldari are meant to be missile specialists then why are so many of their ships so badly designed that they cant even make optimal use of their races preferred weapon system it means the ships themselves are fundamentally prenerfed even before you fit them since they cant utilize their weapons the way theyre supposed to be used without forfeiting another advantage the basic bonuses that all ships are meant to get as a reward for training up the hull skill this makes no sense as well as being completely unfair nerf missiles or missile boats some other way to maintain balance if you have to but this kinetic damageonly bonus joke has to be fixedplease do not regurgitate the you can switch damage types so thats a bonus you already have argument again it will only prompt me and everyone with common sense to sneer at you
not supported there is a reason why the any typhoon pilot will fit torps instead of acs even if they only get a rof bonus and nothing else acs suck badly at the moment that will change slightly after the patch but not enough to make a huge difference typhoon pilots will still be fitting torps and they will now be able to fit 5 instead of 4 and they do this even though missiles are supposedly bad
now why would you possibly want something like this seriously though very cool idea be a bit of work for them to do it right and the details will vary based on how spacebook winds up looking but i like it can see cool things resulting supported
this is a great idea especially for lotteries ill support if the lotteryisk pay portion has a contract with random member generator built in
there is always a problem when you try to organize events on a mid level scale to reach out to the players who might be interested in your event perhaps other requriement options then skill level and isk such as ships or the ability to fit a particular module say cov ops cloak or remote armor repaireri know you put it on the list but to have it as a search criteria aswell would be nice
not a bad idea i was thinking there would be a link to list the required itemsships for an operation event being able to check whether your skills are sufficient would be a good function so that you can filter out events you cant join ill add that in when i get some timetamber
youll probably find that something similar to this will come with new eden when its releasedsupported though its a good idea regardless
if all our hopes for new eden come true this will be part of it eve is a player driven game and anything that helps players organise and advertise gets my supportvoting for the council of stellar management is now onlinemake your voice heard
still doesnt solve the problem theyll just make the bogus sell orders on the ore instead once they realize thats how the system worksyou cant use any kind of autocalculation system based on market values of anything regardless of what formula you use as people will find a way to pad the market values to their benefit exploiters are smart these days there were some suggestions above that i should also discuss the option of reducing or eliminating the insurance payout you get for selfdestructing is a good one but it has two main flaws1 it doesnt account for alts legally destroying the ships in pvp my primary solution to this whole problem which i will mention later should deal with this2 there are times that people really do have to selfdestruct their ship for some reason albeit these are rare cases getting stuck in wormhole space with no probes is one that comes to mind people shouldnt be completely slapped for having to make this sacrifice they should at least get something back to pad their losses a bit solutions to this would be either my primary solution mentioned below or ships destroyed by a self destruct automatically get the default payout for an uninsured ship regardless of whether or not the ship had insuranceanother suggestion above was to completely remove the insurance system outright that simply isnt an option players are now quite used to that system and if it is lost players would never want to risk their ships again or they might even terminate their eve accounts over it it isnt worth the riskprimary solutionthe only way i can think of that will really solve this problem without any possible holes for people to exploit would be to manually go through the insurance system and remap all of the values and this would have to be redone on an annual basis the insurance payout for 100 coverage should be noticably but not extremely less than the sum of the insurance fee the average market value for the ship that is manually checked in order to weed out irrelevant data and the average value of the possible salvage from the ships wreck its long its messy but its foolproof and if necessary i can help with some of the data analysis myself if ccp wishes it
hmmm i think youre dismissing the concept too easily what about basing it on actual mineral sales that would ignore phoney high selllow buy orders altogethertrue you could have alts selling back and forth to each other but youd be spending a titanic amount on broker fees to move the rms mineral sale price even a little remember that rms calculations level out the effect of outlying values both high and low i really think the eve mineral economy is simply too vast to be affected significantly in this way and unnaturally high buy orders are very susceptible to interference once people see whats happening and they certainly will it only takes one smart trader to ninja in a sell order at the right time and your putative insurance market manipulator is left holding vast amounts of someone elses trit at 16 isk per unit or whatever
no claims bonus is all is needed to sort out this insurance messthe more ships you lose the more it costs you to insurecould also tie in the new sov mechanics to insurance for 00 pvp
kind of harsh to penalise legitimate pvp in this way 00 is economically disadvantaged enough as it is
hmmthat might work to be safe it should be based on the average sale values over a period of time perhaps 3 months and then reduce the sum total of the mineral cost by perhaps 10 before calculating the insurance values i can see how that would make anyone trying to pad the market lose a lot of money to transaction taxes before they can make a useable difference to the insurance payouts
i agree this would make hisec wars more expensive as well which is something my corpalliance gets into frequently and my finances are streched thin as it is
hell yes this
good idea
thumbs up
this is something i have missed since i first started playing
supportedccp please do this it may only save us like 30seconds to a miniute but it would be a godsend
in my very very humble opinion browsing  thus declining missions to pick a better one  is not exploiting the system at allone of the original purpose for fw was to get more ppl into pvp and into lowsec so far the isk vs reward was so unbalanced that even looking at lowsec missions common lvl3 lvl4 or lvl5 missions was to a large part either stupid or an invitation to get ganked as most of these systems are getting camped on their entry gatesright now ppl can hand pick the mission that fit their objective hello sandbox  for good lp reward or the right target system  and thus achieve their own player objects and go out into lowsec with the chancerisk of getting into pvpit is not possible to just shut down an agent by just camping his home constellation and it is not possible to camp the target destination system as ppl can shift these to their liking with the ability to browse ppl can use these missions as stated in my link below to give their whole roaming a purpose and an objective to be achieved and gain standing and lp till ccp gives occupancy a strategical and tactical meaningif the players objective is getting lp fast they have to setup their fleet accordingly to avoid pvp but they are still in low sec they still have to travel and if the opposing force finds out they are flying around it is the opposing militias task to stop thisif the opposing force still keeps camping just one system it is not the fault of the game mechanics aka being able to browse a mission that these players are not being stoppedi stated heregiving your fw fleet a purpose fw mission plexing and pvp in onewhy having these mission pickable is a very good idea and good for lowsec and fw and to get new players into trying out pvpif the lp reward is too high i could live with reducing the reward but making them not decline able without a standing loss is imho very stupidthe original intention of fw missions was to get players into lowsecif players are able to farm this mission it is clearly the job of the opposing players to stop this that would be the sandbox approachyou know sandbox the one thingy you are all so proud of if ccp thinks that the reward and influx of lp is to high reduce the reward accordinglyccp wanted to have more faction navy ships in gamemaking the fw lp shop discount not static but standing rank relatedthat would reward those players that dedicate themself to the faction they work for and would make the influx of fw items lower againthere are plenty of better ways to reduce the lp inflation than just making the agents crap by making them again like the highsec ones
given the abuse we have seen with fw missions hello pervs the change in dominion is imho a good step forward i cant support your proposal
back to the top with ye
need this badly regards
yeah easier to manage your isk is good in my bookyou often have personal projects or something you want to save isk for by setting it aside
yeshell yes
yes please
those small things supported
agreed
supporteda very small change it would be but it would be very nice
em yes please
already this way on sisi as near as i can tell it asks you the first time you drag an object to the text input box and then sticks with that choice
please
basically i would like eve to be more interactive with the player as in less text messages and more visual audio messages that make me feel like in space last time i logged on to singularity they had added the transmission sounds around stations and gates and i really liked them although they were a bit loud i dont think we need warning sounds for every module in game since in combat you are probably gonna be targeted by 50 of those modules and that would just clutter up audio so much you couldnt even comprehend what it was actually saying we got visual effects for these that could be improved by adding the module icon next to the brackets of the enemy ships i would although like to hear a targeted warning like in star trek its similar to the virus warning sound avast makes but only sounds once
only 3 supports for more goodies to play with eh
why on earth would you think thats a good idea for pvp edit just to clarify as i dont understand the reasoning behind supporting this you think its a good idea if people only ever engage if they are sure they will win therefore absolutely no close fights
well i for one have heard of something called a warp disruptor and i have also heard of something called engaging a gang the same size or even perhaps bigger than yours in which situation your gang would for the most part be pointed all this solution would do is remove even more opportunity for a close and even sided fight as people in this thread have repeatedly pointed out people would only enagage if they are sure to winand yes docking and especially jumping gates are by definition tactical elements of the gameplay it just seems to me the people supporting this idea are fed up with having to use tactics themselves and would rather their targets are pinned for them purely by the fact they engage
supported  about time
my bad seems like i misunderstood
this is a well needed change with regards to having a blob wait one or two systems over for you or your gang to agress more emphasis should be places on intel maybe you could buy a system scan from inside station indicating blues neuts and reds upto a number of jumps away
i think its a great solution and well balanced
this should win the simplest and most elegant award ever i fully support this combat it will change the game drastically into a much better battlefield
exelent solution
i like the idea of nerfing dockinggames but giving people the option to keep the enemy comitted until one side is destroyed or has warped offthough realistically you arent going to get away in a battleship has a far too large impact on the gameyou wouldnt engage unless you can assure you can win the fight at hand which is hard to tell given that the enemy can cynoin at will in lowsec or have a legion of repping alts in highsecin nullsec the problem of carriers redocking is marginalized by the fact that 20 dreads will be able to annihilate a carrier in around 34 volleys and a titan will even be able to instantly kill one of themif youre going up against a sizeable force of carriers and a titan with less than 20 dreads youre probably screwed yes which is mitigated by the fact that the titan costs 60bil uninsureable vs the 200milfitting cost of a dreadcarriers that dont agress and just rep are a problem without a titan of your own so giving ships agression for remoterepping should definately be looked intoalso the hp buff to all ships and the introduction of rigs and abaddons  has amplified this problem so maybe enlengthening the dockjump timer because of these unadressed consequences of these changes are inordertheres just too many downfalls to being able to refresh someone elses aggro timer to make it a good addition to the game
supportedhtfu indeed 
more like stfu until you can learn to read a thread and not just the op or employ logical reasoning
support
this man speaks the truthalthough i would opt not to have this on gates would make harassment of hostile territory harder
im totally for this in fact i suggested it herereally its genius and it would solve so many issues dont want to engage fine dont want to engage good engage all the way
not supported sorry see above posts
not supported its a stupid idea every race has its own primary damage type why should caldari get four
your argument is wrong periodif fixing this issue would make missiles overpowered then tweak missiles properly so it wouldnt be unfair to everyone else but still change the ships bonuses its currently really unfair to caldari and just fundamentally bad balancebesides when has a weapon system having an unfair advantage over the others been such a serious issue coughlaserscough
point madeallow me to be captain obvious for just a moment lets say you want to train frig missiles both long and short ranged to t2 you also want to train hybrid weapons both rail and blaster to t2 ponder the contrastmissiles train standard missiles 2x skill to 5 and then you get to train standard missile spec 3x skill next train roflokets 1x skill to 5 and get to train rocket spec 3x skillhybridtrain small hybrid turret 1x skill to 5 and then you get to train both small rail spec 3x skill and small blaster 3x skillthis distinction applies across all guns vs missile training there is an imbalance in training up the tree but it is not in favor of a missile user that wants to train both long and short ranged weapons so unless you favor a system that requires different pre reqs for short ranged and long ranged guns as it is for missiles your complaint is a red herring i think you are saying that assault missile launchers give cruiser sized missile users an advantage over med guns vs frigs i agree however i think this is no more op then giving a dominix a damage bonus to scout drones i will wait for your call to nerf that little oversight to respond further sure if you are willing to agree to an adjustment to explosion velocity and explosion radius values so that when missiles do hit a ship in their intended class they do full damageagreed lets get rid of fof missiles in exchange do away with the unspoken nerf to the drone bays of missile ships i would like to field 5 medium drones on my drake please
missiles have their pros and consguns have their pros and consi fly exclusively missiles in fact i have 4 gunnery skills trained gunnery ii and small hybrid turret i because i was born with those and weapon upgrades v and advanced weapon upgrades iii so that i can fit the pgsucking t2 ham launchers on my drake without needing three ancillary current routers i have no desire to switch to gunnery for any reason guns are not better missiles do not need to be more like gunsif you look at just about any missile boat fit you will find at least one ballistic control system that is a lowslot module that greatly increases missile damage thats really all we needi am in support of somebodys suggestion that missiles speed up over time that would be a beautiful thing would need to figure out the calculation to make sure we dont increase their range in doing so though
this idea has potential but needs to be refined
full support for points 1 and 4cannot really support the other 2 however
dear captain obvious you missed the bolded part maybe it was unclear as english isnt my first language but the meaning was homogenize the skill training in all the ways including the progression of the skills in all his partsseem pretty clear require people to specialize in short range small missiles to be able to train for specialization in medium short range missiles and make 1 single skill requirement for short and long range missiles btw having trained missiles and rails the possibility to train specialization in large missiles first is an advantage and fairly big the we should nerf all the missile ships that get a bonus to 2 size of missiles lets see nighthawk caracal cerberus onyx unless the description is wrong it say bonus to kinetic missile damage no size specifiedok but then you need to nerf total damage of missiles you are really wonderfulgimme more gimme more missile whiner still not supported
why should i have to select ungrouped drones in my bay rightclick and then launch them every time when i can hit one button to activate a gun or modulei propose you either allow drones to be added to the slot layout with grouping mode or create a new slot window with hotkeys we already have hotkeys to attack and dock etcthey also need to stack automatically if they are not damaged
how about you group them and use hotkeys then
since i answer questions very often on helpchat this is what i tell the newbiestrain the normal learnings to lvl 2 or 3 as quickly as you can and as you like i suggest you at night because it is no immedialty visible progress it will enable you to learn faster if you decide to extend your trial try to learn all normal attributeskills to lvl 4 at least learning itself to 5 but do it within your 16 mio sp boost you will learn much faster afterwards and learnings will consume less time but it will not hurt if you have your cruiser 2 days faster because you skip an attribute skill but you should train those attributes to 4 for that area of skills you want to specialize in as soon you have can afford the money train the advanced attributes to at least 3 later to 4 when you have a nice base of skills to play the gamethe secret is to maintain a good balance between fun read flying and fitting the good stuff and learnings just my 2 isk regards
learning skills may have a place but its not right at the front of someones playtime and saying well youve got to be patient is a lesson that people should learn after theyve decided to stick with the game training for prereqs for t2 ships needs patience training for capitals needs patience advanced spaceship command 5 for example but both those time sinks are more acceptable because they increase in relation to your experiencewhen youre experienced enough to start training for command ships say the time sink isnt as big a deal because you have an existing array of do neat stuff skills that tide you over till its done sticking one right at the start is a bad bit of designa better system might be that for every few thousand skill points you get 1 to an attribute of your choice to a total of 5060 and a maximum of 10 in any one attribute
thats why theres no rule that says someone has to train them first people have this ability to make their own decisions
isnt it ironic that we have a bunch of people complaining over learning skills and yet they obviously dont know how to use the support buttonall of this over the subject of ingame education
this actually could lube the eve economy maybe some guy who actually has access to numbers could look at your assumptionscool proposal
not supported eve is complicated enough for new players as it is without having to add something else to change fitting
please for the love of god increase the maximum number of tabs to at least 10 even for the carebear it would be usefull having separate tabs for each type of ore they wish to mine or whatever
not much to say about this
no it isnt it would require a complete and total revamp of the way ship movement works the way it does things now is you set a destination or direction and speed from there it moves along a straight path in the proper direction the server tells all the clients which way your ship is going and at what speed and everything is done until you change directionthe way youre proposing would require that clients stream ship movement data in real time like a fps does and the server would also have to stream that data to all the rest of the clients thereby requiring a new system of how movement is handled as well as exponentially greater bandwidth and cpu cycles used simply on how ships are moving ever been in a battle with a few hundred ships those are laggy enough as it is thanks add to that the fact that missile damage is dependent upon the speed of the target and gun tracking is dependent upon the speed of the target transverse to your own ship and you have all sorts of calculations that will take longer and be less accurate due to the fact that the ship is not reliably moving at a specific speed or direction it will mess with the game mechanicsbasically this is something that should not be considered period i hope i cleared things up for you
this would completely change the dynamic of evei vote no sorry
whining what are you on about change the dynamics oh stop all im asking for is to allow you to move your ship with the keyboard whilst leaving your mouse hand free to do other stuffive seen you have totally got the wrong idea of what im asking for im not saying flying to a destination or click anyway in space  so no need for the bad attitude i mean just be able to spin the ship around you know when you hold left mouse button and move your mouse around thats allif you cannot not to see the huge benefit of that then im confusedreallyevery game in the world allows you to move your charship with keyboardsometimes i think you guys should get out alot more
completely and utterly misunderstood my point  so no you havent cleared anything upinfact im sorry you spent time typing
i dont see any harm in the arrow keys performing the leftmouse click and drag function options are good
i know very little about programming so i wont go into if its easy or not but i would certanly use this option
you obviously did not read my post if you had you would know exactly why keyboard control would be problematicyou guys can all show as much support for this as you want in fact i think it would be great to have keyboard control and you certainly will not hear me complain if they ever do implement it im saying that it is unrealistic and would require too many changes to the way the game handles ship movement and calculates mechanicsyou said spin the ship around not spin the camera around thats two completely different things and therein lies the misunderstanding and im not the only one that interpreted your post the way you wrote it if you look at the replies before me using arrow keys to move the camera is something that i can support so long as the arrow keys still work for text when the cursor is in a text box
make camera keyboardcontrollable and add a keybinding which is equivalent to doubleclick at the center of the screen set ship direction
simple answer go play jumpgate evolution when it comes outmore complex other posters have said it already this would require a complete revamp of the ship movement system that is a huge overhaul i doubt it will ever happennow to be fair i hate flying small ships in part do to the point and click movement that eve has it is far to cumbersome so i fly bigger ships it is rare for me to be flying anything under a bc sized ship i am often pulled kicking and screaming out of my domi when an fc is asking for a light gang
you havent listened at all have you m8 that misunderstanding has been resolved go back and read the rest of the postskthx
agreed
if you want to haul the ore out to kspace for refining go for it i know my corp uses and loves their 75 refinery because it means about a billion fewer trips dealing with refinery junk highend holes also have the option of a rorqual being used for compression the current system is fine tweaks of the numbers may be desirable and id love to see the refinery be able to refine anything in a batch instead of just a single type of ore at once but there is no need for a 100 refinery
while i wont support this topic i do think a new refining module is needed not just for whsystems though it is stupid that in highsec one can refine without loss which itself does make sense yet outside of high there is a fixed loss of 25 or worsewith enough skills it should be possible to get 100 anywhereedit  it could be a huge module requiring a tower for itself
about refining the system is completly obsoleteyou have more ore when you reprocess some loot in station with no skill then all skill at 5 with refining array in posits not possible for you to use rorqual in class 1 et 2 because the gates is too small they are some month ago i have make the proposition to create a new pos module this module will be compress the ore like the rorqual
thats what you thinkclass 3 as well by the waybut we found a way around that problem
hrmstepping away from the subject of wormhole systems swapping the refining effiency could be a real boost for player corps in high sec and other places right now the only reason to have a pos in high sec is for research if pos refining was better then npc station then there would be a pretty powerful incentive for players to create corps in high sec
moving around between empires and stations if a real hassle for someone whose main occupation consists of ratting and mission running i propose a system that allows you to get a letter of recomendation from your agent for a hefty processing fee and this will allow you to activate one agent of his level and quality or lower provided the agent belongs to a allied faction for example a recomendation from a caldari agent would work on caldari ammar and ammatar but would not work on gallente or minmatar agents and vice versa this would make it easier to relocate and still have a cash flow it seems that standing is primarily a system to keep low sp pilots from getting in over their heads in empire ut other than that it serves as a hinderance for someone who is involved in a corperate relocation to unknown territory
faction standings already do this but the change is gradual and you really have to work on them you can buy some standing gains through data centers though and it doesnt take longer than a few days to grind standings for lvl 4sstandings certainly arent there to keep newbies from getting into too much trouble more likely it is there to provide consequenses and prevent lazy people from taking advantage of the benefits high standings offer without working for it im not against this kind of system though if you implement proper limitations and give thought about how it could be exploited it propably has a lot of issues so im not convinced the extra problems are justified just so people can avoid a little grinding im not for it either since previous choices and actions should have consequenses it also isnt like you cant get the standings you need but you just dont want to work for them i cant blame you for it and everyone who has had to move around in empire has propably done it but it isnt exactly the best reason to implement something
first off hello everyone my first time posting on this forum so please excuse me if i didnt pay attention to something i should have so what is going on with these so called compactor ships i hear you askwel its like this me being an industrialminer i have always found that it is hard to find a hauler to ship my ore from the mining point to the refining pointnow i know that there is the rorqual but its big not allowed in empire and most of all very expensiveso i was thinking why not overhaul a couple of mining barges and exhumers and rebuild them into empire compacting shipscouple of things on this though to keep it fair 1 for the t1 versions they are cheap but also not very effective so for instance  for every 2 cycles of a equivelant t1 mining barge they get 1 compacting cycle for simple ores such as veld skor and pye2 with each size you go up your total compacting amount rises by so many percent this prevents small ships from being able to compact as much as a full size t2 one3 make them only able to compact simple ore types such as veld skor pyrox and maybe another one4 make it so the largest t2 version can fit special modules to compress the somewhat more advanced ores maybe even iceas i see it this will allow smaller corps and individual players to mine more effectively without the need for multiple accounts or large investmentsoffcourse the rorq will stay king of them all and be able to compress the mostalso  we will need sizes in compressed blocks so there will be a clear difference between what has been compressed by a rorq or a t2 compactor shipprices should be around that of their mining bargeexhumer cousinshope you guys are able to do something with thisjust trying to add my 2 cents to the game  sorry for any possible spelling mistakes speed typing this 
im not really sure this is needed for high sec you have the orca which will hold 175k m3 of ore a ore compactor ship will still take an secondary toon to run and the orca gives mining bonuses voting for the council of stellar management is now onlinemake your voice heard
imho the orca fills that gap in highsec nicely for lowsec00 the rorqual gives you more support
this is a very baaaad ideawhat your going to do is making the mining idustrie run rampant and out of controlwhile everyone would like the buff this is overkillthe rorquals ability to compress ore exceeds everyone expectations but its strictly reserved for 00low sec operations because of its high gainsso you need high risksyou want high gains without the risk if you call it thatcant support thatthe orca is more than adequate for your hauling needs
i am rather new to the pvp scene but when a friend invited me to a gank fleet in low sec i decided to try it out now i understood this was a criminal activity and i did expect a security standing loss but the sheer size of the penalty i received was completely unbalanced compared to the months i needed to gain it i understand commission of crime in highsec is met with swift death by concord and a massive security loss but crimes in lowsec should not result in such a drastic loss as 6 per agro as i received until changes are made to concord and the way security status is handled the eve penal system will discourage many players from venturing out into lowsec for pvpi think eve is due for a security status and standing overhaul and i would like to hear some opinions on the subjectpersonally some of my thoughts include changes to the way low security status is handled for one i think concord should not react to your security status if youre a 10 going into empire i am all for making you fair game for bounty hunters and the navel npcs but concord should stay out of it unless the pirate in question commits a crime whilst in high sec this will make it easier for fledgling bounty hunters to make a living as well as allow pirates to restock and sell their wares in better market economies fighting the navy and legions of bounty hunters is nearly as harsh a punishment as concord but at least it gives them a chance to escape without being banned for running from concord concord exists to serve and protect newer players from piracy not to punish people who have chosen a pvp lifestyle and occasionally need to venture into higha second thought if mine is to either give massive increases to security status gain for fighting npcs or change security losses so that when crimes are committed in lowsec the loss is equal to or only slightly greater than gains i also propose exemptions for logistics ships in lowsec pvp fleets the punishment for aiding a criminal is that your poorly tanked shield repping cruiser gets d by station guns or other players who decide to target you this is more than enough of a punishment for most playersi would like to hear other thoughts and suggestions for how to fix the system to make lowsec more pvp friendly
1 concord only cares about 10 in the genesis region as they are sov holders there2 ratting up from bad sec status is a question of a few days ratting not months and that is even to fast imho you should fell the pain from your actionsthat said  you got what you deserve now work yourself up again
im happy with the current system lowsec is safer then 00 and theres a reason for it
i think that is the idea working as intended id sayfrom what ive read working up your sec status isnt as bad as some think its some weeks of hard work at worstif you want to pvp in lowsec why care about your secstatus anyway
the point that your refusing to accept is if you do the crime you do the timeit would be no different than committing a murder difference is you can work your way out of going to jail by killing othermurderers except they are ai yeahbad example but you get the drift
sorry man but reverse engineering implant bpos out of zombified corpses officially falls into the category of too weird for me

37 are all okay but the rest is a little overboard still though supported
i am feeling pretty much the same as ashina sito about this all in all supported
allow us to doubleclick an object in our overview or a bookmark in our peoples and places to warp to zero instead of rightclicking and choosing
you dont want thispeople would end up warping themselves when selecting the destination may sound strange but it will happen now adding something like the ctrlmouse click to lock a target in the overview kinda of a hot key for warping would work instead of doing it on the overview you could do it on the bracket in space though
ok a single well fit jamming boat would either be a rook or a falcon so we are talking about a 90 million isk ship that has the ability to remove at most six 300k isk ships out of the fight i believe this to be totally balanced as obviously any tech ii ship or tech iii is going to be superior to a tech i shipalso there is a counter if your being jammed its called warping obviously unless you are pointed then you are screwed the ship cant continue to jam you if you have warped away all you need to do is jump right back into the fight afterwards if the jammers didnt have that twenty second timer all they would be good for is breaking the lock quickly for a few seconds not enough to actually accomplish anythingmy two cents
ecm is balanced imo you already have to get close enough to be engaged by almost everything i do agree other forms of ew need to be adjusted up a bit
no its not who told you thatbe a man and control your drones yourself or dont bring them besides you kill things more efficiently when you focus fire anyway when you start attacking a target just tell your drones to attack the same target doesnt sound all that complicated to megod im a better drone pilot than most drone pilots and i only brought my drone skillgroup above 5000 sp last week
this not supported drone micro management is important otherwise you will loose lots of drones
adding this feature would not only effect mission running but also pvp and pve ratting i think its too much automation were already able to use hotkeys to attack dock and orbiti vote no sorry
let me see if i get the gist of your argument you feel that the blob should be the be allend all of eve the very thought that your sniping battleship gang should be even remotely vulnerable to a numerically inferior force sends you to the forums you sir are quite pathetic
no in apocrypha theyre usable nowhence the whining not just after the upcoming patch
sorry i have to agree with thisstealth bombers are easy prey provided you know how to deal with themthis smells of a whine post sorry not supporting
it takes alot of coordination and practice to use a bomber if all that preparation didnt amount to being able to kill a few battleships i dont think anyone would use bombers again sorry not supported

hersch is a really good guy and deserves the support of all voters
one of my best friend in eve ive helped you and shown you the bases in pve ive seen you grow up in skills and knowledge in many diversified areas not knowing different aspect of the game never stopped you finding any answers to any challenges that came your wayyou have my votes with complete confidencegem
ive played in his corp for a year he has a strong sense of what happens in industry but also all of the trade  mercenary  wardec problems that go with it he is also expanding his involvement with 00 based players so i believe that he can provide constructive advice allround while avoiding ideas that disadvantage players with different stylesirl a great guy who is interested in people too3 votes from me
you got my votei am sure your views on economy and metagame will bring something to the table
some comments about damar rocarion are unfair  he has killed me many times  i have heard him lose his cool but on other occasions he has been courteous and one one occasion that comes to mind even sympathetic there are plenty of rude pigs in the caldari militia even the odd one in ours damar is not one of themi am not going to vote for him because he seems only marginally interested in the complete imbalance between caldari and gallente plexes  perma jammed for 2 minutes by rats happened to me yesterday  can not be alluded to by his words npcs defending plexes need to be adjusted somewhat its a gross imbalance and needs too be fixed along with the obscene range on caldari battleship rats without more precise details of how he thinks the imbalance needs to be addressed i could not vote for himsome of his other ideas such as encouraging plexing via reward have merit at the very least they need to be discusseddamar you have to specifically adress the imbalances for anyone in the gallente to support you  you may win a spot without our votes but if you want our respect then deal with issues of balance not just rewards
i think damar would make an excellent addition to the honorable institute that is the csm 
voted nice website btw

i ran on a moddable ui as a big part of my last two campaigns linking your thread both times to illustrate my point and the only reason im not this time is that it was taken to ccp by csm3 and rejectedwhich didnt surprise me but did make me a very sad panda theres too many changes that need to happen for it to be useful for me to list them all in midcampaign but i do feel strongly about the topic and will raise ui issues a fair bit if elected that said im hardly alone in that if you want to vote on the ui i think id be a good person to vote for but there are others as well we all play eve we all know it needs work heres hoping ccp finds room in their dev cycle for that overhaul soon
just vote for herschel cause he needs the votes and hes good candidate i hope he gets in this time
as some said its hard for candidates to disagree that the ui need work yet ehre is a point that we actually can disagree on i would oppose a modable ui strongly in fact not that it will be an issue as ccp has allready rejected the idea i like the fact that eve is not like other mmo where it is not the strength of your player skills that determine who wins but the strength of your ui modding powers
qfti want a newchangeable font asap all if this is a long time waiting though
considering how many goons there are and how many alts they have do you really think they care if you vote for them do you think that they care that i voted for alekseyev karrde with all my votesas everyone should ofcourse not they have enough votes to get themselves in anyways so quit complaining and go vote for alekseyev karrde
there are many different play styles in eve from the hisec mission runner to the market pvper 00 is just as important if not more so than all other play styles only those who are actively involved in that game can speak as experts about it to ignore those candidates is to ignore their right to speak in how the game develops youre choice to not vote for them is just that your choice but it does not make their views invalid inferior or unimportant
i didnt see where he said to ignore nullsec he just doesnt want a goon there are plenty of other nullsec candidates to choose from as for why hed be against a goon for csm well if youre familiar with the goons it should go without saying
who said do not vote for anyone in a 00 alliance are you infering that goons are the only worthy 00 alliance goons are similiar to criminalsyou also implied that the gameplay in 00 is more important that any other gameplay how can one persons game be more important than anothers theyre both customers paying the same amount in order to play i was in a big 00 alliance yes it was fun but how is fighting for and defending sovereignty more important that any other parts of he game i expect a response
dont judge a book by its cover
mine vote 4 u too
consider this1 only a rof bonus you do know that rof bonus is a better damage bonus to torps than a pure bonus to damage right2 besides stealth bombers what other ship gets any other bonus to torps other than a rof bonus3 would typhoon pilots continue to fit torps if they only got rof bonus to explosive damage torps and no other missiles or choose to fit acs that get a rof bonus to all ammo types
i would love to see something like this maybe its only a few days away
fully support idear very good one indeed
dynamically linking insurance to mineral prices to make sure that the insurance value is always around 510 less than the market value barring extremely sudden extremely large shifts which are very unlikely imo is the way forward i thinkof course this will almost certainly lead to an initial sharp fall in mineral prices this inevitably means that miners will see a reduction in income however the current situation is that there is an oversupply of minerals in short we have too many miners let the market decide how many we need and how much they should earnhowever there is certainly a very strong case for eliminating nonmining sources of minerals specifically rat loot some reform of drone alloys might also be considered replacing a percentage of the minerals from drone alloys with moon minerals or even firststage reactions might be a possibility
be careful with this idea too in the missions against enemies that dont have bounties ie drones or empire faction ships the can loot makes up a significant portion of the income especially with drones missions of equal level and difficulty should have roughly equal overall value in terms of isk earned through all the various means loot salvage bounties mission reward lp dropping the amounts on the drone alloys should be buffered by an increase to the mission reward itself or perhaps a tweak to what items they drop for salvage
replacing named item drops with named item bpcs or some sleeperesque equivalent that could maybe also be used for invention would not only eliminate the mineral supply but it would also increase mineral demand additional bonus looting missions wouldnt require so much cargo spacechanging drone drops is a tougher issue but tbh this should be debated in its own thread this one is about insurance reform
of course it has been posted already iirc the answer was that the almighty server would not be able to handle all those drones especially when looking at carrier baysim still expecting the day drones are removed completely

i play eve to pvp and i have 2 alts i need to support that both pvp finally i found the ability to make good isk by using one of my pvp toons to do the isk grind in a reasonable amount of time so i can  you guessed it pvpthe current set up allows me to log in fly around to all the mission agents run some missions and make some needed isk to pvp even though i find pretty much every isk grind method in eve mind numbly boring including fw missions this was at least something i could do in low sec with out having to run a high sec altnow ccp wants to make it pretty much a waste of time just like every other isk grinding method in the game just because a few exploit it big surprise reallyhey ccp ask your self a damn question what in this game isnt farmed in some way or another for the much needed isk why would fw missions be any different why ruin it for those of us that finally have a way to make decent isk because a few abuse it
agree with gar 100 the ability to pick my mission is keeping me in fac war right now and i do it all pvp plex and missionthe lack of a incentive to mission will pretty much seal the deal for me to leave fac war and imho will lead to a lot less interest in low secbad idea to change this in dominion this is my third stint in fac war the first two times i never bothered to mission because quite frankly it sucked the changes were good and very needed
100 agree as it stands right now fw missions are barely worth doing any level of nerf will send people back to their highsec mission running hubs which will defeat the whole purpose of faction warfarewhy is it so bad to let players pick the missions they enjoy running or find the most profitable demanding that players run 4 annoying missions for every 1 fun or profitable mission is counter productive to the point of playing a gameif ccp must nerf fw missions at least put in some sort of viable alternative giving lp for plexing or a small amount of lp for every enemy npc you kill and a larger amount for every enemy player you killplease ccp dont nerf this source of income for fw without some sort of viable alternative
1 you already get lp for killing wt i think that was added a while back2 according to the discussion in test server feedback fw lvl4 missions can be done in a cruiser and give the lp of a normal lvl5 sarcasmgeez you seriously need a buffsarcasm3 fw lp store has prices reduced compared to normal lp store need more buff
i do not support ppl do not run fleets work ppl do not work new player to fw all spy cryers and emo pplnot new player f up fw it older players look new player spys and ppl eve online a game not a job so go out play 
1 we get ship hull lpxship tech level lpxpilot fw rank devided among everyone on grid or in actual gameplay practically nothing it would take years to save up for a faction bs even with the reduced price2 i highly doubt it lvl2s and 3s can be done in af and bombers all the people i see doing lvl4s in amarrmin fw are doing them in battleships perhaps this person in the discussion was using a hacpart of the reason the payoff should be slightly higher or at least the same the lovely beacon that pops up in everyones overview that calls every pirate and wt to a free km 3 no argument there the current reduced lp prices are fine although a sliding scale based on rank might work too
dude you are lucky to get 100 lp for a kill of an enemy and thats actually pretty good for most prior to my alt leaving fw i made about 5k lps from kills and it took several months to get thatthe lps from kills is a pathetic amountyou are also missing the entire risk vs reward aspect in fw missions the second you warp to a fw mission anyone in system can see your mission plex and warp to it fw missions are the highest risk missions in this game and should receive the highest payout because of it
please dont forget to check the support tick boxsince a lot of ppl come here with a you farm those missons for lp this is not about the rewardif ccp thinks the reward is to high just reduce its payoutin my link some of you dont seem to bother to read i stated out something very importantso rather than gate campingstation gamesor aimless roaming around your fleet will have an target systems an objective as well an incentive to pvpif you as an player are the opinion that i in fw am earning to much isk or better lp feel free to shoot me im in lowsec not gate guns no need for a scanner the beacon is visible to everybody yes including neutralshey that would be like  a sandbox 
i have already been chased out of more than one mission and participated in hunting down people in em however there isnt always possible to arrange for taking down a superior force of fw enemy targets sometimes its too many of them worst case scenario your mission is in one of a number of enemy home systems or heavily contested due to plexing ones should really a single person have to fleet up beyond small gang scale just to complete this and should other people have to follow himher into it a waste of time is what it sounds like to me i came to fw to pvp and that is what i want to do escaping as much downtime due to plexing or missions as possible i am for small scale pvp in missions or plexes but i do want to be able to pick where the fight is happening and i do not want it to happen in a system next to my enemys high security border that sounds stupid to me in every way except ccp logic which i suppose is the superior force in this euniversesure change the system if you want reduce reward based on proximity to enemy high security zones for example reduce reward in general taking away the possibility to turn down missions however would be killing the only good thing about these fw missions
exactly posting again because i forgot to check the support box
supported
not supported for the following reasonsthe problem is not that fw is farmed all npc content is farmed thats the point the problem is that fw missions can potentially make 200300 mill per hour a figure many multiples higher then any other farming method of acquiring iskthe best solution would be to revamp faction warfare in its entirety i hope this is planned because this fix is a band aid for the actual problem problem being faction warfare sucks
if you all think that there reward is to high lower the rewardbrowsingcyclinefailingchosing hasnt anything to do with thatthat only allows you to  choose your target system to contribute to the occupancyvictory points pick missions suiteable to your fleetship and especially for newer players this can be crucial and wasnt fw meant to be for newer players
i support this a lot
thumbs up
valid points
sandboxing is good
translation whaaaah wahaaah dont nerf my income sourcenot supportedwhile i dont like to see fw missions go back to the previous state after all the lobbying i did to buff them the current situation is unacceptable ccp unfortunately was rather clueless and tipped them out of balance in the other extremefw needs to be sent back to the drawing board as basically all aspects of it are out of balance until then kill fw missions until the triggers are fixed the npc balance is fixed and running them with neutrals is fixedthe whole idea of cherrypicking location is silly in a war the central command tells you where to go kill the enemies and shooting the same scarecrow in your own backyard over and over doesnt count
the current system is lame and needs to change everyone is just taking the path of least resistance right now so that they can solo farm them while avoiding pvp eve is not a solo game and avoiding pvp while isk farming is not what lowsec is aboutjust nerfing the current system isnt so great either there should be ways to earn isk in fw to replace losses or people have to resort to mission running or something else to keep them in the gameput the penalty on decline in as it always should have been but1 make the missions that take a gang to complete lucrative enough that people will start taking gangs out to do them they should be worth several times what a mission that can be completed solo in lowsec is2 escallate the value of one sides missions the more they successfully complete this will provide more incentive to pvp3 up the lp reward for enemy kills factional warfare is about fighting for an npc faction against other players there should be direct rewards for doing so the better you are at it the more you should make your isk making potential in fw should be directly tied in every way to pvp whether its plexing mission running or just direct fleetonfleet combat
did you even read what i wrotethis is not about the reward if you think the income is to high lower the rewardcentral command consiting from a random system generatorcentral command that doesnt even take strategical or tactical decisions regarding the flow of occupany apart from randomly picking a systemshouldnt this be a player driven game not a wowish go here kill ten ratsdid you even read my postseditcentral command that even favours after dt play thus literally destroying the teamwork of a whole militia to a few ppl on at the correct time
yes i did read your postsmaybe i should summarize them as waaah waaah dont nerf my easy income insteadi agree with davet517s post and statement
diaf you stupid 
so working in a team and setting an player created objective within an sandbox is easy income and needs to be nerfedyou dont like the involvement of neutrals in fwwe have rr neutrals already in pvp also ppl working together is now an exploitthose ppl still need to share the reward and if its an alt so whatppl are multiboxing to increase their profit thus multiboxing with an orca and a hulk to haul give boni and get the roids is an exploit toosandbox anyone dont like it you can shoot meits not like im farming lvl4 missions afk in a cnr in motsu and complain about my salvagei just want to pick my mission regarding my player created objectivesif the reward is to high lower the reward the declining and picking missions is game mechanic and balacing wise something different they interact but can be examine independently and the picking part is not brokenunbalancedlower the reward into obliviion  frag  but thats not my pointso you read my post do you even understand them
garr shes just a corp hopping fool now if they put a 60 day timer on corp changing then shed have her playstyle nerfed and would be complaining her entire argument is a strawman of course im going to proceed with the obligatory ad hominem attack for idiotic views on pvp and eve in general ankh you are not on the csm anymore shut your cake hole and go get a life
walk me trough then how one is suppose to make a income if not by missions while in faction warfare200300m a hour sounds like a very generously overkill figure considering if its done solo ive done missions myself and the rate at what you have to do em then must be close to industrial machinelike to reach that figure now i never done em on my own though always in small gang but hey maybe i am a wave going against the currenti forsee someone infintetly more wise than me suggest kill wartargets oh yea sure for the already mentioned 100lp per guy at best  and no besides that you dont get isk for killing emi forsee someone even more infintely awesomely intelligent suggest get a alt trader alt miner alt missioner alt whatever sort of alt just get one but isnt that sort of besides the point here shouldnt we be discussing this from a player with a single accounts point of viewit is entirely possible for someone to loose 3001bill worth of isk in a single fw battle even more if youre very tenacious at it how many 100isk fw targets do you have to take down in your t1 frigate to raise that sum of isk again and be ready for another fight considering you dont quit fw and go back to highsec for carebearing since that is the entire point of fw if i havent missunderstood somethingif i could raise 200300m isk each our missioning i would do it and it would have been awesome i could have comitted countless battleships to each battle i took part in and it would have been a blast however i cannot and i assume most people cannot either this change will make it even less so in all honesty the risk to reward in fw missions can easily validate how fw missions work now although i wouldnt mind if proposed change to actual rewards were considered if your gang is small or youre alone you take a easy mission for a small reward if your gang is big you want big isk and big pvp you browse for a mission with close proximity to danger and head on out there say no to linear gameplay and say yes to deciding on your own
waaah waah i want to have recon in the same system as my mission agent too all day longits too easy because the mission is completed almost instantly with alts not in factional warfare andor flying cloaked stealth bombers in case of the minmatarcaldarimight as well a give me free loyalty points button no matter if the rewards are reduced the button shouldnt be there in the first place
guess ill go back to empire and carebeari dont do alts i cant currentley sell plex real life i want to learn and get better at pvp but i need isk for ships and modsin fw i mission plex and pvp well get blown up anyway all in lowseci guess i could drop corpfw mission in high sec for standings and isk and just join fw on the weekends some people dounlike alot of missions in highsec fw mission rats dont have bounties i thought the little extra lp and being able to browse was a way to even things outsigned
either through running the exploration sites that now spawn in fw zones or by going back to highsec to mission every once in a whilei know fw costs a lot of money hell i spent countless billions on it and i left every once in a while to get isk back until i got myself some extra accounts to run afkdominixes to rake in plenty of isk to support my habitif youre smarter you can make much more money trading with your market alt so you dont even need multiple accountsbut yeah exploration your plexing ship comes with a probe launcher for a reasoni already told ccp that fw needs to be more sustainable so that people dont have to go back to highsec but having an isk printing machine like the fw missions currently are is not the solution its just another imbalance i dont like to see them totally nerfed to hell they should be a balanced income source with a max income figure of around 50 milhrnpc balance has already been brought up by erik finnegan so well likely see gallenteamarr getting buffed and minmatarcaldari getting nerfed soon
a taking stuff to personal loosing valid arguments in a discussion you might want to reconsider your point of viewb im sorry but having a fw mission in your missions agent system is not possible at least not to my limited knowledge being in there from the startif so that might be an exploit so you might want to bug report thatc alts not in fw remote repping all day long in pvp  news at 10corporation outside fw deccing corps inside fw all day long  news at 11alts hauling ore for hulk pilots in highsec all day long  news at 12 so whatthey are in low sec  so why dont you just shoot thembut hey that would be like getting into pvpbut wasnt that point of fw  getting ppl into pvpbut big letters make better arguments sorry i started it  news at 1editso lower the reward in addition we get lp for missions we trade them for items and then we have to sell them on contractsif the items become more and more available the price will dropthe eve market will adapt so the sandbox works fineso your point was 
if you need an alt in order to play a sandbox game then the game is broke but it might make the company more money that waystill signed in support of op
you really dont get my point and just resort to flawed arguments dont youno matter how in how many forums you crosspost your rabble any reasonable csm will see that this is just driven by personal interest and has nothing to do with game balancestill not supported stop your whiningfortunately you dont need alts to play fw i havent had alts for almost a year while i was in fw and there werent easyisk missions back then hell lots of people played fw for a year without the missions so why cant you
so you are basically saying l4 fw missions should not be more profitable profitable as in iskhour than l4 highsec missions yes thats the way to do it  force everybody into highsec great plan reallygreat do it but after you change the number of hugh quality l4 fw agents explain to me why gallente have over twice as many positive quality l4 fw agents than minmatar and then we can talk about the missions itself being unbalanced
personal interest in sandbox how dare i try to make my own content even though i totally willing to loose all the ingame incentive it might have by not getting any lps for what i want to do so that my selfish personallity can bath in  whattrying to get my arguments past youthanks for the bump then
im not saying that anywhere how did you get to that conclusionfw missions are currently broken and should be temporarily removed until they can be reintroduced in a balanced wayid be in favor of balancing that aspect yesall nice but you have to keep in mind that this is not your personal game thus your selfinterest may not prevail over others when it comes to game mechanic changes that is what the csm is all about being neutral and looking at an issue from all perspectives and from a neutral standpoint these missions have to be brought in line unfortunatelythis is why no single csm will raise your issue the majority of the csm will vote down this issue if it does happen and why ccp game design will laugh at any csm that somehow manages to get it through anywaysummary not gonna happen
where did i say that they do not need to get balancedim just argueing that the current installation on sisi with having standing losses on decline for more than once every 4 hours is seriously counterproductive to what ccp originally seem to have designed fwso rather than destroying the incentive and destroying a possible useable tool to create player created content within the game a far more easy way to stop the farming and rebalance the reward with other stuff in the game would be just reducing the reward on the missionbut again you dont get it i dont get it either so we agree to disagreeyou havent come up with any alternative ideas to balance this apart from soontm while my idea is a simple and easy way to bring balance and keep a new introduced game play feature within the gameand btw even though this discussion is heatedokay girl youre not my nemesis  look im just trying to change the world okay i dont have time for a grudge match with every poseur in a parka  besides theres kids in that park so so sail safe and watch your back
risk vs rewards folksagree fw missions and the ability to cycle missions have brought many people to lowsec and removing the ability to decline missions without penalty will just send folks back to empire
agree full support
definitive support
thisthis is just a new way of isk farming plain and simple you should not join fw to farm missions  lp you should join it to pvp  fight the enemy militia and be rewarded with lp
piratei dont understand why youre complaining though the missions by all factions are still done in lowsec i think this still brings it back to one of my arguments even from a rp perspective since there is a uniform chance of picking a reduced risk mission or a high risk i dont mind the vaklear generals calling me a  pod pilot if it helps me avoid enemy faction home systems or pirate camps in bottleneck systems i want the danger to come to me when im out trying to make isk on my own or in a too little gang to fight anyone who is out looking for ganks not the other way round im pretty sure everyone else who doesnt have a near infinite amount of isk available thinks the same in the long run anything else would sooner or later drive people who arent as resourceful out of fw and into highsec because unless you end up with a 00 corp who is willing to support you that is the only alternative i know at least the minmatar militias oppinion on missions and plexing i wouldnt hold my breath if i call for support in the general militia chan against anything that is outnumbering me more than 23 to 1 unless its a huge blob then its sort of pointless trying to do missions regardless
there are a few things that we have to seperate from each other imho in this discussionrisk vs reward balanceyes even i think that the reward is a bit to high i like it because right now the risk vs rewards is pretty much balanced toward my playstyle but i do see that others are farming these to death and there is a too high influx of lp into the gameso reduce the reward to make them not worth getting farmed again though that likely will be so low that there is harldy anything as reward leftpicking picking missions in a target missionsfw missions were originally designed to contribute to the vp score of a system having them being located randomly made them totally pointless as you couldnt really effectively contribute see how hard we even struggle with our focused constellation plexing effortbeing able to pick missions in a target system allowes now to contribute to this so this is imho a good change of the gamebeing able to decline missions without a standing lossunder the assumption that fw still should be an entry point for newer players to get their first step into pvp not being able to complete your missions because you are a newb low skilledc start solo as everybodyyou might end up picking a mission in a system that is fw main battleground from the veterans in fw and you get podded repeatedly in there trying to do that missionso you try and cant complete it because your outgunned and outskilled and then on top of it you get a heavy standing loss of the small amount you grinded together that is not an incentive to try again for that newer player hell just drop fw and goes back to grinding missions in high secplayer vs players in a sandboxa game imbalance is the difference in strenghts of the npcs in the fw missions and plexes due to their choice weapons some are far more dangerous and more difficult to tank than others this is something that ccp needs to fix and balancea player imbalance is for example the price difference of a jaguar in jita vs rens this is something the players have causedcreated themself and something the players can fix and rebalance them self  if they trynow adapt this on factional warfarethe risk flying in fw and the reason why fw missions were originally designed so easy is because the main point was to get one militia player to fight the other militia player one player should be the content for the other playerso if now one players is flying in fw and opening plexes and mission beacons visible to all it is actually the other factions player duty to stop him from doing soif now one side totally refuses to play at all like the plexoccupancy game in caldari gallente fw ccp is not trying to balance a player created imbalance and it doesnt look like they will so people are picking missions in a system they like with a reward they think is worth the risk encountering an opposing player he is still out there and actually the opposing faction has everything in their own hands to stop this player from completing this mission somebody suggested taking the reward out of the other players pockets but basically you can do that by just preventing the other players faction to do their missionsits a player issue if one side refuses to play the other one scores that simple more to come
lp inflation into the market is to highfw missions dont give out isk at least not noticeable fw npcs dont give out bounties we have to buy faction items and then sell them on contractsso basically we dont generate isk but rather redistribute itif the supply of faction itemsships goes up the price will go down eve markets has shown countless time that it was pretty stable and was able to adjust to the various changes that came so the the price will drop the lp per isk reward will sink more faction items will be availabale for more players and more players will fly faction ships wasnt an increased usage of faction navy ships one goal and a reason to rebalance them another thing is that the lp price for faction items in the lp shop could have been adjusted one thing that springs to my mind is that the discount is equal for everybody how about making the discount relative to the achieved standingrank with the militiaso here we are with a multitude things we have to balance versus each other and one very very simple approach would be to reduce the lp reward to rebalance it but being able to cherry pick mission is imho not the broken part that needs fixing or needs to be nerfedpsthis 5min wait out is really terrible please increase the character limit 
myself having no first hand experience fromthe actual topic fw  fw missions you might want to disregard my input however the argued imbalance between input needed and rewards of fw missions cannot be solved through comparisons to normal mission running the whole pve scene be it in fw or outside needs a thorough and wholehearted reconsideration and revampall pve content in the game needs to have their rewards lowered significantly why you may ask even though the answer is pretty selfevident the industrial side of the game is frowned upon by all the selfacclaimed pvp gurus to whom it is impossible to understand that being able to cut down on the costs of ships and equipment could in fact be considered the most playerversusplayerlike activity in the whole game if only the isk genrating machinery of pve incl npc bounties and mission rewards was turned belly up or at least drastically nerfednormal missions should be limited to early gameplay so that new players are able to learn how to handle their vessels and perhaps gain basic skillbooks and new kinds of ship equipment to learn how to use them in the future when they need to use the thus learned piloting skills in a pvp environment against other playersnow the problem is that all artificial economic environments without need a money printer to ensure that the world does not run out of currency through eg ppl leaving the environment the game but the isk generator of eve should not disturb the foundations of any part of the gameplayeve is a sandbox game or at least has aspirations to become one p but the current pve system makes mining for example not only boring but pretty pointless too in a fully functioning eve universe the combatoriented players would require the industrialists and the ones acquiring the raw materials and the latter ones would depend not only on each other but on the fighters tooi surely hope that solutions to exisiting problems within the game ie the bandaid approach does not mean that game developers cannot see a wider picture i also understand that ccp has no interest in losing paying customers due to nerfing pve content but the end of the day however eve is not a good pve game nor should it be in the long run we should see the game changing towards a manysided if not altogether transdisciplinary pvp game where the combat and the production go handinhandwe will not suffice with a sandbox we want the whole effing saharathat all i really wanted to say but a few words for laughs  inspirationthinking somewhat outside and regardless of the sandbox the sahara approach could mean playerrun financial services banking and insurance etc multiple currencies around the universe the dustxxx console thingy could provide a means to introduce this playerrun nation or racial states with their own laws and regulations democratically set and enforced except for the amarr regions ofc and spaghetti monster knows what  topped with voice channel karaoke bars and ambulationtriggered poker rooms and ography sky aint the limit in spacesorry for drifting offtopic but this is all related to fw missions  at least if we have a true sandbox b

as soon as they make more than 100 mil isk per hour and ruins the spirit of a whole aspect of eve id be the first one to support that
add me to the list of supporters
yes
excellent
please a beep when someone types in the corp channel
removing swear words etc is good but outwrite deleting peoples opinions is wrongeven if after removing all the personal attacks all thats left is a this idea sucks thats still someones opinion and it shouldnt be outrwrite deleteddeleting a post that contains only someone opinion saying that its not constructive basically means you dont want our opinions
a thousand times yes
not taking you seriously
its almost like the gms moderate the forum too its that bad
ccp has the right to have no customers also
hi there i am a miner and i want mining to be a profession again which can compete to any others right now for highsec mining is not profitable as lvl 4 missionrunning in fact it cannot beat it at all here are some of my thoughtsidisallow miners to be fitted to any other ship than mining cruisers and frigs this would reduce the number of iterons mining afk greatly for thus introduce mining cruisers for amarr and gallenteii introduce some afksystem if you are in space for some amount of time lets say about 10 minutes then your modules of your ship deactivate it would also reduce people doing missions afk the afk culture is too much for this game i thinkiiigive us bigger giant secure cans anchorable only for 4 hours size around 25k m3 as example exact numbers must be determined by ccp ivboost the defence of a miner we need to be able to protect ourselves also in highsec when in a hulk ganking hulks has become some sport v bumping hulks is an issue but tbh i have no idea what to do against but those ppl follow you around und keep you bumping out of the belt and you cannot do anything about it except changing belts or system which does not help always vi remove zydrine and morphit from drone loot a miner has to go to nullseclowsec to get those minerals a missionrunner can loot it in highsec from drones no way to get my support for that i do missions by myself and i am not happy with it this are my thoughts i am glad for any other ideas to make mining worthy again also in high security space right now i do not see any advantage of sitting in a hulk when i compare it to lvl 4 missionrunning in highsec space with all the loot bounty and salvage regards
you missed by far the biggest competition that miners have minerals from reprocessed rat loot replace all rat loot with named me0 pe0 bpcs with a small chance of 3 or 5run bpcs and you not only eliminate a source of minerals that produces about half as much as miners do but you will also actually increase mineral demand as well i would suggest that the named items have their mineral compositions changed so they use a very high proportion of mid ends specifically nocxiumjust removing highends from drone loot altogether would totally cripple the drone regions in my insurance thread i suggested replacing a percentage of the minerals with moon materials as a possible alternative faction drone bpcs are another
thanks for your reply yes i did not mention reprocessing modules because i did not have any solution for it your solution is a good idea for drone loot adding moonminerals may be a solution but in the end it would affect moonmining bad idea for my mind i think it would be better to introduce new loot to drone regions where you can reprocess high ends from regards
thats idiotic you nerf the terrible oneminer iteronestimated profit per hour 450000 isk or less but also destroy the 8miner battleship the veldnought and veldatar and just generally destroy the entire concept of fitting generic modules to any ship you want also idiotic doubly so the way you phrased it which would imply my guns turning off every 10 minutes in pvp but even if i assume you meant if youre afk its still dumb the game cant tell if youre afk and sometimes your domi just doesnt require human input not a terrible idea but really the orca was intended to be what you want and it does a good job of it rokh 8 mining lasers orca nearby full shield tankwith cpu mods in lows you now have zero need to fear suicide gankers fit an afterburner on your miner rokh you really dont get all that much of it mission loot needs to be looked at but not for reasons of they get minerals i dont no support
yeah its terrible but an afk industrial mines when you are not able to activly play the game you should not be able to generate isk from roids period and for bsmining i do not support it tbh it was meant only for afkpeople not for those activly playing and yes a game can see if you are there or not yes the orca is good but i need a second person for that which splits my income which is already very low compared to soloing lvl 4 why should i mine with a rokh when i have a hulk i can get this minerals too by doing missions but the risk of a lvl 4 is not comparable of the risk a miner has to take in nullsec to get itplease take this into accountregards
you have provided no argument for your viewbattleship mining is not normally an afk activity because the cargohold is not particularly large it does not take 10 minutes to fill the hold
i think mining is a profession just like pirates missionrunners etc if i train mining i cannot fly missions with a hulk but i can mine with 8 miners in a battleship even highend ore i think this needs to be tuned we could also restrict normal miners to veldspar and scordite
you would be surprised how well a hulk can do level 3 kill missions
before even argue futher pls read the dev blogs about the new patch they announce that there will be introduced a new kind of ore called king arkornor and similar named ores i assume they have better refining rates so mining get a boost but only in 00 where there is more risk involved mining vs afk mining in high sec now before u say high sec income is poor blah blah thats true but eve is a game of risk and reward live with it orelse wow  that way
thats a lie you are doing it seriously wronghere are some of my thoughtsomg yes afk mining ittys are definitely a threat for any serious miner lolamarr  arbitratorgallente  vexorfacepalms it is called orca well you can try to tank your ship properly but nothing in eve is 100 safe that does include mining bumping miner is fun dlet me guess you flame them in local and ask them why they are doing it thats like pumping oil into the fire  i highly doubt that there are enough mission runner in highsec to sustain the market for those minerals needed for productionmy last words for you1 if you are doing claims invest a little bit of time into research mining cruiser2 not everyone is willing to train up for an exhumermining barge for the occasional mining op with their corp mining bs  orca are a nice help to get enough minerals for eg carrier you shouldnt punish people for that3 a single hulk pilot with an orca next to him can easily get 810mhour in highsec thats about the same iskhour an average mission runner has bring a friend
i guess im not sure i understand this point of view in a game in which warp disruptors exist if im ratting in a belt in nullsec and not paying attention to local which is a regularly enforced capital crime and a hostile lands near me and points me then i am locked in combat until i blow up or blow him up or drive him off if im carebearing with no point and in this case i dont even get a chance to commit by aggressing im locked into combat the second the hostile acquires a lock on mein light of that why do you feel its particularly heavyhanded to create mechanics that are less severe at stations allowing a pointed ship to escape by docking even after being pointed so long as they havent themselves aggressed is pretty mild by comparison allowing them to dock at will with a minutes lead time seems overly easy by comparison surely you dont feel that warp disruptors and scrams should also be removed from the game because they lock you into a fight that you might not win rightand by the way even after aggressing you are no more locked in combat by this mechanic than you are at that belt if you are in a fast ship or if you have the right kind of ew or if you have some support from ships with the right kind of ew which could include webs damps ecm or even a warp scram to shut off the hostiles mwd then you can break their point and warp away normallytldr if you think this mechanic is too severe compare it to being warp scrambled at a belt
which is why i dont start fights i cant definitely win in a belt or at a planet compare trying to bait someone into a belt gate and station then apply the sucess rate of belts to the entire game currently the majority of pvp in eve happens at gates and the point is this change would extend the belt situation to gates and stations as well which is a bad idea because it means more blobbing less willingness to engage more falcon alts etc and more general gotry that sucks the fun out of pvp in the first placeedit just try and imagine for a second how much harder this would make engaging a larger gang especially in hostile territory now im aware that is a concept that is totally unfamiliar to the vast majority of eve but some people dont enjoy being a part of blobs and especially dont enjoy having to avoid a fight purely because the other side brought more numbers all this change would do especially for the gates side of things is make that situation even harder to manage for the smaller side then again perhaps that is the motivation for supporting this change if that is the case it makes me sad to see so many supporting it the notion that people should be punished for attempting to engage in a fight in a game like eve is one of total insanity
a very nice and smooth solution to what has been an annoying feature for years now
people wont why would they congratulations you have just destroyed risk vs rewardits hard enough getting people to engage on remotely close numbers as it is even on a station and after 12 bait  ganks itll become totally pointless to engage anything unless you know you can win at which point the other side refuses to engage as the balance is no longer in their favour all im doing here is using your own hypotheses which is the amazing thing as people in this thread are so fantastically keen on pointing out under this change people shouldnt be engaging unless theyre sure they can win but both sides cant be sure to win the same fightthe amount of idiocy and self contradiction on these forums is honestly mind blowing
while i dont think docking games will be a huge problem in dominion station pingpong have you seen how fast someone dies in a 150 vs 150 i do think that docking games is broken and a fix is well overduenote that i think this mechanic should only apply to stations an rrbs fleet who is loosing badly should still be able to save some guys by deaggro and jump
dumb idea firstly because you slyly included remote rep aggro in thereremote repping anywhere should not prevent you from docking or using gates  logistic ships have a hard enough time surviving as is secondly the biggest problem i have with war targets is them docking and not undocking or docking and redocking before they engage this doesnt solve that problem once you leave station you should be dedicated to the situation and there should be a timer immediately applied if anyone engages you whether or not you engaged them stations shouldnt be seen as santuary but as a place to put your  thats itif you cant take the heat stay out of the kitchen or just stayed docked not supported without an extended timer for any engagement

supported id love to see the face on the dumbasses while they try to understand whats going on to their timer how do i get the thumbs up icon on the left
one of the most annoying things about the pvp mechanics for sure signed
the situations are not compareable really if im tackled at a belt i am a not very smart as i had enough of warning seeing you in the local channel and b in a pve ship so not able to fight back with too much efficency though if im ratting in 00 ill have some means to try and break awayif i engage at the station i am willing to enter risk however the proposed changes would increase that risk to a degree thatd be bad for the game eg noone would engage unless they can be sure to win and with cynos covops cynos for jammed 00 systems neutral repping alts and whatnot making that sure is nigh impossiblecurrently engagements on a station have pros and cons for the attacker and the defenderthe attacker can dictate the range you can get your ewar into proper position keep your lighter ships out of web range etc while the defender is forced to have his entire fleet sit at the same spothas the initiative you can roam around with the intent to horribly gank someone with having a bunch of capitalsneutral rep alts on standby but you dont really have a swarm of similar ship ready to jump in as soon as a hostile enters local unless youre a large well organized 00 alliancethe defender has ships to match the enemy fleet in stock ideally can retreat into the station if the enemy cant break him in timethough note that the attack might aswell dock unless its a 00 outpost whichshould favour the defender anyway doesnt need to warp in which takes a whiletaking most advantages of the defender away while doing nothing for the attacker would imbalance this unhealthilythese proposed changes would lead to an immense increase in the usage of new guaranteedsuccess tactics amplifying into making a capfleet on standby or a good amount of neutral reppers mandatory if you want to engage and stand a chance of winning it would serve to further the usage of massive blobs which given that titans are losing their aoe dd will be prevailent in the upcoming future moreso than before
not goodthe system as proposed is vulnerable to being exploited with logonski attacks i undock you shoot at me i shoot at you then your five buddies log on ewarp to the station and im toastyou could fix this and make it more viable though still somewhat vulnerable to logonskis if you made it so that my timer resets and i cannot dock as long as someone that i agressed is still shooting at methat way in the scenario above i undock you undock i shoot at you you shoot at me your five buddies logonski my five buddies undock and pop you or i pop you myself i dockyes
gains a thumb from meedit  still keeping my thumb but the idea above my post is very very good
not until you learn to read
i have to agree with this minmatar terrorist
you can train torps without a specialization in rockets or hams is your point my point is that you can not train a specialization in both cruise and torps without training both t1 cruise and torp to 5 first not so with guns if you do the math across any one weapon system it takes longer to train both long and short t2 missiles in any class than the same class of guns care to debate thatcan we also nerf all drone ships that get a bonus to at least 4 sizes of drones why should a dominix and all other drone boats with a big enough bay get a bonus to all lightmedium heavy and sentry drones no problem there can we also get instant damage as a compromisegallente get to have cake drone damage across all sizes and eat it too all damage types then sit back and call others whinersclassic
still missing it i see as i was saying if you change a thing in the way the skills progression work you should change all and not only the part convenient for missile usersso if your hypothetic changes were to be implemented you should get the whole package from a single skill to learn t1 long and short range missiles to a longer progression to learn the large specialization shield missiles instead of jumping stepsseeing that the comment was in reply to your proposal to do that yes it is exactly what i meanalready put in the original commentmy dear whiner you have ever got your main weapon destroyed by enemy firenot a few shots the whole weaponyour whole suggestion is aimed to get the drawbacks of missiles removed without paying anything essentially you want a super weapon do it all
i agree with the op i cant say that i get your point missiles are rather flawed at the moment and could do with improvements without turning them into a super weaponi think op basically wants missiles to have more use in pvp by making them quicker supported and have skills affect explosion size for all missiles supported this hardly makes it a super weaponfurthermore i agree that training all missile skill specs take a lot of time in comparison with gunnery skills support gunnery skills apart from controlled bursts also have uses over 3 weapon platforms while all missile support skills only have a use on 1 weapon platform to begin with a few missile support skills also do not support the whole weapon platform this makes the skills rather crippled for their training timeso basically while the whole idea could use some working on i do support this issue
no one but you sir has proposed homogeizing guns and missiles it is a term you introduced into this thread as your interpretation of my intent i do not want missiles to be exactly like guns please refrain from continuing to argue how to make missiles exactly like guns in this thread and start your own thread on that subjectwhat i do propose is that missile systems should be adjusted as a matter of balance with respect to modules that improve and disrupt their performance tctetltd as well as skills gmp that improve all missiles and not just half it would also make for better game play if they were more useful in small gangs and fleets more velocityi do not believe there is any imbalance created by such changes if made as a whole missile improvement mods would be self regulating with concern to balance just as tracking mods are now on guns you sacrifice fitting other modules to get the improvementyou have not argued any of my proposals on the merits of the changes themselves you simply keep parroting that they do not make missiles exactly like guns debate the changes on their merits if you like but please stop trollingi beg forgiveness for the use of the word mainstream as it obviously has caused a bunch in your undergarments in an effort to make the title snappy i seemed to have developed some new form of troll baityour objection is duly noted now either stick to the subject or go make your own thread on how to make missiles exactly like gunsmoderators notified
it is the argument of your whole ideayou request is to make missiles practically identical to guns only with a different name i extended your proposals to the logical conclusion to show what you were aiming at and it is not balanced simply because your way of changing missile is aiming to get guns with the added bonus of choosing the damage kind at will
i agree with all of the ideas in the op i myself am a pvper whose skills are focused on missiles however i have found it very difficult to be an effective pvper with missiles and would like to see them get a boost to put them more in line with the pvp capability of drones and guns
the only acceptable pointwhere is my equivalent of the guided missile precision skilltarget size reduce my chance to hit and the quality of my hits i would greatly like to have a skill that will increase the signature of my targetsyou missile users have 2 skills helping with the target motion and size target navigation prediction helping with target speed roughly equivalent to the tracking of guns and guided missile precision helping with target size gun users have 1 skill motion prediction helping with turret tracking and the modules helping with tracking again to compensate for the missing skill helping with target size i would greatly prefer a skill to a module after i have learned the skill it is always available modules are dependent from energy and space and btw you are asking for your module to increase both explosion speed and explosion radius greedybeing contrary to 2 adding 3 would be a non sense maybe you have missed it the thousand of times it has been repeated eve engine cant manage missile and ships higher than the current without acting funny being broken were the words a dev usedthat the main reason for the speed nerf and the missile formula changes all the above are well know informationtaken singularly your requests arent so outrageous together you are asking for a huge buff of missiles without real drawbacks or are simply inapplicableto resolve thing the way you want them resolved it would require to make missile guns under a disguise but then it would require to remove the missile advantages too to balance them
first of all thank you for responding to this thread and not the one featured in your imagination secondly thank you for conceding this point i think i see an inconsistency here first you agree that gmp should apply to all missilesthen you say the skill itself is unbalanced dubiousguns do not need good tracking to hit a smaller target that is not moving or which is moving with insufficient radial velocity so as to overcome the guns tracking turning speed this is why a frig siting still or moving in a strait line toward or away from a bs can be insta poppedin a recent posttaja calaren described the difference quite clearly
so you are saying the only reason there are mods to assist tracking is because there is no second skill to improve tracking to make up for a skill that would add no more than 5 to tracking per level turret users get tracking computers enhancers and links my godbased on this logic i would gladly give up gmp for access to those modules for missiles so you would support doing away with those modules in exchange for a skill for turrets similar to gmp please make that proposal in your own post i will support itmissile trackingi know there is no such thing unlike gun tracking is dependent on both inputs unlike gunsthis is blatantly incorrect the posts i have read refer to missiles acting funny during prior attempts to reduce damage based on target speed and missile explosion velocity not missile velocity i am sure of this but if you could link this mysterious dev post refering to missile velocity i would love to read itthere now that was not so hard was it glad to see we agree now go wash your mouth out i hear crow taste bad
the csm is not working well if at all ccp originally introduced the csm after the debacle when it was found that ccp developers were cheating in game and the person who exposed the cheat the forum blanks his name it is ku gut sumen without the spaces was permanently banned since then the csm has been devolved by ccp to simply become a group of players who are charged with bringing player requested changes to ccps attention ccp has no obligation to implement or even answer to any of these requests and often doesntand therein lies the rub ccp takes the player bases money and offers no accountability for it ccps developerplayer comunication in the form of the forums as in the case of the latest naglfar and mothership nerf often just lead to massive threadnaughts with posts getting deleted or players getting warned for expressing their anger and no final resolutionnone of this gets us the player base that provides ccp with its funds anywhere it also reduces ccps creditability amongst the playersproposalscrap the csm it is simply ineffective and a continual source of frustration for the players as well as the csm members themselvesextend the current proposal voting system so that vote counts are tallied with one vote per player per proposalon a regular basis initially monthly take a set amount of proposals with the highest number of votes and implement them the implementation is obligatory and if technically unfeasible the developers are obligated to explain why to the player base here or in a new section of the forumthe number of player requests would have to be adjusted to fit in with ideas originating from ccp itself and these would take priority say on a 6040 basisthe monthly proposals would be divided into two groups new game feature requests and bug fixes bug fixes are currently working features that make no sense such as the 100km lookat limitto avoid abuse by players developers are required to give an estimation of how long any new game feature request would take and adjust the implementation priority based on that bug fixes take the highest priorityon a regular basis once every six months this system would be reviewed and adjusted to better suit the workload on the ccp developers and the realities of feature development and player demandsproswould do away with a major source of player frustration by enforcing a certain amount of accountability on ccps partwould give players a feeling of getting better value for their moneywe wouldnt have to listen to ccp explaining various nerfs in terms of balance if cp is unable to explain exactly how their concept of balancing works the voting system can simply undo or change that featurethreadnaughts would be less a waste of asciiutf8ccp nozh would get get less hate on the forumsconsi can honestly only see some uncomfortable but not bad changes for ccpccp will have to act more like a corporation that listens to its shareholders where we the player base who provide ccps financing would be the shareholdersccp would be forced to publish a list of development prioritiesthe system will certainly be rocky in the beginning but i believe it will improve with time as things settle downi would appreciate your ideas modifications and votes on the proposal
the problem here is that many proposals are put forward which are impractical to implement also given the relatively small percentage of players who even bother with the forum and the even smaller fraction who bother to check this part of it such a voting method would hardly be much less representative than the current csm it would also be extremely sucseptible to manipulationand at the end of the day ccp would never bind themselves to outside authority in the way you suggest youre conflating listening to the customers with doing whatever the customers tell you any parent can easily explain the differenceyou assert that the csm is not working well if at all on what basis do you say this ccp regard the csm as a mechanism for player representatives to make suggestions and voice concerns in a more formal structured and accountable way than forum rabblerabble the csm was never intended to run the game if you think its failed because it doesnt have final authority then you are the one who has failed to understand what it is for in the first placein short your expectations are unrealistic and in the unlikely event that they were implemented would quickly destroy the game not supported
the last thing i want is obigatory development directed by popular vote eve isnt a good game because it was developed by the masses its good because it was developed by a small team with a clear vision we are not shareholders or citizens we are customersedit no support

currently t2 battleships just dont have a role in conventional pvp blackops ships are extremely specialized and are really only useful for the covert jump bridge generator while marauders are specialized pve ships too expensive for what they do to be really useful in pvp and the reduced sensor strength appears to be a deliberate attempt to keep them away from pvp what we need is a t2 battleship class designed to be taken into pvp to just straightup kick ass in the same way that assault frigates do for frigates and heavy assault cruisers do for cruisers please dont get started on assault frigate balance thats beyond the scope of this post as an extension of the tree that goes from assault ships to heavy assault ships and to be completely honest picks up force command ships on their way through the battlecruiser hulls i propose the main assault ship based on the racial tier 3 bs hulls here is a sample ship i put togethercaldari t2 main assault ship gargoylehull rokhcpu 860powergrid 16000slotshi  8med  6low  5launcher hardpoints 3turret hardpoints 8rig slots 2calibration 400 pointsdrone capacity 125m3drone bandwidth 125mbitsecstructure 8000 hpcargo capacity 300m3armour 7500 hparmour em damage resistance 50armour explosive damage resistance 10armour kinetic damage resistance 34375armour thermal damage resistance 5875shield capacity 10000 hpshield recharge time 2600 secondsshield em damage resistance 0shield explosive damage resistance 50shield kinetic damage resistance 70shield thermal damage resistance 80capacitor 6400 gjrecharge time 1250 secmaximum targetting range 100kmmax locked targets 7targeting speed 8 secscan resolution 80mmgravimetric sensor strength 28 pointssignature radius 510mmax velocity 94 mseccaldari battleship skill bonus 10 large hybrid optimal range and 5 shield resistance per levelmain assault ship skill bonus 5 large hybrid damage and 5 large hybrid rate of fire increase per levelskill requirementscaldari battleship vcaldari cruiser ivmain assault shipheavy assault ships ivadvanced weapon upgrades vshield management vengineering iiiif anyone has any suggestions about a better class name id appreciate it i considered shipoftheline the old naval term for a main battleship but found it too clunkythoughts
good post i like the example you failed to mention the price for this beast and i sure you noticed that the price increase from t1 hulls to t2 is huge for cruisers 10x and even more for frigs by that scale maurauders arent that bad i dont know how much pvp you have done but moving around in a bs through enemy space in anything but a blob fleet is almost suicide no matter what the individual capability of the ship is i would like t2 bs but in my experience having a t2 bs is unlikely to be beneficial in pvp you will just provide a much juicier target
i am not sure how many people have acidently trashed somthing important because they were grinding away at somthing and didnt bother to read the screen properlyi propose a system that will get the job done and remove the burden from gms who process the accidental trashing petitions my idea is simple create a recycling center in the stations that functions like the recycling bin on your desktop items are placed in this location when they are trashed they will no longer show up in the assets window but the items will remain there so you can recover acidently trashed items these recycling centers will be emptied every day at downtime
why not another minor change that would be babyeasy to implement and would help ccp and the players alotsigned
ok i think this needed a little more detail as people read this completely wrong initially and maybe i didnt explain myself properlyproposal is to allow key bindings to perform the left mouse button  drag functionality for change the camera view in space basically when your viewing everywhere in space with your mousewhyok this is mainly for pvpers people who do lots of things at the same time lead gangs be involved with roaming gangs large fleet fights etcnow if this is something you get involved with alot you can understand and see the huge benefit this hasat the moment say your in a gang you have lots of targets on screen at the moment you have to use the mouse functionality to look around see whats happening but then say you need to do other stuff at the same time like target or add someone to fleet or broadcast you get what i mean you have to let go of the mouse go do your stuff then you have to go back and move around againin these types of situations its just so cumbersome you need to be on the ball at all timesso my proposal helps that hey i can still look around using my keyboard but also have my mouse hand available to do the 101 things you need to do when in situations like thisi am not asking for any massive dynamics to change no moving around through space no replacement for point and click nothing just ability to move the camera around via keys this is alli hope this explains it better for the people of brain age 3
theres no hotkey to launch drones
i would like to see a new command for drones that would allow a pilot to instruct hisher drones to orbit a target without actually engaging it in combat that would make it quicker to engage in combat if it becomes neccessary it could also be used to trick a pilot into firing on me at an inappropriate timeplace
i r confuzefor some reason i get it but i dontits potentially possible but really what use is it is there a use for this 00 might as well just attack lowsec might as well just attack highsec might as well just attack if not just scare them off
could be useful for dealing with can flippers or other types of games in high secbut if we were to get new drone commands id rather get a launch undamaged drones command
i agree with this there have been a few times ive wanted my drones to go to a certain ship whether to be near an opponent if he makes an aggressive move or to fly toward the enemy thats out of range so theyll be able to attack quicker when he gets in range approach would be a good term but orbit is also acceptablesupported
agreed supported why should that be a command it should be the default behaviour
oh yeahwill support this
or mmaybe to keep drones close to a buddy without engaging any hostiles until you say so if you set them to support theyll engage as soon as something agresses in some cases you might not want thatsupport
hacking is a serious issue my main character has been hacked a few days ago i hear that many other players have been hacked recently toogms ccp looks like having no idea how to deal with it and how to help victims1 what is the policy of ccp on hacking cases2 are security measures implemented at the moment are enoughi call for the active or candidate csm memers to look deeper into this issue outofgame crimes should not ruin ingame experience
i agree with berendas in that it would be another speedbump for new players perhaps this fuel could be limited to battleships and t2 ship im not against this but i would need some more details before i could support this
i know that there exists a way around the limit but its obscure and difficult id rather just see it supported innately
you could get around it by making a fake overview backup that had more tabs programmed but i read somewhere some release notes i think dont know if they were for dominion or apocrypha or some intermediate patch that they fixed or will fix that problem
i propose an addition to the right click menu of any ship in your hangar by adding a ships log for notes to yourself about the particular setup for that ship ie optimal range tactics ammo options for different scenarios or whateverthis ship log will actually travel with the ship so if given to a corp member he can review the notes and fly that ship effectively without too much effortim sure many players would find this useful especially if they can fly many different types of ships and just cant remember the attributes of all the modules and ships
anybody ever find it odd that there is no ccp sponsored killboard they have all the apis why not just use them and have a killboard on this site
thankfully ccp leaves some of the intel gathering up to the players
why should we be thankful for this the result is a multitude of killboards that are grossly biased inaccurate and fail to reflect a players actual killloss history
you stated why this is good your intel is not 100 accuratenot supported
well first of all  ive listened and what your proposing would actually completely change the combat dynamics from skill based to reflex based this is not freelancer or any of those every other games you were mentioning this is eve there are reasons it is the way it isas for more key bindings why so we can have even more macrofarmers no way no support im sorry but you can use both hands to play eve so the value of isk doesnt plummet even further from goldsellers having an easier time programming macros
yeah why dont you take a break from this forum until youve finished training those
i support this locking  unlocking 100s of bpos is a painmaybe the easiest solution is to allow more bpos to be locked in 1 vote for example select all bpos  propose vote  same thing we do now but on all bpos in a single vote
thank you for supporting this but this topic has already been raised and passed the votesee this pagebpo locking changesadding further support is therefore not needed
only if refining arrays would work in highsec
hardly true lowsec is littered with npc stations and most of 00 either has npc stations or minmatar outposts every group of size in kspace can in practice get 100 refines
i know drones are already op as it is especially on many gallente ships but i think that this idea would add quite a bit of diversity into ship fitsi propose a small extra section of the fitting window separate from the large ring sort of a little window at the top with 3 slots in itits basically a separate rig system but specifically targeted on modifying your drone bay two of the same drone bay upgrades can not be fitted at the same timea bar underneath would show how much drone cpu you have left calibrationthere wont be any sizes for these upgrades but instead some of the bonuses will scale with the ship size the upgrades themselves would be listed under ship modifications  drone bay upgrades and would be manufactured using the same salvaged parts that are used to construct the currently available drone rigsnote im not sure on this one detail there are already modules for increasing drone speedcontrol range should they be converted to drone bay upgrades or left as is and no drone bay upgrades should be created to mimic those upgradesnote drone cpu from hereon referred to as dcpu is set at 1000 for most ships 750 for t2 ships 900 for faction ships and certain dronebased ships eg vexor myrmidon dominix arbitratorexamplesname drone bay expander idcpu cost 400bonus increase drone bay capacity frigates 5m3 cruisers 10m3 battlecruisers 20m3 battleships 30m3name scout drone weapon upgrades idcpu cost 300bonus increases the following stats for all scout lightmedium drones damage dealt not modifier by 75 and rof by 75name drone processor upgrade idcpu cost 500bonus increases drone mbs frigates 5mbs cruisers 10mbs battlecruisers 15mbs battleships 20mbsname drone propulsion stabilizers idcpu cost 200bonus increases drone movement and orbit speed 25 for scout drones 35 for heavy dronesname sentry drone internal weapon control cpu idcpu cost 250bonus increases sentry drone tracking 12 and rof 5name drone bay microshield extenders idcpu cost 200bonus increases scout drone shield hp 50 increases heavy drone shield hp 25name drone bay power relaydcpu cost 500bonus decreases drone mbs by frigates 5mbs cruisers 15mbs battlecruisers 30mbs battleship 50mbs in exchange for 10 capacitor recharge ratename armor logistics drone upgradesdcpu cost 250bonus increases amount repaired by all armor maintenance bots by 20name shield logistics drone upgradesdcpu cost 250bonus increases amount boosted by all shield maintenance bots by 20afterthought i know that drones are already very powerful and useful but id like to see more fitting variety and more frigatescruisers using drones thus i propose that all of the bonuses applied directly to drones not sacrificing drone mbs for cap are halved for t2 dronesso what do you guys thinkviable idea subject to changeconstructive criticismhorrible ideaive got my flame shield hardener iii on so go ahead and flame away if you wish
oh my god yes mabey if this is implimented ill be able to finally fit a full set of heavies on my raven damn ccp and their tiny caldari drone bays
not supported we dont need myrms and almost every other ship bigger than a bc fielding 5 ogre ii on ships like the dominix and ishtar this would prove too overpowering
ninja edit the ishtar and domi can already field a full set of heavies for hyperionmega this would only boost their drone bays to about 100 m3 enough for 10 mediums 20 lights or 4 heavies
i dont think you should have a seperate drone cpu if youre going to be able to install drone bay modules i think they should have a fitting cost in terms of normal powergrid and cpu and these costs will be rather hefty while also implementing a rig drawbacki do agree with the idea of giving ships a few extra fitting slots in the spirit of drone bay fitting slots however i do not think that these drone bay fitting slots should be limited to drone bays but could be extended to every specialised bay like your ammo bay fuel bay cargohold etc
another different fitting limit and another weird set of restrictions on what can go where is not the right approach here this change is better performed with traditional modules using traditional pgcpu than with your new dcpu modules
jita local chat is completely out of control the isk spammers have been pulling out all the stops and flooding that systems local chat with advertisements for their illgotten goods like theres no tomorrow which i really hope is the case once the right click to report spammers option hitswith that in mind i propose ccp implement any of the following measures as a stopgap until dominion and the above mentioned feature goes livea mute jita local chat entirelyb switch jita local to moderated mode and appoint veteran members of the player community as temporary moderatorsc same as above except just appoint veteran players as temporary moderators of jita locald station a developer isd member gm or some other representative of ccp in jita permanently to be able to ban the spammers on sighte implement the right click to report feature early through use of an emergency patchf prevent any character on an account that is not more than 25 days old from speaking in jita local chatg strip trial accounts of the ability to speak in local if the number of players in system exceeds a certain threshold say 50h impose a two post per minute limit on local chat make it so that the excess posts just vanish but are seen locally so that the spammers still think theyre flooding the channel but really arenti temporarily expand the gm ranks with members whos only duty is to respond to and watch for isk spammers in jita and other trade hubsj start paying an isk bounty claimable only by players on accounts greater than 30 days old to the first person to report a new isk spammer make it a trivial yet somewhat meaningful amount like 500k isk in order to combat the player apathy because of how annoying it is to report through the current systemk release an emergency patch that allows players to ignore chat invites mail and anything else coming from characters less than 5 days old unless that character has been placed on a whitelist for instance if you invite a friend to try eve before dominion is releasedl freeze the creation of new characters until dominion is releasedm moderate the creation of new characters until dominion hits make it so that a gm has to at least glance over a list of names and approve them before they can actually be logged on ton try aggressive takedown tactics such as those used by the mpaa and riaa to get the advertised isk spammer sites knocked offline put those tactics to good use for a changeo if ccp has another operation in the works like operation unholy rage unleash it for gods sakes so those damned spammers shut upanything else would probably do but at this point its important that ccp just do something
silly arbitrary limit
how about 249kmthought it was the kind of obvious one see as far as you targetfake edit silly 256 bit overflow limit 257 is for kids
thank you 
im not protective of him as a person im protective of the ideal that is take care and the potential that the csm holds for eve as a game and for the gaming industry as a whole
zod i used the csm vote match and our opinions match 67 plus we agree on many key issues and thus ive decided to throw the weight of my 2 accounts behind you best of luck and hope you deliver
j ai voter bonne chance a toi
1 for mez0d is the guy you would like to play with always ready to give help support and aswersvote zod 
perhaps it would be possible to reduce the number of ecm ships spawning in plexes however often times when someone has complained to me personally about being permajammed is when a gallente has been in the plex and is chased offas we know this triggers full npc spawn now situation is perhaps that a cruiser sits alone in a plex when hostile battlecruiser comes along and looks for easy kill however now with full spawn inside its pretty likely he will be jammed the moment he enters and then we get lolmails like executioner killing an abaddonof course sometimes ive had to credit people like val erian for essentially saving my life in this way such as when i killed two pirate battlecruisers with a caracalthat aside im ready to agree that caldari npc ecm could be toned down amarrgallente npcs need boosting somewhat to remove their current weakness which is speed tanking t1 frigate capturing an offensive plex after all even caldari npcs can be kite tanked and i know gallentes do itdamar rocarionbrigadier generalps im also still waiting for ankh to actually prove any of his accusations about bugging timers and flying cloakedstabbed ships so far she has only proved that she herself flew such things
i would not vote for you because of the lack of experience in pos warfare and sov mechanics while the fw stance is appreciated it isnt the entire game a wider scope of experience is something i feel a csm should strive forgood luck in the polls damar
too bad it has already been proven many times over and everyone can look for the proof themselveswhat damar his corpmates and his alts have done is use a cloaked ship in combination with warping out  logging off to keep the timer running while moving on to the next plex i worked closely with ccp to get this exploit fixed and ccp is aware of the caldari having used this exploit to their advantagethere still is another exploit going on which involves running timers without being present this exploit has been used by the caldari to capture all gallente plexes while keeping their own decontested and is still being used to prevent the gallente from capturing any systems back after the timer has run down in its exploited state the plex itself becomes bugged and will not respawn until downtime which is why the gallente could never find plexes in systems they wished to contestdecontest and why the caldari won by focussing on afterdt plexes almost exclusivelyunfortunately despite erik finnegan and my efforts to inform ccp of the situation they are still not dedicating much time to fixing fw issues and this exploit is recently also used being on the minmataramarr front causing a great deal of frustrationinitially i was against resetting the fw front on the gallentecaldari side but seeing that the caldari won solely due to exploits npc and reward imbalances i think even fw expert damar would agree that the current situation is unacceptable and has to be reset after everything gets fixed and those responsible are banned do you not
despite all the foaming about personal agenda the biggest personal agenda im seeing here is ankhs who clearly hates damar and is doing everything in his power to derail the campaign train
i am doing what is best for eve as a wholeand im not the one running for csm nor the one posting with a bunch of nameless altsi dont need to derail his campaign train though as that is already a wreck and damar doesnt have a chance in hell to win a seat in the csm he has an unlikeable personality and is despised even by the majority of the caldari militia due to his obvious personal agenda and constant emo raging
posts like these just proves that you have no idea what is happening in fw
i too am in love with damar and will vote srspoast voting for damar i trust that he will try his very best to make fw betteroh and thanks for making eve better didnt you take credit for fw missions ankh turning fw to huge carebear fest
1 damar
i must say im impressed that if a person i regularly get into arguments votes for me i really appreciate it really dodamar rocarionbrigadier general
you get into arguments with everyone so thats not very surprising
one more day to vote good luck aleks
haharoma weak what a load of crapempright on brother
bump  elf got my vote
one day of voting left good luck teadaze
you are a goon  so you wont be getting my vote i do like your attitude your approach and your experience but my own experience with goonswarm members has shown me that they as a collective which you are a member of are not to be trusted that unfortunately tars you with the same brushsorry but we can only judge you by the company that you keep
ive voted for you after doing quite a bit of research on your stances and attitude compared to others you have a matured sense of handling yourself when confronted against a lot of unpopular posts and that is something i greatly admire after reviewing your topics and ideas i have to say im very excited to see what you have to offer us and how far you are able to take your ideas as for goonswarm tagswhile goonswarm is something most people may look at with distrust i feel that i know better i remember moo long ago and how their shady tactics helped form a large portion of the games security features for gates concord and sentry guns goonswarm in my eyes is something rather similar while not all of the tactics are community approved and i dont feel they should bethis is eve not church they are still valid tactics that lead to how people view and play the game i could not in good conscious hold it against yougood luckjudge not the diamond amongst the rough for however harsh the landscape and sands around it the diamond still glitters
its your choice obviously but id hope that you can see the difference between the actions of goon members ingame on forums etc and goons on the csm check out bagehis post for examplesif your only criteria is that the candidate is a member of an alliance that you like then good luck with getting useful things done in the csm
its not so much based on whether i like an alliance or a corp that dictated my vote it was more down to who i see as being a good representative of the player community and to someone who i felt that i could trustmy vote eventually went to someone who my own corpalliance has warred with a few times  and with whom there is very little love lost but in my dealings with them and those who i fly with in the main agree we respect them for their gamemanship and their treatment of fellow playersthat is something that i see sadly lacking in gs whether its ingame on the forums on fansites etc i have yet to see any gs member act with anything approaching gamemanship for yourself i have never met nor have i flown against you you seem like a decent person but to myself that is unfortunately only part of the equation however i have flown against other gs members  a couple who have beenstill are csms and to be perfectly frank the experience left me with a very bitter taste so much so that till now i have barely even bothered with the whole concept of the csmso back to my point i do not consider that a gs member can  based on their actions both in and out of the game  be suitable representatives for what is essentially a community based group within the eveo player base your alliances gameplay is essentially anathema to the whole idea of the csm
does it or does the prescence of the rough around it simply make it appear to glitter in comparisonagain i agree with helen highwaters views and was the most logical person to vote for according to the csm vote match however keeping company with goonswarm places you in a position to be easily influenced by them so i wont be votingive never met you ingame or had any contact with you whatsoever just as many of your prospective voters havent so under those circumstances your corporation and alliance are major factors in deciding wether to vote for yougood luck with your campaign helen highwater
ive seen that a lot in this thread its a shame that people can agree with so much of her ideas attitude and plans and then dismiss them completely because of her association with friends i think its one of the most irrational things you can do during an election the right person for the job is the right person for the job regardless of who they may drink at the pub with so long as they dont let the friends impact how they work their job theres no harm done
and how do you guarantee that this will be the case
i couldnt guarantee it for her nor for any other csm candidate if you want to ask for a guarantee from her its only fair to consider same for the other csm candidates all of them have the possibility to be corrupted or be of strong enough individual character to be incorruptible i trust her as an individual and i trust goons ability in community management how they handle their ingame fun is very different from how they handle events that they know is important and gamechanging dont forget that goons helped lay the groundwork for the alliance mechanicill restate again to clarify the importance of it if you want to ask for a guarantee from her its only fair to consider same for the other csm candidates all of them have the possibility to be corrupted or be of strong enough individual character to be incorruptible
im aware nobody is above corruption but there are those that are in a position to be influenced more also you are right i would also expect the same from other candidatesas i already stated i do not know her so this is irrelevant to me and anyone else voting who also doesnt know herthey were also instrumental in the disbanding of there rival alliance in a dramatic showing of lack of sportsmanship
then it isnt an issue of trust you have its that you dislike how her friends fly and how they enjoy their 15 a proper example would be i wouldnt refuse to vote for someone i completely agreed with just because they were part of a wellknown mining corporationbut now that i know it isnt trust but disagreement in play style theres little else to argue cheers
no its not i never said it was you are right i disagree with the playstyle of goonswarm and am not eager to vote for one of them to hold any kind of peer position its simply a shame because the gs ticker is in this case they only thing preventing me voting for this candidatethanks for the debate though
dont blame the origin of a candidate alliancecorppvepvp the real things who count are 1her programm2if you trust herand if the goon are not well viewed people they are also players not totally formated by one thinkthe object of a csm candidate isnt in what world they live but in what world they want to live
this
or get votes from precommitted voting blocks that we dont even know about thats politics too i guessgood idea about the random reshuffle
thanks looking forward to it 
not having closely followed the current csm campaigns i feel a bit overwhelmed by the sheer mass of candidates that have turned out usually the girld get my vote out of principle but the only one in election is running on a bit too narrow a platform im afraidi tried the vote match but the results were not conclusive so i came up with this hopefully provocative list of statements about the game and would like candidates to quickly express their stance aye or nay as well as how strongly they would fight for or against it 0  unimportant detail wouldnt lift a finger for it 9  my holy grail would selfdestruct in a lowgrade clone for my beliefshere goescsm terms should be extended to one year election for half its members every 6 months to increase continuity and competenceplaying solo should be a viable and interesting playstyle in all trades and places nore challenging but not impossibleto avoid blob warfare and more generally swarming strength in numbers should be balanced by some penalty such as friendly fire obstruction or some sort of negative mass effectships as players main visual representation ingame should allow for some degree of individual customization such as corp and alliance logos and a set of colour schemesthe announced mining overhaul should not just increase variety and tactical depth of mining but add some optional relaxed but challanging afkunfriendly interaction to significantly increase yields or qualitymissions should be less static by limiting agent quality and mission availability the more an agent is perused and vice versaplayer actions should always have consequences extreme player actions mass murder treason warfare outlawry should have lasting if not permanent consequences redemption should always come at a far greater cost than the possible gain from the deedpve should be more surprising by introducing random events that spawn inspace limiteduse mission agents as well as through unpredictable turns of events and forks within missions making missions hardly ever twice the sameenviroments need some life the regionsconstellationssystems and of course the stunning new planets could do with some interesting backgrounds random individuality and even some proper economic properties tied to the local npc marketwarp to zero should be replaced with skill and modulebased warp precision to reduce random deviation in direction and distance as well as some sort of countermeasure to increase the time to gank themallow corporations and alliances to wardec npc empires with serious consequences  sieging rookie systems should still be extremely difficult and met with quickly rising npc resistanceships crews and fuels would introduce further depth to ship management a strong incentive to keep your ship alive as well as a serious isk sinkship insurance should adapt cost and payout to a pilots sec status and historynpc corps should be joinable at great standings for individual perks exclusive missions and rewards and serious disadvantages 50 taxes standings hits towards their enemiesthats it answer some or all btw dont count on me agreeing on all of them  some may be trick questions to spot a silvertongued deceiver 
 csm terms should be extended to one year election for half its members every 6 months to increase continuity and competenceno often a bunch of slacking csm are already worn down after 4 months in office and motivation drops to a low i rather see a fresh bunch of csm voted in that will offer new issues and new perspectives however excsm should somehow be kept in the loop by ccp on a nonofficial status as for continuity thats what take care is all about ankhesentapemkah erik finnegan and now me all benefitting from the prior csm experience playing solo should be a viable and interesting playstyle in all trades and places nore challenging but not impossibleyes and the same goes for having only one account i have a lot of accounts myself for trade and industry but i hate that players are encouraged to metagame by using alts for almost everything to avoid blob warfare and more generally swarming strength in numbers should be balanced by some penalty such as friendly fire obstruction or some sort of negative mass effectno as annoying as the blob is there should not be stacking penaltylike mechanics i rather see the higherlevel game mechanics change so there are objectives that encourage players to move in smaller faster fleets ships as players main visual representation ingame should allow for some degree of individual customization such as corp and alliance logos and a set of colour schemesthere are so many mmos that already have deep character customization i dont see why we cant have the same in eve ankh already found that the variations of ships are basically paint jobs already as they use the same texture and material just have a few color settings adjusted why cant players do the same its not like it will cause lag especially not if players have the option to turn it off she tried to raise this as an issue but it was voted down by the rest of the csm the announced mining overhaul should not just increase variety and tactical depth of mining but add some optional relaxed but challanging afkunfriendly interaction to significantly increase yields or qualityas long as this mining minigame is not extremely repetetive stressful or boring im all for it afkmining should be viable but there should be a mechanic that allows players to perform regular interaction during mining missions should be less static by limiting agent quality and mission availability the more an agent is perused and vice versayes but keep in mind that a lot of npc corps only have a handful of l4 combat agents i do support the idea of mission runners moving around to discover better agents instead of camping the same hub for months player actions should always have consequences extreme player actions mass murder treason warfare outlawry should have lasting if not permanent consequences redemption should always come at a far greater cost than the possible gain from the deedim not in favor of permanent consequence that completely trashes ones character unless there is an alternative which allows the player to sustain himself through other means for example pirate factions i agree that the consequence to actions is currently far too low pve should be more surprising by introducing random events that spawn inspace limiteduse mission agents as well as through unpredictable turns of events and forks within missions making missions hardly ever twice the sameyes already pushed strongly by take care in the past
 enviroments need some life the regionsconstellationssystems and of course the stunning new planets could do with some interesting backgrounds random individuality and even some proper economic properties tied to the local npc marketwhile i dont like dust i do hope that ccp starts developing things you mention as part of this system warp to zero should be replaced with skill and modulebased warp precision to reduce random deviation in direction and distance as well as some sort of countermeasure to increase the time to gank themthis can work out in different ways i dont know about this allow corporations and alliances to wardec npc empires with serious consequences  sieging rookie systems should still be extremely difficult and met with quickly rising npc resistanceno fw already showed that the players always find a way around the npc defenses to get easy ganks and griefing i rather see that criminals get booted from npc corps into a wardeccable pirate corp ships crews and fuels would introduce further depth to ship management a strong incentive to keep your ship alive as well as a serious isk sinkship crews has already been raised by take care ship insurance should adapt cost and payout to a pilots sec status and historymaybe but at the moment i would like to start by removing insurace from concord kills npc corps should be joinable at great standings for individual perks exclusive missions and rewards and serious disadvantages 50 taxes standings hits towards their enemiesnpc corps used to be joinable in the past i dont understand why this was removed there is no harm by allowing this again the exclusive things you mention are already in place for factional warfare and could be adapted for npc corps in a modified ways

hi i am a concerned votersince i started playing this game in early 2006 ive seen ccp make the game worse patch after patch probably because ccp is the government and the government cant do anything right now that eve has democracy i intend to exercise my sacred right to vote i cant say ive been happy with my past csm representatives i voted for larkonis in the last election not really knowing what he stood for fraud corruption and getting kicked off the council and it is apparent he didnt bring up the issues i voiced to him several times during his run for csm  a reverse on the nos speed and damp nerf i would like to vote for a csm thats not completely crap at this game and realizes that nerfing everything that carebears complain about as op only serves to dumb the game down and make it more boring for the rest of us is there such a candidate out there for me
i had to chuckle when i saw your alliance tag but have a look at my thread link in sig i might be what youre looking for i have a great deal of pvp experience and i know exactly what you mean by carebear op nerfs and i am as much against them as possible
i wont vote for anyone from tri on principle until you return hydra homeland to us lying politician
oh boohoo you say you want to vote for a propvp person then whine that you got outpvpd its not his fault hydra was incapable of working together enough to hold their space
im sorry we kicked you out 
quoting stupidity
please visit your user settings to reenable images
while i certainly support the htfu line and i recon i aint completely crap at this game i am not your candidate for the simple reason that i do not agree that ccp has been consistently making the game worse not by a long shot
what the hell is htfu
youre right we do disagree i really fail to understand how allowing players to fix the obvious mistakes that ccp wont qualifies as an unfair advantage especially given that every other game with mods has like 90 of those mods being built for public use that said ccp has already said it wont happen so this is all a moot point
dierda vall thank you very much for the csm vote match i thoroughly appreciate your effort i was quite overwhelmed by all the candidates and this helped me greatly in making up my mindbest wishes and regards
good job it confirmed the candidate that i was going to vote for from reading their bio
dont foget there is only 1 day left to vote voting for the council of stellar management is now onlinemake your voice heard
or the people that they associate with
i cant say i like goons as a whole but give the guy a chance if it ends up as bad as you think he will just be voted out every time
i had a widow at one point and sold it just about as fast as bought it heres why for a t2 battleship it doesnt even stack up next to its little brother the scorpion a scorpoin has greater power grid 9000 to 8800 higher structure hitpoints 5469 to 4375 higher armor hitpoints 5469 to 4375 higher shield capacity 6641 to 5312 greater maximum targeting range 90000m to 72000m and one more rig slot 3 to 2the widow has the edge in cpu 760tf to 750tf high slots 7 to 6 launcher hardpoints 5 ot 4 cargo capacity 650 to 550 plus a 10 bump on thermal resists only for armor and shield i wanted to like this ship to me a black ops ship should strike fear in your heart unfortunately this ship doesnt do that its grossly over priced and extremely underwhelming in terms of hit points and resists i fully support asking ccp to look at this ship and all the other black ops ships and giving them a healthy dose of lovinahs
ccp do something with fonts its really hard to see anything in high res1920x1200 is really painfull for eyes 
with all the issues regarding gameplay forming a proactive and empowering community to eve online this font issue  no matter how many times it has been brought up over a lengthy period of time  is perhaps the most crucial ccp is going to face in any foreseeable futurehell let players tweak the font system in the sisi client and provide you with a plethora of suggestions that you can choose from i promise eve a load of publicity in the acdemic and professional service design publications for such a prosumerismprodusageoriented approach towards typology as well as visual and usability designapart from not losing customers because youd make the game better and less hurting for the eyes you might gain some lost customers back if you again send those 5d free game time invites to unsubscribed customers and tell them that this issue has been fixed or at least changed with the aim of fixing itthe fontreadability issue is not one that requires work without generating revenue  in fact i dare say it is quite the contrarythank you for making this change yesterdayb

would be great if you could also choose lock period at willfor example if you are certain that you will not be selling this character under no circumsances then you could put like 12 monhts lock however if you just want some minor protection then only put a weekwell it doesnt have to be a lock but some additional layer of protectin like an additional password maybe which should be stored somehwere safelly and be different from main password or some other means of verification

signedas someone who has also had their account hacked in the past i can fully understand the need for personal securityhaving such tools in place could ony prevent grief
well this will get getting into lotteries much easier  d it would be soo cool since now you dont need to broswe teh forums for it
supporting the discussion and to some extent the op proposal heres another take on the issue at handas bookmarks are merely location parameters on the x y and z axii and these parameters are visible ingame at least when making a bm based on ones own location i am surprised to notice that i have never tried toa create a safe spot by altering the parameters of my current position to random valuesb tried to share a bm by sending outreceiving the xy and z axis valuesin other words i dunno and am too lazy to log in now to check if the parameters can be altered according to wish when creating a bm in spacenot being able to change the parameters of a bookmark would mean that it is utterly irritating to see those parameters in the first place being able to change them would mean that sharing bookmarks and creating safespots the traditional way is utterly stupid and a waste of time hence a workaround for the time wasted in opening cans full of bms would be to send the axis values of the desired position to corpies allies friends or whomever via evemailmakes safe spots easier to make but makes sense as in what the computer of my ship would be able to do anywayb
excellent idea
if i understand you correctly then those are good ideas let me see if i can flesh it out a bit4 the following options should be included for consideration by ccphide highsec  this option when active will cause all highsec systems to disappear from the map you dont even see the dots floating in space on the maphide lowsec  same as above except for lowsechide nullsec  same as above except for nullsechide avoidance  same as above except for systems constellations or regions you have set on your avoidance listhide other regions not on route  this option when active hides all solar systems that belong to another region unless they are part of the route set by your autopilothide other constellations not on route  this option when active hides all solar systems that belong to another constellation unless they are part of the route set by your autopilothide systems not controlled by  this should have some sort of dropdown menu like with the existing sovereignty menu in the control panel that shows a list of all factions and alliances that hold sovereignty any alliance and any faction should also be optionsthe next three are my own idea as long as were on the subject of hiding solar system dots these ideas go towards helping understand the large closed loops in stargate connectivity hide deadend systems  this option when active hides all solar systems that connect to one and only one other solar system that is they have only one stargate for example the fora system would be hidden because its only connected to ebahide deadend constellations  this option when active hides all constellations that connect to one and only one other constellation for example the mobrault constellation would be hidden because it only connects to the braille constellation the elerelle constellation however would still be shown because it connects to braille in the same region and to the 59hog and anama constellations in other regionshide branches  this option when active hides all systems that cannot plot at least two different and nonoverlapping routes to some central reference point ill say make yulai the reference point since thats where the concord assembly is headquartered but the reference point could just as easily be arnon dodixie rens amarr or jita for example all systems in belt velvet and sole constellations would be hidden because any route to the reference point must go through the bfsdp system so two or more such routes must necessarily overlap at bfsdpgiven the phrasing of the above options a solar system should be hidden if any one of the activated options applythere should be one last option to show or hide connection lines where only one end of the line is hidden thus the player can see that a connection exists to a system the player has chosen to hide
insurance reform yesone thing im seeing a lot of though is people tossing around words like average and meanlets be very very clear on which one were discussing because they arent the same thing
mean modal median yeah yeah if you dont want to use the mean mineral sale price then explain why you think the modal or median would be better
im a computer programmer not a statistician im not endorsing using one over the other im just saying lets be sure were all talking about using the same one ill leave the determination of which one up to the the people with a deeper understanding of the numbers
sandbox ffsthis is all farfetched but as op stated longer term we need a better system playerrun insurance companies will hit the eve universe at some point probably not in years and i do hope this game beyond gaming known as eve will continue to exist for as long as i am able to type din other words getting completely rid of the existing insurance mechanics would not mean the end of insurances ingameplayerrun insurance companies could use api data for risk assessment to decide on the price and payout as well as regulations and limitations of an insurance deal id like to be able to insure modules too but that would require a load of coding to distinguish between similar modules but im confident that we will see this feature in eve at some far away date breaking down moduls by overheating might make the insurance company give out nanite repair paste as gratuity gifts ships should have mainenance logs pretty much in the same vein as kill mails to see by whom and how much damage has been dealt to a specific ship even when it is not completely destroyed and how much has been paid to repair the said damage all this information would affect the prioce and legth of the next insurance deal with the pilot and especially regarding the same boatminers would get better deals if they stay in hisec or have significant overwatch in low sec low sec mining is stupid anyway or 00 related kills in killboards could provide a platform for the insurance companies to verify this even tho they do not function sufficiently for any insurance company use atm failure to meet the requirements of the insurance deal would void the responsibility of the company for the payout ofcinsuance is cheaper if the customer gives the insurance company the right to sell insurance and fitting data to third parties derived of repair logs that may or may not exist nowadays pilots could try to doubleinsure their vessel using more than one company but the insuring sides should take this into conideration in the deals and consult each other to ensure exploitation of their services etc etc etcreliability problems and trust issues as exemplified in the recent banking scamdal sic would of course exist but they exist in the real world too however the exploitation of trust has less dire impacts on the scammed and provide less revenue for the scammer than similar exploits of trust in rl so i wouldnt be too worried about any large scale issues arising tho exceptions might have devastating effects on individual pilots ingame early implementation of such a playerrun system would be a pain with scammers and actual verification problems of all sorts blurring the situation but i am confident that in the log run playerrun insurance companies would providea the insurance services neededb a nice platform to learn insurance mathematics and risk assessmentc more widespread playerrun banking and financial services incl real stock markets with corporate annual reports and alli dunno if such development is positive but it sure is in line with the sandbox approach  and as i think i stated in some post last night tho with different wordings why should we be content with a sandbox when we could have the whole effing saharasupporting the op as some sort of a start but more in support of discussion around the issue as well as the sandboxesque development possibilities as regards insurancesb
yes it really is now dont get me wrong there was pretty much nothing in your post i didnt like but what youre talking about would suck up huge development resources and ad a vast amount of complexity in essense what youre describing would require a true secondary market sophisticated financial tools etc essentially a wholesale reform and upgrade of the economic basis of the gamei was thinking of something rather less ambitious although still very economically significant an end to the outright equation between insurance value and mineralship prices
indeed i agree with you but like i stated in my support post i believe this should only be a first step in completely removing npc insurance what beau is talking about is the next steps i agree lets get a quick fix for now but that wont make the problem go awaya long term solution wont be quick to implement but the things that beau mentioned are things that industrialists and tycoons have been wanting for a long time now if that could be combined with fixing insurance then its killing two frogs with one stonelike i said im supporting this idea as a quick fix awaiting a more permanent solution after all just removing insurance would be a bit harsh

damn fw missions are the least of 3 exploited and unbalanced isk faucetslvl4s in highsec moongold in that orderi wholeheartedly support more players finding it easier to pvp however there is no way to track your enemies efficientlythere are no bountyhead agents who send mails automatically about multiple players so you can create a profile on your prey whether they be wanted hostile wartargets or militiamenor they could reduce the turndown rate 30mins and the standings loss to like 2 with all agentsthat could be tweaked over a month at a time but that would require a 6minth delay per changebeing able to choose target system and objective would equal avoiding pvp at all coststhe current flexibility is already being abused from what ive heard and this will not become guild wars aka single player in instance with ai buddies online although they do do that pretty damn welluntil i hear of the aforementioned feature i vote nay tough luck
actually id rather see someone posting because they are driven by personal interests rather than a troll such as your self that has absolutely nothing constructive to say on this topicwhich means arguing you is pointless because you have no point you are just a bitter troll because someone else has something you dont have now for the more reasonable here a few things you guys might not be aware of and another reason why fw mission should have higher rewards that they do 1 fw mission isk pay outs is very low for level 4 missions that means we get no real instant isk reward maybe 2 to 3 million and the npcs have no bounties that means we have to buy items with out lps and wait for them to sell 2 we dont have the opportunity to loot and salvage the missions like you do in high sec that means for the most part the lps are our only pay 3 despite what people say they do have a lot of risk and not everyone runs them in stealth bombers you have to constantly dodge wart targets and pirates and both can hold up your missions or make you have to quit it if they decide to camp you mission systems id say overall from what ive seen the bulk of the players do these as intended and arent farming on a massive scale as many here love to claim and whine about i do agree the lp rewardsnpcs need to be adjusted and evened out among the various races but i think taking away the ability to pick the area you run the mission in will kill them for the guys running them just to support their pvp yet it will fail to affect the groups that are already farming them due to the fact they will still be able to run around in gangs and complete what ever they getccp think about this before you do it because you are going to ruin a valid income source for many of us and do nothing to stop the abusers

for clarity lets gather some factslvl4 mission generate instant isk as rewardlvl4 mission generate lp as rewardlvl4 mission generate instant isk with npcs bountieslvl4 mission are done in highseclvl4 mission if somebody shootssteals you
current status of fw missions is untenable insane rewards for no risk and penalties  might as well introduce a save game or print isk function what i would like to see in regards to fw missions ability to select target system from a listing of five to eight possible locations per agent no more single decline crap shuffled at dt standings loss on failure see below system vp awarded for missions to specific locations shuffled weekly and advertised on opposing sides militia board our informant tells us the tlf is focusing on 123 this week rewards balanced out or missions tweaked to prevent the lone bomber from doing them if mission objective is killeddestroyed by anyone but your own militia the mission fails remove standing hits for objectivesbasically make missions have an impact on the war as a whole and use them to encourage pvp by requiring the missioneers to defend them to avoid standing hitsit is the militia high command that is sending us on these things yet they have no effect the whole damn fw system needs to change i would prefer a removal of all the broken things until they can be sorted but fear i am the only one 
i would bring this up if i could  however csm3 is finishedcan the fw system be improved yes definately perhaps pilots should be able to select the constellation they want their mission in or even the system perhaps only contested systems are applicable for this i dont know but there is a lot of room to improve the strategic element of fw missionsis making the fw missions undeclineable change the existing mechanic a solution no the isk generated by these missions does not compare to the isk generated by regular level 4s they pose no real danger to the eve economy so until ccp can implement a proper mechanic please do not touch this one
fw missions do generate isk also npcs drop tags for which there are npc buyorders guess where that isk comes fromif you were intended to be able to pick up what mission and where you want surely there would be a some sort of drop down menuanyways hoping for a nerf here if not only for your bitter tearsps ive done hundreds of fw missions and never lost a shipwhen doing missions could you point me to the risk part ive had some opportunity kills inside the missions toodone correctly there is practically no risk in fw missionshow many ships have you lost doing missions
every 10k lp translates into a faction frigate currently selling for as much as 45m  that is up to 90m isk per lvl4 fw mission in lp alone  and it is done at zero riskpenalty in less than 5 minutes i would love to know what regular lvl4 agent you use if you can match that it is very much broken missions are too easy penalty nonexistent and highly farmable all things that are bad for any gamei would rather the next csm make ccp engage in a brainstorming session to improve not only fw but lowsec in general ie pirates some anyway  are people too high and nullsec have been getting hand and foot the last several patches and all lowsec has received is a scaling of sec hit according to system security 
mal is insisting on continuing the job despite the train car full of alliance soldiers mal hell this job i would pull for free zoe then can i have your share mal no zoe if you die can i have your share mal yes so im pretty much willing to do these missions for free only if i can pick my target system that makes me  kinda stupid but i would be happywould that make you happyim must be doing something horribly wrong doctormaybe though i just suck at the game but again willing to do these apparent no risk missions for no reward if i can pick my target systemand on another note actually if ccp only introduces the standing hit by declining feature without reducing the rewards as well i would be better off than what i proposed because my lp income would not change i just would have to fly to random systems rather than dedicatedthe only feature i want to keep out of the game is the randomness of the target system i have to fly toso where am i whoring lps and crying about my income
i do not care about choosing mission system i can even live without choosing mission type but there is one thing that will effectively kill fw mission expiration time 12 hours for doing a mission which may happen in a system full of enemies that do bust it often is too short right now you can just ignore it and go to sleep after the change failing to do 5 missions will kill your standing very swiftlythere are two simple solutions to that  no penalty for mission expiration as opposed to cancelling it extending expiration time like for normal missions at least a few daysps firetails sell for 31m not 45 atm and the price is falling constantly in the last months
so the market adjust and soon it will be not profitable anymore for farmers to farm missions for lp and those that remain can keep playing the game as intendedand that even already without an change to missonswaves hand this is not the financiel isk crisis you are looking for you as general you not directed toward you faelwenn
fw doesnt need missions they dont add anything to fw
it wouldnt matter if you could endlessly turn down fw missions if mission mechanics were working as they do for lvl 4 hisec missionsin lvl 4s the mission rewards are based on complexity of the mission in effect the quickest easiest missions pay the least its why materials for war has such a low completion timer about 12 mins last i saw and relatively crap payout other then the nice implant which is a static bonus for that missionwhat im saying is this if everyone who does fw missions always choose the same shoot this one guy and then warpout mission then the rewards should self lower as they do for lvl 4 missionsfairly soon your favorite 5 min to finish mission will be worth maybe 300500 lp that is comparable to similar timed lvl 4 missionsright now fw missions are broken you can make 200 mill per hour by choosing the easiest mission over and over again
why not 500 where do you get your numbers i invite you to join fw yourself and do some missions surely for 200 per hour its worth your time do them for some days sell the stuff on contracts and after that check exactly how much per hour you made adding all the time to fly and collectalso your theory is flawed in assuming empire mission payment  agent reward the most money comes from loot bounty and salvage and they do not change so a mission is not getting worse as it is blitzed where fw missions do  all the easy ones give much less lp than the hard ones
500m iskhour only  nah it is much more  you can do those missions in 1 min and gives 10k lp each  600k lphour  so with 4 accs running it is 24m lphour if we calculate with 1 lp 2000isk then we get the final 5bill iskhour now that is what i earn by runnin fw mission usuallyat least according to future mutant and similarly talented high sec dwellersimho the real income is around 5060mhour which is in acceptable range compared to high sec lvl4 40mhour with much less risk involved2nd the money come from the lp not the lootbounties  first you have to change it into fw items then sell them on contracts then if more ppl doing fw missions lp value will go down due to competition on contracts currently i cant see any competition at all or very fewfor matar fw items  that shows me the current fw mission system is just fine at least for matariany change would make it worthless  and ppl will go back to doing braindead lvl4s in high secthe only change could be that  you cant do more than x number missionsdayagent that way the fw missioning would be limited if somebody still has more time to spend he can do regular missions or go pvp i see no reason to nerf something because some ppl can play 20hoursday and earn so much that makes others jelaousanyway if somebody thinks fw missions is so awesome then join millitia and do it youself too it is not like you will be denied from joining
as proposal i would support thatand yes fw does not need missions but right now plexes dont give any real reward apart from standing but fw missions have been adding some flavour and reward to that part of the gamewe dont need mining in the game we just could buy the ore from npcs but it adds flavour for some mining is boring for some it is not being able to pick missions in a target systemconstellation i can have my fleet get some lps while doing plexes and do mission in the same system while focussing on a target constellation to gain occupancy it rewards my fleetcorp members with the few and according to the reports compareable low shared lp reward for their time doing the plexes because of the missionsagain good proposal i would support that but the current changes with the standing loss on decliningincompleting a mission does hurt while a simple lowering of the reward would not destroy the gameplay but at the same time will introduce balance
this is a great way to do it as it will finally give people a reward for plexingplexes are great as they can restrict the size of the ship going in thus giving newer players a more even battlefeild as opposed to a guy in a rifte being ganked by a harbingerplexes should be the focal point of fw with all pvp happening in and oround plexes make them worth going into and this will happen
being ganked by a harbinger sparks the f i need to get out fast response from newer players whereas being ganked by another rifter does not even though epic failures of more experienced pilots do exist and i include myself in that group the odds of the newer player surviving the fight are just as nominal against the other rifter as they are against the harbingersorry to spoil your enthusiasm
i agree with you beau but for a new player the psychological difference in encountering somebody in a rifter vs encountering somebody in a harbringer makes the difference between staying and fighting or running away it might be the same bad decision but he will try to fightin addition not all new players check the age of the character before they engage to estimate the potentail skillpoint difference between them and the target
it is not wise in the long run to encourage new players to fail in pvp combat running away is a real pvp option  if it enrages the opponent into uncontrollable smack about how wimpy or unpvpish running away is the retreating party has most definitely won the player vs player confrontation it is the psychological reaction that takes place after the situation that counts not the one prior to it  at least as far as encouraging pvp is concerned the aggressor should know that if heshe tries to gank a rifter in a harbi the opponent is likely to flee if they dont have support nearby and pointscram fitted
i know but thats not currently not in the focus of what i want from this proposali dont mind ccp lowering the reward for fw mission they even might drop the reward to less than a 100lp for a lvl4 mission if they think that is reasonablewhat is bothering me is that i would like to determine the target system that my mission is located innot to have easy pvp or to avoid it at all but to determine a player created objective rather than the randomness of the current mission generatorbeing able to decline missions without a standingloss was allowing that to me and that is all what i wanted to keep in the game

you have my vote and my axe
there are approximately eight billion problems in eve more pressing than afk mining in haulers and if you dont support battleship mining i suggest you talk with some 2003era miners theyll set you straight no a game can see if im providing input to it or not i have two monitors and a dvd player on my computer please tell me how the game can tell the difference between me sitting at my computer watching a movie checking the eve client once a minute but not doing anything and me being afk and this is why people mine in groups yes its a multiplayer game  you should get bonuses from playing with other people failing that cargo fit on a hulk is about 18km3 and its even more secure than a secure can because you want to fit a tank and an afterburneroh agreed  nullsec income levels need work but the problem is not measured in morphitehour
as much as i also dislike seeing mining haulers forcing this kind of restriction is unfair toward other ship classes that have proven themselves to be efficient miners mining battleships may not be as popular as they once were but some players still mine in apocsrokhs simply because they dont want to skill for bargeswhilst i agree that gscs could use a buff  since once you start mining in a barge you end up filling them in about one cycle  i would disagree with your solution because you can already mine into a jetcan it might not be as safe as mining into a gsc but its a relativly good trade off between risk and efficiencyyou could always mine into an altagreed to some extent i believe it should be possible for a well organised group to gank hulks in highsec because you shouldnt be totally safe anyway as following with the mantra of eve but due to the increase in popularity of hulk ganking i think this could be looked intoyou can fit a pretty hefty tank on a hulk but i doubt its enough to hold until concord arrivesagreed as amusing a passtime as bumping afk haulers isi believe this has been the issue of much debate on the forums there have been some pretty good threads about it try searching for them
i honestly do not understand how people like you have fun mining 237 in a hulk or mining ship in empire this is a pvp game go back to wow
i have mixed feelings about the simple solution approach to this problem docking games most definitely constitute problem that needs to be solved or rather shouldve been solved ages ago gate jumping games are not such a problem as they should  as someone mentioned  be taken into consideration by both sides of a potential fight anywayhowever similar the docking game problem is on paper in empire as in null sec i claim that the situation cannot be solved in both with a single change in game mechanicsdisregarding the empire side due to not coming up with any great ideas perhaps the ops suggestion works fine there in 00 the owner of a station should have serious advantages sic to the attacking forces and imho the docking game approach is a part of this advantage unless ofc the owner lets the attacker dock too so for small stuff stick with the existing game mechanics pleasebut then the big but large or gigantic camps on dwellings are called sieges a siege is a way to deprive the inhabitants of a dwelling of new resources food water energy and whatnot as well as waste disposal causing diseases etcas regards the docking game my 00 proposal would consist of1 not changing the current mechanics in daytoday gameplay or maybe change the timer from 60 to say 120secs ie small and mediumsized fights would need to take place elsewhere unless the other side wishes to let the station owners dock at will after 60secs2 implementing station siege where a significant attacking force could disable station services by keeping energy and nutrition from coming to the station after besieging a station over a considerable time with a considerable power the station services such as repair facilities and clone upgrades  im sure all 00 dwellers have jump clones somewhere would one by one cease to function making docking games a practical impossibility a smaller force could besiege a station too but then it would take longer for the station services to fail rclick a station when in appropriate proximity of it choose siege or whatever the term once my vocabulary gets fixed and the size and amount of the besieging ships could determine how long it takes for station services to fail3once a station is sieged up to an extent it will be impossible for anyone to dock at the besieged station attempting to do so gives out the msg running out of food and water go find your destiny elsewhere pod pilots constituting only a disappearing percentage of the inhabitants of a station this would be rather appropriate undocking is possible at all times ofc  thus making a call backupundock combo a good way to counter the siege4the player stations really do need windows but not ones that directly tell how many ships there are make em poor besieged count em manually5once a siege is over  no matter if the station ownership changes as a result of the event if other station ownership change requirements are met  the owner of the station can hasten the renewal of the station services operation by bringing in station revitalizing stuff that could be sold for example at nearby npc stations during and after a siege and disappearing so that it cannot be stacked just in case or some other way of making this idea feasiblei support the op in the short term  the original idea seems a whole lot easier read faster to implement but as mentioned by critiques in this thread it has its downsides tooi sure hope i like my idea tomorrow b
this is the point you commit when you commit you can guerrilla all you want just dont expect to do so in the shadow of a station and be finethis is the new law for pirates wardeccers and cowardsever heard of a siege someone corners your group and you all hold up as long as you can but eventually you have to go outside and fight to the last man or scatter in all directions or stay docked and crybring enough ecm and an fc and your guys can get away but the winner will not be decided by who can squeeze back through the castle walls before they get hit with a calvary chargerl look it up sometime under war is hell undocking is still consent htfu
best be trolling especially with the classic real life analogies fight to the last man cavalry charge war is hell this is a game its not a cavalry charge its a blob fight to the last man  get ganked war is hell  pvp is  thanks to this change and has about as much relevance to real life as your post does to fixing docking games bring enough ecm so we want falcons online back already and you have totally missed the point about only engaging if youre guaranteed to win both sides cant be guaranteed to win the fight so where the  do the fights come from but anyway at least you have confirmed my point that people supporting this change are the people who do not want fights in the first place but want a quick gank with their massive blob of thundering s the cavalry charge you were referring to not quite as poetic but far more accurate so they can get back to their business of pretending to be in a castle or farming the fields or whatever it is you think youre doingbut anyway its all a waste of breath until you can learn to distinguish between a game and real life and not make game design changes based on situations in real life warfare
before we get to it lets just clear up some of the language and misconceptions that are muddying thisaggression timer this is the 15 min timer you get when you perform an act that is deemed aggressive to a third party this includes attacking him directly or else aiding someone with whom he is currently egressed this happens everywhere they just dont show it in 00 there is an amusing exploit you can test this with  aggress someone in 00 on a lowsec gate and both jump through once primary aggression see below has cleared engage your target again and gate guns ignore you because you are continuing aggression not starting new aggression old bug is old and is bound to be fixed eventually and it may not always happen so make sure you test with something that doesnt insta popprimary aggression this is the 1 min timer you get when you perform an aggressive act on another party ie weaponsdrones scram or ewar it is impossible to dock or jump a gate with primary aggression remote repair of a target does not give you primary aggressionthe op has proposed the followingonce primary aggression is acquired the timer can be reset by committing primary aggression on the initial aggressorthe naysayers response is summarized asomg i have to risk my ship in combat nowai that suxxorzeleventyoneif i undock then i wont be able to dock again its not fairthe second fear is valid but misunderstands the aggression mechanic as described above as long as you do not aggress you will always be able to redock in docking range after 30 secondsin order to make the first point people say such things as oh but what if you aggress something and cant kill it  it just keeps you there till his friends arrive from 20 jumps away if youre aggressing something you cant kill though darwin requires that you loose your ship at the very least if you undocked and there was a small fleet outside which you drove off apart from a tackler well then the same applies unless you have friendsif you cant find friends to help you kill or drive off a single tackler in the time it takes people to come 1020 jumps ie at least 1020 minutes then youre playing the wrong game if you want to play by yourself then can i recommend privateer elite 2 or one of its more recent descendantsas initially proposed the ops idea would not stop carriers repping a titan from redocking when they got aggro unless rr was counted as primary aggression and theres a valid debate to be had about that in all other ways forcing someone to commit to their act of aggression instead of hiding behind a docking mechanic to mitigate the risk to his ship can only be a good thingbear in mind that the trap works both ways too  you undock your bait ship and reapproach the station remaining unaggressed they open up on you and your fleet undocks and pins them to the very wall they were pressing you against allowing you to totally destroy them rather than just 1 or 2 that cant dock before their primary aggression expirestheres no way that this is a bad thing
getting so sick of repeating the same stuff but here we go againi dont give a flying  about darwin that has absolutely no relevance as were discussing game mechanics here and what is best for the state of the gameits not about a single tackler its about your gang being stuck unable to either jump or dock to avoid an incoming blob youre advocating the removal of any tactical retreat from pvp therefore favouring pure escalation of numbers over any thought and planning it becomes irrelevant as theres no way to avoid getting blobbed theres no such thing as lets go and see if we can get a fight if they blob us we can always reapproach and deagro to split their numbers or get out theres just if they blob us we lose our ships thanks for demonstrating that in the bit i quoted the only options left are to either not engage or to get more numbers im saying this is a bad thing for pvp i dont like flying in large gangs i dont like their structure of the fc basically playing a rts and everyone else sitting there like a moron simply following orders and as a result i dont want to be forced into flying large gangs by people looking for some free and easy bait n ganksno see above for full detailsthis bit actually made me laugh as all you are doing here is complaining about the inneffectiveness of blobbing someone because they can just dock up on youthere was a time in eve when trying to boost the strength of the numbers game was a bad thing i guess those days are over and the reign of the tactless morons has long since begun
this and i cant even fly a nag yet and now im pretty sure i dont want to i get a lot of flak on the forums for my ranting about the way the minnies are being continually screwed over with every single patch that ccp brings out such as the coming navy armageddon which is quite possibly the best bs in game making that uhm only 4 very good bss the amarr have compared to at most 2 halfway decent ones for the other racesits kind of paranoid but one seriously gets the feeling that none of the ccp developers actually fly any minnie ships in pvp
definitively supportingat the very least they should change it so the training time is more similar training 40 more for less dps less tank and less everything is just pure idiocy
given that the static data dump is out for dominion its probably too late now for anything to change before the patch hitsbut we can at least try to get this reviewed in the first postdominion patch
dont mess with my vertical masterpiece
how exactly am i wrong period i might have a few logic fallacies and whatnot but i think my argument is pretty solid you want one race to be able to ignore the racial flavor law that all other races must follow without any apparent penalties not to pull a no u but i think your argument is more wrong than minenobody here has seriously said anything about lowering missile base damage or anything to that matter to make up for the adjustable damage types without penaltiesyeah and can lasers freely choose any type of damage with no penalties to damage amount or range or other aspects of the weapon sorry but no lasers are getting looked atyeah its really really unfair to let caldari ignore the racial flavor rule by giving them bonused everything ammo please explain to me how its unfair for caldari to be able to use any damage type without losing range or velocity or explosion velocity or explosion radius all you lose is the bonus to your racial damage type and some ships arent even limited by that
your wrong because other races allready ignore the racial flavour lawgallente get 5 kinetic bonus from rof and dpl for every hull level trained on hybrid bonused ship hullsgallente get 75  10 per level bonuses to all damage flavours from drones em  kin  exp  are not i repeat not gallente racial damage typesamarr get 5 thermal bonus from rof and dpl for every hull level trained on laser bonused ship hullsamarr get 10 per level bonuses to all damage flavour from drones therm  kin  exp  are not i repeat not amarr racial damage typesminmatar get 5 emthermkin from rof and dpl for every hull level trained on projectile bonused ship hulls emthermkin  are not i repeat not mini racial damage typescurrently if you compare cmb bonuses for solo  small gang work to other damage improvement bonuses they equate to roughly 13rd the valuerof and dpl bonuses at 5 basically mean that for every hull level you train you get 5 more dpsso for 30 days training to cruiser level 5 for example you get 25 more dps in all engagements you fight averaged out you get 25 more dps for 30 days trainingnow compare the cmb bonuseskinetic missiles are useful against t1 armor reppers and mini t2 only this accounts for about 13rd of engagementsso for 30 days training to cal cruiser 5 for example you get 25 more dps in 13rd of engagements you fight averaged out you get 85 more dps for 30 days trainingtheres really no need to worry about lowering missile base damage ask most serious pvprs and theyll tell you guns are better for pvp than missiles that fact is hardly ever disputedmissile boats are in a need of a boost to bring them up to parif you want proof then look at ships that allready get rainbow damage bonuses to missiles  raven  sacraven is not overpowered versus other bs  in fact for pvp its one of the poorer ships although not by any huge marginsac is not overpowered versus other short range ships despite getting double rainbow damage bonuses to short range  high damage missilesin fact sac is one of the most unpopular hacsif you consider ship hulls to be balanced at low skill level then its a mathmatical impossibility for them to also be balanced at high skill level and vica versadue to the 25  85 disparity explained above5 per level rof  dpl works fine for guns  a few missile boats that have them5 kinetic equate to somewhere between  125 and 16  rof per level30 days training is 30 days training it should be equally valuable for anyone who trains it no matter the ship hull

you create the inconsistency cutting the post in half the skill itself is not imbalanced as it is compensated by the existence of the modules it become unbalanced if you introduce extra modules for missiles without introducing the skill for gunsguns have 1 skill 2 modules and 1 rig missile have 2 skills 0 modules 2 rigsboth system get the same end result reducing the effect of size and movement on damage mitigationas the post of taja calaren you cited say if you overcompensate for tracking you get a reduction of the size effect on hits as the to hit formula use tracking  size in his calculation and the values arent capped at 1 ie if your tracking is x15 the angular velocity of the target and the target is 12 of the signature of your weapon you get 1512 075 chance to it simplifiedbut it work the same way in the damage resolution of missiles explosion size and explosion speed are multiplied by each other so if you get one above 11 with the target value for one of the elements you compensate the other so  eliminate the guided vs unguided distinction is acceptable as it will allow all your missile to benefit for the skillrigs asking for extra modules affecting both values so that missiles get 2 skills 2 modules 2 rigs against 1 skill 2 module 1 rig isnt

this is the csm forumturkeys dont vote for christmas and csms dont vote for no free holiday and no free sekrit informationzccp didnt give us a toothless worthless organisation because we needed it they forced it onto us because they wanted it if theyd given us what we needed that would mean that suddenly a software supplier would have to behave like any other regulated service supply industry like banking or energy supply and who the hell wants to actually be held accountable for their own actions nobody thats who
you want ccp to act like a banking or utility company really where are you from that these companies are considerd good models for customer serviceinnovationetc im facinated edit where you live are the banks and utility companies bound to impliment policy based on popular vote of the customers since thats whats being proposed here
no thats not what i said its what you read but its not what i wroteyes they are its called a free market economy i can choose whichever i like any company that doesnt want to supply what people want doesnt have took so thats two points of no substance got anything elseand to be clear i dont care what is suggested in the op i read point 1 scrap the csmit does not matter what else it says because this is the csm forum and the csm wont entertain this thread because of point 1 but i will support for no reason because of point 1 alone it could go on to suggest replacing it with a troupe of flying elephants that  candy corn onto dead babies that would be an improvement on the csm so thats why im supporting but why are you retorting with nonsense
rockpaperscissorsmarauder  falcon  sniper bc  maraudereverything has to have a counter mauraders need a boost but not to their sensor strengthand we do not need another expensive useless hull blackops anyone
even if something like this went through you wouldnt see them as anything other than the occasional novelty toy of the super rich until insurance is made to cover at least part of the cost of more expensive t2 ships any of the t2 battleships are more a liability for the target they represent than anything they could bring to the field
the very first thread i ever made on the forums included a proposal like that but in retrospect i think they did a better job with t2 battleships than i would have even with the hilarious failure of the black ops class if theres a role for another t2 battleship it ought to be a fleetcommand role i think not another expensive heavycombat ship we already have 13 faction battleships and to some extent 4 marauders for that funny note  hacs insure for something like 60 mil postdominion youre getting your wish in less than a week
supported wtb khanid bs with cruise missiles
just boost blackops ships a bitdecent res ability to tank etc
i doubt it would be actually used in pvp much with what it would costno matter how tough they made it it would catch focus fire and go boom near instantly
supporting simply for the pure awesomeness of the example ship
keep it tech one with bonus to salvage per level enough powegride and cpu to run say 4 salvagers and 4 tractor beams
wait whathave i not run a thrasher with this 44 setup you need a bonus to it too whywhat next plz more cargo space so no need to dock so oftengiving the destys any more pg cpu or cap would make them or at least a few of them seriously overbuffed
simply just ask to rename the destroyers as garbagers fit better to their role actually ill add that ccp thoughts are too concentrated in big class ships instead of small ones we need at least 1 faction destroyer  for the amarr with turrets not with stupid rockets  and 1 frigate new hull for each race and its t2 counterpart and we still need the 75 ab bonus to the af
i already can run a destroyer with 4 salvagers and 4 tractors a mwd and cargo expanderswhy do you need a bonus to do that i dont use it anymore because it is a pain now that im doing level 4s but its easy enough to fit
with no skills i can fit 4 salvagers 4 tractor beams a mwd an expanded cargohold i and 3 cargo rigs with no cpupg problems and when my character is added to it i get a max speed of 1146ms and a cargo capacity of 804m3 i dont know what your problem with fitting it is are you trying to use a 10mn abmwd
meh4x tractors 4x salvager ii1x 1mn ab stuffcargo expanders3x small salvage tackle65 salvage chancecycle expanders to keep speed below 450 so you dont outrun your loot can only problem is that all but the coercer cap out pretty quickly but this role is ideal for the amarr dessiewhat they need and have needed forever is a dedicated industrial hull for this task and fixing the failure that is destroyers since rmrtier 1 industrial hull 8x utility highs decent maneuverability  speed salvage chance boost or tractor range boost
not sure if this has been proposed before but not knowing what is outside the station or if the undock area is clear before undocking is a bit silly this would go well with the anti dockinggames proposal also madea simple list of ships in proximity to the station sub 100km would do the trick or even a list of players in the area outside would doeven simpler a threat indicator that lights if there is anyone of negative security status within x km of the station could also be an optioni realise this would need to be developed on further
yea ccp once looked into this but said no something to do with node changes and coding problems

they already have something like this  the assist and guard commandsstill i support this
not a bad idea per se i can see this come in handy in many situationshowever and i dunno if this is a positive or negative in the end wed see more people fitting smartbombs  effectively countering the usability of such a commandi would like to see smartbombs used more so if for no other reason the op gets my supportedit spelling
and remember free p0rn is always a trap
okay then im screwed
you were not hacked you most likely downloaded a program that you shouldnt have that was attached to a trojan and you essentially gave somebody your username and password either by keylogging your password entry into eve or downloading your browsers saved password file that you probably dont have a master password set for thereby leaving it unencryptedagain you werent hacked nothing happened that you couldnt have prevented there is nothing that ccp can do about it and there is no reason they should reimburse you have a nice day
i am it specialist i never go to any suspicious sites i never download anything no ie no scripts 3 firewalls one at providers server 1 at router 1 at pc strong updated antivirus strong updated antispyware i download only mail headers at first then choose which are reallyreally normal and download only them i never enter anything sensitive login name pass email anywhere else apart from game and eveo
this can happen to anyone no matter what precautions you take and you wont be so uncaring once it happens to you
i loldit could be you did something or ccp did something but seeing as youre the one looking at  on your puter and not tranquility or the customer database server my moneys on it being something you didbesides no fortress is secure as an it specialist you should know that you should also know that the primary source of computer error is a chairkeyboard interface errorvape your hdd reinstall from scratch change all your passwords and move on i say
move on after everything whats build from 2006 is gone any point
in terms of eve  ccp usually reimburse you lots of isk once they agree that its hacking simply keep pushing at them an it doesin terms of your puter you have backups right
is it some kind of threat
probckierrmin1probckierr
so who the hell are you youre probably not much more than a nobody in eve and as such you wouldnt be a single target of a hacking attempt so that means there was a massive attack on the eve player databases and thousands of accounts have been compromised right not that ive heard that leaves one thing you did something stupid and your eve account was accessed by somebody that shouldnt have had access to it everybody does stupid things it specialist or not if you were an it specialist you would know that it doesnt mean squat as far as making you invulnerable to virusesspywarephishingetc you can have all the antivirus and firewall protection in the world but its not going to protect you from a custom keylogger and it certainly wont protect you from your own stupidityit has happened to me despite my 3 layers of firewalls fullyupdated antivirus and it specialism so dont even go there bro
for an it specialist you obviously dont know what the hell your doing if you got hacked that isi mean common sense alone begs the question that you obviously missed something very obviousnot that you will ever admit to it youll be too busy blaming the game or something else like all the other so called it specialists will dotldr  epic failness
edit fail in posting  lost my own msg and posted a full quote of op argh quick rewritegreat thumbs up for addressing this issue but as others have pointed out the suggested solution seems unimplementablehowever the pvpsandbox intention of eve urgently requires a pve nerf even though some sort of isk generation mechanisms are needed to counter the natural loss of isk due to ppl quitting et cetera the current pve imbalance is in a word intolerableas regards the faction boats and modules the op is slightly mistaken the isk flow does not go to other mission runners but to fw which is or at least is meant to be a pvp scenethere are loads of great pve games out there but eve never was nor will it ever become one of them
forgot somethingdependency of the ingame economy on the isk grind of pve could be seriously decreased eg by making pvp wrecks drop significantly more loot and salvagables with new salvage items that could be used to build something else than mere rigs  maybe even boost might need renaming too of the hackingarcheaology skills and moduleslost raw material in ship and module losses are the most significant isk sink of the game that needs to be balanced out by the pve grind this quite naturally offers an incentive for players to acquire alts to grind the isk whilst they play the actual game elsewherehowever lucrative in the short term this approach will not provide long term growth for ccp as it provides further speedbumps for new playershell need to give this thread the official thumbs up after all even tho i do not support the op solution my selfacclaimingly great ideas wont be heard if they are in not supported threads
fully supported even though increasing the amount of tabs doesnt really make the overview good it only makes it slightly more tolerable id love to see the overview restructured completely i have a few ideas that might spark interest or be utterly ridiculous if analytically reviewed by superior pod pilots first of all allow multiple overview tabs be viewed simultaneously thus making them into different overviews rather than tabssecond and only if the first point is implemented introduce a means to filter overview objects by proximity only objects that you can warp to  only objects falling short of min warp range  custom range for drone range smartbombs and what notthird allow playergenerated exceptions to the overview rules  hide planets from overview  exception show planet iii in overview or hide pilots of your own fleetalliance  exception the sob that stole my officer loot the other day and whom i wish to backstab as soon as the current fight is over or hide pods  exception the one with the multibillion bountyfourth  tho this is rather academic or trivial make overview settings intelligent enough to use pilot data to hide settings that have no effect such as show militia members or show alliance members when not in a militiaan allianceb
hi therehow about an option to dragdrop the broadcast commands into empty slots on our hud  everybody has at least 8hi8me8lo slots on the hud you changed that a while back now you can see only real empty slots which most of them are empty due the ships slot design so how about to use them the current buttons are too small cannot be resize even if you scale up the broadcast window and sometimes you miss them due lag or your mouse is to speedythx some other ideasadd location on killmailsadd faction deadspace  officer tags to module icons
i would like to see an option in the overview settings to show expiration timers as a column this would be usefull in long missionsplexes or for mining operations so you can see how long a can or wreck will survive in space right on your overview as of now only anchored secure containers show this information
generally a minor issue but itd be nice supported as long as the technical issues arent too bad
supported
i think a better solution would be to make notes able to be turned into physical objects just like bookmarksthough with fewer stupid annoyances in the process and just stash it in the cargohold im not sure how necessary this is but it seems like an interesting idea
as a rule i think that something should be automated ingame if and only if it could reasonably be automated by a computer in the ingame universeunless a change to that is necessary for functional gameplay hence why i favour such things as warning sounds for hostiles entering local  checking corp on a known list of players against a red list is something your ships computer already does it should be able to tell you what it finds this doesnt meet that requirement where exactly is a person getting the intel from inuniverse ccp has all the intel but concord doesnt never mind your ship as much as intelgathering is kind of annoying i cant support this

id love to see if someone is damn fool enough to say no ui is greatof course we would like to see it better faster cleaner making that a plank in the campaign platform is so redundant that most of us do not bother those that do might be looking for something more than adjustable and moving into mods from outside sources which have both their ups and down i believe the current eula forbids such things so i do not see ccp making a turnaround on that anytime soonmike
this is just my opinion and a bit of idea collection but here it isas i see it the destroyers are supposed to be an average between frigates and cruisers like their big battlecruiser brothers are between cruisers and battleships and frankly destroyers are absolutely useless at the moment they cant deal with their own factions tier 3 frigates what we need is for the destroyers to be the superfrigateminibattlecruisers that they are meant to be instead most pilots are using them as mere salvagehaulersi also think that the destroyers we have are far too similar we need to bring some racial variations into play  for example amarrian ships are known for having sturdy armor tanks while the minmatar are versatile fast ships mixing tanks and weaponscoercer the prophecy has a 5 armor resistance bonus therefore the coercer should also have a tank bonus also its slot layout renders it next to useless  one mid slot this makes it difficult to use in combat and therefore it should recieve an additional mid to bring it in line with the punisher finally the coercer has problems fueling a full rack of guns and armor repairers it has the same peak capacitor regeneration as the punisher in light of this fact cap capacity or recharge time should be boostedcormorant firstly this ship should have been a missile ship two supporting arguments for this change1 seeing as the caldari are the missile race their only destroyer should also be a missile ship2 if we look at the flow of ships that most caldari pilot will fly it looks like this kestrel  cormorant  caracal  drake  ravenas the cormorant is the only turretbased ship in this flow many of us are simply skipping from the kestrel to the caracal based on our skills its bonuses should be changed from turrets to missiles either a 5 velocity or damage bonus and the 50 range bonus should be removed completely an extra mid slot would also be extremely helpfulcatalystin my opinion the catalyst should receive a 50m3 drone bay and 25 bandwidth while scaling back the damage of its turrets currently most pilots are leaving the drone bay empty as the ability to launch one light drone is not worth the effortthe ship needs an active armor tank bonus perhaps a 5 bonus to armor repairers similar to what its big brothers  the brutix and myrmidon  currently enjoy it should also recieve another mid slot to bring it in line with the tristanalternatively the catalysts bonuses should be brought into line  the current optimalfalloff mix is unacceptable as sublepton has mentionedthrasherthe thrasher is currently overpowered compared to its brethren from the other factions the changes above would fix this though the thrasher should also receive an additional slotthese changes are geared more towards empire missioning than pvp but both categories of pilots will enjoy the newly revamped destroyer classin conclusioncoercer5 armor resistance bonus per levelremoval of tracking bonus1 medium power slot10 boost to capacitor capacitycormorantconversion to a missile ship 7 missiles1 turret1 medium power slotremoval of 50 optimal bonus and turret bonuses5 missile damage5 missile velocity bonus per levelcatalystconversion to a drone ship 50m3 drone bay 25 bandwidthremoval of all turret bonuses 10 drone damage 10 drone hp per level1 mid slotblaster boat50 optimal bonus converted to 50 falloff bonus10 reduction in mwd cap penalty per level1 mid slotthrasher1 low slotincrease in base speed to 300msall shipsincrease in warp speed to 45aus

great idea way off topic but i throw this out there every chance i get  still wish bpos were blue and bpc another color or something like that 
well since the game is supposed to be player driven i dont see any problems with making that easier by providing more tools for the players to drive the game forwardvery nicely done btw im sure ccp will have a hard time making it useless if they even remotely follow your example

bad idea herschel it is too easy to manipulate the market value especially for ships with a low number of traded unitsabout removing the loot drops it will unbalance the materialisk input in game you risk big inflation problems as a general proposal to revise insurance supported
i am against lowering the insurance payout in generalthe insurance payout acts as a lower bounder for the minerals if minerals become to cheap people can and will make profit by selfdestruction ships and thus they increase the demand of minerals and therefore increase the pricesremoving insurance will only result in a sharp drop of mineral prices making mining even less profitable it is already not that profitable compared to other activities for example level 4 missionrunningjust lowering the insurance payout by 2533 will lead us nowhere anyway because then mineral prices will simply drop by 25  33 and we will be where we were just beforea different insurance model in the long run is some other topic with premium fees for people who get their ships blown up often and discounts for people who rarely use the insurance payout for example
the way it should be

just want to point out the fact that if people exploit this enough it floods the market with lp products making them less rare making them less valuable so your 45 mil mission turns into 10 mil mission and on and on until lp is basically valued the same as any other low isk generating activity rattingif you let the system work its self out you improve the system
im torn because fw needs a total revamp and implementing this change will pull some people out of fwbut then these people probably never left the ehaoicx systems and thus i huess its no big loss no support
this put lp rewards on complexes or something we need fights in plexes
why do i get the sneaking suspicion that the very people whom are farming the hell out of these missions actually want ccp to continue with these changesi think its pretty clear the guys that are farming these missions like crazy are doing it in groups so they can camp out systems it doesnt matter if ccp changes it for risk of fail or not being able to choose systems they will simply just move in a group and bang them out and lower their income just a tad this isnt a bad deal for them in reality because they can still easily farm out billions of isk with lps as a group more importanly these changes will mean less competition for them as less people will run the missionshowever the threat to their income is the fact that right now everyone has the ability to also run these missions with out much problems now that on the other hand is bad for profits because if everyone is running them the lp become less valuable making these farm group efforts less worthwhileyes ccp fix this so the farmers can continue biz as usual the farmers themselves have even stated that the current set up on sise will not really hurt their methods yet it will hurt the guys doing it to supplement their pvp income why not lower the rewards to bring all 4 factions in line with each other and simply reduce the amount of missions each agent will give each player daily
because after the patch they will be the only ones who really can make the new stuff available in quantities and for profit and can set the price incredible higheverybody else will have to grind their way up the hardway while the amount of lp already hoarded will have an even better isk to lp ratio while if ccp wouldnt do anything everybody could get on the lp farm train and thus increasing the supply reducing the lp to isk ration due to the higher supply of itemsif ccp does nothing everybody will start farming zero isk missions in low sec if they nerf missions they make those who already farmed mission even more richanyway im not in here to nerf or unnerf the rewards per se although they do need balancing i just want to be able to decline a mission without a standing lossthats all

if all the miners went back to wow who would the leet pirates gankbut mining is lucritive enough without help everything is pvp in eve not just the pew pew splodey parts trading is pvp industry is pvp and if you cant win on your own merits you dont deserve a win
some of us are just not into all out combat shoot em up is not really my thing getting a bpc determining the ore you require building the item and then flogging it on the market is fun for mei got a real sense of achievement from not buying my first hulk but building it killboards hold no such interestnow you may not understand that but i dont understand why you just want to blat other people and yet that is the wonderful part of eve each person makes their own fun and chooses their own pathas for the opwho cares about how other people mine its non of your business if i want to afk mine in  for example  a strategic bomber its my choice i can have a 1 laser indy or a battleship or what ever you mine your way ill mine my waythere really is no defence against a suicide gank you can boost the hulk but the gankers will just get more ships even if ganking is not profitable they will still do it for kicks as stand over tactics as part of a territorial dispute or to cause market spikesi am halfhalf on bigger cans as a trader and when shipping ore or minerals the extra 30 from cans is great and the security in the ice mines is a must but they are a hassle to load and unloadon the other hand you can always jet can mine and thats cool if you accept the risk of losing to pirates i lose cans now and then and its annoying when it happens but hey  eve is pvp and player pirates are just one of those parts of the game you have to deal with it makes it a little more funmining is boring enough as is without adding in secure jet cans  that would be like shooting fish in a barreloh  and there are thousands of belts out there to mine especially since the macro deaths of junejuly so if the can flippers and suicide gankers get to you move along find your own belt
sorry but in a game that actively promotes survival of the fittest darwin has no relevance oh my god are you playing the wrong game hello kitty is that way sir failing that give me isk and ill give you 10x backdarwin has no relevance to the game mechanics i mean come on reallyjust because youre incapable of seeing any tactics for strategic retreat or splitting forces other than jumping gates or docking doesnt mean the rest of us are so limited and frankly if you took even 1 tenth of 1 second to check on killboards and realise what my background is you might consider that im not wholly inexperienced in the theatre of small gang work there is almost not a single kill that my gangs get that is on a station because docking games bore me to the extent i rarely bother all of the fights i get then are at gates or belts in ships which dont have the luxury of tanking 20 man fleets for 1 minute in order to jump through in systems where i couldnt dock at the station even if there was one to dock in and yet here you are ranting about how your favourite toy would be taken cruelly from you and that thered be nothing but blob warfare left well having just last week turned back not 1 but 2 4050 man bs fleets with a fleet of 10 frigates and 45 support no prizes for guessing which frigs i can tell you that there is plenty of non blob fun to be had still in this game if you truly cant see that then you have my pitythe reason you keep having to repeat yourself is that we utterly refute the central thesis of your objection as i just did once more merely repeating it ad nauseum wont suddenly make you right if it truly is your contention that docking games are the only means of prosecuting the kind of warfare you favour the burden lies on you show that there are no other tactics to try to make your pointthe axiom of this argument is that docking games as defined by undocking aggressing a target in the hope of an opportunistic kill and redocking before the dps of any support can break you is not big and not clever and requires exactly as much skill as that required to pick your nose without giving yourself a lobotomy we here if the other supporters will allow me the liberty consider it to be too close to consensual pvp which goes against the very essence of what eve stands forunless you have a new argument to put to espouse your theory that docking games are the only way of controlling the battle space whilst outnumbered your options pretty much are to repeat failed arguments again concede or and something tells me perhaps unfairly that this would be your preference try and argue against the premise of the axiom i definedwhich it is i leave to you

aside from about 4 drones boats gallente are stuck with only thermal and kinetic damage this takes care of the fact that they actually get a bonus to both for the drones drones have built in advantages and disadvantagesaside from about 2 or 3 drone boats amarr are stuck with only thermal and em damage this takes care of the fact that they actually get a bonus to both for the drones drones have built in advantages and disadvantagesminmatar ammo does less damage and in many way is forced to fight in a non optimal range you cannot possibly say that minmatars situation is better than caldaristhat is in no way an argument for getting caldari a bonus to all types of damage if i had time i could pull out a list of ships with holes to other races damages and figure out some cute numbers of why we needed boostingother races may get 25 bonus no matter what engagement because they are forced to use that damage even if a better damage would work better caldari simply choose to use different ammos which work better because the outcome is bettertbh i wish i could use missiles in pvp because of the changing ammo types huge optimal range like i said earlier numbers really dont mean muchi could make some up for my argument too
your the one claiming we play a game where all are stuck with bonuses only to racial damage  clearly not the caseif hybrids on gal only got 5 to thermal  25 equiv dpl and lasers on amarr only got 5 to em  25 equiv dpl and proj on mini only got 5 to exp  16 equiv dpl then your argument about racial damage would make sense but this is not the game we are playingyouve done 7 asides and claimed 2 racial flavours for gal and amarr and overlooked the changes being made to proj ammoyour racial argument has more holes in it than clyde barrowyou seem to think that eve combat is only about damage type selectionyes everyone knows blasters and lasers cant change damage type  there no need to caps it for usblasters and lasers have far better raw dps compared to missiles and proj to compensate for the fact that they cant select resistance holeswhy are you even here thenyou have just clearly stated to everyone that you dont have the first clue what your talking aboutquote still harkonnen  tbh i wish i could use missiles in pvpyouve never used missiles and your trying to tell people who do use missiles as well as guns how the balance is numbers are provided here to help people understand the issues they are not made upif you disagree with my 16 per level assesment then please be so good as to explain to me against which target types you think kin is the optimal ammo
quoting this for the ownage factor
as if your argument doesnt have holes either pointing out all the little flaws in my argument of how yes other races get bonused to 2 damage types doesnt make up for the fact that caldari should not get bonused to all types of damageedit check out range on blasters that may be why they do the most damage ive actually seen multiple fits of caldari ships with more dps than blasters even where blasters get more damage the range is so pitiful that its often not worth it blasters are supposed to have more raw damage blasters dont have that much more damageyou are the king of assumptions because i said i wished i could use missiles in pvpyou assume ive never used missiles for pvp you assume ive never used missiles at all you assume i dont have a clue how missiles work i have used missiles in pvp i have used missiles before i dont use them often due to most of my skills being in gunnery i have seen missiles used i may not know as much about missiles as you but i know what im talking aboutalso please spell my name correctly if you read close enough to catch my name correctly maybe youd read close enough to realize youre not as clever as you think with that responsei cant say that kinetic is the best damage vs any particular target i dont pay attention to that what i do know is that its a balanced damage type that works decently against many ships while em for example works very well against shield tankers but is generally screwed against armor tankers
you have to warp somewhere to see this part of the game you could warp to another station if you dont feel safe warping to a gateplanetbelt that way you will see this part of the game yet still be in dock range when you land and before you ask no no one can lock and shoot you while you are in warp

boost destroyer warp speed to 45aus instead
well ok since there have been a few people who appear to kind of like the idea but havent supported it for various reasons what suggestions can anyone make on how to improve itwhat im trying to make here is a ship class which is as much above a t1 bs as a hac is above its equivalent t1 cruiser a ship that can take on 24 t1 bs at once and come out comfortably on top if it isnt yet tough or powerful enough to live up to the considerable price tag it would inevitably attract please tell me how far id need to go to make it sohow about for the sake of the example if i increased the gargoyles midslots to 7i think you may be exaggerating just a little bit sure that might happen in large fleet battles with 20 ships per side but in smaller engagements 510 ships per side itd be considerably more durable and worth its weightalso supporting my own topic since i didnt before

im not sure implementing the feature is as easy as writing im sorry the items were deleted on your own accord and we cannot restore them
plenty speed plenty cap stable plenty room plenty fast on salvaging
worst idea ive heard yet but ive only been on a few minutesthey are already good for salvaging what other ship other than a battleship is going to give you 8 high slots to play around with and throw salvagers and tractors in none or it would be a slow boat either salvage while you are missioning or stop complainingby the waydestroyers are the shaggin wagons
woops spellingit would be handy for those of us who group lvl 4s and have a salvager buddy scoopin up the slag strewn about maybe increased tractor rangeit dosent make sense to risk your orca just to far range pull stuff and not every one should have to own a marauder to salvagethey have specialized scanning ships why not a salvager call it a junker
having only recently joined an alliance i havent encountered this particular problem until this weekend when i started having to invite people to a fleet opit then became readily apparent that while cspa charges are not charged between corp members they are between alliance members since one of the clever fellows in our alliance charges some astronomical sum for people to talk to him i had to get him to put me on his buddy list so i could invite him to fleet  but this seems a tad silly to mea simple fix would be to give people the option in the cspa charge area to turn off charging cspa charges to alliance members who try and contact them or just flat turn it off completely this way i dont have to fill up my buddy list with everyone in my alliance and remember to keep track of when the member corps add new members and then add them to my buddy listi realise that the alternative is to turn your cspa charge to 0 but this is defeats the purpose behind the cspa charge in my opinionlow priority to be sure but i think it would be a welcome fix especially for the larger alliances  can you imagine having a biddy list thats a couple thousand people long and changes on a nearly daily basis
i remember being in my first alliance before even knowing wtf a cspa charge was it wasnt a problem in npc corp or player corps so how was i supposed to know at the first x to fleet time people said mean things to me the good thing was that i learned to hunt down the settings and learned to use them you can get around the cspa charge by putting organisations on your allowed list so there is no need to buddy up everyone in your alliance
i didnt know that thanks

currently most of the ships in eve have t2 varients with the exception of the mining frigates tier 2 battlecruisers and tier 3 battleships here are a few ideas for t2 varients of those ships in addition to a few new modulesprospectors varient of the mining frigates these ships can fit covops cloaks and they would have a single gun slot used to fit a prospecting beam this beam effectively gives the ship a 2minute long mining cycle during which it mines a single compressed unit of ore these ships will have a dedicated mining bay 1000m3 that only ore can be placed in to prevent abuse bonuses will be to agility and cargo space slot layout would be 212defenders varients of tier 2 bcs these ships would fit gravity signatures that force all hostile ships locking members of the defenders fleet within 10km of the ship lock the defender instead defenders would have extremely high ehp but minimal dps bonuses would be to hp and resistances slot layout would be 54 gunmissiles slots82 for armortankers28 for armor tankersflagships a step up from command ships flagships are battleships that trade firepower for no less than 3 gang assist modules they would be very slow compared to other ships but have immense buffer tanks as a result bonuses would be to hp and effectiveness of gang modules slots would be 74 weapon slots8448let me know what you think please
vulturedamnation full fill that role quite nicely already
yo disc o very much like the idea of a flagship like a bs sized command shiphell yes we need more ships in gamenot sure the exacts but il allways support more ships in game
i kind of like the scanner as it is but think that it is far too manual at present your player skills at placing scanning bubbles and interpreting the results seems to outweigh the toons ingame skillsi dont want to change the whole mechanic just tweak it to make it a little more automatedstep 1  place scanning bubbles as normalstep 2  perform an initial scan which gives you a list of detected objects the same list id tag signal strength and type shipstructureanomaly etc is finesignal strength from the initial scan is effected by skills probes used size of scanned object if its already bookmarked  signals strength x 10 number of scan bubbles its in scan bubble size probe rangestep 3  player selects which objects they want scanned down and the system kicks off on auto modein auto mode each object starts with its signal strength from the initial scan and then increases at a specified rate up to 100 just like targeting an object in combat at various stages 25 50 75 you get more info on the object and when you hit 100 you can book mark it  no different from nowthe rate at which a targets signal strength increases is relative to the same factors as above skills object size scan radius intersecting bubbles etc that means that if you are scanning for a battleship or a wh grav site you can scan them down quickly but it takes quite a while when scanning down a frigatethe number of objects that you can scan down at the same time is relative to your skills maybe it starts at 1 or 2 and then based on skills 1 scanned object per level just like targetting but based on an astrometrics skill level instead the number of simultaneous objects being scanned down is also ship limited as well so only specialised probing ships can make use all the objects a level v toon could scanat any time you can stop the second stage scan get an approximate fix on the objects just like now reposition your probes and do an initial scan againif you only have one probe out and have low skills it may take you 30 minutes to scan a site down but you will  eventually assuming it takes less than an hour when your probes go popif you have high ingame skills and lots of probes out and right down to only 05au range then you can scan down almost any object within a few seconds your success at scanning then relies more on your toons skills than your ownof course if you happen to like the current method then just perform the initial scan my step 2 over and over and move your probes manuallynot fully automatic scanning but this is an improvement over the existing highly manual method and pushes the balance back towards having high toon skills
this proposal is so bad i dont even know where to beginfirst you cant get a warpable result on most objects with only one probe out  you need at least four which is conviently enough the number of probes you can launch once you have level 1 skillsecond your probing skills are designed to make the process of probing faster not easier think of it as a mini game within the game where the prize for being competent is something fun to dothe fact that i have seen people probe down a wormhole from initial probe deploy to lets go see whats inside this wormhole in under 3 minutes indicates to me that youre either not very good at scanning or you have some other ulterior motive for this proposalin either case not supportedin before the obligatory learn2probe
as was suggested i posted this idea in features and ideas

its a good idea but ive heard this sooo many times the only feasible way that i would think this would be done to make any sense whatsoever is to replace the background when you are docked with what is outside the station such as zooming out all the way or partial way when you are sitting in space at a station but then eve becomes more like vendetta online which is a very crappy game i personally prefer eve the way it is its been the same way for a long time with the docking dealeo and not too many people have had issues if anything it should be an option if ccp decided to do this but would you really want this when you are sitting in jita and thousands of people are coming and going think of the massive server load this would havei am not for more lag so no fellows i dont support this but had to put my input inthanks for listening to my rambling

wait what you actually have or suppose the op has problems in dealing with npcstrolls are fun but trolling the untrollable equals failing at failing faf  analogous only to fof missilesin case you are serious do you think you actually kill npcs do they not respawn or is it beyond your comprehension that drones can engage in pvp combat toobashing the leak vuoto in finnish aside still supporting the op as much as in my previous post

thank you so far interesting answers goona have a while to analyse one thing that struck my eyei have haerd that before but i have never found any reference to this its not in the wiki afaik also i really tried to raise the issue once more with a decent proposal on the forums even contacted erik directly but nothing came from it can i count on you to raise it again
this really isnt critical but im the one that brought the idea up and ankh was my only other supporter i had it figured to allow quite a bit of customization for only 3 additional bytes of data sent the rest of the csm voted it down and ccp never heard about itmy original thread was here heres hoping it gets brought back to the table in csm4
allow me to visualize the amount of traffic in the jpsc before and during the csm elections with this graphplease visit your user settings to reenable images sok
i can spot a steady rise from 1 to 5 visitors there at the start of the election
what is this supposed to say dont be a noob setting up your campaign thread somewhere halfway in the elections
its certainly true the same could probably be said for all aspects of the csm todate its largely forgotten about  unnoticed between electionshopefully csm 4 will change that they should be very aware of it now
thank you for that information spatiopatheand thank you to everyone that voted for me
im flying the sin aswell and im still wondering what is its role it isnt tanking it isnt dps it isnt logistic so wtf is it
i love my 5 speed per bo skill level rank10 lol no i dont give something more useful pleasejump range could use a very small boost just a tiny bit moresupporting this
aye
yay
plus increase in agility  lower sig for all destroyer hulls
decrease sig a fair bit increase agility a little bit and add more targeting slots and were good to go
this idea would improve the player input into the game and increase teamwork something ccp seems to want i dont see why its not already in the game supported

how wonderfulas fleet salvager on corp mission ops ive dreamed of this feature it will save me hours and hours of drudge works
i love the way the last sentence of your post completely contradicts your first if you want to improve mineral throughput and therefore prices you should advocate better insurance rates for people who lose lots of ships
yes remove insurance see how many noobs stick aroundyou guy ever think that that is the real reason they arent updating payoutsnot supported if ank voted for it it is likely a stupid idea
each week ccp can calculated the avg price for every mineral based upon the volume and quantity sold insurance rates for that week would then be set at perfect build price 1 to 5 this would insure that prices for insurance are in line with the market it would be very difficult for someone to casually manipulate the mineral market for all of eve for an entire week unless chribba starts refining his veldspar and selling trit so it would somewhat reduce the chance of insurance fraud
bad idea not supportin dis since it doesnt address the issue and only makes pvp more of a barrier which strings out the following equation less pvp  less lost ships  less bought ships  less money going to industrailists  market collaspethe solution more money in the hands of players so they can buy more ships maybe dominion will change this we will see
ships prizes are currently artificially kept high due to insurance if things are cheaper the value of isk increases in comparison to other valuables thus lowering the insurance rate will indirectly increase players incomeremoving insurance entirely is anoter issue and thats not what is being proposed here i am in favour of both but i think more things need to be changed before npc insurance can be removed me crosses fingers for the next industrial expansion
supportedif ccp is worried about how fw mission rewards compare to empire l4s they should balance the payouts accordingly
this is simple at present a number of functions are arbitrarily bound to certain keys preventing us from customizing it examples range from functions that are common like bold and italics controlb and controli to the nonsensically obscure what possible reason could ccp have to prevent us from remapping disable turret effects off of controlaltshiftt and then there is screen shot which is permanently locked onto print screenof course if you have an unorthodox key board that for some reason doesnt have one of these keys i for example do not have print screen on my laptop then you are effectively locked out of using those functionsthere is no reason for this i think we should be allowed to utterly confuse ourselves by rebinding all of our keys as we see fitedit i see that the controlaltshiftt example is now unlocked but there are still other locked functions that i really do feel should be unlocked again if i want to use a totally obscure set up or have a nontraditional keyboard i dont think i should be unable to remap basic features
supporting my own topic naturally
completely agree
another attempt at thiscomplex spawning in factional warfare is related to downtime a longer explanation by ccp greyscale can be found here to summarize in situations where only few systems are occupied by the enemy the side which has an upper hand postdt has a clear and distinct advantagethis has changed from back then it seemed to me at times that ccp actually fixed it but the recent capture of arzad by the minmatar  in a multiweeklong campaign  and then recapture within five days because a majority of the plexes spawned postdt and almost none during the day showed that the problem is still presentthis is annoying both for the minmatar who do not have to bother about capturing hostile systems or even recapturing their own unless they have a clear and distinct advantage postdt as well as for the amarr who are putting a lot of effort into this and have their success soured by a game mechanic that gives them an edge that is not very related to their effortsunless fw is supposed to be the kind of gameplay where getting stronger forces postdt is the goal and should be rewarded first and foremost this needs to changeedited to addquoting myself from the other threadyou can see the first in siseide and lantorn it is basically impossible for the minmatar to recapture them without postdt superiorityyou could see the latter in halmah and arzad both recaptured within days despite especially in the arzad case of a minmatar superiority for most of the day
supported
definitely supported
please do not use arzad as an example if you do you need to include a lot more than just the last month every time a system flips on the matariamarr front it is due to this single mechanic the fact that the front is pretty much static speaks against the minmatar does not have numbers post dt point  matari spent 2 weeks technically multiweek i suppose and amarr spent 2 weeks check the dates if you please  available pilots ebbs and flows like just everywhere elsesomething that has to be included the biggest difference is that a single matari is all it takes to capture any plex whereas amarr has to use largish gangs to do the same when offensive plexing then you have the blackhole effect the post dt spawn which required amarr to move a lot of plexes by offensive plexing in the minmatar backwater systems in the hope that they would respawn in arzad the following day then you have the geography of the bleaks allowing insanely fast moving of plexes compared to the maddeningly stretched out matari spaceif you look at it and analyse it with everything in mind you will get the sense that ccp intended amarr to lose  and fast the endalmost everything related to fw needs an overhaul not just spawn mechanics  missions need to make sense rp wise maybe even play a part in occupancy npcs need to be changed to level the field plexes should not accumulate in massive stacks pvp inside plexes should be encouraged and not on gatesstations neutrals should be discouraged in interfering with what is essentially empires at war standings perhapsetc etc etc ad nauseumnot supported unless fw in general gets some sweet sweet love
supportedsee for example here for my comments on the other issues in fw this thread is about one of them which i had hoped was fixed but isnt oh and edited to addthis is not about minmatar losing i was perfectly fine with losing eg siseide because that happened when the minmatar militia was on the defense and definitively weaker this is about a broken game mechanic regardless who benefits from it i bring it up now because arzad showed me that it indeed is still broken i had put off a lot of indications about it not being fixed in the last months due to misperception and rationalization of defeat but thats difficult to maintain now

faction warfare is a lot more fun when it doesnt consist of the 15 bs blob a couple times a day and the post dt rush taking systems would be a nice way of motivating people to come out and maybe give way to skirmish warfare again but thats not gonna happen if they get rescued during the post dt rush also last i knew plex mechanics have nothing to do with regions weve had the entire hed region scanned and free of plexes at a given time which makes me seriously doubt that plexes can in fact be moved at least regionally
supported
agreed and supported with all sentiments in this thread evening out the plex distribution and making systems contestable and defendable across all time zones does encourage small gang warfare which is what in my opinion a lot of people come to fw to findsignededit for typono
supportedi ve posted that yesterday and my post was censored
supported we all pay a monthly subscription in one form or another so should have an equal chance to participate in the capture or defence of systems
you sadly posted in a roleplaying forum and this is an ooc problem  something that bugs me a lot because i cant really talk icly about it the twelveoclock tea war just doesnt cut iti only saw part of what you posted it bears repeating
supported the whole plexing system needs to be fixed and made fun so that those participating can achieve something meaningful within a more reasonable time frame the current system is dispiriting ctf style gameplay can be fun but not when its done like this
yup supported an equal distribution throughout the day so it is fair for all tzs is necessary this prevents the boring fleets some call blobs but they are fw players who want some fun in late nightearly morning with no clear objectives even if they were to break into small frigates and plex the hell out of minmataramarr space there would be no incentive for the amarr to react if they can easily push the favor back postdt when the majority of the plexes spawn and they have the superior numbers approx 5 capitals  13 bs in the reclaiming of arzadfix plz kthxbai1 i disagree with your first point it is just as easy for an amarr navy slicert2 interceptor to solocapture any minmatar plex the only reason they would be unable to do so is due to the efforts of sasawong and other defensive plexers in the minmatar militia2 is this mechanic proven3 the amarr did lose fast and then ccp changed the mechanics so that capturing systems was a much longer processonly after the amarr recaptured most of their space excluding ezzara and kourmonenhowever i completely agree with your second paragraph fw love is needed
make it so
i agree with you minkert more could definitely be better
i especially want at least 1 more destie per race possibly another t2 destie and please make a t2 for the drake hull

tactical retreat and the blobwith the new mechanic in place tactical retreat requires you to shake of any points either due to destruction of scrambling ships jamming neutings sensor dampening or getting out of scramble range todays tactical retreat merely requires you to have lots of ehp i dont think carriers dreads and battleships were designed and meant to be ships good at performing tactical retreats new tactical retreats may require you think and act rather than to wait for a timer and spam the dock buttonalso the dock button isnt a tactical retreat it is a strategic retreat there are no counters to it you cannot be chased and corneredthe current docking mechanics favor escalation of numbers since as soon as larger ships are involved you know that the hostile will have enough time to dock if the fight doesnt go his way unless you bring on an extreme blob very fastat least this is what i tell my pilots when im fc and someone is playing docking games unless we can bring at least 20 gank battleships dont bother engaging his abaddon he will just dock if getting in over his head i need 20 to 1 odds to kill a docking gamer if anything docking games promote blobbingand you know what if a docking gamer isnt able to dock and is going down you know what most pilots that are taking it down will do call in their friends of course not most pilots dont want extra ppl on their killmail when they could have taken down the docking gamer themselvesthe only odd situation is where neither ship at a docking game is able to kill each other or escape then again if you as a docking gamer attack a ship that you cant kill and cannot escape from and you cannot call in your own blob before they call in theirs then you deserve to dieif you are concerned about hostiles calling in backup through logon traps or not just think that you can do exactly the same and your docking games ship will simply be a bait shipthe new mechanic should not apply to stargates just at stations after all a superior attacker aka blob already has options to try and catch a deagressing ship at a stargate
supported im ambivalent about the amendment proposed in 27 the idea of a timer cutoff to prevent stalemates with points is a good one but it might take that long to wear down a carrier or other cap that engaged a small gang
sounds like a great solution to an annoying problem
actually darwinism is based on minute genetic mutations that take place over thousands to millions of years allowing one mutation of the species to be more adapted to their environment than the other in which case the other dies out and the process continues stop hijacking an idea you think sounds cool because it makes your game sound hard first of all going to nip this in the bud  i actually looked at your killboard before i posted my first reply to see if it was worth taking into account it wasnt i would advise you to try and stick to reasoning and leave your 101 ratio out of thisthere are 3 ways of getting out of a fight 1 mwd out of point range and warp out 2 jam everyone pointing your gang and warp out 3 jump out or dock1 requires you to be in fast ships that can be useful in a fight while staying out of web range a few hacsrecons and frigates2 requires you to be an ecm  in which case you can go die in a fire in the first place3 this is what were discussing the total removal of jumping or docking oh my god you managed to stay out of point range of battleships with a frigate gang all you did here was employ strategy 1 staying out of pointweb range this is not possible if you want to fight with a small battleshipcommand gang or even hacs hence why you see so few in 00 and therefore they rely on the 3rd strategy if they get blobbed heres an example of my most recent fight3 of us in battleships in low sec we came across a local gang of about 8 who were happy to engage us in a belt the fight went well but we were low on cap boosters and armor and local started spiking just as their last ship dropped so we warped to a gate into a system we had eyes in that we knew was clear the first part of their gang followed us to the gate where we engaged and they did in response after one of their ships went down we deagrod and waited out the timer while just about tanking their ever increasing gang i jumped out just as i was hitting structure as i was primary the others came as well and we warped out to a station to restock and reset the fightnow if they werent terrible they could have sent a tackler or two to the other side of the gate to pin us and our situation may have been different they could certainly afford the numbers but as it was they didnt so we had a chance to tactically retreat reset the fight and come back and do this nb  1st engagement was at a belt 2nd was at a planet as we wanted to avoid them playing docking games  my point about this change is without that ability to jump out and reset on a blob like that we simply would have been overwhelmed by their sheer numbers despite the fact theyre too useless to even send tacklers to the other side of the gate were on it was a gamble we took by engaging their gang on the gate that they too might agress and not deagro in time to follow us over with the risk that they might either kill us before we can jump or send a few ships to the other side to finish us off
continuing from my last postno  sherlock you say i said something i didnt they say ill say that i didnt i have not once said docking games are good it is totally your misinterpretation and failure at comprehension that gives you that idea if youre still struggling how about taking quotes out of my posts and arguing against them instead it would save everyone a lot of time and you might learn something in the process this is why i keep repeating myself you seem incapable of reading ill try again thoughdocking games are not good as defined by people repeatedly redocking in a fight to go from structure to 100 shieldarmor instantly and need to be fixed simply docking in the first place to avoid a fight is not a docking game however all my posts in this thread are arguing that regardless of how bad docking games are this fix is even worse because of the implications it has for situations not even remotely assosciated with docking games especially with relation to the total nerfing of small battleshipcommand gangs and the far increased risk that would now come with attempting to engage someone while in a smaller gangi had actually taken it for granted that frigate gangs would remain largely unaffected by this but judging by the example you posted apparently it had to be spelled out
i like
destroy docking games for good

i fail to see how i got owned lolomgall i see is somebody severely misinterpreting a quote from menohe assumed that smartass it happens to be not truenohe assumed that smartass i happen to have used missiles beforei may be the only person in this thread thinking this but you look kinda stupid now
ignore the trolls its a good ideathe whole point of missiles is varying damage types locking a ship into one type completely defeats the purpose of the weapon system it would be like forcing drone pilots to only use their racial drones or turret users to only use one type of ammo you only get a bonus to firing iron rounds em rounds  radio seriously make more missile boats like the raven
hi guys for a long time now ive been a navy mega enthusiast and have several of them they kick ass in the field and they look awesomescary with that black hull im starting a petition to persuade ccp to keep the navy mega the way it is this new camo green hull is to be frank hideous in comparison to the original black one there is absolutely no point in ccp turning round on a whim and deciding that the navy mega should be a green camo color after all this time especially since it has absolutely no effect on the navy megas performance please respond to this post and have your opinion heard and maybe we can persuade them to keep the navy mega in its current awesome style sign the petition

change defender missiles to target all missiles aimed at gang matescorp matesalliance mates this would make defender missiles actually useful on as a fleet setup and perhaps open up the option of t2 defender specialist ships some may say that this would kill missiles however i myself fly almost exclusively missile boats and i feel that these weapons need some love
anyone who has ever worked in the management of an even a mediumsized corporation would support any effort to make lockdown ui better
isnt this a little redundanti sold two salvagefitted catalysts this morning i salvage corp fleet ops all the time and the only thing i ever wish for is a little more cap
wuti have a amarr and a minmatar salvage destroyer that does just what you wantboth with 4 salvagers and 4 tractors and other goodies to boot rigged no lessdo you even know how to play the game are you just ranting to be rantingno offense but honestly thats a very poor trollwhine on your partthumbs down

i like the idea for a hotkey to launch drones however think of how this should be implementedin my dominix i have at least 4 sets of drones how does the client know which one i want to launch do i have to make a hotkey for every groupsecondly drones should not stack automatically in my myrmidon i use a set of 2x heavy 2x medium and 1x light drone if the light drone automatically stacks with my 5x light drone group then launching drones will take even longer than it does now
drone interface is archaic and needs a revamp
no we dont need more t2 ships especially not tier 2 battlecruisers coughdrakecough
i dont like defenders  it just sounds like a space version of a warrior tanking with taunt and removes some of the benefit of good fcing game mechanics that remove player control of targeting should be introduced very cautiously if at all
the prospectors just sound like they were designed with afk mining in mind so no
my suggestion would be allow a skill to be train that would assist a fleet scout in determining whether or not players are in same corpalliance in local chat the skill could be intelligence aquasition and would show up as icon in local chat different for each corpalliance this would give instant intel and since skill would have to be trained not all players would be aware level 1corp level 3 alliance level 5fleet
sure if local is changed to wspace mode so that theres no list of names except those talking with local as it is now no way
i dont have a problem with needing 3 to triangulate a position 1 probe should tell you  there are x objects within scan range 2 probes give you a general area and 3 or more allows a precise locationscan time is about 10 seconds and moving probes around is a bit longer than that so the 10 bonus on scan time is only really a 35 bonus per level in overall time and that is ok for probing down 1 object but when you are probing an entire system and you need to prob down all of your eisting bms first the probe repositiong is very monotonous this coming form someone who prefers mining to missioning if a miner finds it monotonous its pretty dullhmm not 3 minutes but i do scan down objects in under 5 minutes and i admit that i could learn to do it faster its not about speed for one object its about removing some of the keyclick mouse drag monotony and allowing trained toons to scan down multiple targets at oncethere is already a targeting skill for combat why not a similar skill for system scanningskill levels are one of the best parts of eve so why have a mini game that departs from that
what is your view on fixing rockets in particular and making missiles in general faster so they have shortened flight time to the targets i already voted for you but i would like to know anyways
you do know that voting is closed for a while now yesand bunyip is right he brought it up i tried to help him defend it but the rest of the csm voted it down with as only argument waaah it will cause uber lagi did poke devs at fanfest 2008 about it howeverthere are a lot of issues that were voted down in previous csm due to stupid reasons which should be reraised in csm 4 and ship paint is one of them
shhh dont tell them  theyre still happily replying to threads  anyway thanks for the link bun but im still wondering where those csm minutes have ended up also there is a persistent rumour that cpp officially said it would cause lag is this a filthy lieps damn i was sure the vote ended on sunday evening it used to in the past oh well now no one will get my bazillion votes too bad p goes off to feel stupid for a bit

known facts about black ops arethey jump in blow something up jump out hit and run i dont see where the tank is actually neededdps wise all of them can get 700800so lets say a black ops fleet of 5 jumps in to gank a rorqual or a ratting bs from a constellation thats near another and has blocked defended gates in between do you need a tank to kill a rorq or any t1t2 bs with 5 x 700 dps black ops ships most will go down even with just 2 black ops bs shooting them very quicklyfor any operations where resistance is expected you will simply have to be more tactical about it the more numbers game doesnt work with bops is that bad or good i think its greatthe jump range could be 25 or 3 light years  but thats just a maybethe only real change id suggest is remove the sins drone damage bonus and its drone bay just because dominix was drone dependent doesnt mean that sin has to benow we have these bonuses on sin4 turrets5 velocity125 cloaked velocity modifier5 to large hybrid turret damage  10 per level to drone damagehpafterwards5 turrets5 velocity125 cloaked velocity modifier5 to hybrid turret damage  5 to rate of fire125m3 drone bay with 75 or 100mbitslike t2 megaall in all if sin would receive such a change it would be without the drone damage disability that slows donw hit and run operations and be like the other bops ships
i am sure that this is in here but it makes sense and i didnt see it in the first 3 pagesconcorde needs to stop paying out insurance for ships that concorde killed i am ok with a group of pirates killing an itty 5 for the 5 bil in cargo the guy is moving afk but 10 people in t1 battleships shouldnt be able to gang up on someones missionexploration ship and get virtually all their cost refunded
3 replys behint you proposal power to concord
not quite the same i dont mind high sec criminals preying on the really lazy or stupid but the bar needs to be higher
instead of asking ccp to prohibit playstyles you dont happen to like why not support my proposal to deal with the root cause
i approve and support
hi
i wouldnt take away the current one just offer people a set of different ones to choose from supported
supportedmore flexibility with different destroyer variants add a t2 dessie add another t1 dessie hull for each race with specific dessie role ie drone boat sniper etc apply appropriate improvements to current t1 hulls add garbagehaulerjunkyardsalvage boat hull just for fun and make it appropriately hideous not to be confused with possible bulldozer class industrial ship hinted at by ccpmore choicesoptionsspecializations on smaller cheaper ships makes sense
many times ppl have suggested that ccp add in a ship that would ease the pain of having to transport large numbers of large rigged ships from one side of the universe to the otherafter some discussion a group of guys have figured out the specifics of how such a ship can work its going to be a t2 freighterthe coloring of these freighter will be the alternate t2 version of that race like the difference between a abso and a damnationwill only have a ship maintenance bay no normal cargoable to fly through high and low sec like any other freighterthe ship maintenance bay it will have 10000000 mUFFFD maximumthis size will be large enough to hold 20 rigged teir 3 battleships 20 maelstroms hyperions rokhs or abaddons input has been that 20 might be too many so maybe 10this size is small enough that you cant fit a carrier dred another freighter or jump freighter in the cargocannot jettison or have ships stored in spacerequirements to build will be the same as that of a jump freighterin terms of pos structures needed not materialspossible skill requirements can beprimaryracial freighters level 4secondaryship transport freighters level 1 working namethe requirements for the new ship transport freighters skill can beadvanced spaceship command level 4transport ships level 4bonuses can be like that of a jump freighterracial freighter skill bonus 5 bonus to agility per levelship transport freighters skill bonus 10 bonus to shield armor and hull hitpointsalso we are considering implementing different sized bays like what ccp was planing for carriers so that we dont get 500 frigates being transported and lagging everyone sless when the freighter popsoruse a new kind of cargo can that magically crams a rigged ship into it so rigged ships can be carried by normal freighters and scrap the whole ideaoruse a flat rate 20 or 10 ships only rules appliedand to deal with nonship items we are consider a few options as well small standard cargo space maybe 10k mUFFFD freighterinspace rules apply or special new cargo containers that can be put into the ship maintenance bay limited to one can so we dont get ppl using these like super freighters or making special rules for these ships that allow ship to keep their fittings and allow only ammo in their cargofeel free to suggest names or modifications to the skill requirement or names for the ship transport freighters skill or even the size of the bay maybe 20 battleships is too manyidklets get this thing finally taken care of 
one addition to this idea is to limit the frighter to 10 of the ship containers each ship container would hold1 bs or2 bc or3 cruisers or4 dest or5 frigalong with this a 1020k cargo bay for ammo fitting etc
looks good all 4 of me likey
smaller cargobay for fittings and ammo since ammo and cap boosters can be in ships own cargohold maybe 3k or something still good idea
lame
for me i would need to have a cargo bay i run 3 accounts and if i feel like moving to another factions space to screw around there ill need to bring all my ships hardeners a stock pile of faction ammo drones etc etc for now im training to use an orca so i can make this move but it means leaving a lot of ships behind and scattering myself all over the universe
for me its a thumbs up except for the skill requirements should be raised now it takes for you to fly any type of tech 2 freighter race specific to level 4 examplefor a ark you must have amarr freighter to lv 4 so why not have this type of ship in which would be a huge asset to anyones fleetcorporation a little harder to aquire also have jump freighter raised to level 3 and jump drive calibrations raised from lv 1 for a ark to lv 3 for the ship freighter
maybe higher skill requirements but the idea is one that i support
wery usefull and good idea little bit of tweaking and thats it eric
looks good
ya i was trying to be modest on the skill reqs any specific suggestionsas for having to require the jump freighter skill that makes no sense as this one wont be jump capable other than via jump bridge or i misread ur suggestionive also thought of adding in graviton physics or something or maybe a new skill called ship bay management which could also give some benefits to other ships that have a ship maintenance baywhat those benefits areidk just a thought
power to concordconcord dont work they live from ours taxes and do nothing for us give us option to fk with them or hire someone elsegive them authority to pod players with security status under 50 why we letting pirates do what they want in ours hisec its like inviting mass murderers in kindergarten if i can be suicide poded by player with 10 sec in 07 why cant he be killed by concord and why he got insurance for that
taxes you dont pay taxeslike inviting mass murderers in kindergarten more like allowing a mass murderer to go through town without any guns and allowing any citizen to kill him on sight if they wishnpcs dont kill pods period stop ing and take advantage of the fact that you can podkill them yourself
a yes concord is far too lax in its duties a concord spawn should follow any 5 or lower in 5 space and bbq them the instant they board a shipb fit a tank even a modest tank will survive a typical suicide gank attempt as they usually set up to deal with untanked shipsc dont use autopilot if you have cargo 1 isk more valuable than the ship carrying it refer to b aboved keep your mining boats a minimum of 1012km apart few suicide smartbombers want to waste their efforts to gank just one barge your hauler has slots for tractor beams use theme go on the offensive nothing scares these twits away faster than something that shoots back
absolutely not
you already have the option to hire someone elseanyway i support your proposal on the condition that concord are made realistic in other ways starting with realistic tax levels 30 seems about right
yes i do what about money for any market transaction thats what and you going to pay 8 from new expansion anywaythey sit in theirs pod doing nothing and if they are in ship finally only to suicide someone with t1 fitted crap what benefit of doing ita yes b dont work c dont using anyway d i did i was killed in crappy fighted covetor man e to give them right to kill me back and sit in station for month greate solution
when ship prices are so low that people can make good isk by selfdestructing them then arguably there is not a shortfall in ship supply t1 ships are effectively free in fact you get paid to buy them how much cheaper do you want themthis raises the prices of minerals which then in turn raises the prices of other things that are built from minerals  such as eg modules which arent free and youre not paid to buyso lets imagine that insurance values reduce by 25 and ship values consequently by 20 minerals prices will also fall by 20 this means that building modules will be nearly 20 cheaper module prices will then also fallso we will have a situation where t1 ships are still virtually free but its considerably cheaper to fit them please explain why you are against this
malcanis there is another problem thoughwith mineral prices dropping everything that con be bought gets cheaper but that means everything that needs to sell stuff to the market especially miners will make far less isk if the mineral prices drop by 20 thats 20 less money for everyone that sells mins so either they go to missioningratting etc and make isk from something else  more money in the system less minerals avaiable stuff gets more expensive inflationperhaps even supply shortage on minerals till they get more expensive againor we have the same problem again in 6 months whith another cry for lower insurancei aggree that the situation isnt acceptable and that insurance might need a change but your solution will not solve the whole problem only cure a symptom for a while
what youre saying is that we have a mineral production surplus i agree we do kind of this is because mineral demand is distorted by the huge insurance subsidy if you look back to page 1 i hint that instead of just looking at a supply side solution we should also consider the demand side in short find a way to replace the artificial demand from fixed insurance rats with greater player demandand what better way to do that than to reduce the noninsurable component of ship loss ie module costin short because of the insurance subsidy minerals are being diverted into insurancefraud ships when they should be used for building modules resulting in excessively high ship and module prices for consumerslet the player market decide how much minerals are worth when insurance values shadow mineral prices they willwhy should i have to pay excessive prices because miners want subsidising
still no reply from csm what a shame
ive already raised this in csm2its not that no plexes spawn during the day its that at downtime all the plexes that have been warped to even when not completed despawn and are redistributed hence the spike in available plexes in desirable locations after dtlike veshta said everything related to fw needs fixing and almost everything in her list has already been raised by me or by erik fun thing is that with this particular issue ccp said they already had a new plex distribution system waiting in january and that they would implement it right after apocrypha but thats what they say with just about any fw issue soontm and then it just doesnt happen for over a year
i am pretty sure minmtar outnumber amarr at any given timezone greatlythere were always lots of you around spread among all systemsmost of them just did not seem to care to defend arzad so you lost it againfirst few days after you capped arzad there were very big minamtar fleets active after dt that greatly outnumbered usand because most of your milita didnt bother about arzad anymore you now want ccp to intervenethe amarrminnie fw zone is already designed greatly in minnie favour and still not enough also arzad was lost due to other faulty mechanics in the first place1 the fact that amarr npcs can be speed tanked by almost any frig with ab easily2 abusing of the timer bug
not support unless more is done to fix fwveshta has a more valid point to fix fw as a whole rather then asking to fix one part you have the numbers minmatar just convince them to be on after dt you have done it before 
imo the amount of effort spent capturing or recapturing some system is irrelevant here the problem is that currently all plexing in captured systems takes place only after downtime it just doesnt make sense to have most important stuff taking place at a time where the least amount of people can be online in europe only the unemployed and lazy college students are able to attend postdtso either have it happen at some other predetermined peak time or have the plexes spawn randomly over the course of a day or some other solutionsupported
got to say i agree with vesh on this point gets ready for friendly fire in next fleetarzad was taken because some ppl actually helped our die hard plexers for once but unfortunately that help did not continue and arzad was easily retaken the mechanics are the same for both sides so i dont get why anyone would claim they have anything to do with it tbhwe minmatar constantly complain about the near total absence of amarr in the war zone during off peak times and its a legitimate observation which is why i dont understand why when arzad has been recaptured suddenly the minmatar are outnumbered around dt its simply not true when i log on post dt i see all war zone local channels filled with purple stars and definitely waaay more purple than orange the truth of the matter is that arzad fell because we couldnt raise enough pilots out of the many on line at dt to defend itin short the minnie militia in general do not give a crap about plexing and that is why arzad fell not some mechanics that affects both sides equallyi would support this proposal too but fear it would be seen as plexing is now fixed which it certainly would not be as this change on its own would do nothing significant towards making anymore ppl plex unless plexing earns lps and actually affects the systems in some meaningful way such as docking rights the large majority of fw pilots will still never care about themnot signed withstanding a great deal more reworking of the plex system and fw as a whole
this thread is not about why one side cant get sufficient numbers for the postdt fleetsthis thread is about the question whether a game mechanic that makes postdt fleets the most important fleets by far is a sensible game mechanicit doesnt matter who benefits from that game mechanic currently its a stupid game mechanic
trust me i have tried solo capturing in every conceivable ship the vengeance can do some plexes if of you tank it like mofo and even then its dicey you severely underestimate the effect of the tpmissile spam  avoiding damage while remaining in capture range is practically impossible at least in amarr hullswhich one the moving plexes or blackhole moving is what dark used to take halmah in less than 45 daysblackhole has been mentioned by ccp i believe plex spawning is based on exploration code and if they spawn in an illegal system they are taken out of rotation makes sense as amount of plexes approaches zero as day progressesvp to capture was changed before amarr started the long clawback process you are referring to the bunker hp buff i think  i know because i was the first to max rank under the revised vp system the spawning mechanic most definitely needs to be near top of list when the proverbial thumbs are taken out up there in icelandwe should create thread with a comprehensive list of all the things that has to be included everything is scattered across a billion threads
please do  im happy to contribute my ideas too 
you made it about that by implying arzad fell because of the post dt mechanicbut the recent capture of arzad by the minmatar  in a multiweeklong campaign  and then recapture within five days because a majority of the plexes spawned postdt and almost none during the day showed that the problem is still presenti pick you up on it because 1 i disagree that it adversely affected minmatar more than amarr as is implied by ur statement and 2 i disagree that plexes spawning evenly thru the day would have made any difference at all arzad fell thru a complete lack of interest in defending it a lack of interest that affects all timezones there is simply no reason for most pilots to give a  about occupancyi think it is important to make this point because i fear that if ccp only fix the spawn times without making plexes mean something the problem will still remain barely anybody will do them
noi stated that the fall of arzad showed me that the bug is still in place  it was not obvious before that it was mainly because the amarr were mostly stronger than the minmatar but not enough to break more systems so the postdt bug was not really apparent i made no claims about what would have happened to arzad if the bug had not been in placei repeated this a few times tooi argued against the absolutely silly game mechanic of plexes stacking up in a single system when the minmatar captured halmah toocould we now please go back to the topic at hand  whether a game mechanic that makes postdt fleets the most important fleets in fw regardless who currently benefits the most of that if anyone is a good game meachnicthanks 
i agree with op that this is not relevant to the topic about the topic i do support it
sure go back to discussinggettin a fix for this broken mechanic in isolation and then marvel in ur own silliness when you realize you have achieved nothing since barely anybody will do them stillno discussion of plexes is meaningful unless all the related factors are taken into consideration you are changing a tire on a carwreck with this approach but pls carry on edit this whether a game mechanic that makes postdt fleets the most important fleets in fw is the bit i have the most problem with in reality at least as far as plexing goes the most important fleets are those that actually give a  about plexes since the vast majority do not that relegates the dt spawns pretty far down the list of what is wrong with plexes lack of rewardspenalties for doingnot doing them and npc imbalances rate far higher on the list of reasons why ppl do not do plexes and lose systems as a consequence
agreed minkert more diversity would be nice and it benefits all players guys at the bottom of the food chain arent necessarily benefiting from the new t3 stuff as it will be quite a while before they can useafford any of it
all boils down to the allseeing local chatremove it and there is no need for logonski
just make all stations kick outs o
i often question myself as to why we have self destruct there are many reasons it is needed  such as getting rid of ships u no longer require and claiming insurance or indeed bieng trapped in a wormhole selfdestructing and then podding urself to get home  fair enough these are acceptable in the past two weeks we have had 2 x carriers tackled in missionsplexes and an orca in wh space  whats the first thing they do self destruct this is not because are stuck  its simply to deny the attackers of a km and loot eve online says that they are trying to promote gang warfare  in every aspect but when it comes to this there is simple no way to kill a carrier with a decent tank in under 2 mins unless you have a large fleet  if your on a roaming gang and cannot refit ships then its pritty much pointless suggestions increase time on self destruct ie larger the ship the longer it takes to self destruct or do not let the self destruct inatiate if the target ship is pointed by players any feedback of similar situations would be welcome i know this is an issue and its begining to annoy me im sure there can be something done about this and done just say get a bigger gang support would be welcomed  i mean how many times have u missed out on a kill due to self destruct and the the person rubbing it in your face in local

agreed
p4rky  carebears
sounds good to me its just a griefing tactic on us pvpers from carebears
signedi like the idea of no selfdescruct for the target when he is pointed this gives a new option for pirates to steal shipsbecause the only options to escape for the victim is to loose the ship through damage or leave it with the pod

not supportedguess what even if you didnt get a killmail you still accomplished your goal the enemy ship is deadand so you didnt get a chance at loot that just means the opposing player made a smart tactical decision to deny it to you
actually you should not be able to self destruct a ship at all
this
the logic is sound but i dont give a damn about killmailsso not supportingbecause thats what this is all about a egotistical epeen extensionthe ship still dies that and the tactical reasons involved
this if you didnt bring enough dps to kill them in time its not their fault
this
so you would rather every kill was a blob and they almost insta pop things  no fun in thatthis is a broken game mechanic and it is being abusedself destruct timer based on ship size makes total sense
i will know very soon if i will be pushing for this d

simply remove the self destruct mechanic theres simply zero need for it if the pilot doesnt want their ship any more all they have to do is eject

you have to think about more then your personal interests herethe killer should get the kill makes perfect sense if you want to abandon your ship just eject

10
this morning i woke up and felt like destroying something im sure the capital dev team can relateanyways sported
fully support
probably too late but i support leaving the naglfar alone
fear the monstrously op naglfar that would have been so op after changes that it came prenerfed
so the minmatar main weaponsystem is artillery thats why the minmatar dread gets a bonus to missiles ie secondary weaponsystemseriously wtfartyshipsrupturecyclonehurricanemaelstromtempestskill progression ie small artymed arty and so on continous and sensiblemissileshipsschytetyphoonnaglfarmisselstorpscitadel cruiseskill progression wtf
yeah this patch is really something elsenaglfar terrible for years finally after thousands of tears and petitions it gets a rational well thought out fix that made everyone happy it even improved the racial feel of the nag giving the xl projectiles a chance to shinenow this nerf completely out of the blue or did i miss the because of naglfar threadsadditional kicks in the nutsbonuses worse than the original terrible nagtack on another month of training time yayan asidewishful thinking perhaps butthe patch states that the projectile rate of fire bonus is removed for the missile fire bonus does that mean the nag at least keeps the 75 damage bonus or are we looking at the 5 5 nag from sisi meaning pages of feedback and rational ideas meant precisely nothing
this is driving me nuts i feel ill reading all this i love the nag but ccp must hate it why gimp it again they gave us a good ship for what 23 months then they go right back to crap when i first got my dread i trined capital armor capital arty and cit torps more training then any other cap then they patched it now i train sheild more training but thats ok i guess its a good ship now then this patch they gimp itoh and more trining to put cit cruise on it so now i gotta train another capital weapon system to make my ship worse ok i need to get up and walk around a lil as i am starting to shake oh ps what the hell do you mean i have to target paint a dread to hit it well you gotta be kidding me
yes literally the same for me until i learned about these changes i might as well go for the revelation now or the moros just to be a little differenttank your dreads for emtherm people
its a straight up fact that at 75 damage 75 rof projectiles the naglfar would do too much damage in light of the cap weapon and projectile ammo changesbut making it split weapon again is just ridiculous reduce the bonuses to an acceptable level if its necessary but this split bonus crap is untenable there was a excellent post in dominion cap ships blog that showed that 75 damage 5 rof projectiles wasnt bad at all
its also a straight up fact that a considerable part of too much damage would never have connected with the target due to being speed  sig tanked
youre referring to the awful missile explosion radius im assuming and youre right on that part its the changes to ammo  capital range weapons that made the naglfar a monster however three turrets with a 25 firing speed bonus moros rev is an effective 4 turrets two turrets with 375 damage bonus and 375 rof is an effective 4407 turrets on tq projectiles are pure suck enough to warrant this375 damage and 25 rof would be an effective 3666 turrets it would end up with the highest paper dps still but the missiles would still be pure suckage to the point that it was on the same footing with the rev and moros25 damage and 25 rof would be 3333 turrets for reference the sisi nag has 25 turrets and 2666 incredibly ty launchersedit still supported both bonuses need to be turret based
quit hatin on the nag ccp
i doubt you will have a chance they explained multiple times why they changed it
sadly i have to agree with darius herei dont like that change i hate the reason behind of it but theyre not going to change it given the reason
example typhoon class battleshipcurrent bonus 5 damage bonus to large projectiles 5 damage bonus to torpedoes and cruise missilesproposed bonus 5 bonus to large projectiles and torpedo and cruise launchers another bonus follows 5 to shield boost amount per level just an exampleassumption made currently split weapon systems are unpreffered choice for pvpgoal to make ships with split weapon systems more viableeffects of the change as i see them while you still have problem with having to use two damage mods if you ship is all outriged for tank it does not matter now you could use split weapon system not to rely on just one type of weapon meaning if soemone speedtanks your gun missiles still hit generally i want to make all ships with split weapon systems more viable in pvp because i like ships in split weapon systems and their inferiority dissapoints me i propose to merge all bunuses to weapon for ships with split weapons into one and give them an additional bonus that fits their role eg bonus to tank or maybe rof bonus your thoughts
you missed the news the phoon just gets buffed 55 highslotsso now you can make it 5 torps and have 3 utility slotsor 5 projectile turrets
your post only oonfirms what i saidpeople do not tend to use split weapon systemsthis change would promote split weapons and this is not just about typhoon their is plenty of other ships with 2 weapons including drone ships and ships that have both missiles and hybrids
as a caldari missile pilot i would be affected by this but i agree defender missiles should attack all incoming enemy missilessupported
no support missiles are finally relatively well balanced complaints about them being either too powerful or too weak are few and far between and it seems like the majority of experienced missile users are satisfied i would rather see defender missiles just removed at this point then risk throwing off missile systems for who the hell knows how long
im fine with the down time block clear if the right click report does not auto block them at the same time

yes the csmccp meetings would take 5 minutes to approve too for some reason it took them 3 months
for those who paid attention to the original announcement it statedthus i for one am not surprised that there is no public announcement yet
december 1 is patch day i think they are putting more effort into getting that taken care ofin addition they already said they would announce on the second of december
yes black ops dont really need to tank but they should atleast have some t2 resists  the same hp as their t1 counterpartsthe main thing that kills them is ty bonuses and horrible jump range sin is additionally disadvantaged due to drones and even as a gunship it would be rather subpar with rails being rather low dps but blasters cant reach 20km either rest of them can easily get about 25km range with their short range weapons also panther needs another turret and being changed to a shield tank lows  mids

i disagree with the opno new ships splitting up your ability to transport costing 2x the skilltime and 2x the materials to do a single task haulingsimply introduce ship docking arrays of various sizes these are just different sorts of cans just like general freight no planq affectthey cannot be accessed except at a pos tower orcacarrier ect or stationsmall 10k m3 usable for hauling smaller rigged ships via a standard industrial roughly the same as can be carried currently as packaged vesselsmedium 150k m3large 400k m3giant 900k m3essentially these cans should be able to haul around 12 as many ships as they would if they were packaged a frig equivalent 5k m3 a bs 100k m3 ect ships must be assembled and can have no cargo of any sort not even ammoediton a side note maximum courier package sizes are being changed to 900k m3 so you can now courier assembled battleships
yes but even with the new change ull only be able to fit one tier 3 bs in which case u might as well fly the bs itselfthis is for the transport of ship that are assembled and riggedalso for the cans im guessing ur going with our second suggestion on reducing lag when a ship transport pops what do u propose be the volume of the can itself cause at this rate ur just as well off setting up a courier to move rigged ship but is again limited to only one or two bses
a tier 3 bs is how large when its packaged lets say its 50k m3 the cans or whatever they be bays racks ect should double the packaged size of the ship so in this example a tier 3 bs would be 100k m3 and youd then be able to carry 9 of them in the largest size of these proposed containers but you could also use a smaller can and have room for a few general freight cans as welli strongly dislike the idea of yet another tech 2 besides hull with yet another required skill for such a very very limited function we have a ship already capable all that is needed are the containersedithonestly for all that it matters haulers should simply be able to haul ships regardless of their state with the cargo limit no cargo no ammo except in weapons in place freighters and their ilk cannot be accessed in space so the can never become a deployment platform anyway except at a pos in limited situations so why the big problem just making ships transportable as cargo in these superhaulers regardless of statealso assembled ship sizes need to be brought down considerably on all subcapital hulls anyway
been thinking about this for a long time i think that now that we have super carriers we should now have a true mothership insanely slow speed insanely low warp speed ultraweak tank can use normal stargates only due to some lolrp reason no high slots no med slots no low slots no rigs make the ship bay size the ships bonus so it can move a maximum of say 30 fully fitted and rigged battleships at max skills lots more littleuns relatively low build cost say in the same range of dreads lots of risk for lots of rewards with a kickass escort
the abaddon is 495000 mUFFFD and other tier 3 bses have similar numbersso roughly 500000 mUFFFD or half a millionand sure they could reduce the size of an assembled ship but then u get the whiners that know that a ship that size cant possibly be that size in volumeits being realistic since a bs is about a kilometer long we have to make 20 the maximum because thats roughly the number that can be fit in 10000000 mUFFFD of spacethe nidoggur is a little over 11000000 mUFFFD so any thing much more than 20 battleships worth would give ppl enough space to get a carrier into highsec which is why freighters lost there ability to be riggedexcept in that case it was because a rigged normal freighter had the space to fit a packaged carrier 1000000 mUFFFD
not necessarily i mean seriously there are alot of modules that have the whole can has be fitted  no  can has be fitted  yes argument same with live ammo in a contract just make it so you cant put capital ships of any kind in them
could be nice
insanely slow speed insanely low warp speed ultraweak tank this sounds like all risk no reward no one would buy it or fly ita little background on the conversation that started this thread a lot of people in this game have multiple accounts and lots of rigged ships between all those accounts those are the only people i can think of that would even need a ship that can move multiple rigged ships for the most part i know a number of people who use the orca to move their frigs and cruiser but its only barely usefull for and not intended for the roll of uhall especially when rigged battle cruisers and battle ships comes in
gah my math fails ignore such drivel
this new ship wouldnt break anything that we already have good idea
yo dawg i put a freighter in your freighter so you can haul while you haulnot supported freighters are too small to visually hold more than 2 assembled bs carriers can only hold 2 shesh and you want 20 in your supership
i didnt read the whole thread but i read the entired csmccp meeting and they confirmed that the courier contracts will accept up to 900000 m3 in fact exactly a charons capacity with caldari freighter 5you still wont be able to drop a ship directly into the cargo hold but you can create a courier contract move assembled ships that way were already able to move assembled cruisers courier contracts in a freighter but we will now be able to move assembled battleshipsbasically your whole thread is useless because the issue is going to be resolved very soon
so you can move 1 whole battleship inside another slower ship wow youre right thats exactly what we were talking about and this thread is now over sarcasmwhat we are proposing is something like a car carrier for ships

they need to make it so being concorded isnt game over in its current state concord is vastly overpowered and those brave enough to act in high security space are unjustly punished for their boldnessmy solution make it possible to fight concord like militia rats
and then people start farming concord again as it was in the pastno thank you
well farming miners in belts gets pretty dull id welcome the change
i can support this clearly you shouldnt be able to profit by getting your ship destroyed on purposei just dont understand how concorde can pay insurance for ships they destroyed please support my post
insurance needs to be looked at2 quick fixesno payout for self destructno payout for gcc destruction
i just read the patch notes and apparently they are going to make containers without a password lock on it transparent at a distance this is a great step in the right directionas always it would be great to hear from a csm delegate as to the status of this request of ccp have they given an answer on whether or not this might find its way onto the server any time soon if not what was their reasoning any information would be great
ofc

agree just lower the lp if the reward is too high
supportedthe relatively high reward of fw missions was driving people to lowsec ive heard complaints that its too easy for the missioners to warp off and avoid a fight without risking anything from failure but you arent going to have any of these missioners to fight at all if people dont run theseive been on both sides of the equation and id rather have a higher volume of rabid carebears to shoot at
the problem are stealth bomber soloable missions for eg caldari there is big disparity between diffictulty level for the factions ccp please do a real fix an redesign the missions by adding some gas glouds andor tons of fast tackling npcsthe main issue seems to be the possibility to decline missions without gaining a standing loss a simple balancing should fix this easily just allow to drop and grow lps in dependency of how often given mission is finished if people have to accept missions up to 16 jumps or similiar the fw missions are doomed again not counting mission time this will vary with current 4h fix the fly time alone will take up to 35 minutesso at the end we will possibly end at some 2560min per mission  gallente needs more time and bigger ships if soloing i dont think a hisec lvl4 mission runner will be motivated to step into lowsec and run fw missions if its come to the monetary aspectother issue is a current lp distribution in dependency to the mileage there is no one or at least i see no one 3 jumps or 16 jumps  the all pay the sameoh and thisimho the real income is around 5060mhour which is in acceptable range compared to high sec lvl4 40mhour with much less risk involvedmy calculation was the same all exagurated calculations based on best case scenarios or cosmos tricks fix fix  are not the general situationcurrently i cant see any competition at all or very fewfor matar fw items  that shows me the current fw mission system is just fine at least for matarisame for gallente any change would make it worthless  and ppl will go back to doing braindead lvl4s in high secthis is the way we heading atm could be true if a player already grinded a few dozens milions of lps he of course would be in favor of fixing a intresting question would be if those ppl who whine for a nerf actualy have tons of lps prepared for a artificial created monopolyi think ccp could take a closer look into this issue too contrary to other nerffixboost threadnoughts i do not see a broader group of players but a very significant small clique with a few bandwagon minions 
while i agree with the statement that some fw mission tend to be too easy and the cherrypicking is probably not what was intended here are some thoughts for you that i hope will keep you from doing that stupid change in the next patch ccp1 just changing it back to the state it was before cherrypicking was possible is the easiest dirtiest fix one could think of you didnt put a single second of thought into this obviously the missions are imbalanced otherwise people wouldnt click decline and request so frenetically to get a better mission changing it back to the previous state is changing nothing on this imbalance it was bad before the cherrypicking and it will be even worse if you change it back2 as stated it will be worse than before the decline timer got removed why well lp dont have a fixed isk value the value of lp is determined by what you can get for them what people are willing to pay for that and most importantly by competition exploiting the fw missions doesnt make isk out of nothing actually lp inflation made possible through this exploit will just drive prices for fw lp shop items down now what happens if you allow a few people to farm those missions while others havent discovered this yet and now change it back of course what wasnt exploitable at all up to now suddenly puts those who farmed between the patches at a huge advantage this has been stated before but i will say it again lp supply will go down dramatically after the patch and prices for the unique items will skyrocket do you really want those navy tier 1 bs to be so expensive i liked the idea of them being flown on a regular basis at last they will always be more expensive than their standard version3 there are lots of other problems regarding balance of fw missions for example while the good three in lvl4 gallente missions can be flown solo with an ishtar or dualboxing with a stealth bomber and a speedtank caldari missions can be flown solo with a stealth bomber the latter two impose zero risk except for a 5second or so window when warping to the mission beacon btw did you know that systems in black rise tend to be larger and thus warps are longer on average caldari of course get the edge by being able to solo those mission riskfree i heard for minmatar missions it is the same why dont you tackle those imbalances instead of reintroducing that timer4 the timer was removed because some combinations of missions and location are just too hard for any sane player to do while removing the timer completely might have been a bad idea why the 4 hour timer fw missions are not comparable to lvl4s in highsec there you compare missions only by their profitability also you have more agents per system you can ask if you dont like a given mission in fw some missions are more profitable ie faster to complete but an additional factor is risk which doesnt exist in highsec also there arent as many agents which can be asked for another mission giving it the same timer is just stupid why not introduce eg a 5 minute timer it will prevent the players from choosing only the very best missions at the very best places but it will still keep it possible to choose your mission if you really want to didnt you even think of this most simple varianti find point 2 the most important i too have been farming those missions some of them with corpmates in a wolfpack some of the solo dualboxing i get bored of farming too fast but i already have piled up some lp for dominion i would certainly get more money out of them if you really are so stubborn ccp but i would rather see faction ships flown more regularly in pvp as of now the price of faction ships is determined by their value for pve rather than pvp see navy raven which is currently worth nearly 15 times as much as a navy mega

insa rexion i must say you have earned my respect by looking at the whole picture in wanting to fix faction warsits finialy good to hear from the other side respect to you for it
i dont think theres an inability to view the bigger picture i think its just a differing of opinionas far as making plexingoccupancy worthwhile i dont think that needs any changes at the moment if you want to make isk out of fw you have missions in place that are simple to blitz in a matter of minutes if you want reasons for plexing there shouldnt be much more required than pvp and rp reasons plexing brings fights arzad didbut on the topic of the postdt mechanicwhile some people could care less about this these people tend to be those least affected by it those who can play postdt it is very frustrating for someone like myself who has to stay up past 4 am to partake in postdt plexing i did it a couple times after we captured arzad but theres no way a working person can maintain that kind of schedule its rediculous people expect us to make rl sacrifices in the name of a fake game does this really seem reasonableno it isntas far as getting people interested in plexingim curious where you got this data that nobody gives a  about plexing there are many plexers in the minmatar militia you should feel fortunate you are not in the gallente militia the majority of minmatar pvpers understand now that plexing can bring lots of fights if done properlyif you want a big fw patch great i do too and ive wanted one since i started but talking about the postdt mechanic like its not important is not looking at the bigger picture fw should be equally fun and meaningful to everyone a us player who cant partake in postdt plexing will care less about occupancy as they realize its not something they have much control over when their efforts predt will be reversed when they wake up the next dayyes the ability to solo plexes is not acceptable i think everyone realizes that also the ability for someone to bug a plex so that it continues to time itself down even when the plexer has left system or died yes im mentioning this because its the amarrians favorite exploitif you have suggestions for fixes im sure you will be listened to however if all you aim to do is point at the other problems to say look this isnt the only thing wrong with fw then i think you are wasting your breath fwers know there are a multitude of problems
i think all sides heavily use that bugbug report 87218 in case a dev or bh reads this 
and 39065
honestly i dont disagree with you and i hope this gets a fix as i see it must be very frustrating for players such as urself my main fear is that if fixed in isolation ccp may view this as plexing is fixed when it wont be if only a very small age of players still engage in itwhen 2 opposing sides in faction war both legitimately claim they won using 2 completely different but valid yardsticks kills vs systems then something is very wrong yes plexes can sometimes get fights but the majority of them are taken without even a whisper of resistance the link between plexing and combat is tenuous at best and this needs to be changed but whatever i do not wish to undermine this particular issue further it is a ty mechanic and i support fixing it lets also make an effort to address the other problems in tandem with this one
yes pleasei think there are two levels of complexity in the brokeness of fwthe simple level is stuff that is simply broken postdt plex spawns the vastly different npc danger levels the keep timer running bug and such things that require some kind of programming effort but nothing morethan there are conceptual problems for example the lack of stronger ties between plexing and pvp the whole idea of plexing etc  things that require a game designer to sit down and figure out a better wayfixing the former would be a great step ahead and likely requires not that much work fixing the latter would be awesome but requires a lot of work so starting with the simple stuff first would be great
this to be honest i dont mind babysteps as long as were getting somewhere

i support this
you already have a lot of ships and modules that are unused because something else does the job betterif you start adding more stuff it will either make the current stuff useless if its better than the ones used now or will become useless itself thats the balance problemadding more stuff just for the sake of having new things doesnt make any sense try pointing a niche which those new modules or ships would fill and then you can think of new stuff

this is pretty funny lots of familiar names in this threadwhenever the issue was raised in the last year regarding docking games in highsec these are the same people who would flame with l2p or go to 00not supported let them experience how ridiculous docking games are firsthand 
supported bump
sounds solid resetting the timer on every aggro is a good proposal
great idea sir your spot on 
on the first sight i was not in favor of this solution i always was thinking of some kind of ship massdock timer dependency however after a few thoughts i think the proposal finally will prevent all those childish docking games at all either you fully commiting to a fight or stay docked aproved

this idea is neat and tidy
one minmatar terrorist supporting another
bump
support on concept i would sugest that you compare t1 firgs to the asault ships and do a similar bump for the destroyer hull figure out the percentage bump to the base line stats and apply to the destroyers stats get this as a nice working concept and get one for each race ready for a base line once this is done post the proposed stats on the ships and moduals thread and perhaps pass around on batle clinic i garentee that this topic will be supported if you give people a working concept plan
looks good to me id say finally time we get a good tech ii destroyer instead of the paper thin dictors
yes
supportedimo an equally sound change would be to just disallow a self destruct if you are locked the code is already there for cloaking however keep in mind that disallowing a self destruct in such circumstances leads to situations where you could grief hard by keeping someone locked up and scrambled in order to keep them from going anyplace but thier desktop perfect solution is to just give a killmail in a self destruct but expect a resistance from ccp on that given what a mess the current code is and how difficult that might be to implementgl anyway with thisgj
that was me sorry

wthi would think that especially when a ship is pointed and the pilot knows there is no way to escape hell want to selfdestructwhats next no selfdestruct when the victim tried to fight back
also supporting this because it makes sense
do iittttttttt
for all you that have supported idea  thanks in the original proposal i did not mention the fact of removing the self destruct button all together  i would say that increasing the time makes sense for a larger ship ive read in other posts how people complain about how blobby eve is how gang warfare is always blobbyits simple if u have a gang of 6 bs you cannot kill a carrier before 2 mins is upand u say self destructing is a tactical move lol yeah ok basically its a cowards way out with no skill involved at all and in my opinion its abuse of a game mechanic you can tell who the pvprs areif u want to take a carrier into a plex then u should be prepared to lose it and have it fitted to save urself not just self destruct  lol i just laugh at the carebears saying oh no do not take our self destruct away
leave the selfdestruct timer as it is 2 minutes for all ships but cancel it as soon as someone locks you  should be very easy to implement
not supported try ransoming for once if your objective is to destroy the enemys ship then congratulations you just accomplished it i see no issue with the current sd mechanicsend of
thumb sidewayshalf support i dont care about the killmail he knows he died and i know he died and that is all that matters i just want the loot getting a ship to self destruct is the same has killing it yourself it would be nice if it dropped loot after the self destructmaybe we should talk no insurance on self destruct
id quite happily support no inusurance payouts on self destruct insurance should be for losses you cant control ie someone blew you out of space not losses you initiated such as self destructingas for removing the selfdestruct option thats a load of hooey cowardly or not and thats a subjective response it is a viable tactical move to deny the enemy resources in the form of loot and tactical information in the form of the kill mail detailing exactly what you were carryingfitted with selfdestruction aka scuttling in naval terms has been a viable tactic since the advent of naval warfare get over it and move oni would support lengthening the self destruct timer based on ship class if you need an rp reason call it time to reach critical mass for the reactor is longer the larger the ship is but only if that means the time gets shorter for small ships say 15 seconds for frigates to match their inability to actually survive for two minutes under firei mean im just saying that door oughta swing both ways
if you dont have enough firepower to take out a ship before it self destructs way i see it you dont deserve the killmail anyway you say it yourself the game is supposed to promote gang warfare      bring more peoplesorry
right reasoning wrong conclusions if everyone is supposed to run around in a fleet that can kill 800k ehp in 120 seconds small gang pvp will be a thing of the past
if they forced a self destruct then they did kill it killmails aint the end game and there isnt any issue here loot and a killmail is just the icing on the cake but if it self destructed you accomplished what you set out to do no need to whine and scream grief1 sd working as intended if you still think youre being griefed then this isnt the game for you andor you need to htfu
yes
so youre saying the op who started this thread actually had more ships available to use but chose not to use them to preserve small gang pvp of course not im sure they used every ship they had available at that time just like everyone else does the status quo now did not eliminate the ops fleets that could not kill the large target before it could self destruct not changing that status quo will somehow change fleet sizes going forward not logical
daaaaaamn im glad i focused on subcapitalsit seems with every patch they nerf this capital or that capital despite nothing being wrong with itcarrier haulage  nerftnaglfar  nerft fixt nerftat least now i can fly  well everything below capitals so when they nerf a favorable ship i can find another
this is a horrific change by ccp please leave it with a single weapon system being bonused
dominion patch notes are out and they really seem to want to go through with thisme cries and trains for revelationthanks for the support everybody so far damn if goons and wizard hat rpers aggree on one issue ccp should really make up their minds
ahh teh poor old nag  cant it just be left in peace thats an agreeing with op
the one dread i actually want to fly and ccp turn it back to  buggeri may be able to hit up caldari or gallente comfortably but im never training up ammar online i like vertical ships damn you
by monster i assume nohz means kitten modify the turret bonus if needed but down with split weapon bonus
is there any reason not to just use the revelation now
the dominion trailer has a subtle hint  the only nonwreck dreadnoughts are revelations  destroyed moros naglfar and phoenix hulls are all visible in the wreckage field shown during the first minute
fully supported will sell my dreadnought skillbook if this isnt fixed in the next patch 
cant fly it but dont need to to know that split weapons are terribad
finally i wanted to train matari caps back to the drawing board with that plan
im not sure if anyone else agrees with me on this but can we please have more class 2 and 3 wormholes  i used to have a pos setup in a class 2 back when the wormholes were new i left the system but kept a scout in it just in case i wanted to come back its been like 67 months now and i decided to go back of course the system is taken now which i knew would happen eventuallyhowever i have been scanning constantly now for a week straight in low sector and high sector sometimes 46 hours a day accross gallentecaldariand minmatar space while i find alot of class 2 and 3 and 5 wormholes all the class 2 and 3 are taken i have found some class 3 that are empty but the class 2s seem to be all taken either by big corps or 12 man corps iv talked on the exploration channel offering 50100m for a empty class 2 if anyone has found one but everyone reports the same thing they are all taken nowif it is true that there is only 2400 or so wormholes i would hope that sometime in the future ccp would add more wormholes especially class 2 and 3
im sure if you check you will find that some towers in c23 that show up on scan are actually abandoned i share my wspace with 23 other people as we get too many sites for 1 person to keep clear especially when the gas clouds and roids pay a visit weve actually seen plenty of empty c3s that our c2 has had access to
yep its true they are all takenand the only c3 that are empty are the onethat have only static 00 and some with lo secas you can see the problem is with hi sec static exits which all c2 posses as far as i am aware  that makes logistics to easy i could even say nonexistent
perhaps its the static connections to highsec that are the problem remove those and logistics becomes more challenging and perhaps pos density would drop
if you want the access to the resources you either force them out or explore deeper they were there firstmany of the higher class wormholes are empty granted they are harder to keep up logistically but are generally more rewarding and saferalthough i would like to see ccp take a look at the higher class wormholes as some demand you having a 20 man fleet with lightning speed reaction i would like to see less numbers but more specialization fleets of all classes of ships instead of huge blobs of rr battleships and logistics
number of player complaining about local chan and want to see it disableim agree with them and notwith domi new way to improve systems we have a simple and effective solution to resolve the problem and make almost everyone happyccp make all nullsec local disable as in wh space and if a corpoalliance howner want a active local chan they have to anchor a special structure for it  a global system communicationthis module may require lev 2 sovereignty 21 dayslev 3 strategic upgradelev 2 military and industrial upgradeedit global interface system or global solar system communication are a better name gsc seem too familliar 
huh what a simple but good idea supported 110
every year we get awesome expansions to eve making the game look great work better and as we all like more new stuff toys to play with sometimes there are improvements to game play and balancing of modules and ships although some of the stuff that is done doesnt always appear logical and some things have been ignored for a very long time all i ask is that the csm has a wee word in the ears of the gods for one of their team to review the item database and makes a few corrections to stuff the makes little logical senseas an example of what i meanitem exotic dancers item name implies plural more than 1structure description for exotic dancers weight 50kg volume 1m3these are very small dancers i would expect an exotic dancer to be fit athletic even thus weight for one would be approx 75kg transportation volume allowance  15m3 eachsuch revisions should only require some database maintenance and should not have any influence on server load i suggest this as a startyourszirk
um seriously please tell me this is a troll post so i can go back to thinking that the bulk of people that play eve are past the middle part of the bell curve representing the human intelligence scaleif this isnt a troll  who the hell cares aside from you i mean are there really people out there obsessing about how much the exotic dancers weigh
no support  cause you can neutralized every missileboatbut  you can neutralize every gunboat with tracking disruptors that failed against missileboats  isnt itwe  should thinking about defenders   i support thinking im a missile pilot  cant hit a dread with a frig gun    
remember if there is 2 ravens thats 12 cruise missiles the defending ship would have to to have 8 turret slots and youd have to have two you made a good point about tracking disrupters there should be some sort of upgrade to these more than useless defender missiles
im not saying that the op is the best idea just that defenders seem to lack any sort of good use and that missile ships lack a true missile specific counters
to effectively combat the isk spammers they have to institute an automated system using pattern matching of any text that trial accounts send any mention of anything that looks like one of their adds should automatically flag them for a gm to quickly verify and they are banned within seconds of the first time they spam you also need to require a credit card or something for confirmation that isnt as easy to generate hundreds of disposables as an email address is then when perm banned for spamming they could not so easily go create more accounts right away
many people must have seen that in the last patch note changes have been made on the skill required for using covert ops cloaking device tech 2 before lvl 5 now lvl 4this is abnormal to change skills required to use such a modulesome bad effect will follow this changes for exemple 1m sp character able to stay cloaked for ages in a systemunfare change as usual by ccp  people have skilled to lvl 5 only to use the cloaking device tech2 and know have a lvl 5 skil that is not worth it  not usefull if people only intend to use the covert ops cloaki suggest that ccp changes the skill concerning the cocd as followslvl 1  allows cloaking device  cloaking time of 5 minlvl 2  allows cloaking device  cloaking time of 10minlvl 3  allows cloaking device cloaking time of 15 minlvl 4  allows covert ops cloaking device with 20 min cloaking timelvl 5  allows covert ops cloaking device with unlimited cloaking timelike this people that had skilled to lvl 5 do not loose skills and it prevents low sp character from having the possibility of staying cloaked for ages in systemso to resume no permanent cloak except lvl 5 cannot fit covert ops cloak if under lvl 4this will add a good thing ingame rather than being unfare and help more people to afk cloak in system thing that is totally stupid for pvp and pveno more hasbs  cloaked for ever when chased by gangno more afkcloak with ships other then black ops or covert ops recon tech 3more fun for pvpersthanks for reading 
i am not going to read the patch notes because if you are going to complain about something i am going to trust you to place the correct information in your complaint post has far has i know and i have three characters that can use cov ops ships with the cov ops cloaking device ii on them one for over a year now you have always only needed cloaking iv to use the devicedid i misunderstand your post or are you really only complaining about afk cloakers
he means electronics level v though i think along with engineering that is the most useful skill in the whole game i do believe we should be compensated for specific trains my alt had no need to train for electronics v other than for t2 cloak
thank you now i understand and yes it is still very much worth it to train that skill up to level vi got over being mad irritated and wanting compensation for skill training when ccp changed the remote sensor damps the day before i finished training for the gallente recon ships

hello darius this is a proposal post not a political or what so even postim saying that ccp will know allow very low sp charactere to have covert ops cloaking deviceand that people spent time to train lvl5 and so onccp originally said that it was lvl 5 to limite expension of covert ops cloaking especially concerning very low sp characteresim not speaking for or about tcf but just bringing a point concerning covert opsbest regards

vote match overviewthe vote match website presents the user with a list of statements pvp should be optional trade orders should have a 1000 isk minimum increment etc and compares the answers the user gives to the answers given by csm candidates using this comparison the website then calculates a match percentage neatly identifying and displaying which candidate represents the users views the besti have been collecting data on the website usage as a tool to improve and verify the questions this analysis uses the data gathered i also present a tenative census showing which candidates were most popular with the websites usersoverall post election assesmentpreparationthe preparation that was most important to the website was the gathering of questions i did this in several threads on the official eve online forums as well as the scrapheap challenge forums as my statistics show that only 5 questions will need to be changed to removed i think i managed quite well to get a good collection of balanced questions i did make one mistake in changing a question shortly before opening the candidate entry phase which resulted in two questions which more or less covered the same issue i decided not to change the question when i found out  but i will take greater care checking all questions before opening the candidate entry phase next timecandidate responseevemails were sent to all candidates informing them of the website giving them their login information and encouraging them to participate as the candidate entry phase progressed a reminder evemail was sent to all candidates who had not yet filled in a profile additionally i made two forum threads one here and one at the shc forums listing the unresponsive candidates to alert them or people who knew them i also tried starting ingame conversations with the unresponsive candidates through these efforts 38 out of 49 candidates made a profile two candidates chose not to participate because they felt the website did not represent their points of view or style of representation nine candidates did not respond at allpart of the reason will be that at least a portion of the candidates are leaders of large corporations or alliances which generally tenders their evemail unusable i hope to get a higher response rate in the next election when we call all enjoy an evemail client that is actually usableuser responseas this election was the first vote match was active in i am quite happy with the 3300 unique users see vote match usage below it has given good insight in the questions as well as show that the concept works i am quite happy to report the feedback i received from both candidates and users was overwhelmingly positivehowever as we have seen voter numbers between 20000 and 27000 in previous elections the current response lies far below the expected number of voters since one of the goals of vote match is to encourage more people to vote it is clear that the website needs more exposure in future elections this may be done through a more active advertisement campaign including loginscreen advertisement
vote match usagegraph of the 14 day election periodas the graph shows the first few days the website was open were also the busiest we reached over a thousand users in the first day this was as we expected we maxed out at 3389 unique users and 4614 users including duplicatesthe difference between the unique users and all users is most likely due to people taking the matching test several times out of curiosity as most of the difference stem from the first few days of the website being open additionally some matches by different people will register as the same user if they use the same ip address college campuses or office buildings any shared connection will generate a difference between all users and unique usersvote match question analysisthe answer index ai is the average answer on a question as all answers range from 2 to 2 a perfectly balanced question has an ai of 00 questions where the ai is greater than 1 or smaller than 1 are questions ill look into removing or changing as they do not get as many different answers as i would like as stated in the preparation paragraph i am also planning to remove one question which accidentally duplicated another issue only 4 questions are candidates for removal based on the current answers 1 question was perfectly balanced and resulted in an ai of 00question importance qi is also an interesting stat as candidates can mark 3 questions as being important to them a question that no candidate finds important is one i will review for removal or change only 1 question was not important to anyone the question that was marked important most often was marked important 9 timesvote match censusbefore listing the top tens i want to emphasise that vote match was never intended to be a census tool as such i am not posting these lists as a prediction but rather as way to see how the vote match users correlate with the actual results the reasons that the actual results can and most likely will differ from these lists is because we have no way of verifying that the vote match users are an accurate cross section of all voters in the election additionally it is quite likely that this website is used more by people who are not sure who to vote for and used less by people who already decided their vote an example of this would be pilots in an organisation that direct all their votes to a predetermined candidate for block voting this behaviour skews my statistics towards candidates that attract more floating voters the statistics also do not take personal ingame reputation into account which may very well move pilots not to vote for their highest match additionally 11 csm candidates have not been included in the matching process as they did not fill in a profilei have generated two candidate rankings based on two different calculations the first list is based on calculating how many voters have the candidate as their top match the second list ranks candidates based on the sum of fidelity for them of every voter top match1 z0d2 helen highwater3 alpais4 basta ya5 jonathan dawnchaser6 daugar draaken7 herschel yamamoto8 kirana9 mrs trzzbk10 elvenlordtotal fidelity1 z0d2 helen highwater3 alpais4 basta ya5 elvenlord6 mike azariah7 teadaze8 jonathan dawnchaser9 song li10 darth sith
the future of vote matchwhile i quite liked providing this service i think it would be best if ccp would incorporate a service like this in the csm section of the website since ccp has complete control over the sign up process they could achieve a 100 candidate response rate ccp can also reach out to the player base a lot easier than i can which means a lot more pilots would become aware of this website i did notice that particulary pilots who were not familiar with the candidates appreciated this service and as such i think that this could be a great tool to get more players involved in the election ccp did indicate they want to achieve a higher response rate and giving players a better insight in where the various candidates stand is paramount in thisas for the website itself one feature i hope to add for next time is the ability to chart the political position of candidates in two dimensional answer space it my sound a little abstract but it basically comes down to a chart like thisi would appreciate feedback to further improve this service 
thanks for providing this service and i agree that ccp should have a look at this and implement it in some formi dont like the dimensional graphs as eve is too complex to just pick some polar opposites and place candidates on a scale somewhere between them i like the question system much better
thanks diedra great post look forward to correlationevaluation of this versus the key results should be particularly interesting in respect to alliance influence on the outcome im sure there will be many lessons to learn for future candidates
i wouldnt remove the question system  the graphing would just be extra 
i agree that advertising directly on the clients main page at the logon screen would greatly increase visibility and make players aware of important events in far greater numbersthey could also greatly increase the numbers of voters if they incorporated voting after your initial logon and before choosing a character to get in the gameplayers could still at that point choose to vote or abstain from it
unfortunately i dont have 700mil to spend on a login ad p hopefully i do in 6 months
funny thing i didnt used it before vote but i was curious and used it after i voted actually best match 73 was with candidate that i have chosen strange thing i should say especially when considering why i voted for that candidate but maybe this thing works or it is just coincidencenice statistics anyway i just like statistics any kind of statistics
edit spellingconsider to also make use of topicsissues handled by former csm maybe in a second sectionthis second section will help to give a better profile on candidates and their overall knowledge of eve onlineand on a large sidenotevote match is a nice tool to see whos ideas match you the bestand with all the campaigns run its always about what are your ideas people with just good ideas can be the worst csmsthe results say nothing about a csms qualities ability to communicate efficiently some talk too much  we aleady got the point can we vote now  we already discussing in csm for over 4 hrs not sure if you have but i do have a real life  some write too much too detailed their ideas  tldri  too long didnt read it  being able to see the bigger picture or the lack off  too authistic  are you able to speakwrite topicsdiscuss in international understandable englishespecially native english speakers easily make use of not common englishwords it will make your fellow non native english csms have to grab the vocabulary book many times try to make use of more common words yes it will cost you more energy are you still being csm triggered to show up every time when the counsil gets together my topics i ran for candidacy have been discussed i have no further useinterest to appear in csmmeetings  i am only interested in my own topics do i really need to study on all the other topics wich is 89  i visited iceland i had my vip treatment by ccp i had my adventure like i said before when 9 muppets been elected we will get the muppetshow and not a working counsili hope the next run for csm vote matchwill be less about ideas only andor will include a section about candidates capabilities or just give a warning that vote match is a tool to match your ideas however it says nothing about the candidates qualities to be able to function properly within the counsil or maybe ccp xhagen should campaign more about what is being expected from csm candidates and what candidates can expect a summery of my post for examplex
if you can come up with an objective metric for a persons capabilities i would love to hear it i wasnt able to come up with one and im not going to resort to a checkbox are you a good communicator yesnoadditionally the text on step 4 reads
actually psycological test will be to much but that question that there are quite good though i think there should be more question about trade im personally trader thats is why its important to me i most of the time trade in jita for the last few monthsquestion likerenewal of ordersto rare reloadingquestions about wallet maybe for example not showing right number of isk in some situationsi just didnt thought it was important but somehow after i used vote match i realised that its hard for me to understand who is better based on how 00 works etc when my style of play differs from most of the players more questions for peaceful style of play like mining industry science trade would be good some csm candidates maybe dont care about it thats why many peacful industrialists and traders could vote for someone who cares for example one reason why i have chosen candidate i voted for was mentioning by him of some critical industrial defect in his program
having used tools like this in conjunction with real elections there is one extra feature i would wish for the ability for candidates to write short comments on the reasoning behind their answerstools like this make it easy pick out a few people with mostly compatible views but picking the best candidate from that pool is much harderthe reason a candidate agrees or disagrees with my view on any particular issue can be far more important than the issue itself it allows identification of both false positives and false negativesobligatory silly examplecandidate is in favor of universal health care stated reason we need universal healthcare so that dissenters can be sterilized
thanks for providing this please keep it up and improve for next time d
this could easily lead to information overloaddespite that it wouldve been nice to be able to justify hard choices maybe in addition to important questions it would be nice if candidates could justify just those questions it would suddenly add new weight to those questions
interesting to see you say this although you came up as my highest percentage match iirc i actually chose not to vote for you because you had no website and had little to no further information that i could base a final decision on
i submitted before creating a jpsc thread which was my mistake by the time i had the thread and its url i couldnt change the listing in the candidate page so i did the best i could to advertise the url for that thread in my bio in game and my signature herebut i am sure whoever you ended up voting for convinced you to vote for them which is the whole point of an electionhowever this isnt the place for this conversation
you could charge future csm candidates to participate you could probably even make a profit38 candidates  50 million iskcandidate  19 billion isk or you could do half that and still get past the 700 million mark
when is this announced
not until wednesday 
hi guys
am i the only one that read this and thought sour grapes but the results havent been announced yet are you going to be this negative if you get electedand the best way to convince people you are a good negotiator mediator and problem solver is to talk to people discuss things and not just your conclusion but your method of approaching that conclusion by doing that you can convince people to not only vote for you but to convince other people to vote for you
just decided to say dont ask why i havent said that earlier because i dont knowi used that vote match thing after i voted for candidate i have chosen i didnt need it to choose candidate actually vote match best result was that candidate who i voted for maybe it really works
