you havent invented time travel yet opened a thread to discuss mining in general and low sectldr  dock or die vs stand and fight playstyles
from a hisec mining perspective this would basically eliminate the skiff completely as weve seen from both the big odyssey change and the smaller kronos revisit hisec as a whole only cares about 1 tank and 2 yield in that order putting the hulk as the best in both those categories would make it the goto any time there was a hauler around not to mention opportunists either jetcan mining or mining into a freight container agility and speed just rarely matter in hisec because being surrounded by neutrals all the time makes it a lot harder to preemptively warp before threats landoutside of hisec and into the realm of speculation i suspect that rather than having procsskiffs take a niche as ninja miners they simply wont be used in favour of using better mining ships fitted with higgs rigs that are permanently aligned align timewarp acceleration dont mean anything when youre always two clicks away from entering warp especially when the nonprocskiff ships bring both better tank and better yield to the partyfinally im not so sure that anyone solo mining in a hulk would be a fool if i were a solo miner in nullsec i would definitely use your improved hulk id simply use jetcans as an external ore bay rather than warping it back to station every few minutes when a couple of cans are full or when hostiles are reported in intel anywhere nearby just park the hulk in a posstation grab a cloakmwd miasmos and clear out the cans you get the benefits of strong tank vs the nullsec belt rats and high yield and you mostly sidestep the issue of the small ore hold
what if the differences are as pronounced as between cruisers proc  skiff battle cruisers mack  ret and battle ships cov  hulk
here is your ad
miners will pick the ships based on the differences they like and then structure their fleets to cover the differences they do not likefor example they like more yield and they like more tank so they pick covhulk almost exclusively they do not like small ore holds or slow align so they bypass them with fleet haulers and with higgs rigging and permanent alignbut theyre not going to trade off both tank and yield for ore hold or agility not when there are alternatives
this would be the aim procs and skiffs would be the best solo  ninja miners that is brilliant going to try squeeze it in my bio and the op of this threadnow did you stalk me or just felt inspired because i often say i got lucky with this profile image just dont look at me in 3d makes it really funny
im glad you enjoyed it i had been thinking of doing that kind of video but hadnt yet you just got lucky or unlucky which ever way you see it
i am linking it in a url to people as awesome lewd videos share it with your friends
indeed ironically despite needing to get people to pay attention to you in order to get elected  a need for attention for attentions sake is counterproductive in that regardi think theres a definite element of that here in one respect at least this thread has been an object lesson in how not to run a csm campaign

i take offense at this postdear babby jesus help us if people start getting confused in reallife when youre not able to downvote in real elections
if people could opt out of pvp in low sec to some extent people would move there and be willing to undock in something more than a combat ship with a fleetmost of pvp goeshighsec is it a tank ship scan it does it have value yes kill it before concord gets you does it have value no keep scanning targets doesnt have a tank kill it just to kill it use an alt to scout a war target it is something to solo or gang up on yes jump in warp to altlow sec does it move yes kill itnull sec is it red yes kill it is it neutral yes kill it is it blue yes kill it is it blue and largeexpensive yes get others and kill itive been in pvp a lot been shot at by blues been ganked landing on station at 0 while waiting docking confirmation had terrribad fc figure they can attack a t3 on a gate with 200 reds in system and no one would respond been awoxed several times seen others ganked after just undocking most of the time going to low sec is greeted by smart bombs going to null is greeted by bubbles going to wormhole space is greeted by a fleetif people actually cared about economy or fleets people wouldnt be so quick on the trigger just for a kill mailid like to see the vast support of alts go away myself as the usual mo is use an alt or train an altwe have alts for every from boosting and logi so some one can solo fight to massive amount of production rather its building mining or injecting massive amounts of isk via missionsrattingincursions or what ever into the systemm the economy would be looking a lot better
unless ccp change ore beltanom composition or blueprint material list youll always be hauling tritpyemex to null in order to build anythingccp pushes nerfs and pretend to try to make null self sufficient when the whole system is designed from 2003 to make it self insufficient give ores belts the same composition as blueprint bill of material list then scale yield per unit of ore from 10 sec to 10 sec like rats do say 5 yield per unit of sec and suddenly you dont have to haul trit from highsec anymorebut that would make too much sense
where did they ever say they were making any area self sufficient eve has a long history of nowhere being totally self sufficient
look through the blogs i cant be bothered to find it for you but its among ones back during industry revamp
strange how long it takes to buy and set up some ships in another system sigh can you believe that some people actually play the game

xenuria at the risk of being labeled as a troll by yourself i do have some genuine questionsconcerns about your campaignfirst off is that your corp history is scary long you seem to not be able to stay in a corp for longer than a month at any time which shows a history of instability which is not good for a csm campaigner why is this the case and im curious as to how you feel you can be a stable and active csm member in light of thisanother is that you seem to handle criticism extremely poorly and lash out by either calling people trolls or just pretending they dont exist which is also a bad thing for a member of a political party even if it is space politics you will no doubt come under attack by members of the public who dont approve of your actions if you were to be elected and attacking them is only going to cause things to escalate further you will also come under attack from other members of the csm both in public and behind closed doors and you need to be able to keep your cool and frankly i dont think you would be able to do sothe third is that you personally seem to have had a history of controversy surround you which has caused some animosity with people in the community how do you see yourself overcoming thisyou seem intent on becoming part of the csm and while i dont agree with your motivations i wouldnt actively want to try and harm a campaign but there are some serious concerns to be addressed
proper use of your moneyno chance of wastei hope you at least did it with plex and scammed money so you didnt have to work for it yourselfeverything else youre using your moneytime to vote for a candidate failing both compared to other candidates and compared to no candidate at all and in competition with voters who at least for the nullsec vote  and in part for other areas with coherent functioning groups  is better organised both internally and between groups and have equivalents of party lists in other words you have to spend a lot to make any impactbut it gets worsewith your claim and i gotta say i doubt your honesty youre doing exactly what xenuria wants to abolish as a possibility youre using practises to elect a candidate who doesnt want anyone to get elected that way except id wager that xenuria runs on the platform of xenuria in the csm whatever it takes as kiryen obannon eloquently put it before furthermore when your attempt to buy the vote fails it will be another example of why xenurias current platform is worthless and even when attempted doesnt work for those without the proper means and for those with the proper means is unnecessary and a dumb expenseso heres my prediction your several accounts will make no difference you should have bought a couple of hundredyou used them to vote for a failing candidate who cant get elected in a fair election furthermore your method puts either your own understanding of the candidates platform in question or the degree to which your candidate truly believes in his own platform furthermore if you paid for these accounts from your own pocket it seriously puts your sanity into questioneffectively youre paying for the privilege that for a wellconnected candidate in the cfcn3pletc is a single ping away and im willing to bet isk that a nullsec ping is more effective in terms of voters than the upper limit of how many accountsaccounts youre economically and mentally able to producei hope youre countertrolling like i assume of aram but if youre honest i like this excellent example of the xenuria voter
dont forget to vote guys
full endorsement for this great man he does so much for eveonline and since he took over the community role at evebet i have been so completely astounded by how much he will do to support everyone and everything in our great community an integral part of our team and the perfect candidate for csm bam we are behind youevebet huntdirector of operations  staff
as i was scouring the interwebz i found an endorsement i did not know about it was very sekrit indeed thanks rixx javixx for putting me on your groot and best luck for your applications
you can find the podcast here thanks to dow for the efforts and especially the speed of the followup and posting of this
all of my ballots have you at the top i wish you luck in your campaign
what content have you organised for players
i dont think you know what the word convenience means
ive spread the word wide no less than 30 accounts have you at the top
1 youve got my vote again core as an almost 10 year player ive seen a lot of changes in and to the game its good to see other players stepup and dedicate the time energy and talents to make the game as good as its become thanks for the commitm
i am not sure that you have justified just why this discourages conflict just asserted it but leaving that to one side noeach time we moved space as an alliance we reckoned on losing between a quarter and a third of our membership they didnt in general leave for other alliances they just stopped logging in and we eventually had to kick them their stuff was trapped in hostile space because they happened to be on holiday or posted abroad or whatever when we had to move and it just seemed like too much effort either to smuggle it out or to start again with nothingso if ccp instituted something like that then they would almost certainly risk steadily losing nullsec players phoebe makes that even more likely having to travel in a system written to make travel awkward and annoying is not a good ideaedit oops i am endie i guess i should look more carefully at which character i select on the relevant page before posting
hi endiehere is my take on it using goonswarm as an example you guys hold deklien from what i understand its some of the best space correct me if im wrong in nullsec with regard to moons and ratting space you guys have held this region for at least as long as i have been playing  2012your position in deklien is unassailable and if you dont actually need any more space where is the incentive to fight anyone for anything other than for the tears where are the conflict driversif after time regions degraded in some way while others got better would that not create conflict and competition for the best space  whatever that means after the sov changeswe need good reasons to fight each other againas for members not playing because moving is a pain i imagine even more members stop playing because of boredom no wars to fight
one quibble i dont think that anyone in nullsec is currently unassailable i just think it would be horribly hard work to take down n3 or the cfcyou have a fair point on the gradual effect of boredom on subs but i repeat that losing even just a quarter of the nullsec playerbase every few months due to the system you suggest forcing constant moves and logistics on people  the low end of what we have seen  would soon see only a tiny remaining nullsec populationi am confident that goonswarm pl ncdot and the like would move to npc space charge protection money by bullying others and spend their time hitting the unprotected people who try to live in nullsec driving yet further numbers out of the game it would be a horrible outcome for eve nullsec would be a desert
im sure youre right its why i voted for you
lets see what ccps rizzie come up with this week and well know what sort of basis we are working from
the tension is just unbearable isnt it
i do feel i bring real value to the csm in the form of change management needs facilitation player issues pass through and the likehoweverif you are just voting for the shineys and the toys offered by ccp then you might as well drop some comedic value in there in the form of a harry saqjust sayin 
our roundtables are concluded and have been published you can find them herecsmccp relationship
that was a good time thank you to dow 
malc is probably referring to my post at the end of the day the vote calculation algorithm used by ccp is not known except maybe by csm who may be bound by nda not to impart any knowledgein the total absence of information all we have is conjecture and the desire to vote against a candidate is not a new one
recording is up on csm9org here
pvp isnt riskfree even missioner ganking last time i checked pretty much any ship can fit a tackle mod of some sort and the training time is what 15 minutes every player has the option to fit a point or more pvp mods in general while missioning if they are too greedy to not fit one then they have to bear the consequences one of the major gameplay aspects of eve is figuring out how to earn an income in the face of someone trying to stop you optingout of pvp not just in lowsec but highsec as well basically breaks the game by allowing riskfree isk making if anything ccp has been recently increasing the opportunities for conflict between pve activities and those that hunt them outside of highsec this drives conflict and is good for the gamei can see why your suggestion would increase pve activity in lowsec but i can see no way in which that is good for the game overall if you want more noncombat ships in lowsec increase the reward or funness for that activity not reduce the risk

poke voting ends mar 10 how are ya feeling
and how about that ccp addressed it really impressed by the amount of effort hes put in corbexx getss both my votes
today ccp released a new dev blog related to sov changes this is a big step for the game and ccp is looking for feedback on their current plans check my feedback here and post in that thread your own opinion as it will be the most watched thread for the next few days
heres an image of a kitten to thank my voters
good luck sabriz as an autz candidate ive been mindful to give you equal mention along with myself and cagali when ive posted or spoken about the csm in the context of eve down undereve down under  a community for players in the autz
i am not the one running for csm with a platform of content creation neither are you  but by all means keep answering for sabriz confirmation of the point i made the aim here is player driven content you get this right so if incursions are risk free then the blame lies with those fail to bring that risk it is obviously important to someone now sabriz cites rl  totally fine i trust everything is in hand going forward but no one else takes up the torch including you this clearly demonstrates that is not important enough
well sabriz did understand what i was asking and the answer i received was satisfactory but since you did not i have since edited it for clarity note especially for you it was typed slowly you dont read very fast if you takes days to notice
wow so much bitter im not sure why you are implying an ingame effort to create content has any relevance to the purpose and daily activities of the csm of all the roles it has grown to fill running ingame contests isnt really something the csm is forsabriz i have cast my multiple ballots for you you have had an uphill battle for a seat with all the competition this year but i am optimistic that your campaign has reached many and you have a shot at one of the last seats your thread has the most likes of any and only toras has more views people if you havent voted and you want an engaging new eden full of excitement conflict and energy a new eden where a proper risk and reward balance drives players towards evermore hilarious destruction putting sabriz as your 1 is a really good idea
i imagine its because a csm candidate where candidates are expected to have enough time to essentially have the csm as a second fulltime job claiming to be a content creator purely because all gankers seem to feel they create more content than any one else while simultaneously failing to create content because of out of game commitments is falling down on both the content creation and the ability to free up time for the csmexcept thats not how its going to happen i mean first of all sabriz only wants content for one group of players  people who want pvp from the comfort of highsec and want to force people who have no chance of beating them to have to fight back secondly even if he makes it to the csm he wont have control over the direction of the game its more likely hell be seen as overly negative be involved less in csm processes and ultimately be a wasted vote
running on a platform of content creation in no way requires him to run events also rl happens of course to an npc with a blank killboard none of this will make much sense as youre just here to troll thanks for keeping the thread bumped though
vote sabriz
lol dont have to get hissy i was just making fun of the typo we all make them i apologize if i dont check the forum often enough on weekends for your liking i typically only check it while im at work
you should know that being bumped is not always the best position to be insome time past it was discovered that devs are prohibited from suicide ganking the almost immediate acusation from various elements including james315 was that you are not playing our game so here we have a candidate representing a play style  but is not playing that game the ad hominem card cannot be played at this time troll hits your post for 3 points lose a turn that what you wanted
still digesting the sov devblog posted only minor thoughts in that thread so farmy post thereneed to think much more before giving feedback as to the overall directionhowever three small points1 mining and ratting should be able to substitute for each other this system makes doing both extremely important to holding sov let players do the one they prefer rather than providing mechanical advantages to splitting your effort 5050 between the two2 entosis links will be frequently destroyed and so should drive an enormous amount of industrial production crius for all of its successes had one enormous failure in that it reduced the gamewide demand for production line hours and science line hoursi propose that you make entosis links take a considerable amount of time to produce of the order 4 production hours for a t1 36 science hours and 16 production hours for a t2 assuming skills all at 4 station services and no decryptor being used to help address this this will help address some of the economic issues caused by criuss increased production throughputsome numbers that would achieve this ballparkbase production time 6 hours entosis link 1 24 hours el 2base invention  30base copy time 6 hours el 1invention time 6 hours el 1base bpc max runs 720 el1 1 el2finally el2s should be produced with something that marks them out as different to other production and that favors building them in nullsec i propose a megacyteheavy basket of minerals for el1s and an el1 plus 250 of each racial processor for el2sedit 250 not 2500 you have a math degree irl sabriz dont be an idiot3 entosis trollfits fitted for absurd speed are going to be a hell of a nuisance a 10mn mwd confessor orbiting a structure with an el2 will be a horrendous thing to catch please add a hard cap on the speed players can go with an el active  i propose 3000ms for el1 and 3600ms for el2
i was asked in game to show some examples of things id be for such as what would i support in the platform bullet points previously posteda few examples of items i would supportnpcshave the drifters go to war with concord in an incursion like manner the effect would be that the drifters would engage any capsuleers they randomly feel like engaging and also temporarily negate concords capabilities within that system they are doing their incursion in until the drifters leave the systemare destroyed etc pcsremove players access to npc corps once their account is off trial add a new player status no corp with the effect being that they are considered outlaw to all other players until they join a corp or form their own corp players who leave a corp voluntarily cannot join another corp for 1 week unless they are recruited straight into another corp from the corp they are leavingorafter an account is off trial any npc corp the players characters join is considered part of faction warfare for the faction that the npc corp is a part ofor bothaurumhaving microtransactions for items that actually affect gameplay the current microtransactions only buff how the characters or ships appearance with no effect on gameplay if youre asking someone to pay real world money for aurum then allow for some items in the aurum store to be similar to the items players can purchase with loyalty points with some effect on the gameplay it could be something similar to what the dust players can do without being overbearing or outmatching to the lp store setupchanging the bounty system in some positive wayremove the percentile payout and set the bounty payout to 100 of the kill valueandorfor any bounty of 100m isk or higher individually placed on a character not corp add one open killright activable once only by anyone to the character the bounty is placed on the bounty remains if the killright actvation does not clear the bountyjust a few thoughts to clarify the sort of things ill support and push for without getting to bogged down in details
i like most of this i really like the npc corps all being part of fw this will make the perma npc corpies come out to play i also like the bounty fix i am curious of your oppinion on the nerf reversal what nerfs would you undo
so continuing the theme of quality game play and meaningful engaging content regardless of the overall viewpoints of the new sov mechanics ccp is still relying on the same low quality interfacesmitigating the number of alts prevalent in the game is a function of engaging and meaningful game interaction alts exist to do the crappy things that ccp keeps designing to force teamwork lighting a cyno is always the best example but afk cloak camping is anotherthey did the exact same thing with the entosis link push a button and wait somebody even posted a snarky yet telling response in the feedback thread along the lines of well looks like i have a few more skills to add to my cloaky afk camperswhatever you think of the new module and mechanic i would argue that it is a tremendous opportunity to add some awesome things to the game read my post in the feedback for what i am talking about
love the videos love the concept of your corp love the torpedo delivery guides i like the fact you are creative you care and are supportive of eve and hav a great sense of humor you got my vote good luck
thanks to the dow podcast crew for hosting these round tables i have a great time and i hope i didnt ruin your reputation for quality contentdomanark cohost clueless space nerds podcast
unless ccp is changing it from the last elections theyre using the wright system the code used by ccp to run the calculation is here linkabloobloosearch forums use it
resigned to either fate a great endorsement
 or swarms of interceptors t3 destroyers etc
i just like to see my post in forums why so seriousi did vote for him howeverat first there wasnt a hance but after ccp purposely cut out a rightfully voted for csm becuz they didnt care for his critism i said screw it if they dont care i dont
lorelei i am interested in hearing your views on something like this
so by having this change in game you want your going to kill off how many subscriptions from players who make isk being a spy or camping a null sec system or so forth so how do you plan to help ccp recoup the player base that they loose
but i do thank you for your support of heros of high sec
ccp is the final decider on what they want to do for the game we all share they do have data about how people play that neither you or i have i am running on ideas based on my specific play experience and to represent a play style that has been underrepresented on the csmi believe that unfortunately the current spy game and afk cloaky campers are causing the game to loose more subscriptions than the play style you seem to defend you may not agree with this but neither of us can know for sure this is why i am running for csm x and i certainly would love to see a candidate represent the play styles of spies and cloaky campers in the csm arena where are theyalso i could return the same question to you how do you plan to recoup the subscription losses due to the use of game mechanics that cant really be countered and are all rewards with no risks which i believe being a spy and being an afk cloaky camper are at the moment
noa vote for borat is a vote for one more nerf tm what would eve be without corporate espionage and cloaky neutral alts a dead and empty game thats what
puts cynical hat oni think anyone that cares about the game rather than being a breathing advertisement for their group will probably be a frustrated person and waste of a votethey have managed to keep this going for 21 pages with some help from the code fanatics despite a lot of open hostility so there is determination at leastsnip please refrain from personal attacks isd ezwal
for rl reasons i will not disclose the precise reasons i dropped out of eve for most of the period of that event i had planned other than to say it was a lowlevel personal emergency details are a private matterhad i been on csm at the time id have gone inactive for those weeks too i wouldnt fault a csm member that went inactive for those reasons real life comes first
a few more thoughts on the sov devblog as its kinda a big deal direct copypasteok a few more thoughtsfirstly i need to think more about the primetime issue but my gut thought is that it will lead to a lot of stalemates where a weakbutviable au tz alliance has one constellation a stronger eu tz alliance has the adjacent two and neither can dislodge the other stalemates could lead to boredom or could lead to a system of fun permanent war existing coalitions will probably splinter into groups based upon their timezone and this is probably badsecondly the defensive bonuses for ratting and mining but not for exploration need to be more interchangable the idea of the overhaul is that you want people using space if you own one system mining in it ratting in it running noncombat exploration sites in it and killing hostile players in both your system and adjacent systems should all contribute to your defensive bonuses and should all be interchangeable to a miningoriented nullsec sov holder the present system says we dont care that youd rather be mining you need to drop that and rat this isnt good let players choose how they use their space and reward them for using it dont tell them they have to focus on 50 ratting 50 miningthirdly if the present system goes ahead unchanged there will be a massive flood of additional nullsec mining a small change here would be a good thing as more mining fleets means more fleets to ambush and more fighting over null belts means more fights that might escalate but the economic effect will be a drastic devaluation of null minerals and the game impact will be a dramatic increase in the number of bots mining in null i will go as far as to predict that these changes will lead to a 20 or larger increase in the number of trial accounts running mining bots in ventures in nullsec and nullsec wars will be won in part by having enough of these bots running to keep your defensive indexes maxxed out
well played npc
aint that the truth i honestly cant tell if you are being ironic or not i think probably not but you get a like anyway these same devs have on multiple and repeated occasions made it explicitly clear that suicide ganking is an intended mechanic in the game its pretty strange to claim that something the developers put in on the game on purpose isnt part of the gamebut really if you read sabrizs campaign statements or look at her vote match answers you can see that she isnt running on a prosuicide ganking platform i think most reasonable people agree just go read all the candidates vote match answer to the question that suicide ganking is important for the game and doesnt need any major changes including sabriz i voted for sabriz because of his ideas and experiences in highsec war and corporation mechanics and his understanding of industry and production not to mention that he is clearly an intelligent person that cares about this game i think he would make an excellent representative of a playstyle that has not only been underrepresented on the csm but as you point out one that the developers may not have as much experience with because of ccp rules if you think otherwise dont vote for him that is how the system is suppose to work
i do not expect the circumstances involved to repeat but a family member having serious health issues can happen to anyone
indeed they can and im not disputing that but surely you can understand why someone would take it as a bad sign when were not even past the campaigning stage right
i cant in fact i am wondering if you sprained your arm reaching so far
of course you cant but then from a code member who quite publicly has some kind of personal problem with me trying to push for a code candidate i hardly expect you to be objective didnt you block me alreadyat the end of the day people can take it how they want clearly that guy takes it as a bad sign and while i may not entirely agree i can understand why he sees it that way personally i think the problem with sabriz isnt the level of work hed put in its that hed actively refuse to consider opposing styles of play to his own as even valid let alone deserving of any positive changes
from my personal discussions on comms with sabriz i can assure you that is not the case he is open to opposing views and argues the merit of them he does not discount them out of hand unless they are blatantly bad for the game or fallacious in nature even if he were biased towards pvp content rather than ballanced as i consider him to be what is one advocate for content creation out of 14 the csm are the voice of the players and historically no csm member has represented the play style while every other play style has been represented that is why i voted for sabriz encouraged all my friends too and sincerely hope that he does in fact get elected

solid candidatededicated to making new eden a better place for all levels of players respectful and considerate of new players and vets equallymindful of different positions and concerns without being blinded by his ownalways ready to listen to ideas and perspectivesjust wants a better eve for everyone new or old and willing to devote the time necessary to make it happen
you lot seem to have gone very quiet people are wondering whyperhaps some of you csm hopefuls could trouble yourselves to comment on the proposed sov changes its not like this isnt important or anything
i posted explaining why i hadnt posted earlier too
indeed you did you were the only one though steve so much for communication and transparency
i suspect theres a degree of well let the waters calm a bit before getting in with the piranha as well as similar reasons to my own for my favourite other incumbents
traveling should be able to comment by sunday
this thread has been moved to assembly hallisd ezwal community communication liaisons ccls
well lets see steve has explained gorski has commented in a depth typical for him xander claims he is off on an oil rig somewhere mike is sifting valuable nuggets out of the thread sion is no doubt preparing an opinion piece for tmc sugar is actually talking to people corbexx probably doesnt care and everyone else is waiting to see what mittani says 
i am up to about page 75 out of 131 at this point i will be answering things there when i catch uphere i am in favour of the changes i agree that numbers can be tweaked etc but that is why they put out the blog in the first place    for feedbacksadly some in that thread are making their feedback prove that they did not actually read the blog but are reacting off of second hand info the way i recommend reading the blog is to make notes of the goals and then compare them to the choices mademmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
should ccp make the use of the entosis link render the ship immobile like using a cyno siege triage or bastion module i see and hear complaints of the trollceptor this could solve the problem as it would force the use of the entosis to be an actual commitment or have the entosis link penalize the ship with a reduction in speed percentage
xander phoenas feedbacki posted the link to the full blog post in the main thread and given that it was completely ignored i figure that people there arent actually curious about what csm thought theyre just mad that csm didnt come out screaming that it was a terrible changeim personally amazed that people are more worried about badlyfit interceptors than they are about kitsunes a cowardmobile that can apply a sov laser while also jamming out a countersovlaser seems to me like more of a threat
good dayin game i am known as evelathia i am 25 years old and a heavy duty mechanic i live in alberta canada my father is known in game as xalderze he is in his 60s alberta canada he works day in and day out for hours and hours i can remember a time i did not actually see him for 2 days because of his job he was not allowed to leave his post but after all that he still comes home to play eve and relax with a big old glass of coffee and his magnifying glassi have seen the announcement about the new ui changes to the ship icons i my self like them but for my father this is going to be tough i love being able to play this game with my father i may not do the same things as him in eve but we chat and enjoy our time on here he loves this game as do ii am more then concerned that with this change he may not actually be able to play this game anymore which is an absolute sin and would leave me heart broken my father has a medical condition called rod cone dystrophy which allows him to see some peripheral vision but not right in front of him unless he uses a magnifying glass this condition has made him clinically blind since he has been the age of i believe 8 years old he hasnt legally driven a vehicle nor had the vision to see the world as me and my sister have i have never met a stronger man in my life that shows no pain about it and does not ever get himself down or upset because he can not do certain thingsall my life we have always had a hard time doing things together because of this blindness he wasnt able to just take me out camping or just hop in the truck and go on a mans day shooting guns an such but i managed to find gaming and it interested me i started off with wold of warcraft when i was much younger and he enjoyed my stories so he looked and looked and looked for a game that interested him and he found eve back in 2006 i enjoyed watching him and all the things he was doing so i started playing in 2007 with himwe have had our fun made corps together went to wormhole space together and then we split ways i went to try null sec life and pirating he has a difficult time with the pvp aspect cause of the fast pace and the magnifying glass doesnt slide across the screen very fast at all so not to worry he stuck with industrial side of eve we chat all the time in game and most of our phone calls in real life always depict some sort of craziness about eve in them from oh my god no why would ccp do that to the usual goons again go figureto have this game has been the most amazing thing for me and my father for 8 strong years now we have been to fanfest once and are coming again this march its our father son get away togetheri am asking you ccp please work on a visually impaired ui for eve so i dont loose my amazing father from a game we enjoy to play together and spend hours on together that has given us the ability to finally connect so much better and have that bonding time with each other again my father would definitely not ask for something like this as he is a strong man but i know this will not go well for him
ccp should make the new icons an opt in choice
ccp can you please release the redacted portions of the minutes relating to sov prior to the election ending in 5 days
what on earth are you talking about i dont recall any elected csm member being removed for being critical of ccp
i think hes talking about funky baconwhere after he pissed off ccp developers a hr issues arent a csm issue and b people had just had friends lose their jobs his post on it didnt go down well at all we the csm had a talk with him and he pretty much flat out said he thought posting that kind of story was more important than maintaining a good relationship with ccp devs note im saying devs not the company it wasnt the high ups hed pissed on at which point we the csm figured he was more trouble than he was worth the story burnt capital for no benefit at all at which point we shifted our general chat to a different channel which he didnt have access tohe still had the same degree of access to ccp he could still talk to the rest of the csm he didnt really he just didnt see the day to day bullshitting
ok you pretty much had my vote at elite on the spectrum 48 the joys of being captain jameson
thanks for askingi think i said somewhere that lowsec actually probably needs an oretype that is unique and pretty much essential for producing some stuff i think that would be the best and easiest way to get miners out there in the first placeonce there is a reason to mine in low then one could look at balancing ships around that unfortunately as the system is i think other changes probably would not motivate many high sec players to move over there
trying to dock through the back of a space station cos of the stateoftheart line graphics good times
got my vote
you have it wrong its cloaky neutral alts that make the game empty as they prevent players from undocking removing anonymity of alts is a bit radical but may be that is what is needed in any case it is for ccp to decide if they want to do that or notborat got my vote
what nobody is going to ask me about the sov change upcoming mmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
oh hai mike what u think about sov revamp
to be honest i was wondering what you thought about some sort of sovlite concept for high sec where players can have a degree of ownership of those systems and some sort of benefit
well the csm has been so quiet in the thread i assumed you werent interested  sov light for highsec sounds great maybe even finer grained asteroid belts etc
usely dont care about csm but hoping ya poin them to a easy solution so voted on yanow get the multi ships fitting working yust hold a beer infront ofthem open it then say ya get this when ya get thos done and voila its done within 5 minall structure alrdy inplace uyust a littlebit of coding and done
i think it is a good thing but as fozzie said it will need continual tweeking sov systems will always find a balance and start to stagnate if you dont poke and change it on a regulare basis like a plant becoming pot boundmmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
hell no to the staying out of the thread i am just trying to catch up yes i am reading all of it and in the first few days it has gotten away from me gimme timestaking a claim on a belt has been suggested before not a bad ideammike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
perhaps he should state that then from his ideas and listening to his interviews he believe that miners should be forced to engage in pvp with guns a playstyle they are both terrible at and dislike he states this will add more conflict  by which he means with guns  even though he also states that conflict come in multiple formsplease stop referring to it as content creation as if all other playstyles are not content is created in a multitude of ways i dont think any of the csm member could be considered anticontent honestly i think what code does is damaging to many other playstyles effectively you are happy to have your content while roflstomping over everyone elses playstyles in highsec and you want to be able to do that with even greater ease its for that exact reason that sov is being changed to make my own group less effective too while no other csms dont necessarily represent all playstyles they certainly are more balanced in their views than sabriz obviously you guys will vote for him because hes pro your playstyle but outside of that people shouldnt even consider it nobody should vote for someone who would quite happily erase whole playtyles and force people to play in ways they dont want to its for that exact reason id not advocate voting for one of the csms who want ganking to just be deleted either
i have removed a rule breaking postthe rules4 personal attacks are prohibited commonly known as flaming personal attacks are posts that are designed to personally berate or insult another forum user posts of this nature are not beneficial to the community spirit that ccp promote and as such they will not be toleratedisd ezwal community communication liaisons ccls
yup cant csm if your meat bag starves to death cant think and focus if one of the meat bags very similar to your own is struggling et cetera ummm  miners in null clump together as deep as they can into pockets and pipes for safetythere is no shortage of rattersthe question that needs thinking about is how do i give miners an ability to stand and fight so they feel safe enough to spread out in null
got my vote7o
as i write this we are on page 134 of the feedback forum and by now it is all talking in circles it would really be nice if ccp would provide a response regarding the issues raised so the conversation can move forward a bit there are alot of good subtle ideas and other points being made that are getting drowned out by the big three issues1 inty entosis2 prime time3 we have now gotten two sticks wheres the carrot otherwise known as incentive to even live in nulli know it is only the third day but i am not seeing alot of ccp feedback to the feedback doesnt have to be much sounds like they need to grow a harry saq help them out and vote harry saq
thanks so much for posting tho i will say that the interview was deffentally not the best which i explained here
1st on my ballot convinced by the capstable podcast for sure

i agree with rosal his points are valid
counting myself as a csm hopeful here is the link to my feedback on this the day of
while kitsunes can target a full 250km of entosiss range its slow and can be caught a lulz fit trolleceptor may not be able to target a full 250km but its targeting range can still be made large enough that it has a large radius to play hardtocatch with while keeping the sov laser onim more concerned about afk camping duty thats coming afk camp will be the only effective way to drop system defense no not the small gang roam that only drops activity for 5 minutes theres no excuse to not show up on afk camping duty since all youre doing is nothing this is not how i want to spend my eve playtimeany thoughts from csms on this
if a kitsune wants to come in close enough to jam you it generally has to be within sniper range thus it can be blapped off the gridthey are also slower than ceptors and not bubble immuneeve is like an addiction you cant quit it until it quits you also iderno

with the stv vote system not filling your 14 choices fully is the best way to limit independent representation on the csmthere is no downvote possible but the stv system is fair enough that you do not need it just put 14 candidates that are not part of the big blocks if you want to not cast a vote for any block and prioritize them according to how well their capmaign fit your views
we have been running through scenarios as the sov changes are planned right now there is no point defending sov this is a really heavy handed solution with very short sightedness it will be a lot of small gangs fighting  mechanics perfect for low sec not for an aging player population that wants to build things and work strategicallygriefers paradise and interceptors online here we comeall the interceptors spreading out everywhere to hack every sov unit in a region
hey have you voted for stevewhat the hell is even wrong with you go vote for steve

also it is from 3 months ago to bad you never get anything recent so sad 
all my votes went to xenuria just to  of the antixenuria posters in this threadmy advice for everybody vote xenuria it will make great laughs
sorry dude but no the average female in eve is unlikely to vote for you speaking as a female and as someone who knows a large number of females in gamealso i noticed you ignored my questions
he always does this isnt new i am female as well and i didnt vote for him i know a number of fellow female players as well and same applies heh i have seen his attempts for a few years and i usually refrain from commenting but this year i guess i felt like i had towhat i fear is that i keep seeing people placing troll votes to him and so the scary part of this so many people are speaking up on these troll votes and what if all these troll votes actually gets him in it seems like he also doesnt take any of this seriously from reading all his posts and what not it seems more like a joke to him vs the people who truly want to help make a difference in this game those votes should go to candidates who truly want to represent the community not thisand that is my two cents take it as you will
that could be a good carrot but it would make null and worm holes even less self suffient additionally arent there too many rods keeping people out of null not enough tools to adapt in there
got my vote i think my alts voted for you too but im never sure what they are doing
thanks guys every vote is needed
if you put tora on your ballot send him a fedo for each vote
this public fleet fc gives you his vote
thank youyes removing alts anonymity is a radical concept but i do believe that it would improve the game for the majority of players i understand that it would also alter spying and cloaky camping but would not prevent those activities altogether
sorry cant vote for you1 you dont have the well being of eve as a agenda only your bit2 be capable of growing chest hair first p

a possible alternative to how sov works combining current and fozzie sov
second time ive voted for you steve keep up the good work
are you a heavy minerits easy to have various thoughts about how to improve mining but what constitutes improvement has much to do with pov and level of involvement with the activity be wary about the clamor that mining needs improvementi mine every day with six toons and have done so for years i enjoy the process and the environment but i have to say i mainly enjoy it because im commanding my own minifleet i mine with four mining barges skiffs or hulks depending on locale highsec hulk mining is engaging as the roids dont last all that long and youre in potentially hostile territory and ice mining with skiffs is engaging because its very competitive feeding this many mouths on the proceeds from mining entails a number of skills and a variety of efforts but done well it pays wellhowever solo mining is another story thats the rub mining with several toons is engaging mining solo not so much my concern is with proposals that add more busy work to the mining process to make it seem more engaging which perhaps means something to the solo or casual miner but is nothing but a pain to the multitoon pro minerwe serious multitoon miners make up a good portion of the mining community from what ive seen in the belts were just not banging on doors asking for anything to be fixed
i couldnt help myself one xenuria vote at 1 the csm deserves you
i think one of the big draws of null is the big alliances big battles et ceterai think anything that entices people out of high sec could be a good thing and that is where the unique ore should come inmaybe self sufficiency should involve more than one sec status low high and null
i can get behind thisdesireable but nonessential things in different and all sectors of spaceso null might have desireable thing 1 but low would have 2 bit like how whs have the t3 stuff you dont need t3s to fight wars but you need almost all minerals to make all shipsessential ship building and pos fuelling in all sectors of space

voting today thanks for the work in csm 9 looking forward to seeing you in csm 10
voting today i like your work with the lore podcasts on
dont worry dreads will be removed soon as they have no ability other than damage dealing carriers will be reduced to one highslot and no dronebay supers are already slated for a change to have 0 infleet ability besides arbitrary stat bonuses and titans well titans are busses that should have been removed long ago as they really dont serve any psychological factor like they used to they arent a serious dps or fleet support factor ongrid just brick houses of ehp that for the large part can be ignored unless your fleet is mostly caps then maybe they have enough to alpha carrierssupers off before reps but not much else
this whine is weak a blob of carriers can be alphaed off the field with a much smaller blob of dreads worth only a tiny fraction in total isk compared to the carrier blob theyre killing sure youre going to lose dreads but thats working as intended did you want to kill capital blobs with cruisers and be able to burn off at the earliest sign of trouble and lose nothing now thats unbalanced
and we know this is possible as drones can be scooped directly to the drone bayposting to bump and further support this concept
an exellent way to introduce a new set of t2 destroyers and battleships supported
so i found out that toras war declaration is still active today a guy from my alliance went all the way up and had a look at jita went something like thishey guys there is a bunch of war targets on jita stationreally we are at waryeah why didnt anyone tell me  because it isnt serious we lose and destroy more in a night in one fleet fight than they have managed in two weeksi mean come on we had three war decs on us already when he declared war did he really think it would bother us i suppose that he has to believe he achieves something or he would just have to give upnow i am interested to see how long he keep the declaration running nonstopthis whole thing is like dealing with a toddlerjohnny have you been naughty john starts pummelling your thigh hey dont be silly little guy you cant hurt me with your tiny fists why didnt you just answer the question
most proposals made on the forum to improve mining usually fall under either vast increases to yield or total changes to remove the current leisurely method of mining some would use boring instead of leisurely but note i do not agree with those commentsthe steve ronuken proposal is the best so far because1 it introduces a kind of sovereignty aspect to high sec which is interesting2 it defends the connection between the empires and capsuleers as faction standings will be required3 it defends small miners from being predated by large afk miners who gulp up all the ore4 it adds a further complication for gankers in that they cannot just warp to the belts they have more work to do if they want to suicide gank your mining vessels 5 it adds content to the missions part of the game which has taken a few hits in recent times and still appears to be in ccps firing line so on the whole i would like to see his ideas implemented
i think the candidate should reply some of what you say worries me in that i dont see how these concepts though somewhat interesting as concepts actually make the activity of mining more engaging bringing up the myth of large afk miners gulping up the ore from poor solo miners is well nonsense someone really needs to clear the air about this old afk mining stereotype  its not what multiboxers do you cant really do serious multibox mining afk plus if a mining fleet comes into a belt where someones mining in a venture  easy fix venture find a different belt no matter how many large mining fleets are out there theres more ore for the soloistthis isnt the candidates reply above but your comments have me a little worried that hes bought into the afk asteroid vacuum cleaning propaganda
im not a heavy miner no unfortunately with being on the csm my time in space has suffered i do have miners on my three accounts well 2 miners and one booster in an orca with a mind link now that mindlink prices arent insanefrom before i got elected well i know how much effort is needed when mining in highsec if youre in systems which get mined out yes the roids are small and you need to keep switching if youre in a less busy system theyre generally enough for 2 or three cycles or moreanywayim not looking to change the core of mining im looking to as much as the csm can change anything which means im suggestinga supplement it with an active method which is less efficient but faster b change how you find asteroids in the first place so with skill and effort you can find larger asteroid fields or you can have someone else find them then sell them to you if youre in a pc corporation right now theres no real benefit for miners to join a corp id like to add one so for a large multibox miner the main change would be finding the roids rather than just warping to a belt i dont see it as something which would take vast quantities of time and the sites would last a while if youre good at it smaller sites would be easier to findcreate oh and they wouldnt be anomalies but bookmarks
thanks for the replyregarding the reply cant see the point of a method thats faster but less efficient unless youre thinking that would be another attack on afk miners which i hope is not the case because this seemingly popular propaganda about afk mining should have been put to rest along with the demise of permanent ice belts this wont make mining more fun  just forced engagementthe prospecting idea has been brought up in several places several times by several people im guessing it has something to do with other space games that have or will pursue this minigame for eve this too strikes me as nothing more than busy work maybe sort of fun the first couple of time but a pain in the neck thereafter for those of us who mine dailybut this is not the time or place to dig into the mining issue this is simply your candidacy threadyou got my vote not because of your mining opinions but because of the great work youve done with your website and 3rd party development maybe well talk more about mining some other time
its not an attack on afk minersits an alternate method youd get isk faster but deplete sites faster thus needing to find them more often and pay more attention while doing it mining the old way would take longer but youd have more isk at the end of it

i thought jump freighters were industrial ships with the reduced fatigue timer and a larger storage than said carrier granted yes you need to redo the rigs you are able to move 6 battleships for example plus the fittings vs the single battleship and a frig or two with a carrier as an industrial pilot i thought you and your industrial continuance would be glad with the fact of the jump range nerf and fatigue timer said way of operating would result in more demand for both ships mods and rigs ships and mods have a chance to be killed by a defenseless jump freighter or it would require a support escort war is good for the industrialist because it creates demand if the industrialist can not keep up on supply there is where would be better addressed keep in mind this is coming from a limited industrial primary pve pilot if you can not see this plain obvious way of doing things then what makes you think you could be of use on the csm i really am trying to see your logic but this being eve it is adapt or die even for the industrialist
all i have said that it is used in logistics operations which is true it is i have had more than a number of people agree with me on that aspect yes they are not intended as industrial ships but even so we still use them for that  it can save time and be more cost efficient depending on where they are going vs packaging them up and then going ahead and refitting themso im not seeing how its a valid argument since i have already said that they are not industrial ships i have agreed with that
it looks like a way that noncombat toons can assist in major fleet ops and small indy setups as well i approve
props to xander phoena and the crossing zebras team for their efforts regarding feedback on these changes with podcasts featuring manny eddie progodlegend and grath telkin who are all big nullsec movers and shakersthanks guysgo vote for these guys
you do seem more worked up about it than he is even if you also believe youre winning i dont think he really puts much thought into who he decs he just likes lots of red targets and a constant influx of tears
i am having a very public laugh at his impotence and how there is a candidate that is so unapproachable can you imagine it hi tora i have some concerns about the mechanics they plan for sovget lost i dont careisnt that an odd way for csm to responddeclaring war on you raaagh  i do like your idea about making supers and titans have various sub roles and access levels so you can moor them to a pos have to destroy the pos to get the super  titan and then be able to go about your business while others with the roles can use some of the ship abilitiesby the way marlona sky biomassed

yes so hard especially since i buy thousands of accounts to vote in this game good thing i named them all xenuria sucks15001
given your unwavering commitment to trolling this process i would not be surprised if you had my name tattooed on your forehead
you still havent answered why voting for you isnt a mistake so i dont see any reason to vote for you i still dont have any confidence that you have the best interest of the community at large at heart and you ignoring questions and calling people trolls isnt helping
voted xenuria the guy takes the time to know his what hes talking about and genuinely cares its more then 90 of the other people campaigning power to xenuria glory to change expect transition life finds a way
in case you missed the first post of the thread i wont be answering loaded questions doing so could be seen as engaging flame bait

tora how much time per year do you spend in null sec is this maybe you hoping more people will come through jita ps i spent about a year almost solo in a worm hole so no tears
ive spend more time in nullsec and lowsec then you would probably guess but then i need to tell you who my other chars are which i wont so i do know how to speak f1 and redeploy remember assumptions are the mother of all fckps i wonder why
you will find anything ceo kept hopping high sec mining high sec  low sec gang wars c2 with c3 link  where i stayed c2 with c4 link where i didnt have the sp to pilot ships for c4 sleepers to incursions and then to null sec renting so we were all spread out really thinquestions arent assumptions you can give ball park numbers and alliance names talk about your experiences there dont have to be specific on names and battles
as tora is the only one i think that does empire war decs daily out of the candidates i have to support tora herehe does empire war decs every day and he have done that for a bloody long time now so he pretty much knows the stuffs  deal with empire wars and war decs in empireand as i love empire pvp and empire war decs i for sure want to see some good changes to empire pvp and the war dec system in general and im pretty sure tora is the only person here that knows the stuffs 100 in thisbecause of that my support goes to tora

the nerfing of eve has been one little paper cut at a timeexample of a something to rollbackchanging aggression mechanics to appease the lazywhen the mtus were introduced drones would aggress if the mtu was attacked putting both players involved into a limited engagement the afkbears screamed that this was unfair and demanded it be changed the initial response was working as intended which later ended with the aggression mechanic being quietly changed during a patch to appease those too lazy to play the game with a degree of attentiveness beyond at the rock push f1 launch drone and mtu  go watch netflixfriendly fire as a corp option to make hisec safer for new playerseves draw for myself is that its not wow in space safety is something that is never fully guaranteed the old friendly fire on status was in existence for a variety of reasons such as allowing for corp pvp practice corp discipline short of booting someone etc awoxing and safari were part of the landscape that had to dealt with through diligencecommon sense and care now people can be even less careful diligent etc about how they interact with people in the sandbox eve once had a claim to be not saying im for rolling it back purpose of making it easier for awoxing or reverse safari etc but ffs where does it end does eve officially die in the sense of being a sandbox when they remove all the things can cause loss or otherwise require risk each little nerf done for appeasement or becoming more like wowinspaaaaaaaaace is in my opinion a paper cut towards the end of the sandbox the sandbox is about risk management and working well or not with others take away that aspect and the sandbox ceases to be and eve loses out on being somewhat unique and essentially slides more towards being wowinspaaaaaaaaaace etc in my opinion
i highly support any ships that aid in the deployment and removal of poss i havent fully read both threads and apologies if i am repeating anything but these are my first thoughts on the matter from my experiences of using and deploying starbasesa good bonus for these ships in the possible changes to starbases is that they can be used to anchorunanchor modules at the same time at the same starbase that would really helpfulthese ships could use a t3 like subsystems not a t3 ship though that could allow you to configure it to a specific role so if you want ships to drop a tower you might not need the large primary weapon but on the other hand if you are planning to siege a tower then you dont need a massive cargo bay if this is the role this ship is going to cover as a combat engineering ship it needs to be adaptivei like the idea of a light ship maybe with a primary weapon as an anti structure energy weapon if this ship is not limited to just deploying things like mobile warp disruptor and can be used to scoop starbase modules as well it will need a sizeable cargo bay 10  20km3 if you dont want to keep going back and forth to a drop point as some of those modules can be big for a small ship the heavy combat engineering ship could be a problem as in where do you stop there would be a good number of issues for how big you could make it and how much it should carry for starbase deployment fuel and stront are the largest items to be delivered to a location would it be acceptable to carry all that a starbase needs for a month in one go plus it would also need to be able to fit inside whs maybe c2 and above so we are looking at at least and orca sized ship to pull this off i would guessif the heavy combat engineering ship were to use a large anti structure weapon my first thought is yes please but how powerful to make it i dont know it would have to be less than a dreadnought in siege mode but if it works like a doomsday for example uses a lot of fuel to activate it then would it be acceptable if it took off 10 million hp every 5 minutespersonally i dont necessary think adapting industrials or cruisers into further t2 version for this role makes sense as these ships are very specialized maybe have them belong to a pirate faction or ded would b a good idea they will need to be generally well tanked and the ability to break through blockades so interdiction nullified would be a good ability defence wise drones would be a good idea which would allow the ship to continue doing its job while under fire if tractor beams could be used to drag in unanchored structures quickly it would make these ships work really well
supportedalthough we dont need deployable afk weapons that can be deployed on a gate or belt unless there is a time or a limit based on skills as this system could be abused to leave a bunch of afk weapons and then we end up with vietnam
i love the lack of hot drops thanks to fatigue i hope they reduce the fatigue bonus on industrials and black ops soon
greetings members of the council for stellar management and eve pilotsi would like to propose an idea we had that could improve player control over the number of blueprints and afford additional opportunities for players to achieve control over markets and expand the game for players interested in industrial play while addressing a game balance issue that hampers newcomers to eve while giving early adopters a massive market advantagewhile talking with my ceo it occurred to us that the ability to make a profit on t2 ships is becoming harder and that most t2 materials with decent invention of prints are not profitable for me or any of my corp mates able to make ships we theorized that the mega alliances like goonswarm and pandemic legion or others have a monopoly on tech 2 bpos with a much better materials efficiency lvl readily available and a freeflowing moon goo supply to make these ships for far lower cost than any other groupthis means early adopters of eve have an unfair advantage over all other players and are effectively controlling the tech 2 marketduring this conversation we considered the fact that as t3 ships need to be reverse engineered why not destroy a tec 2 ship and from a fragment of the salvaged ship reverse engineer a bpo of the ship this would create a new task and activity niche in the game and would make it possible for others to gain the bpoUFFFDs that exist in the game now but are only available to the select few mega alliances and aforementioned early eve adopters who won tech 2 bpos way back when this idea could also be adapted to all ships and modules in game at this time and work on the invention principle it would require skills datacores and a percentage chance of success similar to current invention practices in evethank you for your consideration and hope you will find this concept of sufficient merit to present it to ccp at the next summit or earliest opportunitychen gidrine and enn deekay
i dont wholesalely agree with your idea even though i think there should be a better way to get to any type of t2 bpo differently than paying for that one guys greatgreatgreatgreatgreatgrandchildrens ships schooling and retirement planbasically thats the main driveoff for new players two people i know wanted to start playing went into industry found out theyll never be actually getting their hands on a t2 bpo since their prices are insanely expensive and quit the game because to them there was no purpose always having to dig into their own pockets for extortion of other blocs who had those blueprints
or just get rid of t2 bpos all together problem solved

it does little to engender community confidence in a candidate when the candidate refuses to answer questions i wont answer loaded questions might work once or twice where its obvious but using that excuse over and over renders it flimsy indeed a question is not loaded simply because a truthful answer would reflect unfavorably on the candidatefurthermore attempting to use forum rules to lawyer your way out of answering wont inspire confidence either its not hard to figure out that if candidates can dismiss any question because in their personal view its flame bait or trolling that will quickly result in candidates rejecting hard questions on those groundsthe excuse of flame bait and trolling looks even worse whn you make snarky comments about people forgetting to vote on some of them while at the same time running on a platform opposing multiple account voting especially when you have not actually articulated a meaningful problem in that regard
so finally the csm voting is overi managed to attract the attention of gevlon goblin and the official voting list of the antiganker community see the bio of sarah flyntsome of the commentators thought i was a troll even gave me a marks as a trollbut i am no trollthe csm is something that needs to be taken seriously and if i dont get elected then you can bet i will be backhigh sec is also something that need to be taken seriously even when the focus of the next year appears to be sov changesi am looking forward to seeing the results of the elections and reading the analyses of those resultsheres hoping for a better high sec
is it a war dec if it is just flagging some people up to trade hub camp doesnt sound very war like to me

last chance to vote folks polls close today
i agree with agondray as much as we all liked mines i dont see how a deployable weapon system could be balanced in a way that would prevent spam i do think this is a great idea for a new ship class or classes there are plenty of good ideas for deployables in the stickied thread all we need is for ccp to act
but theres no problem to solve t2 bpos dont control the amrkets ehll the few of them that are left are mostly either on inactive accounts or stashed away in collectors hangarsdeleting t2 bposs has little supporting reasons beyond waaagh i dont have one so nobody should eb allowed to especially people who played the game longer than me which si the same arguement to remove t3s supers sov moongoo and hell capitals from the game
focusing on other things until the key notesthe fozzie logic has me hoping i loseyes a pun on fuzzy logic
thats pretty obviously a loaded statement you could ask why should i vote for you or ask someone else why should i not vote for him but asking why isnt it a mistake takes the position that it is a mistake and the questioner must be proven wrong its really not possible for it to be a mistake to vote for him unless you intended to vote for someone else and you made a mistake you vote you intend to vote for him its not a mistake you might regret it but thats on you its amazing how much time and effort cfc types waste on this guy we get it youre not fans move on i very much hope he gets elected if for no other reason than to laugh at the reaction the csm is a partially reimbursed focus group in which the work of the group falls on the group members its pure genius on ccps part perspective get some
honestly no real effort has been needed so far for meits so weak a candidate several things can be rebutted simply by quoting two mutually contradictory statements by xenuria asking which of these represents your beliefs and watch either the rejection of the question a nonanswer or no answer i mean its pretty much a field day for what not to do as a serious and sane candidateshowcasingso its pretty obvious that were not afraid of xenuria mostly because its not a serious candidate then why do we use time on it personally i enjoy watching train wrecks like this some people drive slowly past a car accident and i participate in horrendously executed election campaigns on an internet forum  except of course noone gets hurt here unless they have chosen to put themselves at risk and internalises any grief so i dont think its equivalent to watching a car accidentothers like i said earlier seem to genuinely attempt to improve xenurias campaign which i dont understand and would generally think futile but obviously not for the exact same purpose as mea few might primarily be posting to warn people of how moronic xenuria is although i personally dont think xenuria needs any help showing that to the worldat least one wanted answers to genuine questions and was put off by the candidates reaction to any questions that doesnt fit the candidateim not going to claim i know why cfc types post here but if i were a betting personality id say mostly their own enjoyment and partly a desire to test if xenuria is as worthless as the stories sayand since xenuria summarises his own platform with two words vote xenuria its easy to see why the stories are vindicated the platform of the candidate is that voters should vote for the candidate no politics no substance no talent just egoand im not going to lie it would be hilarious if he got elected to csm horrible for the csm as a worthwhile institution but hilarious check out this list for a number of examples of the simply crazy hijinks that joke candidates get up to every once in a whileim not that afraid though trolls could vote for him and idiots might but with better troll candidates and with a number of organised partylike organisations any trollidiot votes will be diluted into inefficiency you need a lot of primary votes for xenuria for it to matter at all and most people votes for candidates who takes their own candidacy seriously
that would be a pretty good response if this were a debate among equals but its not its a political campaign xenuria does not have to respond to a question like that by trying to disprove that its a mistake to vote for him at a minimum he could resond as you did candidates are not obligated to respond in the format the questioner wants but when one doesnt respond or responds by calling the asker a troll thays a tactical mistake it creates the appearance of being afraid of something and trying to hide it from the votersalso there have been far better questions ignored or blown off as trolling by xenuria so focusing on this one is not a legitimate counter to my point anyhowin reality the amount of time and effort spent on xenurias csm campaign by the cfc opponents in general and me in particular is really pretty trivial its therefore hilarious that you are talking about perspective furthermore no one is obligated to move on from opposing a candidate i find xenuria very interesting in the abstract both from a inventing a moral crisis and then running on it and b doing so in an incompetent fashion i find this thread interesting as a lesson in what not to do to get elected to csm and to see community reaction to xenurias complete lack of an actual platform or agenda his abject surrender in the face of hard questions about whether a need for a reform candidate exists as well as responses like your own which amount to  go away youre being mean rather than actually addressing points raised is very instructive for those wishing to run or oppose candidates in the future
weve asked the question nicely and unibased before hell even given advice and places and ways to be more active in the community to help their chances of getting electedwe were told we were still asking loaded questions and just trolling were told obviously we just like the status quo and sucking mittanis engorged peanuts and they we werent welcome in the threadoh and just try bringing up any other prior platform xenuria has run on in the previous years of what the most important thing to add to eve was and youll get a big ignored stick thrown at your head and the only reasons those previous platforms were brought up is because they legitimately bring xenurias competenceability to perform as a valid csm candidate into question
wishing i had voted for you and tried to get others to do so at this moment in time xenuria would have been so good to have you discussing sov mechanics with fozzie for the next year

the high sec trade hub campers and gankers are the kids that hang around corners beating up little newbies for their lunch moneysending you a hilarious battle report from when i started talking about how gankers are really carebears code sent a contingent to my home system caught one procurer because he was stuck on the invisible part of an asteroid then they had a 97 isk loss when they were wiped out
the problem with tora isnt that he doesnt know wardecs he certainly does the problem is that because he only supports one side of them that his opinions are heavily biased in favour of them staying broken theres indisputable balance issues with wardecs a group of a couple of hundred players being able to farm several hundred wardecs at a time for mass profit isnt a sign of superior skill its a sign that the system is broken and has been for a long time wardecs are going to change and its going to benefit defenders thats inevitable the last thing people need is a csm member defending them that resorts to name calling and smacktalk when confronted there are many other candidates that know about wardecs and can be expected to respond reasonably and objectively rather than just going i r want evil
so many negative comments fueled by madness and ignorance
so is he saying because someone can get more enemies the war mechanics are broken  thats not very logical mate in nullsec lowsec and whspace everyone can shoot each other should we change that too  must be broken if he cant handle it as long as he followed orders and voted for me its ok
misrepresentation of an argument good showdo you honestly think that the ability for a group to set up hundreds of wardecs against a massive variety of groups for less than a single trader can make is a well balanced system the idea of the wardec system was to allow groups to fight over their disagreements structure resources and other competition its to drive 2 way conflict which creates meaningful content the way the system currently operates it doesnt do that it simply acts as an off switch for concord allowing groups like yours to farm easy kills from players who have no interest or skill in fighting and you dont have to choose ooh do we wardec group a or wardec group b since you can just wardec bothfurther to that it acts as a barrier for nonpvp groups who want to generate meaningful content in highsec as its so easy to pull off just look at groups like redfrog or pro synergy they operate entirely out of npc corps because operating a nonpvp group from a highsec corp is practically suicide before you go onto it i dont care if you wardec my alliance for all i care they could remove wardec fees against null blocs altogether and just let everyone have free targets but it seems ludicrous to me that the current system is such that the most optimal and efficient method of running a large scale nonpvp group in highsec is to do so out of npc corpsand no i didnt follow orders i vote for my choices for csm not the bloc vote some of those line up which is great but other choices and the order of the votes is significantly different that said i dont think being 14th cfc choice means much
salty post counter inboundim no longer cfc but did follow orders and voted like a good spacemonkeygood points made tora why should everyone be able to farm nullbears for freed
eve is about sandcastles eve isnt safe and highsec isnt a safe place htfu you carebear its unfair you can shoot anyone for free in nullsec and we have to pay for it in highsec instead of you wanting to nerf nullsecetc you want to nerf the guys who already have to do more hard work and pay mucho iskies to get pvp in highsec if you think you re having a hard time in eve now you should have been here a few years ago when life in highsec was much harder many nerfes have been set to highsec highsec is already carebear land you just want more because you want it even easier because its not fairrrboohoooonow stop this nonsense and tell me you secretly voted for more evil in in eve 
coming from you that means next to nothing you specifically target the weakest players because youre too risk averse to fight players who can fight back and you boot people for losing too much and damaging your precious kb stats just because you like to pew pew industrials on the jita undock doesnt mean youre not a carebearat no point will you ever see me stating that highsec should be safe but that doesnt mean that it should be impossible to run nonpvp groups without being instantly wardecced by people like yourself the game is missing a huge portion of collaborative gameplay simply because the wardec mechanics are overly simplistic and favours your carebear pvp over actual meaningful conflict ccp know this and wardecs will change thats not even a questionand dude ive been playing for 10 years so indeed i was here a few years ago a few years ago you could shield yourself from wardecs shed wardecs and the costs were prohibitive for wardec farming you would not be able to afford close to the number of wars you currently have unfortunately you seem to drink the code koolaid when they state that highsec is so much safer and you like them ignore changes which made it tougherthe reality is that when i started you rarely heard about gankers and could operate moderately sized industrial corps with only the occasional wardec while yes more mechanics have changed in favour of the highsec carebear than against them the increase in aggressive activity in highsec and groups who specialise in aggressive activity means that highsec is considerably less safe for the average player than it used to beim all for more evil it just has to be balanced and it has to involved more than just shooting people i dont believe in just nuking every nonguns player into the ground screaming yarr as if its some sort of achievement to blow up an industrial ship i honestly believe you have too much of a blinkered view for your own style of play and what you consider to be increasing evil is simply softening up your gameplay style at the expense of nonguns players eve has more in it than just guns you know and conflict needs to take all of it into accountand sadly no you were unable to convince me of your campaigns merits and i voted for just 8 people of which you were not one if youre at fanfest though we can grab a beer and you can try for my vote for next year p
weve been a year at war with the entire cfc and probably any other alliance in eve we done more then 10k wars total are you saying theyre all weak  of course not and you know this as well you only say that because it fits your story you are as selective with words as goblin is with numbers if people want to be in a safe place let them move to nullsec whats this code koolaid  marmites have been shooting people long before code was a thing and were not gankers so dont mix them up yarr is a very nice expression  yarr  finally something we can agree on beer  to bad i wont be going this year but i will next year
im not saying they are all weak but the vast majority are you cite the cfc and other null groups but you know full well that from a high sec perspective yes they are weak the only cfc players you encounter in highsec are the ones dumb enough to operate in highsec without using an alt hardly in line for a pvp awardand yes the code koolaid where they try to claim that everything in highsec has been nerfed to carebear land while no changes have been made to make it harder complete rubbish whether or not you existed first is irrelevant you still drink in their claims and the only difference between what you do and what code does is they pay their wardec fees in ships to concord both of you aim for the easiest targets you can so you can cheastbeat over how great you are for killing rookieshonestly i cant believe you can seriously look at wardecs and not see how shockingly unbalanced the system is luckily it doesnt matter ccp know and have alluded to impending changes if when that happens youre still too busy saying everything is fine then youre even less likely to be able to make strong contributions to suggested changes and those carebears you hate so much win even more if you were a bit more honest a little less arrogant and realistically approached highsec balance you might stand a chance of impacting changes they feed down the line
if wars ever change in high sec the first ones to feel the pain are the industrials why do you think they sell so many ships now  only changes i want to see with the current war system is a way to protect the smaller corps until they are a bit bigger so they make more isks to hire mercs or setup their own defences and for the gankers i want to see more options for antigankers to fight back but you can read about that in the op i do agree that paying 500mweek for a big nullsec alliance is unlogical they are big and rich enough to defend themselves the 500m barrier is just protecting them
while producers would see a bit of a dip it would be short lived i think ccp are likely to replace wardecs entirely with a mechanic which drives conflict between groups more able to fight each other rather than the very onesided gank wars we have now and a considerable amount of ships are lost outside of highsec wardecs tooits impossible to protect players who want to make isk and be in a corporation since the act of making isk makes you an attractive war target regardless of size mercs will never be viable because they simply demand too much isk for most corps for it to be worthwhile theres not much profitable value you gain from being in a corp over being in an npc corp not to mention the amount of players who attack with one corp then sell protection services with another for the most part its just a way to fleece a rookie corporation for cash it is ludicrous though that pve groups are better off staying in npc corps than forming up though thats an obvious hole in current wardec mechanics which wont be solved just by changing pricesas for null corps it really doesnt matter how much they are to wardec they are easy targets that provide a huge number of players to shoot and more than pay for their wardecs with the loot they drop so their wardec price is pretty much irrelevant if it were too low or free more corps would attack them and the targets would soon dry up null groups always have and always will be the loot piUFFFDatas of wardeccers
lucas i dont know how to break it to you but your whole argument is based on false premises and conjecture friendplayers who want to make isk and be in a corp should never be excluded from the rich interactions our virtual world has to offerthey are not better off in npc corps if not for taxes and no structures than at least for lack of interactioncorporations can take care of themselves and dont need your patronizing whiteknight routine thanks very muchthey could i dont know interact with the wardecersmercsdont want to pvp all fine and dandy even in a pvp centric game but there are consequences simpledo some diplo before you flaunt your bling maybe consider having some pvp pilots anyways hire protection maybebe a part of the awesome meta youd have them build a castle in the sandbox and close the gates foreverif youd have your way ccp should just instance the universe so everyone has hisher own personal shard to grind inif id like to start a corporation in the real world but dislike taxes and finances i cant decide to skip bookkeeping all together can i i should work around that hire someone to take care of itits impossible to take you serious while you constantly take a dump on the whole idea which eve has thrived on the spirit of the game and its players the day rabblerousers like you get their way is the day eve diesyou are in way over your head if you think you can besmirch people like tora feyd and the plethora of other real content creators with your inane baseless fantasy grow upd
he for sure knows a million times more about empire war decs than you would ever dream of knowing and much more than most others who lives in empire so there isnt really much to argue about there because of that tora is the best choice to support if you want to see some good changes to empire pvp and war decsif tora doesnt knows empire pvp and war decs that does this everyday and have done it for years then who in the csm does
except they obviously are better off in npc corps otherwise we would see all of these large nonpvp corps operating out of player corps but we dont they all operate from npc corpsthats right they dont want to pvp and they shouldnt be force to in order to group with others eve is pvp centric but pvp is not limited to shooting people with guns its a sandbox game where people can play how they want and alternative methods of interaction should be cherished not punishedlol bling corps barely have to have a financial footprint to become targets because wardecs are too cheap and too easy i totally get that youll deny that because you do themyou have absolutely no idea what you are talking about eve was not built on the premise of just use guns all other playstyles should be removed its a sandbox game a game where you make you own way balance has fallen towards favouring people who want to score easy kills with little to no effort like yourselves and youll say absolutely anything to protect your easy playstyle because you cant be bothered to put the work in well tough luck im fairly sure ccp are going to stop all over your little teaparty and youll have to actually start working for what you getas for content creation  ha pew pewing noobs on the jita undock isnt content creation if anything it detract from content because other playstyle arent given much of a chance people like feyd and tora just want to whine on about how super easy everything is while they themselves revel in how easy their playstyles are if you cant see the blatant hypocrisy there thats your failinghey exafterbirth how you dointora might well know wardecs more that me though id very much doubt it since the system is pretty simple and sure if you want the system more unbalanced in your favour which i assume you do since skill isnt exactly your middle name then tora is definitely your guy though hed likely not survive more than a few discussions before he gets makers as too negative disregard if you fancy seeing actual balance being supported though like most players do then hes the exact opposite of a good idea and you can only really use the term empire pvp very loosely camping the jita undock and smacktalking is hardly a good example of empire pvpanyway now that tora has his little army of trolls well on their way to disagree with absolutely everything said im going to call it a day i dont really fancy getting into the usual circular arguments which all boils down to we cant easy pvp against unarmed targets  cos were so hardcorettfn
you can argue as much as you want but you dont do empire wars and you absolutely doesnt do that everyday like tora does because of that you simply dont know as much as tora does about empire pvp and war decs and how the mechanics behind it works because of that you shouldnt even be a part of this discussion if you are not supporting empire pvp and war decs to get betterat least you should point out toras flaws or bad points with his ideas if there are any but your knowledge are pretty much zero in this thats the reason you cant even point out any flaws or bad points with toras ideas and just claim you know more than him and that tora is just wrongnot only that but tora knows enough to actually be a real candidate to the csm with its empire pvp and war dec ideas you dont understand the game enough even in its basic state to even be considered a candidate to the csm by a long mile even if you had tried to go that way how about thatthe fact is that according to you you know pvp better than those who have done that for many years and even every day for many years as we have seen from earlier discussions where you claim to know more even as a carebear noob you even knows more than tora about what empire pvp and war decs is even though tora does that every day and have done it for many years while you sit in 00 space carebearing while using alts in empire for industrial things you even barely do pvp at all so how can you expect us to believe you when you have pretty much zero pvp experience to begin withjust because you are sad because you know that tora knows better than you you dont have to claim that you are better than him at this because you are not you are not even remotely near himoh also the new rebirth is called deadly fingertips if camping stations and gates brings tons of kills and tons of isk income then who gives a rat ass about doing thatyou are simply to scared to admit it that you are afraid of the marmite because they are so effective at killing stuffs that way yeah you have several alts in empire righti bet 5 dollars that some of your alts have been war deced by marnmite many times if they are in a player corporation and you have simply been hiding from them thats the plain fact of why you are so angry at tora and marmite in general yeah you think you know more than tora but hey i also think that tora knows much more about empire pvp and war decs than you do does that makes me to be more right about it just because i think sono i know this because its a fact no matter how little you like to hear it or not you can disagree and go buuhuu as much as you like but everyone who knows tora knows im talking the truth
the voting has now closed i want to thank those who supported me win or lose i appreciate itgood luck to all the candidates who rani have said it a few times publicly this is my last race for a few years no matter what the results are i have no idea how i will spend the next election season probably sitting back laughing and throwing in the odd comment from the sidei think i have earned itagain thank you allmmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
dang i didnt realize it had opened yet
heres an image of a kitten to thank people that voted for me
fingers crossed for sab
i like your line of thinkingi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
leave jita dude and for the record eve is not a pvp game eve is in actuality a spacefaring society simulator with a nicely fleshed out story addictive elements and a very high challenge level primarily because regardless of whether you are shooting boxes zapping roids or undercutting another trader you are effectively competing with human beings in this regard the game is crafted to cater to predatory behavior outperforming others is the main motivation for most of what we do killboards wallets shiny spacepixels you name it very few roam the stars aimlessly for very long as i understand it eve has one of the lowest new player retention scores of any longrunning successful mmoas in real life this game hands you few cushions and even fewer second chances to actually make something of yourself you either find a niche here friends commonalities purpose or you move on you are perfectly capable of being a pure carebear but the nature of most others will seldom mirror your owni would even go so far as to say that the driving force behind the careers of all truly invested eve players is that they are the sort of people who ultimately want to either save the universe or destroy itand as for the notion that eve was once an eden as it were the older players here must surely remember the exploits of the guiding hand social club and the rest of this games pioneer social engineers so please reconsider wearing those rosecolored glasses
for me as for many other players a visual part of the game experience is essential i really liked the new model of the moa its amazing and its derivatives but in the latest update of the model of the eagle was changed again it added that awful hump and round antenna it looks so appalling that excellent ship seems to me unsuitablei would like to see the model eagle similar to original moa or redesigned to something like onyx which looks pretty goodmy suggestion  if not completely return the eagle model without hump then add this model as the skin in aurumshop so anyone like me wishing to fly on a beautiful and powerful t2 ship will be able to get itps sorry for my poor english
no politician responds to every mouth fart of the rabble i should point out that voting is over yet youre still full of blather and bombast this must be really important to you put on your powdered wig grab your roberts rules and throw some elbows
theres a major error in logic you should look up its called begging the question and you should stop doing it using dismissive language does not render your points valid when you lack the reasoning to back it up  and so far you have not ebgaged in anything that might be described as reasoning while were at it try to figure out which error of reasoning leads you to believe that i am replying necessarily because this is really important to me
im not trying to start an agrument with you lucas nor did i read most of toras and your debate but that bit caught my eye but isnt the fact that most highsec corps are inherently easy targets a problem with how the game encourages play like as such people think highsec should be a safe pvpfree zone or at least have the impression that it should be and when they get wardecgankedwhatever they overreact they think they being abused i would say its the systems fault for not properly letting them know whats going on i would deffently agree the wardec systems needs to be changed i would say that all of the npe need to be heavily reworked im glad ccp is working on that deletetheweak
lucas next time i go back to marmitehisec come join me i promise ill find you ships that shoot back 
in the end its all about risk versus profit and attack options versus counter options if you keep these two in balance you get great content and how to do this well not everyone agrees on how to do it
lol so unless im for making wardecs more unbalanced than they already are im not allowed an opinion thats really not how it works bro and war mechanics are very simple so i doubt tora knows anything more than anyone else thats been here a while was he even here for old style war decsi have youre just not reading before you leap in to defend himlol tora would be a disgrace to the csm he favours his own playstyle at the expense of others and hes near incapable of a reasonable discussion i guarantee you that i understand the game far more than you think you attack me but you know absolutely nothing about meim not saying i know more about pvp im saying i know as much about wardec mechanics because they are a very simple system and theres not many mechanics to know and once again you know nothing about me i have plenty of experience with pvp both in empire and out of it you presume too muchwhats wrong with mechanics that are obviopusly unbalanced i dunno buddy maybe you should think about that why does sov and jump mechanics need to be changed the cfc is so effective at owning half of null so who gives a rats ass about doing that the answer is everyone else because us owning everything is a clear sign that the game is unbalanced its the same for you lot a bunch of people who wouldnt know skilled pvp if it jumped up and bit them in the ass wardeccing thousands of noobs and farming them like they were npcs thats a clear sign the game is unbalanced im going to laugh my ass off when ccp announce changes and you implode with rageand youd lose 5 dollars there friend ive not been decced by marmite even once if i ever were the 3 people i have in a corp wouldnt care since they dont undock  not ever and ive made it totally clear why ive got this opinion about wardecs ive stated reason ive made a point you simply dont want to read it so youll just sit there badly smacktalking as you always doreally though your opinion is irrelevant ccp are already going to look at wardecs and when they do your crying about how you should be allowed to farm newbies will mean nothing youre incapable and objectively looking at the mecahnics so youll likely have no say in what they change
snip please refrain from personal attacks isd ezwalhow wrong can you be when you think every corporation and alliance in eve is one of stupids bound to fail unless ccp holds their hands how completely ridiculous you look by arguing that until you are blue in the facehow silly you are when bleating on and on about killing noobs in podsshuttles as if thats a thingnewsflash veersie most groups that interacted with marmite or the others got to have fun got better from it and thrived the small minority of debate club rejects that want to form a corp with their 7 alts to farm purples might not be doing so well but they like you were doomed to fail from the startsnip please refrain from personal attacks isd ezwald
the problem is that youve got players who do nothing but pvp the with guns kind as thats not all that pvp is able to switch off concord and attack players who play in other ways they stand no chance of fighting back because thats not what they do and they dont want to fight back as thats not what they enjoy effectively what that means is that highsec favours pvp with guns to the point that its impossible to have a decently sized nonpvp group hence groups like redfrog and prosynergy operating out of npc corpsas we all know that new players tend to stay longer if they are part of a group it means that new players choosing to stay in highsec have the choice of joining a pvp group or playing alone or in a very small group the fact that youre better off running a larger pve group in null than in highsec for safety reasons is a good sign that the security part of high security isnt effective whether people want to accept it or not high security is supposed to be safer what people like tora push for is to maintain the status quo so they can continue to farm there with ease its good for them but not for the gamein part social groups will solve that but i dont think it will be enough and ccp knows this the old wardec system had its flaws but it was more prohibitive of the mass farming style of wardecs people do now so back when i started large scale nonpvp highsec groups were actually viable now they simply arent the problem is both the changes to wardec mechanics and the specialisation of groups like marmite what risk do you have farming newbies and industrials the problem is that its not balanced right now youre happy with that because youre on the winning side you need to learn to be more objective im happily watching ccp smash though my entire playstyle with a sledgehammer because i know and accept than null mechanics are out of balance i dont necessarily agree with how they are doing everything but i understand why its neededwar decs will change and when they do you will be negatively affected thats something you will have to learn to accept one day or not you know your call ccp will be pushing ahead regardless though because theres glaringly obvious balance issues there
maybe have newbies start in safe nullsec and when they are ready they can try evil highsec i just call bull  when i see people cry about how others are so evil to them its unfair its unbalanced bla bla etc you have exactly the same options as the attacker side so accept youre weak or htfu and become better at what you doif in an fps i get killed by a better skilled player do i cry the game is unbalanced broken bla etc  no i accept he is better in this game and try to become better myself stop looking at others and start looking at what you can do yourself to become better at this gamethe game must be broken because the pl is better at nullsec then marmites  of course not do we cry about that hell no we try to get better 
snip please refrain from personal attacks isd ezwalthey stand no chance of fighting back yes they do they dont want to fight back hey i dont want to farm isk but ccp isnt handing it to me for free because of thatwhat that means is that highsec favours pvp with guns eve  pvp game pvp with guns wits social skills number smarts etc but pvp yeshence groups like redfrog and prosynergy operating out of npc corps they adapted they win you whineas we all know that new players tend to stay longer if they are part of a group it means that new players choosing to stay in highsec have the choice of joining a pvp group or playing alone or in a very small group you just refered to redfrog and prosynergy those are not very small are they the fact that youre better off running a larger pve group in null than in highsec for safety reasons is a good sign that the security part of high security isnt effective and yet hisec is much more alive and is the place to be for pve and pvphigh security is supposed to be safer it is a lot what are you trying to say cant hear you through your tearsback when i started large scale nonpvp highsec groups were actually viable now they simply arent time for you to come off your high horse and smell the hisec buddy there are literally thousands of those groups active and thriving in hisecwhat risk do you have farming newbies and industrials  we dont farm anything and everyone is a potential killeryou need to learn to be more objective project muchwar decs will change and when they do you will be negatively affected pretty sure they need to change but not how you think corp hopping should go thats a given and that will happend
or ccp balance it out so highsec is what it was designed to be rather than the broken system it is now that involves both lowering rewards and tightening up restriction on wardecsbut it is unbalanced do you unserstand that there is more in eve than just shooting each other right now highsec corps are pretty much restricted to either being a bunch of alts or a group that wants to do pvp corporations in highsec are uselss for a large scale nonpvp group thats obviously a balance issue for gameplay styles that are not yoursand fps game is designed to be people shooting each other if an fps game also had a pve section but anyone who did that got immediately wiped out by one of the pvp guys then yes it would be out of balanceyou problem seems to stem down to you not understanding that eve is a sandbox and that shooting each other with guns isnt a mandatory activity someone who chooses not to shoot someone else should not be at a disadvantage automatically thats not what eve is
i understand this but what you dont seem to understand is that all these fun things in eve are interactive with each other eve doesnt have a little corner somewhere where you can safely pve indy and not care about the pvp side of it
quotedanalee they stand no chance of fighting back yes they do a nonpvp corp has a chance against a group that specialises in attacking nonpvp players i think not your alliance kb stats seem to agree with me there they dont want to fight back hey i dont want to farm isk but ccp isnt handing it to me for free because of that and yet you farm that isk by killing industrial players through pvp so you can play the way you want but others arent allowed to how about we add a mecahnic where i can force your alliance to only be abel to engage in pve for a week so you either have to pve or quit your corp thats the equivalent of what wardecs do to nonpvp players it forces them into a gameplay style they do not enjoywhat that means is that highsec favours pvp with guns eve  pvp game pvp with guns wits social skills number smarts etc but pvp yes wrong eve is a sandbox virtual world pvp has a big place in it but there are other aspects of the game that said why should pvp with guns be more viable than other styles of playhence groups like redfrog and prosynergy operating out of npc corps they adapted they win you whine they didnt adapt they accepted the fact that a nonpvp group cant run a large corporation in the current broken mechanics and they fell back to npc corps newsflash if the best course of action is to use an npc corp then the mechanics is broken since that should never be the best choice npc corps should be a last resort not the best choiceas we all know that new players tend to stay longer if they are part of a group it means that new players choosing to stay in highsec have the choice of joining a pvp group or playing alone or in a very small group you just refered to redfrog and prosynergy those are not very small are they they arent operating as proper corporations though they have to run as npc alts because to do otherwise is suicide the fact that youre better off running a larger pve group in null than in highsec for safety reasons is a good sign that the security part of high security isnt effective and yet hisec is much more alive and is the place to be for pve and pvp its more alive due to the game as a whole being more alive than it used to be and lets face it most people playing in highsec are npc alts or in personal corpshigh security is supposed to be safer it is a lot what are you trying to say cant hear you through your tears it is in some ways not in others a corporation that doesnt focus purely on pvp is safer in any other section of space than highsecback when i started large scale nonpvp highsec groups were actually viable now they simply arent time for you to come off your high horse and smell the hisec buddy there are literally thousands of those groups active and thriving in hisec ok name 5 large scale lets say 30 unique players nonpvp groups that operates entirely in highsec and doesnt use alts to avoid wardecs should be easy since there are thousandswar decs will change and when they do you will be negatively affected pretty sure they need to change but not how you think corp hopping should go thats a given and that will happen do you mean corp hopping or do you mean corp rolling not that it matters either way they will both stay or be replaced with equivalent functionality
im not playing that game mangyou seem to know a lot about me lucas nothing is true but dont let that stop youfor isk ive got an alt who runs lvl 4 missions in a corp with 7 other people nice people never had any troublei dont make isk with pvp it just doesnt work like that for me dont know why you would think thatwhen you say pve is safer in low and null im sure you are joking at least tell me you are jokingdid you mean pve is safer when you are in a corpalliancenullbloc that has pvp players protecting the bordersthan you are correct and prove my pointcheck here if you are looking for a good hisec industrie or exploration or incursion group its a good startthanksif you have time pray tell how would you change wardecsd
and i get that i just think the current ability for a group such as your to force hundreds of corps into having to fight back or hide only serves to strip away fun from those groups to favour you an industry group has no interest in fighting with guns and they usually have no skill in it either wardecs as they currently stand encourage you to pick the weakest target to make the most profit this means that as the system currently stands the best choice for highsec industrial groups is to not exists in an official capacity i honestly dont know how you can possibly look at how groups like redfrog are forced to operate to survive and cant see that theres a glaring balance issue there that leads me to believe that you can see theres an obvious balance issue but because you benefit from it being out of balance you simply deny it the thing is interactive is a broad term its not just shooting people and yet thats all you seem to recognise people like you and danalee can sit there and go on about the carebears and say htfu as much as you want but people play eve for different reasons and in different ways they shouldnt be forced to play it the way you want just because you want to force them toeven if you do make it onto the csm which i doubt ccp are likely to change wardecs in ways that you probably wont like at the end of the day they are providing for the whole playerbase not just what benefit your group at some point you will actually have to put some actual effort in for the masses of rewards that you reap
wow a whole 7 people apologies though i thought you were a halfcompetent pvper you should be able to make considerably more than level 4 missions when you are farming haulersi didnt say pve is safer learn to read i said operating a large scale pve group is safer and it is if you tried to run a 100 man industrial corp in highsec youd be permadecced by like 5 groupslol so tldr while you say there are thousands of large pve groups operating in highsec you cant name 5
we dont farm anything it doesnt work like that try it youll know level 4 missions make solid isk and dont force me to suckup to some spacemonkey scrublord to be allowed to farm in nullbear landonly 5 wardecs if youd try to run a 100 man industrial corp in lowsec you wont be able to undock everin null you wouldnt be able to get the corp started in the first place because you need to interact with the locals to do ityour premise is this magic 100 man corp doesnt want to do that think about it man i know youre pretty smart you figure it outi can name more than that weve wardecced a lot of them some even gave us bloody noses others made a deal others lost ships and carried on others dont exist anymore which is all good for the gameim waiting for your magic change that will make hisec better for everyone by the wayd
for a quick win id restrict outgoing aggressive wars to 5 or 10 this would stop mass wardec farminglong term id remove the entire system as it currently stands and replace it with a method for taking short term control of sections of space so pve activity within it pays you  you get a cut of market fees taxes repair bills etc the aim would be to give pvp groups something to fight over while giving pve players ways to support the groups they want to support by playing the way they want one of the best examples of pvp in highsec working as it should was when rvb were taking pocos and the mercs all went after them two way fighting is far better at generating meaningful combat than the one sided turkey shoots that wardecs currently promotei wouldnt do it like sov with structure shoots and timers itd be much quicker so you literally just fly over and stake a claim and as long as noone is contesting that you win control straight away for a day or so if someone wants to contest it they fly over and do so and then both groups are free to fire on each other at will i suppose it would be like a cross between fw and sov but faster paced
i like that long term idea its goodthere is cause for interaction add something to gently but steadily move players away from npc corps and you are goldenrestricting outgoing wardecs is gamey and will be gamed especially when combined with the current other corp mecanicsi make corp wardec 10 other corps becuase they taunted me or something and they all drop and reform corp nah lets not the temporarely claiming of systems yeah love itdps we are actually having fun with rvb again
of course you dont you just mass wardec corps and destroy their ever replenishing industrial ships for loot oh wait that is farmingand i dont farm in nullbear land like level 45 missions its peasant isk i make most of my isk trading in highsec and i enhance that with production the reason im in a null group is so that i can readily engage in large scale pvp and run some trade in null secill have to take your word for it in low since nobody lives there because its terribad as for null there are loads of pve groups parts of the cfc are pure pve as are most of the renters yes you need to interact but you dont need to do it with gunsso start naming ones that still exists would generally be good as it would only prove my point more if you names groups that couldnt survive
glad you like it i dont want to see pvp gone form highsec i just want to see it have meaning and not push out players who play in other waysgaming that system by the way is simple to fix if a corp disbands cancel the war and refund the fee if no kills were made but like i say thats only what id consider as a quick win to help corps survive a bit longer rather than a long term change long term there would be no restriction on how many areas you contest at a time if youre big enough to dominate the whole of the force more power to you
lets focus on this i believe it to be the key to a common groundyou say you dont need to interact with guns in nullsec yesim saying that in hisec you dont need to do that eitherin null everyone can shoot you  more dangerous less optionsin hisec you have to announce 24hours upfront you intend to shoot someone  less dangerous gives you more optionsagreeddedit uh ow tora disagrees with us lucas and still i hope he gets into csm because i know him and i know hes not like you think he is at all hes an open minded smart cookie that will try and influence our sandbox in a positive way with an as large as possible playerbase in mind
i think we spend way more on ccp war fees then we get back in loot loot fairy hates us if it was just for the loot i would stop war deccing people have you any idea how much we spend on war dec fees a week  its not like ganking where you try to hit high value ships your war ideas sound horrible to me if i wanted to do sov things i would have moved full time to nullsec it would kill the entire meta gaming it would prevent people to go after the rich incursion players etc it would kill the economic war far we often work for industrials who want us to kill their competitiondid you know there are many highsec alliances who work together with mercenary alliances and who hardly care about wars  those are the smart ones who do get it
if youre only looking at it mechanically then yes  but if you look at it in context of how it actually works out there are less people in null as the population is lower meaning intel is better and less people are around to attack you in the first place to get to you they have to fly thorough space where they also can be attacked looting your wrecks is considerably harder in null so you are less likely to be farmed for incomeall in all if youre in highsec and dont plan on doing pvp youre better off either in an npc corp or if you do missions in a solo corp its sad that that is the case but there it is
id guess at 2030b a week and lets look at your kills 318b is what zkillboards lists for marchso if your war decs are 30bweek that works out to 43bday so for the 12 days of march so far thats 516b that means if the loot fairy drops at least 166 youre in profit and thats not even including how much you are paid by clients for those wardecsif you arent making isk you are doing something very wrongand of course my ideas sound horrible to you you want easy riskfree kills against noobs you already cant go after the rich incursion players since they can disband and reform their single player corp with ease
your calculations are wrong in so many ways im not even going to explain it to you hint eve ships pocos posses pods loot stealing splitting the loot srp etc etc  who are you to decide if we re doing things wrong or right  you know how arrogant this sounds  i dont care if you dont get it but at least dont pretend to do so youre also avoiding all points i made why your systems is terribad and i kick myself for keep trying to educate you on highsec wars i give uppointless
crazy maths for the wineven yesterday i farmed lots of implants from a pod awesome loot maybe that was in my dreamswe all know exploded ship  loot no what is it only the modscargo that has a chance to drop ohwe all know mercs never loose a ship right what those blinged out boats get exploded just as easily as the targets ouchwe know in hisec there are not much players stealing loot right like in jita everyone has plenty time to loot their kills no darnitpocos drop awesome loot thannot even that jeebus what happened here lets all go to null and not interact with anyone to do pved
quick and dirty rough calcs they are just as wrong as your claim that you dont make isk from the loot drops but they point to the truth i can guarantee if we did a data pull from zkb and looked at only dropped loot youd still be in profit over your war costs youll deny it of course because you want to put across this idea that youre hard done by you dont want your insanely easy playstyle made more difficult and youll say anything you can to keep it as it is even if it your ridiculously laughable claims that you dont make profit you are far far far worse than any carebear has ever been because you not only want your playstyle to be easy but you want it that way at the direct detriment of other peoples playstyles
ask gevlon to calculate it it wont be perfect but at least much better then most others would do
its not even close to quick and dirty my rough calculations are based on experience and wallets which go down why do you think most marmites have more then one char  its to make isks your calculations are based on nothing and it showsseriously mate make the calculation i dare you ill send you a fedo and a quafe if you re right
dude are you seriously attempting to claim that marmite is operating at a loss sorry but theres absolutely no way i believe that to be true you guys are terrible but youre not that terrible
yes thats what i am saying we are not in it for the isks if i wanted isks i would go do incursions industry trading etc if we were i might even agree with youbut i am ending this discussion as its pointless i tried to educate you many times but you just dont get it or want to get it
the best part is that hes yelling sandbox while doing so while trying to actively take away player freedomsnip please refrain from personal attacks isd ezwal

im not arguing to remove freedom in the same post argues to remove freedomyou astonish me thats not a good thing
lol snip please refrain from personal attacks isd ezwal apparently when you way freedom what you mean is absolutely everything must maintain the exact same status quo for eternity otherwise freedom is breached if thats the case then yes i guess by balancing wardecs so they arent stupidly easy the freedom of players to farm newbies with great ease is removed and im ok with thatat the end of the day if thats the way you see it then every patch that affects the eve client is the removal of freedom in tiamat 15 the freedom for me to have crackling audio in large fleet fights was removed those monsters
haha you arent aware that you are the only one in here claiming toras idea will make it worserwe are in fact several peoples here pointing out that your arguments are wrong deal with ityour dumb agenda is something you can take elsewherebut we have with several peoples in here pointed out that your reasonings or arguments to that are flawed and bad if you can say alone that yo uare right then we for sure can break that argument by saying we are several peoples in here that says we are right toi attack you in the same way as you attack several peoples at the same time in here you are worser because im attacking just you while you are attacking several peoples in here no matter what they are sayingnow please be silence or at least get some fqacts before you comes with dumb arguments that doesnt hold wateryes you do because you seems to be the god of how empire pvp and war dec works and tells us who do those 2 things daily and have done it for years that we are wrong you have to do alot of pvp in empire before you can fully understand the whole things behind empire pvp and war decs in generalyes i know some things on how manufacturing works but as i dont do it i cant say i knows alot about it same applies to you you dont do pvp and cant say how empire pvp and war decs works as pvp is a huge part of it what you think you know is just the surface of what empire pvp and war decs is before you can go deeper into it you have to do pvp in empire before you can say more about it thats a factyes there are things in eve that are unbalanced and tora is here to change some of the things in empire to the better no matter how little you like it or not everyone that fully understands empire pvp and war decs sees that the changes tora wants is going to make a better empire pvp and war dec system in eve
no i dont lose 5 dollars its just a lame excuse or maybe you havent directly been war deced by marmites but im pretty sure you have been suicided by some marmites some timesbut hey lets wait for the next excuse that naaaah no you have never been attacked or killed by marmites you in fact reminds me of this personin the same way as your opinions here are irrelevant we are like i said several peoples here that disagree with you while you are the only one in here that doesnt agree with tora so its not hard to figure out on whos right hereofc ccp is going to look at the war decs and empire pvp in the same way as tora is looking to improve it its pretty obvious that there will soon be some changes to those things but what you are forgetting is that tora have tons of supports on his ideas while no one agrees with you in hereso now go troll elsewhere
and yes if you are not aware i was part of those amazing fights just watch the video under if you havent done it already
im not the only one thats stated that in this thread and certainly not the only once thats stated that wardecs are balanced in favour of the wardec groups overall and what we have here is several of the usual suspects in here telling me im wrong because their misrepresented version of my argument is wrong other than proving that im on to a point that you consider significant it proves nothing when you have a reasonable argument for why you think its ok that groups like red frog are unable to create actual corporations and have to instead work from npc corps let me knowin addition danalee has asked me what i feel should be done instead and even agreed with the rough idea i threw together in 10 minutesbut you havent youve just told me im wrong and said it must be so because tora does lots of wardecs the fact that he is on the aggressive side of wardecs makes it more likely that his opinions are biased considerably in favour of wardeccers and that his views are subjective not lessim not attacking anyone im attacking the ideas and principles put forward by a csm candidate for there obvious bias youre automatically assuming that in my 10 years of experience ive missed out on the basic mechanics that make up wardecs further you are resorting to launching personal attacks at me calling me stupid dumb etc its the generally expected response when i challenge players like yourself so im really not bothered by it but it doesnt get you anwywhereat no point have i claimed to be the god of anything youre projecting your opinions of what im saying as fact that doesnt make it so youre also still making the same wrong assumption that i dont do pvp ive been involved in highsec wardecs ive taken part in faction warfare and am in the process of training a character to run in spectre fleet im not claiming to have run thousands of wardecs but then thats not a prerequisite of understanding how the mechanics workand the thing is being an outside to a process gives an objective view of it toras opinions are clouded by his own wants he favours ideas that benefit him take for example the dreadnaughts in highsec idea thats obviously going to benefit aggressive wardeccers allowing them to contest structures more easily a smaller group isnt going to stand a chance of running a dreadnaught without attracting a lot of attention from the likes of marmitechange the to the better for him other playstyles will suffer under nearly all of the changes tora has suggested he wants evil and by that he means he wants it to be even easier for wardec groups to dominate hundreds of corps at a time and even less possible for them the evade i dont disagree that what he wants will make empire wardecs better for the aggressors thats obviously true but the system is already unbalanced in favour of the aggressors so i dont believe that making it more unbalanced in their favour is a good idea
nightmarex you are missing out we went for round 2 but allied with rvb and uhurt now against russian mercs its the bombd
nope marmites have literally done nothign to me ever i know you dont understand that i know that in your mind for me to disagree with wardecs it must be because at some point something bad has happened to me it simply isnt true i look at mechanics objectively and the way wardecs are implemented is not balanced it really is that simple whether you believe it or not is irrelevantwell apparently my opinions are relevant enough to warrant responses from at least 4 different people and to cause yourself and danalee to throw several personal attacks at meand lol so in your eyes the person who is right is the one that has a couple of people on his side throwing around insults one in marmites and one exmarmites yes yes a very unbiased set of opinions obviously tora must be perfectly correct  even though youre yet to explain to me why groups like redfrog are unable to create a proper corporation to run operations out of without getting permadecced and destroyed  an obvious sign that the system is unbalanced in favour of pvp playersccp are not going to make the types of changes tora wants they want to reduce wardecs as they are currently keeping people from forming corps in highsec that arent purely pvp based which in turn damages player retention mass farming of war targets the way current highsec mers do is simply bad for business
no one have denied that the war decs arent in favour of the war dec groups we have simply pointed out that some changes for the better are better than nothing and toras ideas will make it better thats the point but maybe not good enough for youmaybe i havent done that but others in here have pointed out flaws with your reasons to deny toras ideas thats more of the point hereyes you are in fact attacking some peoples in here when a person like you with pretty much zero experience in war decs and empire pvp claims to know more about it than others who have done it for years and every day you are pretty much slapping them in the face in a bad wayso its a way of attacking someone with the real experience in thisyes you are in fact claiming to know more about the mechanics behind the war dec and empire pvp system as you think someone with alot of experience in this are wrong while you claim you think you know whats better there is only you your self that think your arguments or ideas are better than those who have experience in thisand this is basicly the issue here with you you cant discuss without thinking you know better how to solve something you have zero experience inand to the last thing what you fail to see is that tora is the only csm candidate to bring up some new ideas that will make empire pvp and war decs a little better ofc his ideas isnt 100 optimal but they are way better than not having ideas on how to change them to the betterthis is the reason why i support toraagain this is nothing more than just your own opinion im pretty sure toras ideas is a good way to go as many others who actually does empire pvp and war decs on a daily basis supports himthe more peoples who supports him the better his ideas actually are now find me the number on how many that doesnt support tora in getting empire pvp and war decs to be better heregood luck
haha i dont think anyone in here believes your lies about that there is a pretty obvious reason why you are so mad at marmite and toraand how many of those 4 agrees with you compared to the others in this topic who agrees with tora herego figureagain there are alot of things in eve that are unbalanced but we have to take one thing at a time and tora is like i have said is bringing out some new ideas to improve empire pvp and war dec in general if you dont agree then fine but his case shows good support from this topic so its not hard to see who is righthey are you ccpoh god the fact that you think you knows so much that you think you are ccp to is even more flattering and laughableno you arent ccp so stop with the agenda that ccp is not gonna look at toras ideas because every ideas that the csm candidates have is going to be looked at
hmmm nice do you have any battlereports from that
so wait you agree that they are unbalanced in favour of aggressors and yet see no problem in making them even better for the aggressorsbut they havent theyve literally just said im wrong called me a carebear and told me to htfu the classic responses from people who have no actual responseonce again i didnt claim to know more and once again i dont have zero experience thats your projection at no point have i attacked anyone and if you feel i have report the postno im not ive even stated multiple time the exact opposite of that and no tora is not the only csm candidate to propose ideas to improve wardecs hes the only one to propose making them even more unbalanced in favour of wardeccers but at least a couple of others have discussed wardec mechanics in their campaignsand great support tora if you want things to be more unbalanced in your favour then its a good idea to support him im not saying its not what im saying is i dont support him because i support game balanceso you agree with what i said then that toras ideas benefit his playstyle thats all im saying here wardecs are already unbalanced in favour of aggressors and his ideas unbalance them even more to make things even better for wardeccers
who cares im unaffected by what you think is my reasoning for supporting game balance if you want to think its because of marmites then by all means proceed to think thathahahahahahahahahaha so yes you honestly believe that a marmite leader having other marmite players agreeing with him makes him automatically right that is amazing whats even funnier is in your previous post you even agree with me that the game is unbalanced in favour of wardeccersno im not ccp i have however read what ccp and the existing csm have put out in regards to wardecs its quite obvious they are seen as a barrier to the npe and its not hard to see where ccp will go when they decide to look at wardecs i very much doubt that will involved making them easier and adding dreadnaughts
read one more time on what im saying im saying the current system is somewhat favouring the aggressor over the defender thats why i said i supports toras ideas on making it better so it doesnt have to be like thatthey have you are so much obsessed that you know this things so much that their arguments towards you goes undetected to youyes the way you claim others ideas are bad and your ideas are better even though the others have way more experience in this is a way of attacking maybe if you have had some proven experience in this matter it would be taken another way but its not you dont have enough experience in this to dig deep enough into the real matter of the mechanics behind empire pvp and war decsmaking it more unbalanced is only your own argument can you explein why they gets more unbalanced with toras ideasno i dont agree on that i agree that i want to see some positive changes to empire pvp and those who takes part of it no matter what the ideas are those who gets war deced will also be a part of empire pvp so its for both partsall im saying is that im positive to see some better changes independent of what the changes are for those who takes part of empire wars and war decs
we cares because its sooooo obvious on why you are mad at marmite and tora there cant be any other reasons behind itliving in a bubble are youif you looks outside of that bubble you will realize that there are way more than just marmites that agrees with toraand no im saying that the war dec system today isnt optimal and are somewhat favouring the attackers over the defenders however there are many other things aswell that are favouring someone over others this is eve and welcome to evethen stop claiming that you are ccp the way you say things then you are quite alot on the defence on saying big words about how things are without realizing that you are a noob about this case
usually i dont get involved but i just wanna put this here for the lols
by making it favour them morefor example sigh claiming someones idea which you have agreed improves the game for aggressors is beneficial to the aggressors in a system which is already unbalanced in their favour  which you also agree  is not claiming to know more than them about the system its simply reading their idea understanding its impacts and responding with criticism i really dont care if you want to keep claiming i have no experience which is fundamentally wrong and thus that i am not allowed an opinion which is also wrong ill continue to hold my views and no matter how many times you attempt to insult me those views will remaindo you honestly need me to explain why adding dreadnoughts to highsec would favour wardec groups over pve groupsmy ideas offer positive changes for empire pvp they offer direct income from pve players by encouraging pvp groups to engage each other thus negating the need to farm newbies or run pve when you are interested in pvp so apparently no what you are positive to see is changes which make your playstyles easier more rewarding and less risky so youre a carebear
lol there cant be any other reasons except the actual reason which i actually gave you look mate im not going to get into this with you if you want to believe it go ahead ill continue on in realityi apologise theres also an exmarmite and exafterbirth players and a personal troll who follows me literally everywhere disagreeing with anything i say good showand yes this is eve the game where the developers are obviously looking at improving the npe and balancing out of balance mechanics my playstyle is being nuked and i accept that because its good for the game when they get to wardecs your tears will be deliciousi didnt claim that not once go ahead and find out where i stated that i was ccp i simply stated what ccp have put across to the playerbase over the recent few months wardec changes will be incoming do you honestly think they are going to make them favour the aggressors more and push even more players into npc corps honestlywhat lols would those be i have an idea that its to do with a lack of comprehension on your part  no offense
i have one main toon go search my kill board for marmite i dont think there is anything therethey certainly havent done anything to me directly that i remember or care abouthowever i remember what it was like being new to the game and having groups that used the war dec mechanics to their advantage against easy targets to farm kills i remember what it is like having the fat kids sitting waiting around the corner in jita to take your lunch moneytaking advice from tora on war declaration mechanics would be like hens taking hutch building designs from a fox have to admire that honesty though
thats just your own words no im looking at both sidesmaybe go back and read what the experts with tons of experience in this are telling youi havent said that im supporting to make it better for the aggressors while leaving the defenders in the dust im in support for making it better for both parts and many of toras ideas does thatso you think the pvpers is the only one that could use dreads if they are allowed in empirewhat differences does dreads make it from battleships that every pveers can use toif i can bring a dread to instapop a pveers battleship then i for sure can bring 5x vindicators that will do the same anywaysok so you are again using big words by telling your ideas are best and the other ideas from others are bad again you dont have experience in thismaybe some of your ideas are good im not denying it but when you deny others idea to be bad while others are telling you that some of your ideas also are bad and dont want to see that then im not gonna bother to talk with a guy who obviously are in full circle masturbation mode about how great and badass your ideas is
so why are you so mad at marmitelike everyone else or most of the others in here disagrees with you it seems that you havent figured out that yetyou said that ccp wouldnt even look at toras idea in a way that would make it sounds like your some kind of a hidden ccp member its the way you say things that makes it looks like you are telling things like your some kind of a god
well that appears to not be the case how exactly do toras ideas benefit players defending against wardecs how is giving marmite access to dreadnoughts not going to severely damage the ability for a pve player to hold a pos in high secbut they dont and thats my point his ideas favours him some have no impact on him and still detriment other players like his idea to force miners to play minigames in order to minei think any smaller group or nonpvp group would get crushed if they attempted to field a dreadnought while groups like marmite would be able to more quickly smash through structuresexcept other arent telling me my ideas are bad danalee liked the idea i put forward youve seemingly not read it as for toras ideas im not even saying they are outright bad ideas they are simply favouring an already overpowered group and thus i dont feel would benefit the group as a whole they would definitely benefit wardeccers quite obviously
im not i have no more a feeling toward marmite than i do deadly fingertips or poh it just so happens that out of all the wardeccer groups its marmites leader that has launched a csm campaign based on making the game even more unbalanced in their favourlol read back through these posts its marmites exmarmites and well known trolls disagreeing hardly what i would call objective opinions that said youve agreed with parts of what ive said  such as aggressors being overpowered in wardecs  and so has danalee  such as my idea for change well then the fault lies with your ability to understand english ill put it more plainly based on ccps recent decisions the information released by ccp and the csm and ccps stated aims i find it unlikely that they would be in support of toras ideas as they would detract further from the npe and further block access to meaningful social contact please note im not ccp and last i checked im not god but i run a close secondbetter
again the pveers usually have tons of isk what makes it that you think that the pveers cant field tons of dreads to counter the dreads we are using to shoot the pos withif we can then everyone else canthey dont only according to you look at all of the others who actually agrees with tora what about themthey are wrong according to you because you think you are better than all of themand you think the pveers with poses would just sit there and do nothing if they also can use dreadsofc the pveers will unleash their dreads aswell to fight usnot only that but if im deciding that i want to kill a poco or whatever in empire i will kill it no matter what the only differences from battleships to dreads is how long time it takes to kill a poco  posso is there any differences hereok so you think all of your ideas are good just because danalee did agree on one of your ideasway to overhype your self dude
yes you are you are mad at marmite because im pretty sure they are preventing some of your alts to have a steady income of isk they are disrupting you in some waysyeah danalee did agree with you on one thing so that makes everyone in here agreeing with you amriteagain thats according to you on how you looks at eveall that matters is that tora have some good supports here and im pretty sure that he will get pretty high up on the list of the csm candidates but im not saying he will get through as a real csm in the end im just saying that by looking at this topic he for sure have alot of supports
im sure pve players will do really well in their shiny new dreads against career pvp players lolbut objectively they favour him youve even stated yourself that they improve the game for pvp playersi think that as usual the pve players would be powerless to fight back against career pvp players the only thing that saves a lot of their poses right now is that you cant be bothered to grind them down reads would change thatthats not at all what i said im just pointing out that when you keep saying that everyones disagreeing that youre obviously wrong
wrong grow up believe it or not many eve players actually care about balance in the game thats all this isagain not what i said once again you misrepresent meno thats according to what ccp themselves have said educate yourself before screeching onall that matters is that tora is a terrible idea for a candidate if you care about game balance and his ideas are badly though out and favour his playstyle most of the support he has are his alliance and alliance that do what he does simply beacuse they too support ideas that unbalance the game further in their favour anyway im done arguing with you as always you are just going to repeated lie misrepresent ideas and personally attack me were not going to get anywhere constructive with this as its impossible for anyone to have a constructive discussion with you so good day sir
i have removed some replies to edited out parts of the posts they replied toalso please keep in mind that this is a csm campaign thread and not a general discussion or crime  punishment oneisd ezwal community communication liaisons ccls
like they will do any better in battleships against career pvp players nowthere is no differenceyeah i support to have a better pvp and war dec system in empire that reflects both sidesand you think its any different now with battleshipsagain what differences does it make when career pvpers still have an edge over the pveers today with battleships anywaysshow me how many peoples that does agree with you in here and then shows us on how many that does agree with tora here there is a huge difference herei do that aswell but we still have to take one thing at a time you cant expect tora to just put out a complete list of things that will rebalance everything with empire pvp and war decs in one go
well its how it soulds like when you claim someone agrees with you it sounds like you nailed it and that you are right about all of your ideas when some few peoples agrees with some few things with your ideasi kinda want to see the source of what they have said about that infact ccp are open to most ideas as long as it gives some balances and improves the gamestora is a bad candidate to you fine but do we carethe only thing we cares about is to let empire pvp and war decs in general to be better than it currently is yes when i say that this applies both to the aggressor and the defenders
kitties also 1 for sabriz hope you make man deletetheweak
thanks for all the support and votes
bongmong pls
ccp has already brought that up as a possibility that legion if its greenlighted would be shipping ambulation gameplay in the eve universe the engine theyre using certainly supports that kind of game well and they already know how to connect it to the spaceship game so it could happenmaybe not soon maybe not all at once legion will probably start where dust ends as a lobby shooter with a persistent world but its a path of less resistance than attempting incarnawod in space over again
this has always been a pvp game you always compete with other pilots whether its for resources trading or even direct conflictit does not matter if you are a high sec miner or industrialist in your first month of play or you fly super capitals in null or worm hole space the prospect of losing a ship you had to train hard to fly and earn the isk to buy or manufacture is an eventuality every pilot knows whenever he or she undockshow you play the game and what your end goals are is entirely up to you if you dislike pvp stay in high sec you will still lose ships from other players however it wont nearly be so volatile as low null or worm hole spaceyou can run missions in high sec mine manufacture and trade to your hearts content however you are restricted to what you can do and how well you do it by your training time playing more often can improve your talent as a capsuleer but it will not improve your skills unlocked at all becoming good at whatever you choose to do will require time
for what is worth i would have voted for you sadly i am lame and was not aware of the election until today  d
there is so much optimism on the forums that we can actually change each others minds
youre welcome to your opinion but youre wrong a csm candidate needs to be able to answer difficult questions and so far all youve done is pretend they dont exist i have raised some serious concerns about your ability to perform as a valued and contributing member of the csm and you dismiss them due to them being loaded questions at the risk of sounding harsh you really need to toughen up a csm elected member needs to be above such petty dismissals and should give genuine questions a genuine answerall i was looking from you was a bit of background on how the previous experience has helped shape you into the person you are today and that youre better for it and why but i get called a troll instead bravo
yeah see i dont think you actually read the op
have you ever been in a town hall meting or a panel debate because i have and i can tell you from personal experience when youre in the panel when you get asked questions by potential voters you do need to answer them granted you dont always answer directly you dont always answer the question the way the asker intended or even answer honestly but youre acutely aware that youre not just answering one person youre also answering the entire audience you know nothing about the political process judging from your comments here and i think it tells that none of xenurias supporters can continue defending xenurias rejection that any question can have relevancywhat he does here is akin to being asked a question by a journalist or a voter in full public on record and his answer is either i didnt hear that stop pestering me or simply silence almost to each and every question no candidate i know of has ever succeeded in an election this way i should point out that this is entertainment and that doesnt stop being funny because voting is over you also keep assuming that this is important when weve already told you in various ways that no its not really necessary for it to beim entertained for as long as this keeps being funny ill keep participatinghows that for an evaluation of a candidate we did it was worthlessso nonloaded questions that youll still fail to answerhow and why could you see anyone committing any of the above acts how would you see yourself doing it practically and purely hypothetical what practical gain can you see by removing themwhat source do you have that 90 of your voters are femalehave the cfc or any nullsec bloc ever placed you on their endorsed ballot please do show ithow does stv function in broad strokescan it ever hurt your chances to be placed on an endorsed ballot even if lowest compared to not being on itsee these questions are questions and questions into claims youve made that you have yet failed to answer even after repeated questions and if you can notice how none of them even are relevant to a sane persons decision to vote in the csm because nothing of this touches on the csm but alone on your qualifications or lack thereof as a candidate whybecause your candidacy has no substancethis candidacy can only solve one persons problem namely your problem with your own ego that youre not on the csmyoure a joke candidate biting even at the hands trying to help you like nariya not me
but see those are obviously loaded questions and your just trying to make xenuria say something wrong to look badedit sarcasm
this is whats called showing your hand you as a troll have shown your hand by admitting that you are in collusion with others to troll badly this thread asking questions already answeredasking loaded questionsasking questions detailed in the opseriously let it go
so by stating he read your op and that his evaluation of its value was that it had none  somehow thats trollingall you are really doing here is admitting that you are labelling any challenge as trolling to avoid dealing with it ive given you some frank and harsh criticism here and i would be gratified to see you act on it next year to try to run a real campaign but i suspect that the rewl value here will be in showing others what not to do  or if you do win that player disillusionment with the csm is so great that they will elect a candidate with no real ideas just to troll ccp
stop being a bad xenuria people might not troll you maybe
im trusting that i will win and i have allready bought proper clothes for my planetary representative
why are we typing the votes are in it probably doesnt matter if tora won or not sov changes coming shows that ccp probably wont listen to him or the player base actually it would be hilarious if tora goes in talking about all this woes and ccp are like erm  those are easily solved hang on station games  ganking all of this is really broken oh well we dont have a solution guess we just make all 08 to 10 areas where you cant take any hostile action against another player
again im not reading everything said just nit pick tid bits i see just because somebody kills 516 bill does not mean they got 516 bill i can kill a 25 bill vargur it doesnt mean i get the 25 bill shown from the killmail hull cost is a thing that plays are large factordeletetheweak
whats the source of your claim  i read and listen to almost everything in eve and cant remember seeing it but maybe there is another good source i didnt know about yeti agree having just corp mates agree with this isnt the most reliable feedback so i do want opinions from others about it but thats also true for your replies lucas so far i havent seen anyone agreeing with you too maybe less hahaha and more short to the point replies everyone  this isnt a marmites is so terrible or fantastic post lets keep focus on the war mechanism i seriously want to know other opinions then the people who always reply any industrial alliances with an opinion here  how do you handle wars 
im not with marmite most of the group i roam are rather gr marmite but i still voted for tora deletetheweak
honestly i dont remember where ccp put it but it prompted several bloggers to post about it not least of which sugar writing 3 blog posts on wardecs above and beyond that though just look at how wardecs work and what they cause they make it impossible to run a decently sized nonpvp corp in highsec and they are a bigger barrier to corporation membership than awoxing was do you honestly believe they are going to keep the ability to farm war target corps in the hundreds once time comes to look at the wardec systemunfortunately i think that most people with opinions about subjects that are as polarising as this will keep them to themselves since when you voice an opinion about subjects like this its minutes before youve got the usual trolls attacking you and shiptoastingto be clear though my problems with wardecs boil down to the following core issues wars prevent large scale nonpvp corporations from being viable the moment you grow to a substantial size you become a target for wardeccers having a force to fight back still doesnt protect your nonpvpers you pretty much have to switch the whole corp to pvp mode for wardecs which defeats to object of being a pve corp this means the most viable option for a pve players is to remain in npc corps or solo corps  this is the biggest issue npc corps should never be the best choice they dont promote fighting with groups capable of fighting back in fact quite the opposite you are better off farming a lot of players with no desire and no skill to fight back than taking on a challenging war tied in with the above theres too little to actually fight over wars are relatively aimless theres more than enough moons for people to split up and pocos are generally owned buy larger groups who occasionally fight over them this means the general aim of a ward is to destroy a group get loot or simply buff killboard stats wars are aggressor driven the defender has the options of fight back or evade once an aggressor chooses to attack theres no other ways to attempt to deal with it without it being the aggressors decision any attempts to negotiate a surrender have to be agreed by the aggressor so effectively this means that the aggressor is paying to opt you in for content you dont want to play at all allies were put in to try to affect this but for the most part mercs for hire there are either outright scams run by the aggressor or far more expensive than simply disbanding your corp and playing in npc land
true but then on average ships will drop more than 16 of their value especially when your primary targets are industrial corps and haulers like i said then its a quick and dirty calculation rather than actual statistics i truly dont believe that between loot and client fees that marmite operate at a loss i dont think ive met a halfdecent merc group that operates at a loss
1 100 false premise no facts presented discarded2 100 false premise no facts presented discarded3 agreed wars need more meaning4agreed dont know if thats an issue but the premise holds water 4b 100 false premise no facts presented discardedd
ok so to address the ones you disagree one1 prove that large scale nonpvp corps are viable then explain why groups like redfrog and pro synergy are forced to operate with npc alts to do everything besides accepting the contracts2 explain what benefits a group has for fighting competent pvpers over easily farmed industrials and haulers explain why marmite decs countless industrial corps and even pays a high price to dec null groups  who primarily only run haulers in high sec  and why they dont permadec the likes of poh deaf etc to benefit from fighting other pvpers4b for the part about scamming this is done a fair bit ive even done this myself for the part about them being priced too high with the alternative of dropping into an npc corp being quite cheap just tax and reduction in ease of tranferring between characters its obviously true that paying a merc corp will be more out of curiosity if a group got wardecced by a group like poh how much would mamite charge to join as an ally and see them off
falseships like pods and pocos drop 0 of their valuechance based loot drop is a lottery on itself and thats excluding people stealing or shooting your lootadded to that their is a thing like loosing ships which is 100 a costa large percentage of the wars yield no result only cost much iskas a merc corp in eve you have to be very attentive and shrewd to be able to break evend
on average do you know what that means
you cant just refer to peoples blogs who agree with you and tell us its ccps direction thats just as bad as me claiming i am right as marmite members tell me sono worries about trolls here this isnt cp and the isds kill first and then ask questions later in the csm section or use alts and if thats still not acceptable mail me i cant know how people think about eve issues if they dont tell me firstwars prevent large scale nonpvp corporations from being viable if this is possible in any other part of eve why cant you do so in an even more safer part of eve like highsec  so i dont agree with you here during a war only a small part of highsec can shoot you in any other space they can all shoot you what is more dangerous to be in  i think the biggest problem is that highsec has more newbies in it that do not know yet how to counter it when we are at war with non highsec industrials for example mining in highsec they are very hard to kill they watch local are often aligned use the watch lists run locaters from time to time and more smart playing keeps you alive not nerfing the gamei dont agree with you that wars are aimless like i told you before wars are also being used to kill the industrial competition deny wh alliances to move through space during wh evictions deny trade hub use prevent ice miners to clear out entire belts alone and i can give you many more examples and of course there are also wars for no reasons at all we sometimes war dec people for flying a drake do you think people in any other part of eve kill people because theyve good reasons  or is eve always about power isks i want yours i dont like you die mofo etcwars are aggressor driven yes just as in any part of eve so  havent wars always been that way for centuries 
i wont make your argument for you thats not how it works but i can say the following1 redfrog et all arent forced to anything they have options and choose the path of least resistance increasing npc corp penalties will solve this i dont feel there should be 100 pve groups certainly no big ones they dont enrich the game at all in fact they kill it2we like fighting nullsec power blocs hire us to fight their competition also gevlon goblin darn i said it we are hired by industrialpve centric groups to kill of their competition deccing other mercs is counter productive and makes no sense  being hired against other mercs is in fact a thing some groups specialise in that it has in fact the largest chance of nice loot drops but the highest risk with it4b scams are a part of eve your annecdotal evidence isnt evidence its annecdotes if not otherwise occupied we sometimes do it for free when potential costs are high naturally clients need to pay to cover those risks thats commen bussines sense paying a merc can be more expensive short term but it helps you establish a name for yourself and built out your empire allowing for more safety at later stages equalling more profit members and fun in the long runyou know contentd
lol for quoting myself maybe this is something we can add to the npe  missions where an evil villain appears in their local window and they have to warp off in time teach them to counter in stead of nerfing the game
i believe you mean its pulling a number out of your behind it isntships drop 0 of their value  this isnt average this is factnow do your math or dont bleat about numbers you dont understand nor have experience withd
i actually feel dreads in highsec is creating more barriers for new players and forming corps then it would remove due to how easy it would be to wipe out the med and small towers i honestly believe limiting tower sizes to med and small would make high sec posts more competitive without placing every indy pos in high sec at the mercy of those of us who would take advantage of them i gotta tell ya id be the first guy to start ransoming all the indy posts in the hek and rens region  
what makes it so you dont do that now noragendo you realise how much at risk youll be in your lonely dread shooting poshow funny the lossmail will be if some venture or skiff gets you eventually d
i only wanted dreads to be able to shoot large posses no other structures dreads on small medium posses pocos would be way to easy but right now large posses have it to easy i dont like nerfes so i want buffs or new mechanicsmaybe just ignore the entire dreads thing and give battleships in highsec x extra dps if they are hitting a large pos or a module only to be used on battleships in highsec which gives you that extra dps when shooting a large pos
the problem is that highsec has a much higher population and thus far more chance of being attacked by one of the war groups in other areas of space you can use intel channels quite reliably and know that for the most part if someone is on their way youll see them 10 jumps out because theres no other players around they also stand very little chance of being able to camp you out because logistically holding a camp in enemy territory is near impossible in highsec there isnt this problem an aggressor can dock in every station you can and can run logistics just as easily with alts ask yourself why corps like redfrog operate from npc corps yet null rents out space to hundreds of corps who do nothing but industry the problem is you are saying highsec has more mechanical safety thus its more safe thats not true at all some are but the majority are for getting easy loot and buffing killboards with easy kills you cant actually stop players running a given activity with a war you can only force them to do it from an npc corp which is why npc corps are so full of playerslol eve is a sandbox people wshould be able to play however the  they want if a group of players wants to play pve they should be able to and the gameplay should be balanced as it currently stands its not pve players do not kill the game lack of social interaction kills the game and wars destroy that far more than pve does and yes red frog are forced to operate from npc corps because to choose otherwise would be suicideship hulls drop 0 of their value but if you take the total value of every kill on the killboard and what percentage of that value dropped as loot then average that out kills drop more than 16 of their total kill value as loot on average its some pretty simple stuffyou cant buff a mechanic for one group without nerfing another so the only way to have no nerfs is to also have no buffs what you really mean to say is you dont want nerfs to your playstyle and you couldnt care less whether other people get nerfsadding dreads would buff your group but nerf owners of large poses why should a large pos be even easier to take down theyve paid more up front and they pay twice as much as a medium pos in fuel specifically so their pos can be more defensible why should that be taken away because you want an easier time wrecking though industrial players
those are synonyms

ccp should try selling something other than clothing and ship skins for aurum like some sort of flair item for capsuleers cqlike some sort of hologram projector that sits on the table and can display some sort of commemorative image like carolines star or a titan wrecki cant help but think they are wasting an opportunity to bring more money in
i would cheerfully kick in UFFFD15 to a kickstarter for an avatar based wis game since thats the only way were ever going to see it
mining not so much but industry in general is inherently pvp you are selling your goods in competition with other playersmissioning is the closest to pure pve in this game although it still has hooks to market pvp just less than industry
id like to see the statistics before i believe that wholesalei know of several that arent on inactive accountspossibly without the data its merely speculation certainly the changes to industry over the past few years have made t2 invention a lot more competitive than in the pastccp are not likely to release the data about the effect t2 bpos have however it would be interesting to see from players an analysis of margins in markets where no t2 bpo exists vs ones where one doesfang
peeveepeetoday i was the slippery little tomato that escaped the sandwich
i read your op it addressed nothing i asked hence the questions i wont bother you anymore with legitimate questions on how you intend to be as a politician if you by some chance get elected because you seem to have a disdain for the eve community
your platform is one of reform reform of the csm which otherwise there is no point in voting for in your view a view that is not uncommon in your experience i have listened to your interview on capstable you are articulate and probably intelligent however your manner is sadly supercilious i found it more helpful than this phlegmatic thread particularly the discussion of the bullying in game  which you admit has been handled carefully by ccp i cant say that youve supported your case very well otherwise i think that is a shame if behind every question you anticipate attack it can make even the most casual inquiry problematic
reading comprehension i would enable you to see that this isnt where i show my handif anything i show my hand much earlier where i continue to call this entertainmentbut we in this sense isnt even what you think im not in collusion with anyone its just painfully obvious that both the cfc and i have been through your op better than you have yourself in very short no theres no need to troll you or work together on it and there exists to my knowledge no agency for keeping xenuria out of politics because frankly you do a much better job of that than we could ever hope to dohatesmear campaigns only work as long as there is some resemblance of truth something to smear with and youve provided so much of that just bringing up your earlier actions statements or history will derail you personally the rest is just pure entertainment for meand i would guess that a number of the cfc posters as well as nariya have only seen you run for csm this time because had they seen your earlier attempts theyd have given up on any real attempt to help andor improve your campaign but just to see how much youre actually able to read lets see which question was already answered and please provide a linkquote to the answer was loaded of those i asked in the post you quoted was already detailed in the opbecause i seriously doubt youre even able to classify even one of the questions in those categories unless youre going to include earlier times where you rejected the question resi durant take every claim xenuria makes with a grain of salt earlier in this thread he claimed that some low percent of eve players are female which is both fairly ordinary and without consequence and that 90 of his voters are female which would be fairly extraordinary and with a number of implications and then when pressed on it tried to write off the extraordinary claim under the guise of the ordinary he never supplied any evidence for the 90 claim but maybe he waited until it couldnt influence the voting to reveal that he actually does have those numbersnot uncommon in xenurias experience also has to take into account his acknowledgement that he only talks with people who already largely share his sentiments when youre in a secluded group and writes everyone outside off as part of a large conspiracy against you 100 of people you know of will share your experiences combined with an acceptance of anecdotal evidence this leaves xenuria fairly out of touch with eve and the eve communityoh and if anyone cares to spend the time try going through the thread with this list and see how many fallacies xenuria makes compared to me for extra credit mark off when one of my ad hominems is actually just changing subject to xenurias qualifications as a candidate in general instead of this particular runoh and xenuria lets see who gets more votes you in this spaceelection or me in the election for my countrys national parliament later this year itll be a fun competition
ccp plan to implement social corporations that you can not declare war on
good this is also part of my own campaign see op gives small corps the option to grow first
even an analysis of the margins wouldnt tell you about the effect of bpos versus invention it has to do with what the demand for that item is if there is a huge demandmovement of product or a hell of a lot of people participating in that market through production thats going to weigh in more heavily than whether or not that item has a bpo
i remember there was a presentation during fanfest 2013 that touched on t2 bpos with dr egyoaksmkasncaijdfhrkndcsomethingsomethingif i recall correctly t2 bpos accounted for less than 10 of the total production for the most popular items that players usefor items that saw little to no market movement t2 bpos accounted for almost 66also excluding invention costs t2 bpos only have nominally higher margins than t2 bpcs and if you do factor in invention costs you need only produce the bpcproduct in bulk quantities to lower the impact of that cost making the advantage of a t2 bpo come down only to the number of steps and click you have to perform in order to producemake what you will of that info

thanks so much for running mike regardless of what people say you have done good for this game and i really hope that youve been elected again if not enjoy the ability to do just that sit back and laugh hysterically
what country ill write your eve name on the ballot 
does not take a genius to see who has been busy trolling this thread i suppose its to be expected being weird or different on the internetthat said it seems clear that even with an appointment to csm xenuria i think you may very quickly alienate your peers and ccp staff and find yourself shut out of any key discussions and decision making i think the way in which you are approaching the socalled problem statement is adversarial and negative i think there are more constructive ways of driving the kind of changes youd like to but in this particular campaign youve chosen not to take that approach i say this as someone who is sympathetic to an outsiders point of view which you have made every attempt to engender
from those stats its obviously xenuria thanks for the confidence but denmark doesnt allow writein candidateswould be hellasweet if alphea got elected though im sure shed raise all kinds of hell in parliament

oh wellthanks for voting guysat least we kept the good ones from csm 9
closing statementit has been quite an experiencequite some day ago i said that win or lose i wont be running again next yearthe whole process reinforced my belief that csm is a farce where mostly only a few people from large alliance win seats few token ones from other parts of eve notice how much of goons slate won seats for examplethe way ccp fozzie logic is going ahead with low sec 20 and ignoring player and csm feedback further fortifies my beliefs that csm is a pr puppet that looks good when they dance to the right tune i am glad that i will not share in the blame for such boneheaded design changesto future candidates remember that marlona sky biomassed over the process of running for csmfortunately good ones from csm 9 were reelectedif people voted for me over some others who i am glad lost the election then i have done my part for eve
not that i disagree but posting this just hours after you lost just makes you look like a butthurt whiner intended or not its distinctly lacking in classdont turn into a xenuria just when you have the chance to show you can handle a loss with grace act like an adult today and go back on the attack tomorrowmr epeen
wheeeothanks to everyone who voted for me
im very happy with this slate do us proud steve and update your sig

keep up the good work
which are mostly him trolling replies and saying why he wont answer a question heh so that would be accurate

gratz dont ever give up the good fightmr epeen
we have the worst csm to date and of course one of the people responsible for it mike got elected againwhen is the next mikesanctioned hisec nerf i believe it was april the time null ores are redone which will probably devalue hisec ores below the ground againanything to say in your defense
despite having 2 gewns and 1 codegewn the community have managed to protect itself from the truly worst candidatesspeaking on behalf of all the people who have read you candidacy nonsense i wish to express the following thought get rekt son
calm down minersabriz  bad luck maybe next time
maybe next year i still have faith
well done cagali cagali for being elected for csm x
and you and manfred are the permanent attendees sweet do us proud sugar
i would love nothing move then to see lots of small alliances all over the place again especially in the east like it used to be a long time ago there is planty of room in the east and north east for small alliances to grow given that it is essentially worthless space once renting is part of eveonline history at least in its current form but the main problem i have with the new sov system is that there are to many penalties for owning space for essentially no reward regions like scalding pass wicked creek and insmother will still be worthless due to poor truesec and poor moon density with no way to ever improve your space to not be  or be worth figthing for and losing ships for other then a worthless flag on a spaceship game map
those are very valid concerns and i really hope ccp is considering them in some ways i think renting space will be easier as the parent alliance can own sov in the system own the stations but allow the renters to set up their own infrastructure hubs certain areas will probably need to be rebalanced as you said with endie and the others who made the csm im sure these concerns will be addressed and lately ccp has be handling feedback really well imo
thank you for your supportheres to a successful year on csmx
grats manny
ty everyone for believing humbled beyond words  manny
well now that ccp has said pos can be placed anywhere just not next to each other these ships would get more use i agree the small should be immune to warp disruption bubbles like interceptors let the small one specialize in mobility deployables and siphon units the large ship would be for pos but what would make it better then a covop transport anchoringunanchoring bonuses andor onlining bonus
hi there and congrats to all elected members of csm 2015this topic is a request to put hi csm 2015 agenda the translation of eve online client to spanish this is a well talked about subject that has a lot of potential for new players in the eve universe and a topic that needs to be advancedthank you in advancehola y felicidades a todos los miembros electos de csm 2015la presente es una solicitud de incluir en sus agendas el tema del cliente en espaUFFFDol esto es un tema que ha sido debatido mucho lo penoso es que el potencial del crecimiento del juego de nuevos jugadores de habla hispana es inmenso y cada dia se esta perdiendo valioso tiempothank you in advancereference
its a slightly larger issue than just the translation of the client though thats far from inconsequentialit also requires support staff which is probably the bigger costill bring it up with them but i wouldnt expect fast motion on it just trying to manage expectations rather than quash them
i like the new eagle please explain why your opinion is more valid than mine
all i want is just to add another eagles model into aurumshop
o csm x memberscongratulations on those that made it into csm x a new frontier for 7 new members sort dragon was csm 8its nice to see so many incumbents return including some very hard workers eg sugar kyle steve ronuken we recently saw a graph from fanfest that showed the use of the nestor battleship in pvp damagesure you can get 14k dps out of it with a 110k ehp tank but at a price of about 63 billion isksource
i am new and did not find the game too hard because i asked 200 million questions in the help channel and grouped with some good people i think the learning curve is okay just from the tutorial and in game help is very effective the player base is both the best and worst i have ever seen in humanity in a game some things i dont like but newbie help is not one of them the players have been so generous to me without me even asking i am really in love with the play base in general there are some things i specifically do and do not likei like1 pvpers with a sense of fair play and who test my limits without a fleet all i can do is run right now but it is alot of fun evading these guys skirmishes in my empire space is fun too2 the help channels nothing like this exists in either wow or ffxiv the two mmos i play off and on i have asked a billion questions in rookie help and help and about 90 of the time i am assisted quickly and accurately amazing this made me subscribe3 the roleplaying community its just plain fun everyone has such a great character and i cant believe how on point everyone is in intergalactic summit characters are deep funny and entertaining and best of all lots of diversity4 faction warfare vets  they are clearly very invested in the game but ive been invited into a few fleets even though i am complete newbie and not in their corp you can tell it is a whole game unto itself that you can get lost in5 mini games pi mining rp exploration  theres so much to do if i am writing my book i can just mine on the side or do pi or if i need an adrenaline rush i can quickly find pvp a few jumps away with factional warfare6 missions they are fun and entertaining and ive found way more exciting if you do them in null sec i am now officially addicted to serpentis and militia missions into enemy territory7 the spaceships galore i drool over them even the rookie ships are gorgeousi do not like1 the attitude of some players who just want to ruin the fun of others ie people who hate miners for no in character reason people who are just plain racist or hateful bags of cat poop people in the game and on the forums especially like to make fun of people with aspergers jews suicidal people  victims people who have any kind of emotion at all and lets not forget the ever present homophobia sponsored by repressed homosexuals in denial posts sit up for 35 years with complete garbage like this in them i have never seen this level of teenage angst in one game forum 2 bad weird suspicious nepotism stuff in eve should stay in eve the whole idea of ccp being in bed with a player corp is a little too creepy for me it reminds me of oh two games i used to play that were totally ruined by coke snorting gms getting cozy with players who were promoted for no reason other than sleeping with the people in control you should never make decisions which affect both an entire game world which is also your job based on your genitals or access to coca to be fair i see that a major restructuring went down recently and even though their is an atrocious past record seems like ccp knows this is a bad thing for business but then again i wouldnt be surprised tomorrow to learn that isis is secretly using eve to plan attacks thats how bad this whole thing looks to a totally newbie like me im not saying thats how it is its just how it looks in the news and player opinions  ive been through hundreds of posts outlining legitimate concerns that are poopood in the typical kneejerk seasoned troll player pattern it looks desperate and it looks like nepotism to me i did come across thisif you suspect any ccp employees of favoritism you should report the incident to ccps internal affairs team via internalaffairsccpgamescomas a result of last years company reorganization internal affairs is part of the security team lead by darius johnson aka ccp sreegs which will ensure that your complaints are investigated in a most neutral  objective mannernow i am not saying i feel targeted by it or that it will ever be a concern for me but it does stink like fish
welcome to eve with the attitude youre displaying youll probably be here a long time about the two things you mentioned you didnt like1 in a sandbox game such as eve online there will inevitably be instances of when my idea of fun is viewed by someone as ruining their idea of fun the opposite is also true this is the nature of a game where you can do pretty much anything you want2 any time you get a group of humans together there will always be hatred and bigotry this is human nature no matter how badly the feel good pc crowd wants you to believe ccp has determined that such behavior is not allowed in public channels so take a screenshot of it when it happens and report it3 look up the history of an alliance called band of brothers aka bob and youll understand why we have that paranoia about devs getting involved with player groups
i too find the economy pretty stagnant i posted an idea on these forums a little while ago
i am pleased please note the following from the first page and it is said in the post above your onenote the time stamps of this post that are before the election resultsi was leaving a message for next years hopeful candidates that message is in my experience do not bother
youre surprised that groups vote for their own members that large numbers help those people win  and you think this represents a problem
no i said they would from the outset tribilism behaviourzuma was up on violent sexual assault charges arms dealing and collaboration before he was elected he simply became president due to being a zulu they are 60 of the population and their closely related tribe the xhosa vote for the zulu representative if they do not have one themselvesi still advocate that ccp inform their player base better of what csm is there was a brief thing on the launcher with the shuttles and then it was gone the average players used up much of my time explaining that there is a csm and what it isonce again most of the csm represent a minority good going ccp link back to closing statement
good luck try get a large alliance behind you it is the short cut to a seat
better luck next year tora ill be having words with my alts if they didnt vote for you
i have removed a rule breaking post
be interesting to see how many of the people posting earlier in the thread and elsewhere praising corbexx for his csm9 service his experience his work ethic and his game knowledge will now shriek in outrage because he wears the wrong alliance tag
did you vote i am in waaaay too good a mood to take offence at your tone your entitlement your errors so tightly pakced in such a small packagethey could make minerals twice as common and easy to get in null unless they have folks there willing to mine them it will make no difference but dont let my opinion sway you tell me more about how i manage to be the one driving the bus taking hisec down the ever so well paved road to hellmdid i mention i was in a good moodmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD

i can only visualise him as a kid
there was a mining report in dev blogs recently which drew a clear picture some null regions scored a lot more than certain not depopulated hisec ones i still remembered how odyssey plummeted mining into the ground and it doesnt take a genius to tell what any ore rebalance favoring null will do to hisec which has already lost any industrial competition with null and is nothing more than a raw resource provider for it at the momentyou were in the csm then you are in the csm now you okd it you devalued it and now 5 buffs later when 80 of resource providing capacity has been recovered time to kick the dying dog thanks mike
i didnt expect to be elected but was always serious about the campaign this was the result i expected from day 1 if not the result i hoped forif time permits i will recontest next year and hopefully i will be under less rl stress than i have been the past eight months if i dont contest i will definitely have  and share  opinions on where eve should go and opinions on who should make csmtwo final things that i hope the elected reps take on 1 in a competitive game environment with the degree of market pvp of eve creating wealth for one subset of players reduces the competitiveness of everyone elsethis applies both to blatant cheating eg t20 at the extreme bot mining or bot ratting at a less extreme example but also to game balance changes to take a hypothetical extreme case if c3 wormhole sites were buffed to the point that they made you 800 million isk per pilot per hour this would have a devastating impact on the rest of the gamehighsec incursions arent at that extreme but they need correction null ratting and highsec l4s need looking at too2 be aware that anything posed as a quality of life change always hides a balance change behind it the changes in phoebe that allowed invention jobs to be multiqueued were pitched as a quality of life change yet i would argue they were the biggest balance change in tech 2 production all yearassess every proposed change  even the most mundane  for its impact on game balance be honest as to what you think that impact will be  then make an informed decision sometimes that will be yes this is good for both qol and game balancesometimes this is good for qol but so bad for game balance that it should be stoppedsometimes this is good for qol bad for game balance but the good outweighs the badseldom will it be this is good for qol but has no game balance impacts that i can forsee if you think it is the latter double and triple check and ask does this affect game balance but in a way that improves my position in game so i am ignoring it
code has forgotten about us miners to be a goon pet for like half a year now 1 bawwwww my easymode pvf player vs freighter gameplay generates no isk please nerf isk generation so all the free stuff we get with my easymode pvf player vs freighter gameplay is worth more2 if the main barrier in said activity was based on amount of clicks you have to make and alarm clocks you have to set when it gets fixed with a qol change and it revolutionizes it then either the change is a great boon or the design was bad in the first place i wonder if people like you wouldve argued against 24 hours skill queue thingy back when it was introduced because it makes being online less rewarding and thus bad for balance screw balance your socalled stance was for conflict and balance is the opposite of that so why so much bother about balance you are a hypocrite in everything except being almost openstanced nerf everyone but me candidate among your gewn masters you put out the word conflict and your final word is crying for balance you put out the word roleplay and the only roleplay you do is masterslave relationship with gewns i am not satisfied with csm election results but at the same time extremely proud to be a part of the community which culls candidates like you and tora
no point responding to a troll but hey ill be indulgenti actually thought you were a mike azariah supporter without his skills in smooth talking and diplomacy until i saw you posted largely the opposite viewpoint in his thread but with the same degree of hostilitybalance is the opposite of conflict ive heard it all now and you should ask people that actually build things what they think of the phoebe changes steve ronuken believes theres issues with them in hindsight its not just me
would everyone now please rise for the national anthem of neckbeardiao7
that didnt make sense tipsy and i know it wont make sense sober not intending to get drunk tonight so a reply might be a while offi am not a goon and i make no secret that i often build things to sell to their rivals in wars im neutral with respect to sov null conflicts however even i think that goonswarm federation deserves an apology for the accusation of being affiliated with mike azariah
it is no secret that the code of code openly states being the pets of gewnsyou are in the code you have the link to the code of code in your sig what elsebeing a gewn hisec pet is not about null sov of course its doing what master orders code is trying hard at that and that includes youmike is not in affiliation he just has been considered harmless and allowed to not be culled for being spineless teethless nobody of a csm

grats mateenjoy your unpaid job
its strange that ccp maintains support for japanese but not spanish not only is spanish a far more common language gaming culture among spanish speaking population is in line with western gaming while majority of japanese gamers tend to be much less receptive to western genres
thx for the quick reply steve ronukenthe potential of new player growth in the spanish speaking countries is big and a much needed fresh air of culture diversity spanish is the 2nd most spoken native language in the world more so than english and it does not make sense that japanese the 9th gets to have a client especially at a 4 to 1 population ratioref
as a fan of the soe ships my problem with the nestor is that it simply doesnt feel like it fits into what the astero and stratios are supposed to be its loaded with seemingly random bonuses including ones that just dont make sense on a battleship im sorry but youre not hacking cans in a nestor except as ridiculous baitid like to see the nestor aligned to a specific purpose still loosely tied to the things the other soe ships lean on exploration cloaky shenanigans drones and lasers agility and flexibility perhaps if you looked at it this way the astero is a ship thats made for noncombat exporationthe stratios is a ship thats made for combat and noncombat explorationthe nestor is a ship thats made for  
support of the other two in larger fleets
the nestor currently has these bonusesgallente battleship bonuses per skill level10 bonus to drone hitpoints and damageamarr battleship bonuses per skill level4 bonus to all armor resistancesrole bonus50 bonus to large energy turret optimal range50 bonus to core and combat scanner probe strength10 bonus to relic and data analyzer virus strength50 bonus to remote armor repairer amount200 bonus to remote armor repairer rangei would love to see soe a little bit more tied into the serpentis because of the lore backgroundsantimona sarpati is the reverend mother1 and ceo of the sisters of evesisters of eve santimona is the sibling of salvador sarpati the current leader and ceo of the serpentis corporation once a close friend and ally of silphy en diabel santimona has now turned her back on her and mockingly calls her queen silphy of the syndicatesource
in a combat role the astero and stratios are great in fleet or solo they are very strong ships the nestor has a unique roles within the battleship class and that makes it a good ship it does what it does well but its expensive atm and that makes it a little too risky to fly exclusively as a damage platform the nestor has other benefits to a fleet which dont involve damage and for me thats where it excels and fits within the lore of soe perfectly for me the soe ships are all awesome in their own way its just the pirate faction battleships tend to be more focused than their smaller counterparts for me at least the nestor is more of a logistics ship than anything else
when you stand on a platform you standwhen you change what you stood upon you should fallcorbexx you stood as independent of the blocksalliances apparently you never intended to be independenti voted for you on this basis and i am sure that many others also did sobad karma you begin your term as someone who cannot be held to his word whatever you do this csm term your motivations will be questioned and rightly soa very bad start to the new csm
years ago before i took a four year hiatus from eve online all one had to do to activate a kill right was find their target and destroy their ship just a few days after returning to the game i was suicide ganked as a came through a gate in high sec granting me kill rights against the character who killed me unaware of the new kill right mechanics i proceeded to fit up a t1 frigate knowing that my target was long range fitted and get some sweet revenge i did not get said revenge i was destroyed by concord because i was unfamiliar with the present day game mechanic i am suggesting a tutorial for activating kill rights be added to the game as to prevent other new or returning players from falling victim to the same confusion that befell myself
regarding politeness  manners i think the rule of thumb is that if you arrive inbelt and a miners is already there you move to the next or another belt insystem and not the incumbent not doing so tends to rub miners up the wrong way and results in conflict i think the changes to isboxer type software have resulted in some multiminer players either leaving the game downsizing or choosing another career option within new eden nevertheless the use of ten mining vessels to clear belts in very short timespans in high sec is not a myth and can be very annoying for other miners i agree that miners are not afk continually as this isnt possible due to game mechanics but it is possible to be afk for periods of time  theyre gonna feel pretty stupid when they find out  rick  find out what   abraham  theyre screwing with the wrong people  rick season four  the walking dead  
i will have to read your mining changes concept again i thought you suggested keeping the current basic target lock and fire laser mechanic but ditch the asteroid belts in favour of new mining missions from agents at npc stations im jumping the gun here as the main structures talk at fanfest isnt on until 1pm but the keynote teasers suggested structures that would be able to mine asteroid belts if this happens then your concept wouldnt be able to be implemented which is unfortunate  theyre gonna feel pretty stupid when they find out  rick  find out what   abraham  theyre screwing with the wrong people  rick season four  the walking dead  
the mining missions thing was as an alternate method to find asteroids not as a this is the only way to get them convenient for beginners and people who dont want to get into finding roids of their own and people in npc corps who couldnt stake a claimthe mining platform thing is an interesting one too having some large asteroids which you cant otherwise mine but the structure can crack them open and release a horde of necromorphs to eat everyone i mean spawn asteroids you can mine
my alts voted alright so no arguments therebetter luck next time tora cya aroundo7

i guess this is the point where im supposed to congratulate corbexx on his masterful switching of sides immediately after the csm election i just hope he stays as a full time wormhole resident for his tenure as csm if he does not i think much of the community will feel betrayedfounder of violet squadron a small gang npsi community mail me for more information

lol how many plex
is a good idea and the return of the spanis chat room
i actually love the mechanic although blops does need some lovin 1
as a former provi resident im glad i missed this thread seriously guys cut the whining learn from yulaivolt and get your  together and form home defence groups the blops nerfs gave you guys some much needed breathing space and provi has one of the best intel networks in the game dont tell me you cant adapt try living without local and random connections in your home and youll know what a godsend a jump bridge once every hour or so would beas for blops i think theyre reaosnably balanced now but would be pretty disappointed if they get further nerfedface the enemy as a solid wall for faith is your armor and through it the enemy will find no breach wrap your arms around the enemy for faith is your fire and with it burn away his evil
i had interesting discussion at fanfest about eve jukebox here is short version of it with simple playlist it would be fairly easy to make no mp3 players no fancy pancy features simple playlist this would require csm to suggest simple playlist for evei think it is horrible waste of good music that there is no interface to control music in eve now you have chance to make a difference bring back our ear candy
a couple of ideas for alternate bonusesto better support the others maybe a direction scanner disabler works into the new gameplay mechanics for combat bcs and the wip sov structures coming out maybe an aoe version to shield allies or structures from direction scans still can be found with probes but you have to be looking for it possible new probe type that surrounds an area even gatespos and stations the probes detect warp trajectories but not distance or speed and create 23 bookmarks that give you a straight line that can be shared to other ppl gives you intel so you can scan ppl out who are in areas not seen by direction scanners really useful if the new game mechanics let you place stuff anywhere whos gonna think to look 5au out from every orbital body if you dont have intel like this still can be worked around warp from station to planet 1 then to pos on moon 6 of said planet then a few safespots then to hidden pos change safe spots every so often and your goodyour working on a new map is there a new solar map coming up could we get real time scanning info on said map with movement maybe only so many larger fleet ships or structures have said realtime linked sensor webs maybe the nestor is the only subcap to get said abilitylastly i dont think the nestor should have covops cause then its just a gimped blackops a pirate faction blop would be too op on the lvl of a tourny prize ship

so election is over its time for evaluation of what went well and what went badlywill we see any evaluation from xenuria or will we see another candidacy for csm 11 with the same unappealing and in many ways dishonest fantasybased and offputting platform and the same predictable election resultoh and if anyone knows where to get the numbers how many voted for xenuria as their first choice i need something to set as a personal minimum since the actual minimum of local votes includes party votes and votes for other candidates cmon xenuria you have tried to play the strongmancard here the allknowing superior electioncampaignmachine with an infallible platform that doesnt allow for further questions lets see how you hold up against someone who does this for both study and livingokay living needs more quotationmarks its pretty hyperbolic since its only an expensespaidfor kind of deallets shake hands on this bet i raise you 1 isk your spacehonour and that you have to answer all questions in your candidacy thread next time you run and that answer cannot be in the check opplatform post or i refuse to answer because of reasons  but copypaste of earlier answers to same types of questions is finewhat will you demand of me mention in my speeches naked twitchstreaming saluting fat bee okay not that last one i do have standardslets do it politicians honouractual goals will be set on sane conditions not internet bets

all the plexjust contract them to me and i shall pass them on
if you do not want to pvp consider grafting yourself onto the multitude of corps who specialize in protecting pvers ie aegis protects industrialists for a cost you must give up some autonomy but this is like irl find a great corp to protect you and offer them your non pvp services it is true it will be indirect pvp but it is a pvp game and this is not even hardcore pvp that is found in fpsi never get bothered in 10 space you can stay there if you want to or learn to use warp core stabs and cloaking always report offensive behavior that goes outside of the tosi am new to the game and i keep finding myself wondering at how nice everyone is even a lot of the people that kill my character there are some nasty stupid people but i will get my revenge on them eventually
ive been playing since 05 and have noticed a massive change in the game when marketing hit the us as im also a us playerfinding ways to make money off of others with as little effort as possible have become massive between numerous scams and ganking anything you can gank

it was always a pvp game if you didnt get the memo in 2004 you will not likely get it now to compete is pvp
how about setting drifters name by the name of capsuleer who killed by drifter npci watching new eve trailer emergent threatsin this movie the drifter had made by death capsuleerit will be nice experience to user
leaving aside the questionbegging in that comparison eve is a sandbox video game where the whole point is to advance yourself and your space tribe and do battle with others in various fashions tribalism is really not a problem in this context
csm 11 official platformapithe api needs work especially in terms of what the player has access too many of the changes i propose are under the category UFFFDquality of lifeUFFFD eve is about the player sculpting their experience and that of others by means of information and stimuli modern day corporations use massive databanks of common search terms and phrases to gauge the interests and desires of their target markets eve should be no different changesthe api should include optionally more information about a playercorpalliance information like losses to npcs kills in a given area over a given time span how many times a playercorpalliance has changed a standing given a time period etc the more data that ccp can reasonably and fairly provide players through the api without being unbalanced the better uithe current ui is a marvel of innovation due in no small part to the diligence of people like ccp karkur and other members of ccp who are constantly trying to find a UFFFDbetter wayUFFFD the ui has come a very long way since the early days of eve letUFFFDs see if it can come farther changesthe corp ui needs attention itUFFFDs a train wreck of dividers and columns that presents in an unintuitive and often confusing way it needs a full work over the results of which players should be allowed to optionally opt in and out of at will the people and places window could benefit from more filtration options like UFFFDmost conversations withUFFFD or UFFFDmost often onlineUFFFD little changes like this make the social aspects of eve easier to managevanity  egoccp has already expressed an intent to bring ships skins and other vanity items to eve that are representative of different factions and entities why should a player with 90 standing with interbus pay the same amount for an interbus skin or vanity item as a player with 90 standing they shouldnUFFFDt my changes would rework the way standings affect gameplay specific in the context of vanity items and ship variations changesa player with perfect standing with a faction 100 should never have to pay for the use of a skin or vanity item of that faction if a player has terrible standing with a faction and wants to purchase a skin or vanity item for that faction this low standing should negatively impact the affordability andor practicality of buying that skin from the vendor a corp or alliance with a desire to put itUFFFDs logo on a ship should have no cost associated with doing so if the corpalliance standing with the faction of that ship is high enough more tba

easily your least terrible op yet good to see youre taking feedback on board i guess
just quoting for future reference specifically to do with already announced changes id expect someone on the csm to keep up with the changes for the game its kinda important
the election is over and more than half of the new csm is cfc i tried to warn you all i told you this would happen
do you also predict it will be hot in florida in july
so two things here both makes you seem illinformedfirst youre complaining that the representatives are by and large representative of the voting population how can this surprise you would it surprise you if i told you that barack obama achieved a majority of the popular vote in the last election no then why are you complaining when the reverse would obviously be worsesecond youre wrong endie sion and thoric are cfc and apparently corbexx will go that way as well giving you at best 414 cfc members not only cant you understand the stv system specifically or democracy in general but apparently basic math is too much for youdamn youre too easykiryen obannon also has a good point i had actually expected it to be 4 out of the box and then perhaps one or two with shifting allegiances and most of all i had expected one if not both of the permanent attendees to be cfc id like to get the numbers to crunch this result would be consistent with a divided ballot so its interesting to see to how large or small a degree the cfc ballot was followed to the letter
all of your assumptions are assuming youre dealing with 200 men with carriers if that is such the case im in terrible feels for who the hell you pissed off taking your logic hand in hand just drop in 200 titians now what is your issue  1 dd is 1 carrier gone no hope or savoir carriers just look scary they are but 200 dreads can put a dent against them easily your subcaps are just that subpar i dont want a bs killing my carrier your bs is for supporting your capital fleet getting rid of the things that we dont really care about so we can support our capital fleet against other capitals plus if you have a jammer you can jam a carrier der der der no more reps from that guy carriers can also be neuted out trust me that hurts the cap chain seriously i honestly hate people who want changes when theyre not willing to step away from a problem and look at it and solve it via in game mechanics troll now how to really win against logi  bring in your jams boy they want jam for their toast they also like being neuted out very effective if you pvp any youre likely carrying a neut if not refit it and then go back or replan your fleet so youre covered or just warp away in general
the bhaalgorns are coming the bhaalgorn are coming
quotealien machine taking your logic hand in hand just drop in 200 titians now what is your issue  1 dd is 1 carrier gone no hope or savoir carriers just look scary they are but 200 dreads can put a dent against them easilyquotethe whole eve is not about i need bigger ship to counter your big ships btw dread blob against carrier blob dont work how many coalitions can deploy 200 titanscarriers remote rep them self dreads cannot have any remote aid neuting carrier fleet so i drop 200 neuting armagedons against 200 carriers  1 per carrier my armagedons cannot cap them self  and will run out of cap pretty soon carriers will be using gardes to kill neuting ships while those armageddons will not do any real harm to carriers in terms of dps  so i need other dps ships wait  local is already at 400 and i still not have dps fleet deployedno this will not work this way either issue is that even reinforced nodes are unable to compute amount of ships needed to kill slowcat fleet
i know a lot of people that are interested in playing eve online but dont know english so there is a lot of potencial is not that hard isnt it
please dont remove jump fatigue it will make me regret selling my cap alt
i pulled a p sick burnout in some of the new ships one could say they were almost ill
im extremely cautious about voting for anyone who appears to have an agenda for the csm every player i know has ideas about eve all the time but if i was running for csm id be keeping my ideas to the fi board where they belong i suppose you could say corbexx had an agenda during csm9 to get some of the wormholes buffed but he obviously put the work into getting enough evidence to prove his thinking was along the right lines given you have over a year before csm11 id consider getting the evidence to prove your ideas are valuable otherwise you will just get put on the ideas candidate ignore list with the dozens of other ideas candidates who dont get voted in
quit trolling with loaded questionsim sorry isd i had tomore on topic opxenuria these ideas are relatively vague pitching an idea and letting ccp work out the details is nice and all but at least put links to corresponding fi threads where you elaborate more specifically on where your stated goal for these changes would be and whyaswell as justification for some of the proposals for instance why should skins ccp charge money for be cheaper for people who grind away in highsec getting standings through missions than for people who arguably supply more content in lownull by focusing on player interaction on that note what justification do you propose to anyone getting a discount on cashshop items especially ones that can be resold on the market as this opens to market exploitation and shutting out people based solely on where in the game they play this is incredibly bad for any game mechanic that relies on real life cash
well the race has been run and i didnt come in the final placings its a shame but im not going to hide under my duvet and be sad about it i just wanted to say a sincere thank you to everyone who supported me on my csm campaign with encouragement and endorsements and of course to everyone who voted for me regardless of where i was on your ballotsi also want to congratulate the members of csm x  both returning and new  and wish them all the best for the year aheadi wont rule out another tilt next year but for now im just going to concentrate on my other spinning platescheerseve down under  a community for players in the autz
mais qui est donc borat guereen  le mystUFFFDre reste complet
i fully support this proposal not only the spanish speaking community is much bigger than many others that actually get support on their own language but the player base for spanish speaking ppl from many parts of the world is increasing for the past 3 years
here you go
i can see how that could be really cool but i think it wouldnt add enough of an extra for the work that has to go into such a feature also how did you envision this feature to be implemented what restrictions would you pose whos names would be used and if so how many times would they randomly spawn or limited depending on how many times a certain capsuleer was killed or must the capsuleer be killed by a drifter or should it only be available after a corpse was actually picked up by a drifter
he has already stated that his alts are to remain in wormhole corporations also a condi tag in no way prevents a player from engaging in wormhole gameplay or conversing with those who dowould be an amusing piece of hypocrisy for some of the more rabid critics to follow through with their threat of purging those alts from wormspace and then saying see he doesnt have any wormhole characters left what a terrible wormhole representative
yeah im a little surprised at the uproar over this seems to be a lot of grr goons mixed in either way corbexx knows wormholes and got elected for such joining goons doesnt affect thatfounder of violet squadron a small gang npsi community mail me for more information
man this thread i needed a good laugh
did not read all the replies but op you are wrongstarted in 2004 took one break of a year had a kideve has always been a pvp game always i remember dealign with can flippers and bumpers even back in 04 suicide ganking was less becuase there was less money in play in 04 so losing a 100m isk bs to kill a mining crusier was not that smart also the mining ships in that day were just pvp ships fitted with mining lazersmechanics changed that made some of the tactics easier to explot more money in play means its cheaper to sucide and you cna get your stuff replaced fastereve has always been this way so if you did not think it was then you need a new gamedareaperminer by profession alliance and corp leader by hobby
groups like goonswarm helped making scamming and other tactics more viabale and seem to be do able no not a grr goon just stating a fact as more players came into eve more people decided to play the  but its always been this way
not sure if this is the right place to post but could a csm please ask ccp about the possibility of making fanfest fully plexablei dont have a large amount of disposable income and would love to attend a fanfestbut at the moment while i could cover the fanfest ticket i would not be able to pay for the hotel  airfairis it possible to use the partner airline and hotel and pay with plex even at an increased pricefor example 1 plex  UFFFD14ish when buying 28when used for a partner service redeem each plex as being UFFFD8so if flights were UFFFD600  hotel is UFFFD500 for 5 nights then make it cost 138 plexfor each plex used this way ccp still make UFFFD6 so for every 1 person attending this manner that would beUFFFD1100 for partnersUFFFD828 for ccpand that is if plex was bought in bulk assuming it was from many single plexes ccp would make an additional UFFFD276a person would still need to pay for fooddrinks etc for the duration but the bulk of the financial burden is lifted
i have a request that we change the input method of the extraction area size from the slider bar option to a manual number input obvious reasons it is simpler to pinpoint that 24hr period vs a slider that cant ever hit it directlythank youcoz

on your vanity and ego sectionmy question is  why should standings matter if im purchasing aur with real world cash to get this item if i was purchasing this with isk then standing should matter
i like how out of 3 issues you want to pitch 2 are utterly uncontroversial and just test it for relevancy with the reversal who would pitch a worse api or ui one might be out of the ordinary but is such a small issue its irrelevant and all three are things that csm can hardly change adding to this it seems like three insignificant issues insofar that you can find a plethora of csm candidates who will promote these and a hoard of other issues if you really do want to vote for an issues candidatebut this is not all this is something like your 5th failed candidacy and the last onestill had questions unansweredquestions central to your then ohsoimportant platform of csm reform which you first tried to write off as removal of voting then rejected that it should be ccp appointed leaving it an open question what should happen where you identified a few issues i quote here the issues and restate the questions i had to them and the rest of your platformso have you learnt something from the failed candidacyis the subject of csm reform as important to you as it were in the csm 10 campaign1 for this compared to earlier campaigns this is merely misunderstanding and bland not insane and offputting hooray for progressmakes it all the easier to ask loaded questions its a gate so wide you can load anything into those terms somewhat like occupancy sov they can catch em all
by not giving some benefit to people with good standings you devalue the effort they have already put in
but why should ingame effort have an effect on peoples ability to spend real life cash into the gameshould we also give subscription discounts to people who pvp alot since they are playing it right and giving contentno because that would be unfairif these were isk based items it would be a nonarguement but they arent they are cash itemsso why if i am in nullsec pvping all day and johnny mcnotbot is farming lvl 4 caldari missions all day and doing nothing else should he only spend 7 usd on ship skins while im forced to pay say 10 usdimbalances should never exist in real cash exchanges for video games because wht your proposing is the isk market for these items should be solely dominated in supply by people who only grind pve due to the fact theyll have a magnitude more cash efficiency in purchasing these items due to an arbitrary ingame mechanic giving their out of game cash more value than my out of game cashin short no its a terrible ideaon that note start up these ideas in fi so we can discuss them there picking apart your proposals in this thread and theyre details is detracting from the discussion of your candidacylook at your ideas expand on them and write a detailed proposition for how and why they wouldshould work with realistic placeholder values for numbers based on where you think it should work and then link them here so we can discuss the ideas there with detail and focus on your candidacy here
2015 is the year of the sheep 2016 will be the year of the xenuria
mods close threads for redundancy all the time then new ones pop up because old one is closed then when that gets closed accusations of shutting down discussion flies aroundsimple solution  mods must link nonredundant thread when closing a thread for redundancy new threads stop popping up discussion ensues in one thread no more whackamole no more forum spam this is already the standard practice of most forums because it works not sure why eveo forum is differentor merge redundant thread into original thread while this may create threadnaughts chances are the original thread already are to begin with threadnaught is better than hundreds of locked threads spamming the forum preventing you from finding anything useful
but this could significantly reduce the number of threads killed by isd and why else would one want to be an isd youre asking turkeys to vote for an extra christmas here
except im not asking the turkey in fact its not up to the turkey
i dont see manual numbers being better unless you call doing calculations easier compared to sliding a bar and see what the timer is
its a hell of a lot easier to press 1 than it is to try and get the slider close enough to 1 day to allow you to use the   buttons to get to where you want to be1
or we could have both options available i like to just click and drag repeat have my other hand doing other things cant be arsed with typing on the keyboard no you sickos writing in a journal timeramount entries so i know how much of what pi and goo i have where
we can hotkey select all but not stack all whywhile i am at it i can hotkey return drones but cant launch group1 launch group 2 whyhelp me
never mind elections are over and it is all irrelevant to me
there are already a multitude of benefits for someone with good standings and putting a barrier between people and the payment method is an extremely poor business decision if someone wants to give ccp money then ccp should and will always allow itwhile i respect your right to run for csm year after year it might be best to take some time off from campaigning to reacquaint yourself with the game and the community whether it be your fault or external factors causing it you dont exactly have the best reputation in eve and it would serve you better to network with players and establish new friendships and partnerships before running again

disappointed you didnt get there for your community input although i have no idea whether or not i consider you a good or bad choice in regard to game balance decisionsmy 5 position didnt seem to get you there
on the down side you didnt win csm xon the upside you dont have to be csm x
i have seen people making whole new accounts to try and shake off a history associated with goons
and ive seen people deny that the holocaust happened whats your pointfounder of violet squadron a small gang npsi community mail me for more information
nobody here is talking about barriers i am saying that standings should make it easier not be the only way please read the op
and were saying ingame activitiesstats should never effect the cost of out of game purchaseswhat if people with the top 10 pvp kills every month received a 30 discount on plex it would be a bad idea
please try your best to stay on topic
that is on topic its a pretty logical evolution youre asking for an in game mechanic that has nothing to do with anything out of game to give discounts and effectively screwing all of nullsec and all those who dont want to grind standings
with the proliferation of structures that ccp has announced along with the rebalancing of current structures i think this will become even more useful as time goes on the more structures there are the more handy it is to have a ship dedicated to dealing with them at least the smallmedium structures
you have enough free timeaccounts to make 138 extra plex but not to pay for the trip i think something is amiss here
looking forward to hearing about the ceo who used his corps srp fund as a travel fund

please can we have a colorblind mode for those of us who have trouble with this maybe its not a priority but it would be helpful
where exactly is it causing troublei have protanomaly but to the best of my knowledge ive never had problems in eve or any other game
hello csm  to whom it may concernthis video from fanfest popped up today
if you dont like it dont participate in that aspect of gameplay you still have agency to exercise freedom of choice
1 the election seems to be representative of those who voted2 xenuria  with all respect no matter how good correct or righteous your platform is or is not people wont elect someone they dont like or identify with a study of democratic politics shows this you need to either reinvent yourself to the current voting population who apparently dont agree with your position change your position and approach since it seems to turn people off mobilize the nonvoting masss behind your disenfranchised revolution or start planning xenuria csm 11 12 13 etc campaign
i have deuteranomaly accidentally pasted the different kinds in the text box and clicked post anywayi have some trouble with wardec targets and corp mates were it not for the flashing indicator on wardec targets i would never know the difference also my blue and purple is badand the red and orange and yellow we all know what yellow boxing is right to me it is orange boxing you havent had any problems then you are very luckyi on the other hand have had many problems interesting factmany games have a colorblind mode i did not post this here so that my colorblindness could be compared to somebody elses another interesting facttechnically we are not colorblindwe are color deficient its a disease i wouldnt waste my time posting a thread if i didnt have an issue everybodys experience in eve is different
couldnt you change the color settings of the screen via the driver settings or the screen itself and it would be fixed for all programs i am not color blind myself so i dont know if this would work
