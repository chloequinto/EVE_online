not a single isboxer was able till now to show he can do things like incursions of highsec ganks the same way without isboxer why nobody shows how to multibox an incursion with 10 chars  or why is an 10 men isboxer gatecamp an instant dead situation and you really want arguments why isboxer is a third party tool against the eula  nobody ever showed how to do the same things without isboxer and no there is not a single hardware solution to do nearly the same thing
it makes isboxer not more legit to tell that there are more tools to do the sameand nice computer array well know as example but still bullshit tell me how he controls his logis in an incursion fleet via the same mouse and keyboard  yes yes there will be also other tools that give the possibility to create a complete other screen with seperated buttons from different screens and so on but still this is an advantage a player or a alttab multi boxer didnt have the main advanatge is the new screen to be honest from a technical point of view this is far away from just clone mouse and key commands
i run multiple machines because im an old school multiboxer from the old ffa pvp mmo days even with isboxer i use multiple machines and screens i only use the repeater function for my dps and the rest are separate i dont use videofx or any of the fancy aspects other then the frame limiter and the cpu assignment so even without isboxer id still be running vanguards and ganking people with my fleetedit  be aware that part of your complaint about isboxer also applies to wine and other virtual environmentsedit 2  youre solution would add massive overhead to the server im pretty sure part of the reason that ogb still exists is because of the hit to server performance that checks would require what youre asking for is every single persons commands to be logged crosschecked and tracked while comparing to past commands thats insanity
complaint dude you are not able to explain how you will manage it without tools or hardware like isboxer tell us how you manage 10 accounts in a vanguard site  shut down all the tools and repeater you use open 10 clients on the same computer and explain how you manage them in a vanguard site at the same time
isboxer doesnt give you items cyrrency objects character attributes rank or status at an accelerated pace multiboxing software is also allowed by ccpi see no reason why to ban it and i still havent seen a legitimate argument why boxing software should be banned remember in a game where ganking scamming and mental harm is allowed using the words morality or fair are not applicable
yes it does see screenshot
not really although you can debate if one action really is one action since you brought up hardware i went and looked up the policy on g15 keyboards and found that programming a key to turn all your hardeners on the example i found can involve inputting multiple keystrokes ccp might consider that one action but you wont get any argument from me if you state that is entering multiple commands with one keystroke since im conceding the point kind of i hope you dont mind if i dont supply the linkand youre correct about the ability of making isboxer or in reality inner space impossible to detect the man who invented inner space and isboxer wrote software isxwarden that hid botters from warden until blizzards lawyers convinced him to stop thats one of the reasons im wary of trying to ban the use of isboxer do we want team security to have to possibly fight that war and be diverted from the fight against rmt that type of detection arms race could get out of hand quickly depending on how willing isboxer users are to break the rules to use their software most would probably follow the rules but you know thered be a few that would try to keep going if ccp instituted a ban
you are mixing up player and character he is not getting anything any faster than anyone else with the same fleet wouldnthypotheticalplayer a mines in a field to make a plex it takes him 40 hours to get that amount of iskplayer b mines for a plex to keep his isboxing 40 account running how many hours does it takespoiler its not 1 hour
and now math for advanced playersplayer a has finished his 40 hours for his plex he does 4 hours a day so he has finished it after 10 days in the next 20 days he earns another 2 plex thats his yield per month after paying his plexplayer b has finished his 40 hours with his 40 characters for his plex he also does 4hours per day  10 days in the next 20 days he earns another 80 plexso you really want us to explain that 80 plex is equal 2 plex  and yes nobody is able to control a 40 character fleet without tools
no need to ban it just redesign pve mining included in such way that isboxer will be of no use like that some situation presented to different windows doing one mission or mininig at one spot would be significantly different and would require individual approach doing so randomizing all these activities adding more minigames and interactions with environment to it including simultaneously from several different clients participating in some action all presented with different tasks so its not solvable by simple multiplication of key strokes will definetely do wonders to the game will make its pve activities more challenging intresting diverse and will make simple multiplication of key stroking events useless it also could stimulate players to more collaboration and enchance social ties within communitybut hey that means that a lot of work have to be done and in the end this will lead to ccps incomes dropping as multiboxers cut their numbers of simultaneously used accounts from 1030 to 23 thats why it probably wont happen
and yet on a per character basis its exactly the same  2 plex per character per month after the initial 1 plex per character is earned to pay for the accountso the 40 man isboxer fleet is not earning that amount any faster than any other 40 man fleet which means based on a common sense reading of the eula about gathering at an accelerated rate it is not in contravention of the rules since the rates per character are exactly the same 3 total plex per month per characterthen why are you lot so focused on isboxer and not on every other method that allows for exactly the same thing i have yet to hear a single one of you call for banning people using hardware solutions
i love people keep taking about hardware solutionsshow me someone who has 40 mice glued together on 40 computers and ill show you a damned fool you simply cannot control 40 accounts solo without cheating
repeaters and identically configured uis have existed for ages hardware solution does not mean a bazillion of mice and keyboards
repeaters are software
i already told you i run multiple screenskeyboardsmice if you run drone doctrine its fairly easy once you get assist assigned yeah you cant run them as fast as you could with isboxer but you can still do iti dont feel like drawing out an electrical diagram for you but its quite possible to clone mouse and keyboard inputs for multiple machines you could also run multiple virtual machines on one machine and have the keymouse cloned to all of them and eve wouldnt even knowhes earning isk at the same rate per account as anyone else theres no acceleration involvedif youre going to call that cheating then any form of multiboxing is cheating also pi alts market alts etc are cheating all alts are cheatingrosewalker  i would much rather ccp spend their time on botters and hackers including repeaters and such would create a nightmare for ccp to enforceits like youve never heard of window mode or alt tabits very possible and quite easy to do its also extremely mind numbing
hi folksthis is an idea for when you are in your captains quarterswhen in cq and you private message someone their image should come up on the center monitor this way it is like having a chat via webcam without the bandwith issuesif you are in a group private chat all invitees images should be up then when someone posts up in that channel that persons image comes up to the frontthis should only work on private conversations to start with and maybe later to corp  alliance channels on a side monitor leave local out for the time beingthis will make the cq area a little more useable than it currently is without needing a lot of work done which would take away from the changes the devs are working for ingameit would also make a nice area for those dull corp meetings and alliance meetings 
this sounds like a good idea it would mean that there is a reason to wander around station
would not be a bad idea while i dont use cq that much it would add one more sensible level of immersion to the cq
wis was created to serve as a new socializing platform the place making game world more believable enhancing submergence to the imagenary universe and making some sense out of those fancy clothes and probably some other similar fancy stuff that could be added in the future the place different from mundane spaceships in space experience while still tied to the game world tightly  where you can change scenery and relax together with your friends while doing some meaningfull and fun stuff that is not spaceships without resorting to third party tools like other games seedy poker rooms of unknown origin etc the place where you can show up in your new unique expensive fancy dress but all these are worth nothing if there are no audience your unique and expensive fancy suite worth almost nothing if no one have opportunity to see it aside from rare occasion he clicked for some reason on your characters picture wis made a mistake trying to force players to attend this new space i think that creating meaningfull and fun content integrated into the game world can be a key to raise its popularity in natural way thats why gambling and similar feature should be accessed only from within this space we can simplify it to some degree redesign it to be like some virtual space accessible instantly anytime from anywhere with ability to instantly teleport between rooms or tables and such but it still should require to be there in form of a human beingthose things are definetly not the most important on the todo list but they should have some time contributed to them too after core gameplays problems eventually will be sorted out
no i will not pressure ccp to ban it 
so does using isboxer to mine with 10 accounts net you ore any faster than mining with 10 accounts and not using isboxerthe answer is no the ship you fly the lasers your skills and the boosts you receive determine how fast you mine oreisboxer does not in any way accelerate how fast your acquire in game currency or goods
kvm switch and matrixes are cheap and can be scaled to 64 computers in most solutions switch itself doesnt repeat anything but a matrix will send the same signal to all machines fully hardware solutionedit or you could just build a simple demultiplexer they are electrically simple to create
for those arguing that a 40 man fleet doesnt make more isk an hour than a solo miner add fleet bonuses and orca bonuses in you will find the fleet makes vastly mope money than a solo player and each member past point x only exaggerates the isk difference
one character with mining boosts you know like in null you usually have in standing fleets does exactly the same amount of income than an another character in a fleet of 40wheres the multiboxing reference in this
no they arent as i explained to you way back in post number 2 of this thread  but please do not let facts get in your way
the main problem with the push for more wis features is that theyre likely to eat up development time that could be used to implement other features more relevant to the games focal features the existence of character portraits seems like enough of a justification for spending money on fancy clothing and the substantial amount of people who are willing to spend lots of time building their perfect space waifuhusbando is another adding new features in order to justify integrating second life in space into a game whose aesthetic focuses are completely different seems kind of unnecessary when they could be built into preexisting features
oh please anybody who says overview defaults are ok lives in frakking denial its frakking torture to set it back when your client decides to go fubar and resets itself to fresh install stateand i suspect shah might not be far from truth about reasons why generally most important part of inspace ui is still neglected
considering that the overview is the most important thing needed to figure out just what the heck is going on around you improving its default settings would definitely do something to ameliorate the steep learning newbie learning cliff that eve is so infamous for even pretty basic whitebread setups like the recommended eve uni ones require you to spend a fair amount of time reorganizing a system that could just be functional from the getgo it took me five days of gameplay to figure out that clicking on things to figure out what they were wasnt an integral part of the eve experience this is probably not an isolated experiencebasically this is good stuff op
so would inice ideam
thank you
this does make sense in the broad termsfree intel from across the galaxy is worse than free intel in the solar system you are in localmmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
exactly the same with rattingminingmarketing bots they earn isk at the same rate per character as everyone else no acceleration involved in traditional notting either just a 3rd party program controlling the game client like isbotter does
a quick bump as ive updated and cleaned up the post thanks for the read

only problem is that there is no pvp in hi sec and some minerhumpers dominating an area would be even more meaningless if you want to play this game get out of the safe zone or continue bending over to concord like the little bears you are
well i am glad it makes some sense at least now i am hoping there will be some discussion about it and maybe some changes in the futureofcourse pl and other big supercap entities will complain about it since they will have to do muchmore effort to get easy capital killson the other hand it will be much more exciting for super and titan pilots to fly their ships since they can move it around the galaxy much easier without the enemy knowing it if they do it right and people will hopefully be more confident flying their supers and create more content
unfortunately there is an unintended side effect of this in high sec wars watch lists are used to calculate if your targets or your aggressors are logged on at a given point tracking down 5 active pilots in a corp containing 50 inactive alts would become exponentially more time consuming and expensive without an alternative game mechanic in placein the opposite direction it is quite comforting knowing that the 2030 man war decing alliance siting in the jita pipe has only 1 dude on mostly likely camping the jita undock after 3 weeks of war decs
there is no unfortunatly in this story since your enemy doesnt know how many you have online either
think about the net resultedit if out of 50100 man corp there are 210 people active without the watch list youd not be able to find them without flying around every system in high sec when we have had a high sec contract involving one of the first activities is to add all the target pilots to the watch list and us this as a basis to track them down this involves looking at contract history of the active pilots and use locator agents to get their approximate location then track them down this isnt trivial in the amount of effort  time spent if you made watch lists consensual by default without providing another mechanic to filter inactive players youd effectively leave empire wars to camping on the jita undock or people war decing as many people as possible to have targets its a rather blunt instrument and ultimately less fun removing watch lists in high sec is kind of like removing local in null sec youd not really know if there was anyone out there to fight
that could be easily solved by making that if 2 entities are at war through a wardeck they automaticaly become available for watchlistas soon as the war drops the availability of being able to watchlist them drops as wellyou can even put that in a story line that if people wardeck each other they will have spies everywhere that will keep an eye on the enemy and will tell you when they log on so roleplayers are happy tootherefore i am not against the idea that if 2 corporations or alliances have wardecked each other the watchlist becomes available for them because if pl or any other big entity wanted to watchlist every super or titan they would have to wardeck the entire galaxy
interesting you are basically saying that optin watch list contacts would also fix hi sec wars unintended but desirable consequence
hi allright so basically i see an inconsistency in logic in the game and would like to report it but support guys basically said non of there businessgame play bugright so bumping a ship knocks it off its align and increases its speed correct so why is it i can use an mwd on an orca to warp faster while unaligned and way over the warp thresholdwas ganked recently using the bump mechanic lost a ship but what ever first rule of eve dont undock if you cant afford to loose itthe gank was well executed and very well planed fair play to brave noobiesship lost was a what ever moment cause i was tired at the time but it got me thinking around the logic of the micro warp and around webbing and bumping there inconsistentso for warp you require to be at a certain speed and fully aligned correctso there for the mwd trick shouldnt work and the webbing trick shouldnt either as your not fully alignedobviously being over the speed is necessarybumping as gm mace and gm the doctor put it is an intended mechanicand as a developer my self and inconsistencies in logic annoy me to no end so id love for a dev to take a lookmore detail around why this works as it does would be great a fix would be fantastic but a explanation from a dev would be amazingregardsmr yoshinesansha sympathiserps thats it now troll away forum dwellers xd
um align then use the mwd or web trick most gankers dont even bother to fit scamblers which still allows you plenty of time to get to warpedit you could also warp to nearest celestial directly in front of the gate first then warp off to the next jump gate
didnt read it properly did you saw a change and started the opinion this is not about getting away its about how the mechanic works and how it should work intended by ccp the fact that i didnt get away is irrelivant thats pilot error as in my bad lol
the orca mwd trick and webbing a feighter into warp work because after you jump through a gate you are stationary and therefore aligned to all directionswith webbing your max speed is reduced but your acceleration isnt so you reach 75 of your new lower max speed quicklywith the orca and mwd the mwd vastly increases your acceleration and your max speed when the one cycle ends your max speed drops back to normal which means your actual speed is above the 75 needed for warp and you are aligned due to the gate jump making you aligned to all directionsbumping stops you from warping because they knock you out of alignment if the bumpers dont know what they are doing they sometimes bump you in the direction of a celestial which you can then warp to
ok so warp requires two things alignment towards the object in question be between 75 and 125 max speedthe mwdpulse and webbing trick are not inconsistencies rather they are workarounds that manipulate the speed requirement alignment isnt a consideration when starting from a dead stop you are already aligned once you start movinghow it works the mwdpulse trick increases the max speed of a ship however the agility acceleration of certain ships are so low that they will never reach even close to max mwd speed within one mwd cycle instead they just happen to reach or be within that needed 75 to 125 max speed threshold when the mwd is turned off the webbing trick does the exact opposite of the mwdpulse trick instead of temporarily increasing max speed it reduces it to where the current speed isagain remember that some ships have very poor agility meaning very poor acceleration a single web reduces max speed not current speed by 60 two webs by 87 because stacking penalties do apply this means that a freighter that has a max speed of 100 msec only needs to be going 10 msec for the desired outcome warpingas for what ccp thinks of them the mwdpulse trick has been known and used for years more thrillseeking players often combine them with a cloak the t2 noncovertops one to get through gate camps in battleships petitions and threads have often been filed against this tactic but they usually are rebuffed and the filer pointed towards the features and ideas forum if they feel very strongly which is then generally rebuffed by the playerbase because we do not see a problem with it  the webbingtrick was never intended by the devs but it was showcased by ccp during fanfest 2013 as an example of emergent gameplay that they were generally fine with note watch the whole thing it is quite interesting how they view their own game and mechanics
this is a topic about isboxer so yes i am focused in such a topic on isboxer but anyways i sad also they should search for characters doing exactly the same thing at the same time to find such tools or hardware but yeah dont read it about a single character in the 40 men miner fleet is earning only the same amount of income than an equal solo player doing the same to be honest why are people mining with 40 ships if there is no advantage at the end your argument is he earns nothing more when you compare character by character you drop the main part he is flying 40 ships it really doesnt matter if he uses isboxer or any other hardwaresoftware solution he is not able to do it without any toolshardware if you would compare your argumentation to a car and the speed limit you would be allowed to drive 4000 mileshour in a 100 mileshour zone because every single car would only drive 100 mileshour  and sure you will never reach your destination any faster than a single driving car 4000 mileshour are equal to 100 mileshourthats complete bullshit people use software or hardware solutions to get a benefit new options and possibilities the benefit here is you earn isk much more faster with a system you cant do without such tools ashley eoner about drone assist in vanguards  i think you know exactly why people will not use drone assist in vanguards instead of isboxer and real dps shipsand there is still the major question why is this topic a problem for isboxer and what to ever repeater solutions a problem when you have really not a single advanatage and benefit 
a client run by isboxer does nothing if there are no player inputsa bot does what it is programmed to do without player inputssee the difference
you see the difference between 1 and 40 mouseclicks 
yes but how is that relevant
the significant difference is that the bot does not require continuous human input  you start it and it runs for hours at a time with no further interaction required on the part of a human player
it is entirely relevant no one human could control so many other characters with out automated assistance no one human without assistance could control two characters as well as one human with the assistancethis debate hinges on the definition of automation some seem to demand that automation is more than one event such as two mouse clicks on the same character as opposed to two clicks on two charactersthis canard of input is just that a canard programmatic assistance is being used to accomplish more than one human could do alone end of storynecessity is the plea for every infringement of human freedom it is the argument of tyrants it is the creed of slaves  william pitt
now youre going into the debate if we should use computers at all what is allowed is clearly outlined in the eulatos and isboxer is not currently breaking it if it does start breaking rules ban it but for now this discussion is just a pissing contest
its really fantastic how people spin a topic just to keep their advantages they couldnt keep without a third party to and without automation via reteating commands on different characters its really fantastic till now you have brought not a single arguemtn why such tools should be allowedan about the eula only because ccp is currently doing nothing is not equal to it is fine with the eula 6 conducta specifically restricted conduct2 you may not use your own or thirdparty software to modify any content appearing within the game environment or change how the game is played3 you may not use your own or any thirdparty software macros or other stored rapid keystrokes or other patterns of play that facilitate acquisition of items currency objects character attributes rank or status at an accelerated rate when compared with ordinary game play you may not rewrite or modify the user interface or otherwise manipulate data in any way to acquire items currency objects character attributes or beneficial actions not actually acquired or achieved in the gamewe do not endorse or condone the use of playermade software or any other third party applications or software that confers an unfair benefit to players we may in our discretion tolerate the use of applications or other software that simply enhance player enjoyment in a way that maintains fair gameplay however if any third party application or other software is used to gain any unfair advantage or is used for purposes beyond its intended use or if the application or other software violates other parts of the eula we may fully enforce our rights to prohibit such use including player bans please use playermade or other third party software at your own riskccp may allow currently isboxer but it breaks all rules of the eula it is a 3rd party software tool it accelerate things it modifies the user interface
indeed its also funny when people suggest that their understanding of the eula is better than ccpsthings we knowit doesnt break the eula as told to us by ccp it does not gain you items at an accelerated rate see point 1 it does not modify the ui see point 1 destination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
wowthink outside the box and not in your tiny realm peoplenot even going to go into details as trolls will be trolls
depends if you believe it is a desirable fix remember it cuts both ways the defender is more likely to be inconvenienced as the same intel is not available to them they are unaware if their aggressors are online so either they will dock up out of paranoia or always have to move around with scout which isnt always a possibility with lightly social groupsthis wouldnt prevent the other methods ie logon traps liberal use of 90 pointless war decs similar to the privateer alliance trick a number of years ago suicide ganking or awoxing if you make one play style less effective people will adapt to the next best thingas for the suggestion of a war dec watch list if we are going to choose game mechanics we could come up with something better than the current locator services  watch list effectively combining the two into a kind of a short delayed target radar something that is used every 20 minutes that tracks legal combatants available to both parties maybe through standings depending on the length of delay war dec requirements  watch list opt out it could help with the ops post of super capital pilots being easily tracked
what about if there was a second version of the locator agentone that after a variable amount of time hours would let you know if your target has been activethis would tell a hunter if the super was on the move but not with enough warning to batphone would provide wardec info as to who was active and needed closer watchingmmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
oh please youre argument is just stupid give it upnecessity is the plea for every infringement of human freedom it is the argument of tyrants it is the creed of slaves  william pitt
how exactly does is boxer modify the user interface because i have to admit that ones got me stumped and if you can prove that someone is using it to modify the game interface then they should indeed be banned
rofl the argument of ignorance as told to us by ccp the huge glaring caveat full of self serving bull so lets see ccp gains by having alt accounts thus ccp has a large incentive for it not to be against the letter of the eula while ignoring the spirit of the eula is that the basis of your argument and as you claim ccps lollets look at this stupid list doesnt break the eula as told by ccp  ccp is not a fair arbiter in this case they have an incentive to break their own rules which they are clearly doing as exposed by your item 2does not gain you items at an accelerated rate  absolute total bs i challenge you to prove that you can control just two characters as efficiently as can be done by isboxer go ahead prove your assertion if you can good luck go ahead and prove it with a nice youtube vid with enough detail to pass the bull  test your argument is crap just as is ccps position on this issuenecessity is the plea for every infringement of human freedom it is the argument of tyrants it is the creed of slaves  william pitt
is this still going on so you do want to see isboxer banned ccp basically states that isboxer is violating the eula in the policy on client modificationthe multiboxing application in the policy that violates the eula but ccp states it will not actively police at this time is isboxerif you really want to convince ccp to ban the use of isboxer you cannot base your argument on the fact that isboxer violates either section 6a2 section 6a3 or section 9c of the eula they have a written policy that acknowledges that it does and that ccp doesnt care as long as isboxer does not violate other parts of the eulaif you really want to get ccp to change its mind you either need to demonstrate how isboxer breaks other parts of the eula or how the use of isboxer breaks down game design one example of that is that isboxer can allow a user to get around the drone assist limit of 50 drones are their others if not you probably wont see isboxer banned
ccps game their rules learn to deal with it as far as your accelerated rate claim im not the one claiming it breaks the rules therefore the onus is upon those making that claim to show proofbut talking of ignorance im sure you can show that right i mean two miners definitely mine more ore than two miners wouldoh and your argument regarding ccps incentive would hold some water if it wasnt for the fact they regularly ban thousands of accounts due to bots breaking guess what the very rule you claim isboxer does destination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
so ccp should not be the one setting and enforcing policies related to a ccp productaccelerated rate has been explained no character gains anything at an accelerated pace you are mixing up character and the actual playercontrolling efficiency is not something which is giving you any gains at accelerated speedtldr you think something is unfair and unjust its your responsibility to provide proof not those who uphold the current status quo you have yet failed to do so
see the ice mining comment on page 3
yep it is their game and their reputation if they want to look like double speaking liars theyre more than welcome to do thatso you are saying that software that can send key strokes and mouse clicks to other clients is no more effiecnet than one person having to to interact with each clientyour equivocations and ccps are lies necessity is the plea for every infringement of human freedom it is the argument of tyrants it is the creed of slaves  william pitt
1 isboxer does not modify any content appearing within the game environment or change how the game is played isboxer is merely a software for managing multiple clients no game environment settings are altered by isboxer and no gameplay mechanics are altered while using the software2 isboxer does not accelerate the acquisition of items currency objects character attributes rank or status at an accelerated rate when compared with ordinary game play isboxer allows for scenarios that spreads the tasks across multiple clients but each individual iteration of the action being performed by isboxer occurs at the same rate as it does on the primary client ie at a human rate of input specific scripting of actions is in violation of the eula as the computer then processes those actions at an accelerated rate but the broadcasting system used by isboxer for multiple clients is not performed at an accelerated rate when compared to a primary client3 isboxer modifies no ui assets in the eve online client all additional assets provided by isboxer are dialogs overlayed by the program on top of the eve client if anything its a modification of information presented on the screen but there is no actual modifications of the compiled client code and ui elements unless done through additional scripting which is a nono
no one human can switch to each individual client and issue events with the same speed and pointermouse accuracy as can be accomplished by one human with the aid of isboxer isboxer goes beyond the human rate of input and capabilities no one human can operate multiple clients as efficiently or at this accelerated rateaccelerated the whiners scream yes accelerated all of the time required by a human with out isboxer is done in the blink of an eye with isboxer instead of the time it would take a human to switch clients and issue the commands its all done automaticly automated for you automationisboxer provides a huge advantage compared to not using it due to automation that automation provides for accelerated issue of commands to multiple clients all of that time saved by the user of isboxer gives advantages far above what is possible by ordinary game playnecessity is the plea for every infringement of human freedom it is the argument of tyrants it is the creed of slaves  william pitt
no im not saying that isboxer is not more efficient at giving commands to clients than one human alttabbing between clientsi did say that isboxer does not accelerate the acquisition of items currency objects character attributes rank or status at an accelerated rate when compared with ordinary game playyou have not found a rebuttal to this ill lurk around waiting
you rebut it yourself every time you play the equivocation game it is not my fault your argument rests upon a lie you purposefully ignore all of the time saved by the isbox user time that would be consumed by normal game play the isbox user can start to accumulate resources from all clients right away the normal user can not the isbox user can target fire orbit evade all clients at the same time a normal user can not they would have to spend considerably more time and effort controlling all of the clientsthat is what you purposefully ignore and try to assume away and what makes your argument a lie time and effort time and effort are the only things that have real value in eve anyone with half an ounce of economic sense about eve knows that isboxer saves the user time and effort you can try and argue against this fact and i will continue to expose your position for the bull  that it isnecessity is the plea for every infringement of human freedom it is the argument of tyrants it is the creed of slaves  william pitt
shah youre usually always right and the rest of your post is spot onbut where did you get the 125 max speed tresholdi just tested it in a covops the fit had max speed around 400 ms align turn on mwd turn off mwd when mwd cycle ended wait a second or two to be sure hit warpmy ship instawarped even if speed was still well over 1000 msmake space glamorous is eve dying or not ask the eveo deathometer
i remember it from a dev post from long ago you have to be within 25 of max speed and my orca usually instawarps when slightly over max speed using the mwd trickedit after some tinkering i think the reason your covops instawarped is because its agility is very high which means that it speeds up and slows down very fast you were probably going well over 1000 msec at the end of mwd cycle but once it comes down enough it flies into warp the speed would have to be down to 500 msec
but csm members dont seem to be really interested in this topic either its been months that i keep bumping it up but rare are csm members who commentill try to contact them ingameplease if you know some of them ask them to support this topic thanks
i sent a mail to my good friend mike azariah who i actually barely know and asked him to have a look i have talked to him before maybe hell remember me or maybe hell think my evemail was wellwritten and convincing enough to have a lookalso i note that this is posted in the assembly hall you might consider making a satellite post in features and ideas discussion i wasnt getting much support for my ideas until i discovered thats where all the activity is fid is for casual chat about what could be a good idea just to run it by others when you get a lot of support you would post it in the assembly hall and ask people who have claimed support to endorse the post then when the csm note that it is being talked about theyre more likely to take the assembly hall post more seriouslyat least thats my best guess at current as to how it works in any case you might just double or triple your traffic at the very least by moving this topic over there
but i already have a similar topic in features and ideas
hi ive been sent this more than once people have been paying attention i like the feel of it is you wantmy personal opinion i lost my overview settings with a reinstall and kind of gave upi know it is frustrating to not receive the feedback you are looking for with an idea like this the csm wont always be able to share what is going on with ideas and proposals it can be infuriating for you however we have our upcoming little things project whcihnis a great place to feature settings additions like this i also have it in my personal player ideas and desires files
some issues that are not brought up alot the presets do not pre seed in the settings menu and you cannot save new settings while sitting in the hanger you can change all the settings around but until you are in space there is no way to save what you have changes
time and effort savings arent mentioned in the eula in the same way you are saying timeone isboxer running 10 ice miners doesnt not make a single isk more than 10 players ice mining next to themhe may do it by himself he may save time over a single ice miner in getting 200 blocks saved up but again no faster than if he had 10 computers and 10 accounts one on each computermore efficient but not faster
that doesnt still accelerate the gain of anything being effortless and saving time is exactly the reason to use isboxer this is not barred by the eulatos and would be stupid if you didnt try to optimize your game play by any legal means necessarywhat im gathering here is that you are just angry about people being better at the game and want to ban their tools
im still waiting for an answer to how ccp are supposed to differentiate between a software solution and a hardware solution without flat out banning multiboxing all together
i wouldnt say theyre better at eve better at time management maybe
no it doesnt but please continue to think that the differences are measured in fractions of a second  the reaction time of the human bodylet me give you a real life example before i took my last break i used to routinely run four clients on four separate screens from two computers using just one mouse and keyboard no is boxer but what is this sorcery you might ask i used a software product called synergy that automatically shifts the keyboard and mouse inputs to another computer on the same network simply by dragging the mouse to the edge of the screen in theory it scales infinitely though the need to have physical screens provides a hard limit for how many you could run practicallyall that was required for me to keep mining was occasionally dragging my mouse from one screen to the other and hitting a few keyboard shortcuts is boxer essentially removes only one step in that process  dragging the mouse so this vast difference youre talking about is marginal at best over other software or hardware that provides the same results
are you even reading your own arguments you contradict yourself what about the mineral miner what about the pvper the ratter the mission runner and the incursion runner the vast majority of the ui overhead is reduced for all of them due to automation they can run around and shoot more rocks more rats more targetscould a player with out isboxer accomplish the same nopenecessity is the plea for every infringement of human freedom it is the argument of tyrants it is the creed of slaves  william pitt
so do you use isboxer now and if so why do you mean to tell me you spent your money for no reason really do tell us all how you just throw money away for no reason oh excuse me fractions of a second were all interested in hearing about itnecessity is the plea for every infringement of human freedom it is the argument of tyrants it is the creed of slaves  william pitt
come on stop talking show me how you do a vanguard without isboxer or any other toolhardware show me that is is exactly the same ratio with alttab and that you have no advantage with it show me how you can ice min with 40 accounts without tools and haul all the ore at the same timejust show it and stop talking should be really no big deal with all your arguments
youre starting to foam at the mouth there a little bit man wtf are you on about
this whole thread reminds me of bugs bunny and daffy duckrabbit seasonduck seasonrabbit seasonduck seasonthe game warden has said its duck season the argument is moot until ccp changes their mind
one player alttabbing at 10 clients vs 1 player using 10 isboxer clients will have a different income because isboxer make sit more efficientthis still doesnt mean that isboxer accelerates the acquisition of items currency objects character attributes rank or status at an accelerated rate when compared with ordinary game playyou really have a hard time understanding what is being talked in this thread
actually with a little bit of thought you can
the entire eula is on a characteraccount basis character abc being controlled by isboxer will achieve the same amount of items within the same time fram as characters xyz each being controlled by a separate personthis is the interpretation ccp has ruled with its the interpretation you will have to live withif you have a problem with it i really dont think ccp cares because youll find something else to whine about with players having these insurmountable advantages over you
theres only 2 or 3 useful attribute layouts anyway needing to frequently change them indicates that youre doing something in an extremely inefficient way
youre the one trying to make a ship the counter to its counter not us
that could work too you could even use the same agent that will tell you boththe location and if he is active or when he was last seen active
alternatively you could log out your spacepeniscoffin in a pos instead of the same spot in lowsec that you were in 6 months ago
pretty easily in fact i do escalations without using any isboxer features other than window management did icebelt mining and multibox ratting for years before even getting isboxer and i did it all well enoughisboxer simplifies things yes i actually dont even use the broadcasting features and mostly just use it for window management and managing cpufps across all my clients if youd like to see how thats done and still doesnt accelerate play wellyou know how to contact me
see you are comparing one person to one person that is not the metricthe metric is account to accountcan 4 people playing their accounts talking on teamspeak go thru low sec and kill things yes arguably better than the isboxer if their is logo involvedwhere isboxer shines is when you have enough to aloha a ship which still can be achieved by xx number of single playersis an isboxing single person running 10 accounts going to be better than a single person alttabbing 10 accounts  yes he will that is why he got isboxer in the first place but does it accelerate the ability to gather things in game no they are all gathered at the same rate
it doesnt matter where you log it offwhat does matter is that nobody should have free easy and instant intel when you log oni am ok with the locator agent giving locations and telling if you are active or were last active because that requires effort
interesting aligned in all directions that seems like a bug in it self and once you move your no longer aligned in any direction as your aligning to something so there for the orca mdw still has the same issue it warps while not aligned  its a very strange mech imo and bumping has effectivly the same results yet one warps the other doesnt  bothunaligned but over the thresholdi should never be able to warp side ways d
okay so here is where we get into some technical stuffthe server only sees your ship as a sphere the diameter of this sphere is the axis listed in the ingame ship viewer front is wherever your trajectory is to be aligned to something is to have your trajectory pointing in the direction of your selected target with no curvature in your flight pathwhat you see in the client is purely graphics whenever your trajectory changes the client will try to adjust the graphics accordingly however this doesnt always work out and it occasionally glitches or is not fast enough hence the occasional sideways warp with large shipsthis also means that when you are at a dead stop there is no front to your ship see the sphere has no trajectory so the graphical front is based on what your last known trajectory was and can warp in any direction you choose equally well see passive alignment is a mythnow when you begin warp from a dead stop you are already aligned towards a target you simply have not fulfilled the speed requirement which webbing and the mwdpulse trick work aroundand when someone bumps your ship they are altering your trajectory so you cannot fulfill the alignment warp condition even if your speed is sufficient
oh dont get me wrong i get the tech for it im a game dev my self so its a simple enough process what im talking about its the fact that tho not always possiblee the graphic should reprisent the logic so your ship should have a front direction ie a point on the shpere to refrance as the facing direction and alignment should only be achieved once the point of front is facing the target as per to say align the sphere its one extra point to calculate and eve is already pretty light on the band width so shouldnt be an issue on that end of things servers might be a pain though as there not really up to the current task as it is ie tidi for example
purely a point of its bugging the hell out of me no meaning to disrupt anyones game but this kinda stuff annoys me d personal bug for code bugs d
im sorry but what you said was closed minded at best sucking it up is a code word for lack of empathy and lazy problem solving i would concider maybe actually countering the ideas set on the table rather than white washing the issue with a we dont need this excusei hope this has helped you in discussing about name changeshave a nice day
by that logic ccp should stop banning botters because they earn isk at the same rate as any other account1 player botting on 5 or 10 accounts for 7 hours earns the same amount per account as another player playing the same 7 accounts manually for 7 hours therefore botting is no different to isboxer and should be allowed
you can repeat it over and over again that isboxer didnt accelerate any gain and it will be still completely wrongyou have no delay with isboxer compared to somebody who alttabs so you have a alpha damage without delay you give all commands to every single account at the same time with isboxer you only play 1 character and copy everything to another characterthats plain and simple an automationstop comparing to single characters you can play only one single character with full concentration and no delay on en24 is a nice example the isboxer bomber quad possible with isboxer impossible with alttab same with isboxer alpha gates all ships align at the same time all move at the same time all shoot at the same time and so on nothing you can do without such toolsyour gain is that you play only one account and several other accounts do exactly the same at exactly the same timeyou can kill stuff much more faster without any delayyou have an alpha because you have no delaywith automation you avoid to do the same thjing on several other accounts like open the cargobay and put ore into the bayyou warp align decloak jump what ever without delayyou gain alot with isboxer tools advantages you cant do without them and you accelerate things killing faster is also an acceleration doesnt matter if it is a npc or a player and with isboxer bomber squads you can also switch complete fleet fightsthe eula is talking exactly about this kind of third party software
did you read a word of whats actually been said i will offer again out of the kindness of my heart and the spirit of you are blue to me and i have to suffer through that every day to show you the error of your thinking
how is it argued that isboxer does not accelerate gain for someoneisboxer makes it so you do not have to go to each of your pilots and command it to do something how is that not accelerating you faster than someone else instead of going through 10 20 30 40 pilots each you just have to do it for one so it drastically reduces the time needed for you to command your own fleet you then benefit from that if isboxer does that makes 40 pilots into 1 pilot command wise how is it argued that does not accelerate gain of isk for someone it does not matter at all what he does with the isk it is the fact that he gains it at an increased ratecompare time needed to go from one pilot window to the next to input commands with time needed to input command to 1 pilot and isboxer replicates said command to every other open window making it so you do not have to go to each window to input commandthis is not accelerated rateconspiracy from within
you know you could read the last 5 pages of discussions as to how isboxer doesnt accelerate earnings on an account basis that botting isnt the same as isboxer as botting requires no human interaction once its set to go where as isboxers actions can be done with hardware or other software optionsi can mine just as fast with 20 characters via alt tabbing as i could if i used isboxer or any number of cloning programshardwarebtw do you have any idea how long it takes to setup 40 accounts for repeater usage do you have any idea how much that costs in money or time do you have any idea how frustrating it is to keep 40 clients synched with eves incredibly buggy ui if it was an easy task youd see massive isboxer fleets taking over everything reality doesnt jive with you
whispers quietly rabbit season duck season
prove itvideo yourself mining with 20 accounts isboxing for 2 hours and then do it without isboxer for 2 hours if you are right youll have exactly the same amount of ore on both runs

there are animations for guns to go from prone to ready and a radial alignment time i propose that not only should these animations be calibrated directly to the rate of fire of the module but also that the first shot occurs after the initial animation like armor repair vs shields a few rationalesmissiles have an inherent disadvantage time of travel in new eden where there is all this technology it is absurd that a projectiles vector ever be calculated incorrectly there is just too much technology for such a simple calculation to miss we see on many shows like mythbusters that projectiles for example can be calibrated to hit within a very small spread over great distances even though is atmosphere there is so many more variables that could ever be added than to a simple spacial vector all weapons should hit always with a few acceptations to ecm if they do not have a firing solution they should not be fired if there is a small signature radius ship that is travelling outside the turrets radial movement it shouldnt be fired until there is a firing solution this will work to lower large sized guns vs smaller sized targets falloff would not happen inertia however rate of fire should be adjusted to compensate for trickier vectors this will work to compensate for falloff misses as with missiles unless there is some sort of quantum laws that are being crossed in eveverse eve is real ammo should have traveling delay as well now this is space so they can travel very fast however they should not alpha on keyboard presswhen the shots are fired and it causes suspect limited engagement or criminal status this should happen as the thing fires not as soon as they hit or miss what this might accomplishbring a more level playing field to missile eggersit would keep the dps and volley damage of guns the same but decrease the rate of fire always to penalize damage all the way to the point of never being able to accomplish a firing solution against some targets this will  everyone off even laser people missile people will be happy this is not my intention i believe this game play mechanic of very basic vectorization failure would not happen in eve so you must get over it
an appeal to authority is an argument from the fact that a person judged to be an authority affirms a proposition to the claim that the proposition is trueappeals to authority are always deductively fallacious even a legitimate authority speaking on his area of expertise may affirm a falsehood so no testimony of any authority is guaranteed to be true
you would have a point if it wasnt for the fact that in this case the authority is the owner of the game and makes the rulesnot only that but they requested input from the playerbase before deciding on that rulingso yes we have that facts and know the rules from the owners of the gameat least have an understanding of the situation before trying to apply any fallacies no matter how good you think they may sound destination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
no i mean i have no idea what the hell point youre trying to make about my supposed use of isboxer or how that in any way relates to the discussion at hand your ideas are jumping all over the place like a seagull on crack hold my hand and walk me through it slowly because frankly my man youre not making any senseyou do if you choose to continue playing the game if on the other hand youre unsubscribing then youre absolutely correct you do not have to abide by any rules made up by ccp except the ones regarding the resale of their ip for real money also the customer isnt always rightactually theres a very simple question that can solve this answer with a simple boolean1 ccp as the owner and administrator of eve online has the right to create and enforce rules pertaining to the playing of said game
actually botting is fundamentally different as has already been explained at least once in this thread i leave it as an exercise to the reader to determine the crucial difference between the two as a hint its called botting for a reason
so you want me to buy a video camera so you can get your creepy stalk on watching me play eve thats just weird brahnow if youre offering to buy me a good video cam then id like at least a go pro level has to be good quality so you can be sure to see my fingers on teh keyboard and such in detailedit  to get serious for a moment if i did manually first and isboxer second that would easily result in less earned on the second
you are comparing apples to oranges not a single character under the control of an isboxer entity gains at an accelerated pace
botting is not allowed because it1 tampers with the game client mostly hooking into same processes and dlls to harvest information client modification2 injects information to the game client client modification3 performs actions without human input automation of game playisboxer does none of these as it functions over directinput just like your keyboard and mouse it also does not hook into the process to harvest information or to post information into the client neither does isboxer perform any actions without human input
you are one player one player only if you play 10 characters controled via isboxer you are still one player and not 10so you can compare player vs player and both gain the same amount of isk when they rat with one character but if player a is doing an incursion via alttab and player b is doing an incursion via isboxer the result is different for a good reason player a is playing 10 different characters player b is playing only one character but 9 character are doing the same thing at the same timeplayer a is multiboxing player b isnt isboxer is creating single multiple single players via automation under the control of a single playerplayer b is getting stuff from 9 characters at an accelerated time
only comparing player vs player is pointless as ccp has clarified that the eula refers to account vs account comparisons
the problem with this statement is that you assume what is cheatingits ccps game they get to decide what is cheating not us playersif you dont like that simple fact then its time to move on to another gameor make your ownbest of luckst
again no player b is just as limited as player a in how long actual events in eve transpire isboxer does not accelerate gameplay it accelerates if anything interaction across clients everything else that occurs in the game environment from reloading to rats actually exploding happens at the same rate regardless of use of isboxer or not there is therefore no accelerated time on the server side of the acquisition of items or isk and the same rules still apply to the client side in regards to how interaction must occur from the player to the client
i still support this it should be back on the front page for a bit 
so talking with incursion fleets the idea of either a repurposed rorqual poor thing is lonely or an orca would make a good choice fgor a ship that can carry fitted bss they wanted 2 plus a cruiser for incursion caravansmmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
i havent read the 21 pages of this thread so if already mentioned please be kind with your replywouldnt a module which converted ore cargo space to sma space be less work for ccp to implement something along the lines of an overdrive which converts cargo space to speedmdd
so are we doing this thing yet it woulda been handy to have around last weekend
erm while i agree that there is plenty that could be improved upon with the different weapon flavors they need to be improved in such that there are still different flavors not just lasers for everyone with different names and animationsas much as i would like to conserve ammo with your firing solution recommendation shots need to miss for the game to be fairalso welcome to the submarines in space game st
perhaps in the beginning of the cycles you would miss but as more shots are fired accuracy improves to a point and rof improves also i know ive had problems with inertia in this game wrote it off as having something to do with warp core i also write off the 1400mm rounds having not only the same volume as 1200mm rounds but having only enough volume to make a sliver of a round  1400mm as these rounds are not actually rounds but instead they are payloads that might be loaded into shells 
i would go with an updated version of the locator agent with some features 1 mode 1  search for all active war decd pilots  user defined pilots that are currently online  youd just get a list of names or an indication that they are online or not just like a snap shot of the watch list  a mechanism to stop spamming  cost scaling based on the search parameters all current region constellation etc and number of pilots2 mode 2  search for a group of pilots option to use the result set  parameters from the previous query  approximate system location 1530 minutes ago maybe a map graphic representing the results  a mechanism to stop spamming  cost scaling based on the search parameters all current region constellation etc and the number of pilots selectedthen we remove nonconsensual watch listsi guess could place both modes into 1 gui and adjust pricing  results accordingly however the purpose is to make hunting targets possible but certainly not passive like it is today another example is quite often in low sec we place known titan pilots of locals on watch list to see if there is a chance that someone is forming to counter hot drop on us this will now require human eyesthe proposal above would make it harder to determine trouble is on the way and tracking supercarrier  titan pilots for kills quite a bit harder assuming no spies in the target corporation without removing one of the tools for active wardec campaigningxav
to be fair on that last point it is kind of the entire point of democracies the cool kids win regardless of the political positions andor actual aptitude for the positionits kinda why america and half of europe keeps finding itself in such  situations

im one of those duders who re upped my alt so that i could use isboxer why would ccp ban it expecially when it only encourages people to purchase more accounts
bots also purchase more accounts
i am floored by the amount of support this idea i came up with while drinking has received and mike that is why i voted for you you listen and actively engage the community while lending support to new or innovative ideas thanks for the support everyone keep it up and dont stop until we have this or something like thisi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
i think this would be a great idea so long as it is coupled with another real world consequencethe corp or alliance is categorized as a terrorist group its assets frozen and seized and its members subject to arrest ie destruction by concord of course game mechanics dont allow some of that so a simple case of having the corp flagged with a 10 security status would do no empire could allow a private corp to claim some form of sovereignty particularly using military actions over their own space if you want to play criminals and gain recognition for criminal acts then you should also suffer the consequences of being criminals
no i am trying to give a heavy dictor a place in eve which currently it is only used for capital tackle and cynosinterdictor bubbles that use the charges wont stop them still i would suspect the power coming from a ship based bubble instead iof a probe that is launched would be strongersimple  give the ship class some life
fyi if youre only using hictors for capital tackles and cynos youre missing out on some of its other uses
freighter bumping is not a problem one corpmate in a rookie ship equipped with a web will launch a freighter into warp and a fraction of the usual required speed this tactic is used all throughout new eden by smart freighter pilots to help prevent ganks and to increase their iskhr by drastically reducing align timesminer bumping is not a problem if you are a miner getting bumped off your mining spot move to a different belt if the bumper keeps following you and you are taking measures to avoid him then report him and the gms will deal with him as there are rules against this if you are afk and getting bumped well perhaps you shouldnt be afk and should be paying attention to your miningminer bumping is a valid tool used by people like myself who merely dislike afk miners but truly despise bot miners i have reported several bots over the years because a timed set of command continues even after a miner is bumped off his spot whereas a simply afk miner will simply sit in space until the pebcak returnsas for the 45 minutes of bumping on a freighter waiting for a gank squad you do know that safe logout only takes 30s and as long as youre not actively trying to fly you will simply disappear from space bring an alt to the system and watch for the bumper to move onbut again you probably dont want to listen you just want ccp to fix all your problems for you
i searched to see if this topic has already been addressed but did not find anything my suggestion is that the kestrel be made to look like a tech i version of the manticore i noticed that the condor matches the raptor and the crow can we get this kind of symmetry for the kestrel thanks

i would love to ask the ccp to consider my suggestionevery single character that has less than 10 million skill point should get 100 or 200 learning boost it should be a free passive effectthe new players can only play with fregatte with this little amount of sp who wants to wait months to play normally and should i pay for this

alts being something mechanics should discourage not encourage if only because goddamnit no oen wants to work with people anymore everyones on the lul may as well have 23 accounts and do it myself trip
what and make it easy for them the effort you put into getting into the higher skills and better ships is what makes them so awesome imma hafta 1 this if you cant spend the time to do it right dont do it
it already exist there are special implants you can only use in your first month or so but you get them only for promo purposes i believesearch for celebral accelerator
if isboxing gives you no advantage to alttabbing to control other accounts why pay for it
could a dev or csm member please respond to this thread we managed to get overwhelming support for this request and we would like to know that our concerns are being heard
why cant they have these little tidbits be boxes that appear while your in warp there but once your on grid with whatever triggers it it autocloses that would make sense and be convenient

i propose this as browsing experience is boosted using ad block plus there is a block function for exactly this sort of thing you should be able to import and export chat blocklists and view who is blocked at the very least you should be able to export block list to see who is on it
it significantly improves screen space utilization when running multiple accounts helps with managing cpu threads and using the correct gpu if youre running multiple monitors on separate cards and makes launching clients and managing accountoverview settings easier
until ccpgames will make a better worded company policy towards programs like isboxer in their toseula and are willing and able to enforce these new wordings hopefully in the fall this year i do not see the company acting on the current situationbanning isboxed accounts will hurt the company through less plex being bought from the market to fuel multiple accounts and it could hurt the price of stuff ingame compressed ore prices will go up and there for t1t2 modules  ships except plex prices though
plex prices will always go upi use isboxer for the screen and resource management functions i can do just as well without it and sometimes i do go without it cause id rather spend the money on something elsesnip removed reply to a deleted post isd ezwal

so did you know that the sanshas nation wishes to expand its borders and that one of its targets is 9hxqg or how about that their base of operations is in 3gd8 and theyre building more and that theyre slowly destroying everyone if not then how about that a random massive mining colony in myw1v is a massive hindrance and the people there are afraid possibly you might have learned that theyve made a pretty massive fleet to protect themselves and more importantly did you know theyve spent years telling us theyve done this exact same thing ccp pls nerf news op

so webbing the freighter as a corpmate doesnt activate criminalsuspect status or do you have to be in a particular state same fleet in a duelseems a bit close to being an exploit to mewould be interesting to have specific navigation assist modules or something like tugboats that are designed to have positive effects
you need to be in the same player corp which means you can aggress your corp mates and not create a flagtherefore you can web a freighter and it will jump into warp far quicker and no its not an exploityou can dual of course but that takes a little more work and can create issuesdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
i make this forum post following my reddit post from yesterday
this subject is not going to go away and its something that the people who have been playing eve for a long time really want we want ccp to open up new systems i dont care if you can only access the systems with frigates or a whole new race is found but we badly need more space to expand i would like to see the amount of systems double of a 5 year period to allow people once again to actually warp through an empty system in 00 again
when did ccp remove wardecs ganking duels awoxing the market contracts mining missions exploration etc from high sec
hii understand the need to update and maintain the software and hardware however in my time zone us eastern time zone i only have two times per day to play eve right around currently scheduled dt and after work ccps recurring and extended dts at the same time each day unduly harm players in similar situations solution why cant ccp either put their a team on maintenance to make it go faster or if they already do and it just takes them a long time to perform the necessary tasks cant they at least alternate with another timeslot and spread the pain aroundthank you
firstworldproblemsgo read a book or something insteadalso obvious troll is obviousserver maintenance takes as long as it takes especially with a system as complex as eves theyre not exactly changing the oil in a ford here just be glad you arent austrailian they have to deal with downtime during their primetime  every day
yes i am a bit frustrated not to receive more feedback from csm members or ccp devs but in another hand i understand you can all be busy with other things no problemits just that the last message i received from a ccp dev dates back to december 2012 when ccp arrow replied
we have a great deal of ideas and suggestions regarding the overview from players and most of the developers want to tackle it sooner rather than later however many of the developers that could take on such a project revamping one of the most vital uis in the game have been working on the new industry revamp for the past few months the same group of developers has a plan to iterate on the industry ui once it has been released next week to ensure it is the best it can beonce that is out of the way many of us would love to look at doing a revamped overview but we need to discuss it with stakeholders and make sure it fits with the plans of eve development teams if it becomes a thing a team would take on they would need to do extensive research and prototyping and run multiple sisi deployments before considering replacing the current oneso as much as i would like to promise you the world this is the reality we live in and doing things any other way or rushing things would not have the outcome anyone wantsccp arrowccp arrow  director of user experience  eve online  ccparrow
this definitely would be beneficial to incursion runners as well as anyone who produces ships or transports as a neutral for war plagued corporationsi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
not having to jump 30 systems to get your logi because your battleship isnt needed swoons
i also agree the pop up fluff messages get very old
i have yet to find this rumored trade hub in myw1v i bet a cloaked it
agree i also would love to be able to group things with the overview like a folder so you could plop things like wrecks or drones in it so you wouldnt have to change or create tabs for them just mouse over the subgroup and anything in that folder would pop up in a window move mouse away and it would go away
just gunna leave this heresuper kestrel
all we ask is that you guys are looking into it 
after all the discussion ive read it remains that ten accounts can accomplish no more than ten other accounts given the same number and types of ships with equivalent fits and skills operating in the same environments over the same amount of timethat leaves the crispy piece of chapped skin inflamed over not the number of accounts or the total time it takes for either set of ten ships to accomplish the same outcome but chafed skin only comes into play when the number of players involved is mentioned1 if ten ice mining ships came into a belt and mined out the belt does it really matter to the person who came to the belt too late if it was done by ten mining ships or by ten other mining ships2 does it really matter if the belt was cleaned out in the same amount of time by one set of ten mining ships or a different set of ten mining in the same exact amount of time give or take a few seconds 3 would it really matter if that belt was eaten by ten accounts or a different set of ten accounts4 would it really matter if each of the ten ships in both sets of ten would just sit idly by not doing anything until the pilot of each of those ships used a keyboard or mouse to send the correct command to the ships in each set of ten to keep moving the mining operation forward5 would it really matter if the owner of each account for each ship from one of the two sets of ten ships was at a movie or asleep and the ten mining ships went about efficiently reading their scripts while the afk player was not even in the same zip code as the computer sending commands to the ten ships6 would the description of behaviors in number five be fair to the ten mining ships whose account owner was present in the belt and without the entering of commands by keyboard or mouse to control each of the ships in the game and making decisions about the actions and movements of the ten shipsplease weigh in on the 6 scenarios stated above i believe it would be interesting
isboxer can still accomplish more than 10 multi boxed alttab accounts1 1 person with isboxer bomber squad can nuke complete fleets solo its impossible with multiboxing alttab2 10 isboxer ratting ships have an constant alpha strike equal to the gun cycling time its impossible with multiboxing alttab the result is a much more higher income you never will reach the damage output at all like with isboxer the factor rep ability of target is irrelevant oneshotkills with pressing a single key3 10 isboxer gate camping gang has a constant alpha strike equal to the gun cycling time logis in the enemy fleet can be useless because the have zero chance to rep anything with alttab delay reps are able to hold because the damage comes in lower4 you can combine different account onto the same screen with different tasks for example logis on the same screen tackle and alpha strike on the same screen tackle ecm alpha on the same screenyou dont play 10 individual accounts with isboxer you play 1 accounts with a factor 10
in reading the eula i found an interesting little piece an amendment alters a material term of the eula that is unacceptable to you you may as your sole and exclusive remedy terminate the eula and close your accounts by a clicking the decline button when you are prompted to review and agree to the amended eula by your choice of not accepting isboxer when ccp did the above may apply to youyour quoteyou dont play 10 individual accounts with isboxer you play 1 accounts with a factor 10 tells me you have not used or have very little experience using isboxer i rarely use it beyond logging in and moving a fleet and in moving fleets i have found some ships will arrive at a gate after i pressed the command for jump and id screwed up and left that ship behind when i finally counted ships and found i was one or two short they had followed my command to move to a gate two or three from the top of two different lists one in the system i just left and on in the system where i wanted and thought all the ships were i was navigating by memory and did not take the time to be sure each ships overview contained only gates i had a destination in each overview and i was sorting each overview by the gates when that happened to me and i to0ok a headcount of the ships arriving at a gate that was not so busy id often find the slow ship about 8 jumps away and blown to kingdom come i learned to over come that mistake so the increased factor you mentioned can also count the number of ways you can screw upim sure it works better for others who take a great deal of time in learning the nuances of its use but it is no piece of cake and certainly not a just a factor applied to an equation that is always goodthe bottom line seems to be not how many accounts not the length of time when one is pitted against ten ships with ten players or ten accounts with one player pushing buttons and moving a mouse to control the ships it is all about player to player ccp looks for equanimity between accounts not between players i can vote using each account i can petition using each account i am given a christmas gift for each account and each account started with 5000 isk and a crappy ship i can simultaneously mine with each account with or without using isboxer but i always have to be present and i always have to initiate each move any ship or module in any slot will take whether i am boxing or bouncing from window to window nothing about it is automatic i would not touch it with a ten foot pole if it wereof course you and every other player may do as you wish but i ask you to examine if it is jealousy that another player may be more productive or a true belief that isboxer violates the eula and tos even though it has had to be hashed and rehashed in iceland probably many more times than i can imaginei hope you and every one else who reads this finds success in your future endeavors and you embrace every advantage of every game mechanic that is acceptable to ccp dont ever tell me you are breaking the rules or let me see you breaking them or you will get a she ton of petitions about it
your comment and problems with different kind of ships doing differnet things shows me only that you have no clue about how to manage things and you are right your advantages with isboxer are very limitedbut anyways time to create a legal bomb squad
1 playing in window mode i can click in taskbar f1 repeat pretty damn fast and have last window be squad leader to warp squad a little timing and coordination is all you need2 and 3 can do same with drones4 proves youve not looked into isboxer isboxer performs the same mousekeyboard actions over multiple clients this isnt commands it is actions all overviews window locations hud locations sizes everything has to be identical or it wont work right therefore you cannot run tackle ewar and damage off the same screen because the actions to perform these commands are not the sameyes isboxer lets you control multiple identical ships from a single interface no isboxer does not give you an overpowered advantage if you make one mistake your cost for the mistake is multiplied the advantage you get is only slightly more than if you ran eve in window mode and spent 2030 minutes practicing your mouse clicks and keystrokes to perform the same actionsim sure ccp did not arbitrarily decide to let isboxer remain im sure a lot of thought went into the decision because no other software close to it is allowed add to all this the fact that you can dump a few hundred dollars into inexpensive hardware and get the exact same results surplus government computers are cheap and a simple google search will provide hardware ways to repeat the commands ps i personally dont use isboxer
because you could carry both and a mission runner and pvp frig for shenanigans the possibilities are one of the things that make me keep pushing this also for the pirate types imagine the tears of popping one and it dropping a fully fit faction bs or marauderi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about

really  you wanna tell me that you are able to do a complete squad bomb run in windowed mode  warp in as squad decloak throw bomb and warp out  hopefully the enemy has no light tackle otherwise it will be a one time job every second counts to leave the field btw how have you solved the problem that ships aligne away from the warp direction after landing when they get no command instant after landing  with moving targets and in pvp targets normally move every second counts every misangle of the warp in direction destroys your focused bomb damage you have with 10 player controlled bombers or isboxerbut yeah drones are not guns for a good reason be efficient use guns 10 accounts with a rof gun cycling time alpha are that what you get with isboxer nothing else nothing less without isboxer you have a hard time delay 1 second per account is realistic if you are well trained as you told us so 10 seconds to get back to the first account wow the first macharial has still shot 2 bullets but yeah  btw have you ever used drones for sniping gates  with tornados you can bounce around with drones you are sticked to a position with tornados you can fire on land with assisted drones holy crap you have first to assist them to the gunner with several mouseclicks ah no target is gone no assisted drone alpha needed anymore isboxer alpha from 10 tornados would be a wet dream in this situation to shoot full dps with every ship after seconds without any delaysame for rattingincursions nobody wants frigates in close range so best strategie is to blow them up in a single alpha on range switching costs time and the frigs get in close range because of all the delay isboxer is ony alpha shot at once boom boom boom tackle dead at rangeto get all clients identical takes 1 minute with all overviews chatchannels and so on and yes it is possible to create a new ui  i know people will scream again because it is only a cutted screen from different screens you can place everything you need on one screen and get the ability to do different tasks from different shiptypes just look the videos for incursion runner setups dps  logis same is possible for pvp same is possible for bomber squads  command bomber with probes rest dps  simpleand yes if you do a mistake alot of  can die  same like in multi box modus with alttab when you try to find your logis fast enough to get reps thats the only point without any difference hm okay its a lie for pve stuff you will use much more expensive stuff in pve with isboxer because it is much more saver to operate with only just one single screen with all different kinds of ships normally dps  logiabout hardware solutions it is an isboxer thread hardware solutions or other software is not really better but thats another topic
you failed to address any thing i wrote except an example of what happened to me when i thought multiboxing was as easy as you seem to thinki it is and then criticized my managerial skillsmy managerial skills are so bad that i can win a vanguard mission in lo or null with eight ships fitted for a vg incursion and a reserve fleet fitted for pvp standing off to warp in and run off or destroy any fleet which comes into the mission after i have started it i always scan and never go in to contest a site but will not be chased out of a site and never have beenccp seeks equality for accounts not people each of everyones accounts can vote in csm elections gets a christmas gift can petition can post likes on forums costs a plex to play got 5000 isk and a crappy shipyou continue to hold out the example of having a race between a single multboxer with multiple accounts and a single player without multiboxer with multiple accounts you are pitting player against player and not account against account your argument is as valid as complaining that your three accounts with rookie ships cannot win against three supers rookie ships are allowed supers are allowed and get your brain wrapped around this  multiboxers are allowed as long as they do not provide automation stored key strokes and alll the other things that come along with bots nothing happens with a ship in a multiboxed fleet untill a human presses a key or maneuvers a mouse bots operate from a script when the player is afk getting laid or on a waterski vacation in the persian gulfpit a multiboxer with ten accounts  ten ships against ten players with each having a single account and if all else is equal  training equipment etc the two teams of ships will basically accomplish the same amount in the same amount of time  they are equal because the multiboxer will be pressing one key at about the same time as each of the individual players will be pressing the same key if you take a single ship on a single account from the non boxer and from the boxer with the same assignment such as mine five veldspar asteroids in a full belt each account will perform nearly the same given they both have the same skills and ships and modules the boxer player using boxer commands will not have an advantage over the non boxer account as they will be pressing the same keys at about the same times add another player with single nonboxer account and another account belinging to the boxer and do the experiment again the two teams will finish at about the same time keep doing that and at some point the boxer account will not be able to perform as quickly as the same number of single player accounts each on a different computer even if the boxer has multiple computers which are comparable to each of the single player computers the boxer will eventually slow the hair you are splitting is not a hair for which ccp has a concern for how well it is splitit is time to stop using isboxer as the universal term for all multiboxing software it is like calling every computer an ibmthe op called for a an uprising of the csm against multiboxing but what has happened is the sound of crickets and many supporting multiboxing or ar at least not finding it in contravention with the eula are you familiar with the term ludditeoh wait you are a crusader fighting for eve to be played the way it oughta be played  according to youive already given you cordial wishes for god luck and happiness in another post which went unnoticed i guess so that is taken care of oh look don quixote a windmill
in theory you can but it would require weeks if not months of daily work to get it working well and even then a minor system lag missclick or any number of other things would break the setup so badly youd be forced into exiting and restoring the settings from a save folder i have a feeling this fellow knows this but cant be arsed to spend the time to even get a somewhat decent setup working or hed of done it already i wish him the best of luck with his bomber fleet because theres already whole threads on the isboxer forums trying to figure out how to make bomber fleets work its possible but you have to have save points already setup and hope your enemy is stupidthis is assuming that the eves ui doesnt decide to stick a ui element to your mouse when you click or any number of stupid things that eve tends to do the more clients you run the higher the chance youre going to get a screw up that desynchs the whole thing
yes yes you can its really not that hard with a little brainpower usagethere are actually plenty of other programs out there that do some of the same functions as isboxer none of them that ive seen do the exact same everelated tweaks that isboxer does which gives it a competitive advantage over our little niche
also thanks to this thread im now curious and plan on trying isboxer myself and seeing if i like it op if this thread was an attempt to make others not use isboxer i think it failed

ccp already have proper gms and theyre not snobby knowitallsso problem solved thanks csm
was just watching the match between gunnar nelson and zak cummings in the ufc and from the start of the matchit was aparent that the v from eve was missing and at the end of the match the eUFFFDs were hanging looseso it is my request that the csm pressure ccp to buy gunnar new shorts
good morning i was wondering what ccps thoughts are on the following1 one of the more interesting issues about the market is the inability to see who is selling or buying until after they purchased from you or after youve purchased from them any chance the ccp will consider it a little thing and put sellerbuyer title in the market information2 this goes hand in hand with point number one is ccp willing to give corporationsalliances more control of their own sov control markets by giving them the ability to ban individualscorporationsalliances from buying andor selling in their markets for example suppose you have a light blue alliance and while they are good at fighting they arent so good at controlling a few of their more industrialcarebear types who dont appear to be helping you out with their presence so you cut only those who have been abusing your friendship it makes sense that the corporation that controls the station would have the ability to specifically control who buys and sells
what problem will this fixwho will it help and how
it should be notedif ccp did add who youre buying fromselling to to the market its not like it would let you buysell with someone else you cant pick orders just buy from the lowest sell order or sell to the highest buy orderas for 2 block them from docking
heres reality and how it functions in any business that actually gives a damn about being around in 10 yearscustomers dont rule customers dont know anything customers are idiots you nod and smile correct them when they are blatantly wrong because doing otherwise will have them coming back and blaming you for the screwups they do because you said they were right and when they get pissy about your decisions you remind them knowing more about the subject than them is your job and they can either listen to what you say or go dobuymake whatever it is they wantneed on their own and laugh as they fail miserablymore on topic just because people whine doesnt mean ccp should throw all integrity or consistency with how they write and follow their rules out the window to appease the crybabies if someone has a problem they want solved they are free to do it within ccps existing ruleset in this the gms do fine they follow the rules to the letter to the best of their abilityof course the hilarious part of this whole thing is you think spending massive amounts of money on real  would change the outcome of anything since would still have to go to the gms who would go to whatever relevant head of whatever they need to clarify for if their is even anything to clarify just to tell the pointless representative that they need to parrot the response the gm would have given anyways
so which game mechanic did you learn about this week
crius bring the removal of slots along with reasons to move among systems to produce stuff teams give reasons for people to pull together into hubs in high sec most productioncentric systems have many stations with dozens of available offices this is not the same for nullsecwith crius our playerdropped outpost bonuses are changing amarr outposts now can be upgraded to give reductions in material efficiency due to the cost of upgrading outposts alliances will likely end up with a few production hubs because of the material efficiency bonuses the tier 3 and tier 2 would be factory and plant upgrades in whichever order is preferred for that system this leaves the t1 slot for a possible office upgrade this bring the number of available slots in an amarr outpost to 2626 slots for an expensive production system is simply not enough northern associates has 336 corporation goonswarm federation has 288 brothers of tangra has 225 pblrd has 113 provibloc has countless unallianced corporations active within their space most of these corporation are small groups of players or individual players with a need to utilitze a corp hangar i know im not the only player that uses an alt corp to manage multiple production pilotswhen crius hits and players in nullsec begin producing more goods locally were suddenly going to have a lot of reason to converge in a production system but will be incredibly limited by the number of office slots and managing blueprints for multiple pilots on the same account is an incredible headache without an office in your production stationcsm needs to lean on ccp to expand the number of available offices in outposts to accommodate the increase in local production in nullsec with the limitation of 1 station per system and a total cost of roughly 80 billion isk to build and upgrade an amarr outpost to t3 these outposts should come with more offices more offices also gives alliances a way to tax members which provides another form of bottomup income stream
im pretty sure that office slots in a world where there are no longer industry and science slot restrictions is something thats been said lately to ccp
hello ccp arrow i understand that it can take a long time for a big game such as eve to see changes being really added i can understand thatit seems that for some reason i thought you were more numerous in the ccp development team thats why without any feedback from the ccp or csm members i started to think that my idea to add the smart filters and the quick filter box into the overview has been forgotten sorry if i looked like a weeping dog 
cpp wont ban isboxer for simple reason that they dont give a hoot about the individual player scraping up funds to pay for one account they like the guy who pays for 5 accounts to win eve isboxer is cheating because you are getting an advantage over someone who isnt running it you can sugar coat it all you want and twist the words but one person controlling 5 or more accounts with one press of a button has an advantage
well that would be your choice which is important to have oddly enough i disagree with your sentiment i think if people knew who they were buying from they would likely be a bit more selective about their purchases maybe youll be more likely to purchase a product from a corp member over someone you dont know or maybe youll refuse to buy a cheaper product from someone you dont like because youre on opposite sides of the war or you just think hes a dnow you need that first part in order to effectively do the second as a station owner you should have quite a few tools available for dealing with various internal issues having the ability to ban pilots from either buying or selling or both in the local market would allow a station owner to have more direct control over what is available to the people wants it is all about choice and tools to make those choices
it will fix a strange lack of choice on behalf of players in deciding who they wish to purchase from maybe not a problem but it could be classified as a little annoyance
you cant choose who you buy from you can only choose how much you pay the order with the lowest sell price is always sold first regardless of the price you choose to pay if your idea went ahead the only way to avoid buying stuff from the person with the lowest listed price would be to go and buy from a different station
u basically can deny acces to station of u own sov its one of the perks over npc null or u work with pre fitted allaince contracts on ships even corp if u have tooi would as providence nrds love to tax by standing though so that guests pay more so tax by standing would myabe help u also
unless youre proposing a change to the market that goes significantly beyond show who each order belongs to the only way to be selective is to go to another station or not buy somethingto be clear it is not possible to select which order to interact with you always buy from the lowest sell regardless of which you select and how much isk you put in
i see what you are saying so shouldnt that be fixed as well
skelee your post is a bit sketchy so its hard for people to identify or help now it yells to me your frustrated but i cant help you since we dont know the content
say mynna arent you in the csm maybe you could
so whats the timeframe then crius hits tomorrow office revamp happenseventually there needs to be some kind of solution to bridge the time between
ofcourse we will the next csm council meet in iceland will focus on handling your request too the csm with the utmost priority in the mesntime maybe you can help with sowing some alternatives toghter lets the people off the eve universe vote over it snd show us the final results so csm doesnt waste any more time on more trivial things like the upcomming industrial release
gunnar nelson is one of the best p4p fighters on the planet in the biggest mma organisation there is there were 10000 people in attendance all chanting his name and hundreds of thousands of fans of the sport watching the event on tvit totally amazes me that the v was missing and that the es were falling off and i think this should be taken seriouslythe eve logo is in the prime position and sponsors will pay more for that with the rate he is going im sure that space will be bought by another company with more money and better glueyou get 5 seconds of the big banner that the corner men hold but a possibility of 25minutes with the shortsi dont think ccp know what they have with gunnar and i hope they put more effort in next time
nice one for a second i thought u ment local chat tabs alos nice but this one yeah also
excellent idea 1
i think it would be a better idea to allow the yearly remap to stack to at least one in reserve
why would they do that when this way they can just blow you off if there is a major problem in game issues i can understand being handled through petitions but major stuff they dont want to actually deal with i had a character stolen off of one of my accounts and all i was told is that nothing can be done missing character sorry nothing we can do wont even tell you how contact corporate and they just tell you to file a petition so that they can ignore you the bottom line is they wont do it because they dont have to they dont really care about you or your problems they just want you to keep playing i mean paying you leave and there are others in line behind you its not how it should be but thats how it is
ew drones are completely useless between stacking penalties durability issues and sig radius they are a complete mess in some cases the stats are so bad that they do not even make sense for example how is it that a thorax with a sig radius of 120 can hold 10 small warrior web drones that each have a sig radius 110 that is almost equal to the sig radius of the whole cruiser and this is just one example we end up with a drone that does almost nothing is very difficult to miss and can be destroyed very easilythese ew drones are in terrible need of a rebalance to make them useful and i hope you all will agree
1 default overview settings are terrible
1 not sure why many of the ships look like 2 different ships superglued together but this has always bothered me

pi alts is cheating having more then one account is cheating having more time to play is cheating having in game friends is cheating having a good corp is cheating reading guides is cheating using google to find game information is cheating having prior experience in the game is cheatingall of those are cheating according to you as those who have those things have an advantage over those that dontwelcome to life its never fair
the ganking community thanks you for your support
this was exactly my thoughtcall it a window but basically just have it load the exterior of the station with the station being the ship view unmovable but at least a view of outside no one could then block the camera haha and it gets people using wis for when it is eventually useful right now as someone pointed out it is 4gb of bloat on my computer and the client thank you for all the constructive posts and keeping this thread alive
one quit bullshitting there are a lot of empty null systems ive been in them over the weekend you just want new good isk systems with no one in them which is impossible as long as those systems are so deep in blue territory which they always will be that they can be safely farmed thus attracting the hordesnot only that but ccp has already stated their intention of playermade stargates with possible dynamic new systems at some point afterwards player made stargates being a confirmed incoming feature shortly after sov rework in a eayr or two with dynamic systems possible at some point down the road
the great wildlands are thataway 
adding space for the sake of space will not mean much tons of empty space out there  adding space that serves a purpose and adds to your game play is a different subject ofcourse like you mentioned there are a ton of ideas how such new space would look like some thigns poeple mentioned1 sub caps only2 limited inhabitants3 no local4 thunderdomesthemparcs5 to far to jump caps in no stations possible as no planet moons6 sleeper infested normal null space7 fixed incursion space8 jove910and so on the issue is investing in time and money versus pay off in both happy players and balance
simply adding more sov space right now would be to gift the existing 2 blocs with more space to rent outsome more npc space would be good though  the north badly needs an npc region equivalent to curse with loads of npc stations with clone facilities and easy access to empire mordus is an obvious candidate here guristas maybe as well although they already have venal far from empire few stations very few cloning stations
you have my full support ccp just grab whichever popular overview pack you like trim the fat a bit and set it as default
are you high ccp actively encourages multiboxing with their power of 2 program they obviously like the idea
next youll want to ban people for being better at you than this game because they have an advantage or banning people who have an iq over 50 because they have an advantageeveryone with more money power intelligence and willpower has an advantage over you but you dont see me complaining about it because i can
i like how eveybody on here thinks for me ans makes assumptions what are you goon pets i actually got my ship ship back only took 4 gms and some attention to detail i just dont like the way they communicate when you send a petitionaccording to eula  blah blah same thing everytimebtw i know my game mechanics and dont need help losing ships i lose them on my own quite nicelyhowever there have been a few times where i lost a ship and i know it wasnt my fault i have got some ships back nut its like pulling teathexample i lost my sb on my way to join a fleet when i was docking to get a mod the station shot me because i tackled a ship outside the station i sent petition with my log and loss mail cpp according to eula  there was nothing wrong on on the server side we will not reimburse however after reading the reply i said look at my ship i didnt have any tackle mods in my mids 2 weeks later i got my ship back  only took 2 gms and 3 mails back and forth all they had to do is look at my ship fitting first timethe last petition cpp are wrong but if nothing on the sever end i accept and take it like a man
to be fair your op smacked of ranting and that never goes over well on the forums hereoh well it has been resolved so there is no point in chewing you out furtherbut i will say this for future reference in lowsec any offensive mod weapon or not will cause gate guns to shoot if you use them first even if you use them defensivelypeople who operate mostly nullsec such as you sometimes forget thatfly dangerously

just wanted to add my support to this issue a toolfunction that enables players to seek out and destroy afk cloakers in systems the exact mechanics are not interesting just that this way of playing eve has a counter and that it has a risk attached to the award of afk cloaky camping systems
this is in balance because the risk which you perceive as being zero is being matched by the reward potential which cloaked players perceive as also being zeroin typical events no side has benefit or risk present with the exception of an error happening competition being based on one player making a mistake is stretching a bit too far i think since the bar to overcome is simply not screwing upyou cant really compete when your actions are meaningless without your opponent first having a failureto give either side more leverage you must grant balancing leverage to the otherupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
i disagree it is not in balance the reward is as an example denial of an enemy systems usage without any active playing all you have to do is log on after dt and then leave your computer for 23 hours until next dt rinse repeat for days weeks months without any active playing or any risk of ever beeing caught people can easily script that so they dont have to be at the compter to restart their clients probably they do this just look at how common it is that the afkcloakers log on just as the server goes up even though it might be in the middle of the night or the middle f the workday for some tzsi like hunting for ratters and hotdropping them thats fun i like counterdropping hotdroppers  even more fun i like that playstyle but i dislike the afk playstyle of system denial and that there is no counter to it dont want counters to cloakers that are playing actively no need for that its the 247 afk cloakers this game needs a counter toso i endorse the original post in this thread and lay my voice on the suggestion to add a counter to afk cloakers
you are pointing at an intangible element as the benefitthe benefit to the cloaked player being implied amounts to some sense of satisfaction which being intangible is difficult to measureit is not unheard of for players to possibly mount a fake threat in a system so that they can harvest the pve resources with no competitiontheir allies keep away and the hostiles see it as already camped causing both to move on for better opportunities elsewherethis socalled denial of usage relies as much on the defender as the hostile as the defender must do two things for this to occur1 credit the hostile with a threat at level x where x is the number of ships expected to support their attack2 by choice or lack thereof not match the perceived threat with a defensive response in space but rather remain in dockthe cloaked player whom you vilify here has no control over this and in demonstrated examples cannot even be verified as actually being present beyond an unmonitored game client logged in by an automated setupto use your example specificallyif you believe that you should be able to hunt and fight this cloaked pilot which i support you doing it requires an equal opportunity to be granted in the favor of the cloaked player for balanceupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
given the rmt potential of fixing it no
yep theres no more to say really
while i dont disagree that ewar drones need reworked i had to address thissig radius does not directly translate to actual size the game follows a great deal of submarine warfare principles that waymeaning that sig radius is about electronic footprint not actual size an electronic warfare drone is probably very messy for lack of a better term with its signal to noise ratio
no just remove wis from the client i could use the free hdd space
hi folks i guess id best start with a few disclaimers firstly i know that this concept isnt a new idea as such new ideas are rare and i am not very smart secondly i dont even know if this is a good idea it came into my head and its better written down than not so flame away of course constructive feedback is appreciated more than a single sentence rebuttal thirdly i dont have all the answers youre looking for this is a first sketch not some master plan i have been working on for several years thats just the way it goesthe current state of moon miningmoon mining occupies a peculiar aspect of eve its the sole source of t2 manufacturing conponents and is a rather passive method of obtaining them requiring the input of pos fuel in exchange for extracting a set amount of moon goo in return occasionally a rarer r64 or r32 moon is fought over but aside from that its a case of put in fuel take out goo so whats the issue with this why does this proposal have to happenwell to clarify this proposal doesnt have to happen its not going to save eve etc etc its just a cool idea of an alternative way to get moon goo which is as stated above in no way new the issues as i perceive them is that the obtaining of t2 components isnt accessible without military might being granted pos roles and running a pos in other words its a pain in the arse and inaccessible for your average line industrialist to approach t2 production forcing them into t1 production effectively which is pretty boringthe actual proposal bitafter a short period of thought its come down to this reduce the passive moon goo output by an amount this ensures that tower mining which would produce the majority of t2 components still is lucrative still given the potentially limited supply of goo create a new deployable module the moon mining hub unoriginal boring name im sure someone can think of a better onethis new module is anchored on a moon instead of a pos the module would allow the active mining of that particular moon however the goo would be extracted in the form of inpure goo that needs refining to get the actual moon goo specific moon goo cannot be targeted all the available products are extracted into the goo the amount of moon goo that can be extracted is of course limited by the adundance of the moons minerals prehaps abundance 1 would allow 15 times the amount of the goo to be extracted daily compared to when the moon is pos mined this creates some competition for the best moonsthe new module would allow the active mining of moons and would be limited to 2 per a system it would create a warpable beacon once deployed the structure would have a considerable amount of ehp and be reinforcable before being destroyed once reinforced the moon cannot be mined the module would be deployable in low sec systems and lower including worm holes the mechanics of moon mining of course moon mining deserves at the very least an appropriate mining module and prehaps a new ship after obtaining these the player must be within a certain distance of the module to mine the moon further than prehaps 50 km disrupts the moon analysis and prevents moon mining occuring then the player can target the moon and mine awayso i guess thats all i have to say i think its got interesting options for gameplay play anyways feel free to debate the numbers which just got shoved in there because point out how i just described ring mining word for word and post any links to old threads i couldnt be bothered to find and necro i hope ive started some fires going anyways fly safe

the sanshas nation wishes to expand its borders and 9hxqg is one of its targets they have set up a major base of operations in 3gd68 and are slowly destroying all opposition to their forces while their peons build their new starbases the biggest hindrance to their plans is in myw1v a gigantic mining colony along with a trading hub is located there and the inhabitants are extremely afraid of what might happen to them should sansha declare ownership of their solarsystem they have assembled a sizable fleet of amarr and ammatar ships to protect their assets and prevent the sanshas nation from expanding their sovereignty into 9hxqg
sir english is not my native language and i had problems understandinging what you meant im sorry i do nowi see your point here that the hunted afk cloaker that quite possibly has been at his grandmother for a full 2259 since last dt after having started up his afk cloaky alt in a system and thus not even is at home should also have a means of detecting that he is beeing counterhunted i can support that thats a good thing desireable that it requires the afk player to be active to detect that heshe is beeing hunted it should not be easily automated by outside scripts etc if you log on cloak and go afk while at your grandmothers there should be a threat to your ship if you stay at grandmother ie afk that threat should prevail until you start playing actively again beeing with grandmother should be a bit uncomfortable  in strict eveterms ofcbut absolutely some kind of indication of the counterhunt of the afk cloaker would be fine thats a good suggestioni dont see any need for hunting actively playing cloakers though i only see a need to hunt afk cloakers
cloaked  not in localsolves the problem
pppffftttttt seraph it is not that simple i wish it washowever on to other things looking at it from one element of the issue threat projection with the changes in isotope size and consumption cost has gone highso far from my experience this has not slowed down the larger blops fleets nor the mainstream alliance hot drops however where i am i do not have the opportunity to measure the effect on solo and small gang huntersas this change had similar suggestions in the beginning of this thread i hope that you seraph and nikk give your insight on the effect of this change on the subject or threat projection as it applies to cloaked pilots
yes yes it would how simple and crisp isnt that solution with that functionality afk cloaky gaming will have a possible counter opening up a new trade for antihunters leaving your alt permaafkcloaked in a system for months and months will not be totally riskfree as it is today i congratulate you on that superb idea and i hope both csm and ccp sees this clearly and implements it swiftly
you do understand that would make all areas of space very similar to wh space this gives an over atvantage to cloaked pilots who then can go where ever when ever with no risk of being detected making rather impossible to catch them except when they first enter a systempicture a shooting gallery where the cloaked pilot is the shooter and all pve ships are the little balloons on the wall waiting to be popped please understand i am not totally against this if you give an equal opportunity to the other side to be able to detecthuntdefend against this i would be ok however my good friend seraph only suggest removing local totally without a counter
i was beeing sarcastic as im sure our good seraph was too ie i meant the opposite of what i wrote im sure he was meaning the opposite of what he wrote too ie beeing sarcasticof course removing local has nothing to do with the problem of afk cloakers having no counter this thread was about cloaky gameplay removing local i suppose would be another thread somewhereeve online needs a mechanism for players to impose a threat to afk cloakers
ive been thinking about this problem for a while and one idea crossed my mind its beauty is in that it can to great extent preserve current functionality of main cloaking vessels still giving a potential victim solid chance to evade cloacked hotdroppers  if said victim is vigilant enoughthe idea involves creating of 2 modes of operation for covert ops cloaking devicethe first mode is very similar to what we have now  you can freely warp around and use any propulsion or purely defensive modules which dont involve locking targets but you cant initiate said locking until you stay in this mode even if you already uncloaked and sensor recalibration timer went off we could allow for locking environmental objects though to not disrupt such rescource gathering activities like exploration or mining you cant either use any cynoshural field generators even covert one or any weapon system in this mode you cannot be scanned down by any cloaker busting scan system this tread has came up within the second mode it allows you to initiate locking the same way you could do it under current game rules meaning after uncloaking recalibration timer starts and after it went off you can lock on your target sbs and blops dont need to wait for recalibration though you can also use both types of cynofield generators now but in that mode your presence becomes obvious to all pilots in dscan range 144au through new dscan indicator cloaking vessels detected in vicinity a humble orange lamp which lights up on pressing scan button if some cloacker activated 2nd cloaking mode nearby will suffice it wont say you neither distance to this cloaking vessel nor direction narrow beam and distance brute forcing techniques wont work here it also wont give you a hint about numbers of those cloackers or their ship types it just means that somewhere within 144 au somebody switched to 2nd cloaking modeother consequency of switching to 2nd mode is that you become a subject to any kind of cloaking vessels scan mechanics this thread has came up with so if you decided to go from afking to proactive playing you should expect your victim will try to find and get you and it wont allow you to be indefinetly afkcloaked and ready to hotdrop anyone anytime you want  if you afking in 2nd mode you are asking for free podjump to your clone stationtransition from 1st to 2nd mode should take some meaningfull time lets say 13 minutes and you will appear on dscan the moment you initiated it not the moment you completed it it gives enough time to vigilant victim to see something strange on its dscan and seek salvation while assailant is still in the middle of transition between those cloacking statesedited but it will be even more intresting contest if hunter could get some method of checking is his pray diligently scans her surrounding or not like some kind of radar system which registers any dscan attempts in dscan range dscan probably implies active radar system so it should radiate some energy that can be registered by other party lorewise so you can wait for some oblivious victim in passive mode just checking this dscan meter or you can study her dscan pressing patterns and find some holes in them in which you could switch to active mode and get herthis new feature could be made available only to inherently cloaking vessels and mb even only when they are actually cloacked like covops recons etc so hunter can register each victims dscan attempt but victim  cant
i really just have no sympathy for people playing the game for ratting im sorry i just find it impossible to have any sort of empathy and when anyone says wah wah someone is shooting me i cant find myself caring ive never really done pve aside from some basic lowsec belt ratting here and there waiting for a target to show up i just cant bring myself to care
the facts are such that world of eve offers only one solid source of ingame currency  pve ratting to be exact you wont get isks from mining roids or from relic sites it is where all isks come from in current age of srp many stoped thinking about where all those ships they spoon fed with are coming from and from which source come isks to buy them the answer is pve even if no one in your alliance do it it just means someone somewhere just did it for you he bought tools to do that from some industry corp paying them with isks he got from bounties and sleeper loot and those industrial corp bought moongoo from your ceo with that currency which allowed him to buy ships for srp to worksorry to chewing it down like that many seems fail to understand this trivia
no i understand industry and moon mining and all of that but to me nobody has a right to rat you get to rat if you can outsmart the huntersratters  preypvpers  predatorsthat someone is making it hard for you to shoot red crosses does not tug on my heart strings i dont care it isnt important player interaction is actual player interaction not this non sense to hamstring people that actually play the game and pvp
i think with current afk cloacking mechanics its too easy for predator to do its job this one i just cant get btw just look how negative are reactions of hardcore part of the playerbase to any other afk activitiy  afk mining afkhauling afk bonus seeding afk carrier ratting but when it comes to afk cloaking  blams dont you dare ever again1smells like hypocricy for me or just egocentrisminfantilism dunnoif you want to be a proud predator  than be it be active and ready to biteatk or to protect yourself if you victim will dare to come to your burrow if you want to hide in some dark coner in total security  than you should get rid of those claws you dont need them at least for the moment
ahh finally something we can agree onhowever i really wish you would put your knowledge of game mechanics and cloaky pvp tactics to answer the questions that have been put to you
fixed is the key word thereit suggest that it should be changed tbh i dont think it should be
why not
warrior sw300 has 25 shield 50 armour 60 hull 110m sigwarrior i has 64 shield 96 armour 144 hull 25m sigdoesnt seem right
no body else has ideas like this so that those that are stuck in station can do things
again afk cloaking is a symptom of local because when you show up people dock up in or warp to a pos so they sit there and wait until you dont care about local anymore thats the only reason nobody afk cloaks wormholes people pop in look for targets and hunt in effect you cannot hunt in kspace because of local
no this is only a halftruth afkcloacking is also a symptom of gankbear desease too gankbear is a pvp carebear that doesnt want to put any effort at all to search for targets and cant stay the risk to his reputationkb isk efficiencyvanityetc and because of that he will hang in local indefinetly untill he will find a target he can take down without any chance it will be able to fight back or run away  preferably playing in tz when it wont be helped by any allies then he will hotdrop gankbears wont afkcloak in wh because you cant hotdrop here and have to station your gankteam in this very system for first  what means you lose coverage for the second gankbear is also absolutely dependent on local and too afraid to act in an uncertain situation  which is dayly reality in whthats also shows while afkcloaking is another issue of power projection problem and must be attended if ccp really wants to give smaller groups some space to act in nulls afkcloaking gives almost all initiative to the attacker allowing him to choose the time most suitable for him the only way to combat it is to have some fast reacting support force which will always be ready to come to your rescue  which means you have to belong to or be in something big smaller entity cant do a thing about that aside from stopping all operations in the end some combintation of game mechanics which will make covert hotdrops harder to pull while allowing for scan those afkcloakers who dont play actively down will give victim and hunter some equality forcing both actually compete each with otherand by getting rid of local you wont solve a thing until you will give some substitution to players which allow them to protect them in some manner proactively if you just remove it you again will give all the initiative to the attacker which effectively will disrupt all smaller and even medium entities operations here wh dwellers are able to operate by placing so called eyes all over their place  which is horrible game approach imo  and as a result of logistical difficulties anyone willing to get them will face especially inability to hotdrop them anytime and you wont get any targets  because gankbears will still be there happily afkcloaking and ready to hotdrop the same way thay did it before but now with the last method allowing their victims little protection gone no one will be there to gank anymore aside from members of well organised powerblocks may bethere is no need to get rid of local to make fights come to afkganker actually make him scannable and you bet many will be delivered to your doorsteps  and thats actually the last thing those pips want to happeni personally dont mind if local is substituted for some advanced scanner which shows you some hints without getting you actuall info about anyone in the system  but only if this will really allow me to be warned about imminent threats and act accordinglythe real issue is not with local chat but with power projection and ability to easly initiate covert hotdrops at almost a zero risk for attacker in nulls afkcloaking and ease of jump drive travel in kspace are what makes it happen
i hardly ever rat either and when i do its to lure hotdoppers to drop me so we can counterdrop them im not so full of myself like others are in this thread that i look down on those that do rat let them play eve the way they want and let us others play the way we wanti want to open up a possibility for player to counter afk cloakers not because i want to rat freely but because i like to outsmart the hunters and i want their fancy ships in killmails if they are so stupid they leave the computer they should have a threat on themi admire thos who hunt actively thats a real sport but afk cloaking for weeks to make ratters careless is not to be admired at all thats just to simple and no sport at all gankbears  thats a brlliant term they risk nothing it requires no skills and no intelligence just some extra accounts of neutral alts that can light a cyno cloak and use a scrameve online needs a mechanism for players to impose a threat to afk cloakers period
for the sake of argument lets say you were given the means to hunt cloaked shipsand they gained nothing in exchange for losing this protected isolating modeyou see the player name appear in local you are now alerted to start your hunting tools in case they are cloakedyou are at a gate camp no i am not implying you can see the gate cloak but you know many ships use a cloak to evade campsit makes sense these cloak hunting tactics would be used herebubblecamps would become effective at stopping most cloaked traffica nulli t3 like an inty could still evade some bubblecamps but as a slower to align ship would be exposed far more than beforethey would be reduced in use as a result to the point of becoming trivial as a presenceonly an inty could slip by reliably as a nonsustainable threat that can be broadcast over intel channels inties rely on these channels not warning players in downstream systemsso the net effect would rely on the defending alliance screwing up by not placing bubbles with the cloak hunting tools and  or not sustaining an intel channel to guard against the possible remaining threat from intiesthe safety level operating pve within null sov would jump up creating a need only to maintain shepherds at gate camps their little pve sheep would then be safe from the bad bad wolvesanything cloaked assuming it got past the gate camps somehow could be cleared by simply seeing the new name in local and hunting it downremaining possible threat blobssince they are numbingly easy to report in intel they can be evaded just as easily pve assets become entrenched with null players only risking ships by choicewould this be your version of balancedupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
im sorry to intervine but what do you think about my piece which tries to tackle this particular problem with this approach cloackers wont lose their ability to cloak in total security they will lose only ability to attack out of total surprise as it will make cloacked hotdrops more hard to pull giving some time window for vigilant enough victim to react i would like some input on these as ive been thinking about the problem for a while toohere it is
we could even unbind this new indicatior from dscan range and allow it to light up if anywhere in the system somebody gone to 2nd mode attacker can benefit from it too  now victim cant even approximately tell how close he to her at any given moment he can be anywhere in the system or 10km from victims location
afk cloakers  thats what we are after not people flying cloaked ships actively there the current functionality is sufficient id say no need to touch that eve online needs a mechanic for players to impose a threat to afk cloakers a f k c l o a k e r s we want their fancy ships in killmails thank you
how about a gridwide doomsday that asks your permission to blow you up with a 60 second timer dont say no in time then you die
no sorry you dont get to have tools that make your ratting easier you want to deal with your attacker set up bait he hot drops you with 20 redeemers have your own guys on stand by to terms like gankbear doesnt do anything but try to shift blame
how about a recalibration of your sarcasmometer
hes referring to the fact that an ew drone would be blasting electromagnetic noise that would make it easier to target effectively making its signature radius larger a real world example would be the f22 whos sig radius for radars atleast is claimed to be about the size of a golf ball slap on a ecm pod and that radar signature would bloom dramatically
to one up this why not just have a clientside update that will mark the last know status of a drone as damaged or even better simply copypaste the last known shieldarmorhull of the dronei mean you could literally print screen that little block of the ui and paste it next to the drone in the bay and id be happy
okay let us adress somethingyour 10 vs 10 exampleisboxer fleet no command calls needed because you as fc will do them by yourself zero time delay for aligning locking shooting warping whatever  fire is always an alpha in the same server time frame it is not delayed between the accounts so no chance to place a rep cycle for the enemy logistics same for logistics  you can group all reppers onto a single button to get max reps in the same server time frame the rate of fire is ecaxtly the roi of your guns  highest possible damage for the complete fleet10 people fleet time delay because the fc has to tell 9 people the command and broadcast targets or alignment points there is a time delay for every pilot of some seconds server will add some time because of the server time frames fire command is always delayed somebody is pressing the button at zero somebody else a second later the third 11 second later and he ends up in the next server time frame equal to 2 seconds fourth guy has a  ping because he lives la and the fc has pressed the button at 1 seconds fire is delayed over four seconds  enough time for a lucky rep cycle your roi depends on the people and is delayed for the resons aboveyour example looks really equal to both but yeah keep explaining me that such things are equalbtw you shouldnt be to sure with your interpretation with the eula ccp will never tell you that a third party software is fine with the eula if you dont belife me just open a petition
no they actually dont bots use stolen credit cards and make fraudulent purchases costing ccp money if you werent a complete idiot and actually did your homework youd already know that
if you have to scrape funds together to play the game then you had really best rethink your life priorities

i love this concept it makes all the bullshit small fights defending your system actually consequential provided you win a majority of the encounters you could literally farm gankers to increase the sovereignty of your system it also creates an united alliance incentive to protect ratters and miners from hotdroppers as they not only protect the current sovereignty level but they also could score big if they hit a big hot dropping fleet if theres a way to make ccp follow this thread by god ill find it
that was meant to be quoted for the last person that replied to me
i agree there should not be tools in the game that make certain activities easy or easier you are perfectly right there and where such tools exist in the game that make life simple and easy they should be changed so that the easy part is countered with a certain amount of hardship and risk possible for other players to impose such an existing area today in the game is afk cloaking that is so easy my 5 year old son could handle it he can start the client hit the cloakbutton and then play with his lego the rest of the day and thus performing a rather perfect afk cloaing activity he could go on doing that for ever and ever and ever just like a gankbear 5year olds like to repeat simple things as you know again again he is just brilliant my 5 year old son and could easily be one of the best afk cloakers in this game the competition is not so maturehahai just cant find it in myself to admire these gankbears whats to admire really its so simple it does not belong in eve onlinethe people who should be admired are those who use the more difficult ways of performing hotdrops  cloaky scouts to actively seek out their preys they fly around using the dotlan or eq map looking in the systems with the most rattingactivity they bombrush systems to catch dazed and unaligned ratters in belts they log of in system in a hub waiting 30 minutes and then log on again trying to catch guys that dont pay attention to intel they use spies to scout out ratters and then log on their cynoalt they scout out transport routes and map their opponents work and then place warp bubbles between the pos and the station to catch lazy freighterpilots that are so rich they dont care anymore and never change their way of flying thes admireable hotdroppers are hard to catch but if you try hard you can outsmart them but it takes effort skills intelligence and time and thats what makes it fun to hunt those guys but afk cloaking is for 5 year olds simple has no place in eve online gankbears have a too easy lifeyou guys that oppose this suggestion you are free to have your oppinions but i sense there is no real substance behind your arguments other than you despice ratters and dislike a splendid term gankbear by trying to argu that it shifts blame really seraph really or you ridicule the suggestion by saying we should have a systemwide doomsday etc etc these are all signs that you have no real arguments you squirm and troll your way around the suggestion that would require you to actually play eve online and use intelligence while playing i find that highly amusing bring moar tears pls rattertears are beautiful i love them but hotdroppertears are magnificient i want them also ingame plsif we are to have a more sound discussion could you describe in what way afk cloaking is essential for your hotdropping playstyle why could you not be succesful using the more challenging ways i gave some examples of above im sure you can continue your hotdrops without afk cloaking it will only require a bit more wits because we will hunt you not only when you play intelligently using the means seraph described above but also when you play eve without actually playing eve the way a 5year old could play eve  when you afk cloakeve online needs a mechanism for players to impose a threat to afk cloakersyour turn gankbears sound arguments please or moar gankbear tears
one more time for you very simpleafk cloaking exists because local exists if i show up in your system you dock up or come in a ship a soft low tank cloaky ship cannot fight
no you have missunderstood me i want afk cloakers to have a risk of losing their ship i dont see any need to touch the existing ways cloaks work as you describe that would disturb the balance only afk cloakers nothing else if you are actively flying your cloaked ship around in system and between systems my suggestion is that works as it does now no changes needed but afk cloakers that log on cloak up and then never touch their client for hours upon hours until directly after next dt when they log on cloak up and so on thats despicable to easy has no risk to it and should be changed by ccp so we can hunt them down and destroy thema f k c l o a k e r s  cant stress that enough afk
i soak up those metatears greatfuly thank yousorry serpah i dont see the arguments here either i want to know how a little risk to your afk cloaked ship would be so dangerous dont you agree it is totally riskfree today dont you agree that eve should have risks to all situations you just dont have any sound arguments to why there should be no counter to afk cloakers it amuses me enormouslyi want to be able hunt you when you leave your soft low tank ship afk cloaked i want you to see that im looking for afk cloaky ships and be able to force you to actively play i take a risk in hunting you because you will have a cyno and if you know i will hunt you you will use other ships that can withstand a bit of a beating so your cyno can live long enogh for you to bridge in someting that suprises me you might be tricking me by faking beeing afk when in fact you have 24 blackops waiting i want to have that adrenalinekick when i light my cyno and we see who has brought the best fleet in for the fight would it not be splendid gameplay the ultimate pvp we all risk something and much fun will be hadif you are flying that low tank cloaky actively fine with me i dont want to be able to find you if you need to go to your grandmother safelog in a safespot off scan but afk cloak  there should be a risk to itgankbearing is not playing eve its 5year olds gamestyle and you have no arguments against it just stating the obvious it is this way because it is this way i want to change the way it is because there should never be any riskfree playing in eve i do want to change ship when you come in a cloaky ship but i want to change to a ship that can hunt you down if you afk cloak there should always be a counter to everythingeve online needs a mechanism for players to impose a threat to afk cloakersargumnets seraph arguments
ok while you did not say this directly your response has indicated the key element of this issue is intelyou want to know that the cloak equipped pilot is actually online and attentive not simply connected to the game while their name is still persisting in local chati would go so far as to assume that since you seem to be asking for this awareness you also feel you are entitled to knownot yanking on your chain just pointing out a detailthe problem with this tactic is that pve players use it in reverse and your request would empower them in two ways1 fake predator  scarecrowi mentioned already that it is a tactic usable by pve players to fly a kite if you knew that a hostile showing in system had to be active you would at once either retreat or reship into a combat craftthe real owner your socalled buddy who is blue or green to you in a pve ship is claiming they know a detail that lets them avoid combat or they are so good at fighting that they survive they are isking up mining and ratting while you avoid the same to be safe and depending on context they can take your share of the isk doing itlimited spawns or limited amount of high value asteroids2 the pos sitting pve player waiting for local to cleari cant say how many times i have seen booster alts or others sitting in a pos for hours or days on endthese guys stay online numbing hunters to their presence this way and go active when it looks safeunless a hunter actually sees them at a npc spawn or roid field they can easily assume they are parked as usual at the pos and move on without delayknowing a hunter had to be active would mean that they had even more opportunities to stroll out than before boosting the success and participation of this tacticupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
this boosts the intel regarding threat levels on one side without giving anything meaningful to the otheryou know they are effectively afk if you cant scan them and for the near trivial effort of repeat scanning every minute or so you can be warned before they can sneak up on you toothe owner of the cloaked ship cannot remain in hunting mode indefinitely while cloaked as even a simple presence lamp can let the dscan triangulate you down and lock you given enough time like say the amount of time an afk player is at work or asleep even if they had their ship moving it would still be in either a straight line or an orbit around an object on gridboth can be compensated out if patient and these players would have nothing better to do since pve would feel unsafeupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
i think there are many ways to make afk cloakys possible to find that would not let the hunter know if the afk cloaky is afk or not also naturally the cloaker should be able to see heshe is beeing searched for unless heshe is in fact afk that would be a bit weirdas for the possitting interdiction nullified belt botter like we have in fountain reported many times without ccp caring i agree they should be delt with and should have no benefits there are obvious ways to handle that in a game design aswell
it would not matter if you knew they were afk since the perception and effect on the cloaked players side would be that they had to leave if they could not compensate for the tactics hunting thempausing pve activity briefly is trivial to enough players that this would effectively neutralize cloaked threatsthe cloaked threat becomes insignificant when it is not practical to sustain in this contextsince neither small groups or large blobs of pvp combat ships are practical to threaten pve assets in null thanks to gate camps and intel channelswhat remains if the cloaked ships cannot manage a sustained presencethe net effect of reduced threat to pve play in null will make the game less interesting thanks to less interactionhow will ccp balance the peaceful systems so that players find them interesting to play inoh i am not talking about someone bottingi am talking about someone afk sitting in a friendly system so that a hostile that patrols will get used to seeing them listed in localafter being seen repeatedly and tracked down to sitting in an invulnerable pos each time the hostile becomes more likely to ignore that name in local when they see it next timethis gives increased reaction time to the pve player should they actually go active and represents a possible intel channel reporter blowing the cover of the hostile as wellthese two aspects make pos sitting a tactic for adoption by afk players like the flip side of the cloaking tacticupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
once again  the game needs a mechanism to allow players to impose a threat to afk cloakers why should there exist a riskfree play style that allows people to hide safely wihtout playing actively for days and days weeks and weeks if you want to hunt ratters even today you wont get the alert ones you will get the lazy inactive and unintelligent ratters and the afk ratters keep on killing them by all means  you will have the same effect without afk cloaking though there is no need for afk cloaking in the game it promotes the same playstyle as the ratters use its despicable and those using it should have a risk of getting caughtthere are no doubt other mechanisms in eve online that would need an iteration or two like safeposes etc but the subject of this particular thread was cloaky gameplay and i think afk cloakers should not live riskfree i want them to play actively or stand a risk of loosing their ships
but you are not offering anything as a balance aspect for this increased chance of losing the cloaked sides shipsthis situation is often viewed as a stalemate for a very good reason neither side makes any progress against the other and both remain intact as a resultyou want one side to exclusively have a disadvantage hereas such that would shift the balance in favor of the other sideif we wanted null sov to actually be a safe place to pve we would have gates that actually lock and block out entry the same way a pos has a reinforce timer a blob could break through it the same waythe game makes it harder for hostiles to penetrate sov null space not impossiblechanging things as you describe would make this even harderupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
so you yourself admit you want to shoot afk pilots and you are calling others gankbears look who is talking
what dark drifter said 1
in reality theres unexpected delays because individual clients lagged without you realizing it so part of your fleet warped off properly and the other part is in a different system now or even better one or more of your clients bugged and stuck the overview to the mouse happens a lot sometimes throwing off your entire ui till you can log off all your clients restore settings from a backup and then log back in and resetup each client or while you were panic fighting you accidently clicked a little too far up so your overviews are completely out of synch resulting in part of your fleet shooting yourself you wonder why youre suddenly taking so much damage the only way to avoid that is to use the in game tagging system while making all movements slow and precise which at that point youre slower then a normal fleet in delayssometimes it can be a pain to just warp your fleet through highsec the unreliable nature of ccps ui and the unpredictability of systemisp lag can cause a lot of problems with repeatersjust once more in case you missed it you cannot move quickly with an isboxer fleet if you do you will have issues as clients desynch when youre playing only one account you can issue commands many many times faster without worry trying to do that with an isboxed fleet is suicideunless of course you dont tag and your overview decides to be silly even when you sort them properly clients will desynch even in vanguards i find some of my ships shooting the wrong romi randomly in an ideal situation yes you can do perfect alpha so can player fleets via the same methodi have no idea what program you are using to put all your reps on one button that sounds like an illegal macro program anyway the logistics comment is irrelevant as i have a nkey rollover keyboard that allows me to press as many buttons as i want at the same time i can hit 7 reps at the same time without any program if you have anything resembling a real time delay then your fc and fleet is bad bad bad tsmumbleventjabber and more allow for almost instant communication if youre using tags youre just as fast as an isboxer fleet with none of the risksfire command is just as delayed as with the isboxer setup above since shooting yourself is bad and stuff the rest of your complaint is irrelevant as youre assuming the isboxer player has a magical computer with no system lag with a magical connection next to ccp while you give the non isboxer fleet a bunch of handicaps
i offer afk cloakers to not be afk and play actively as a tactic to avoid beeing detected and killed i offer them the existing functionality of safelogging when afraid of the imposed risk of afk cloaky detection i also described a potential trick of pretending to be afk while not being afk where much exiting gameplay could be had countercountercounterdrops  and finally there is no need in the game for afk cloaking you can reach any of your goals by the multitude of other tools available allready in the game it just requires that you are active and not afkyou seem to mix up cloaked with afk cloaked i dont see the need to change anything in the game concerning cloaked functions only there is a need for a mechanic in eve online for players to impose a threat to afk cloakers because there should be no riskfree way of hiding for weeks and weeks by only logging on and hitting cloakbutton after dtand seraph  your consistant lack of arguments amuses me greatly you have absolutely nada that supports your aversion to the suggestion other than the potential threat to your current riskfree playstyle your fear of a fight shines through and you squirm and troll more and more thats hillariuosly fun
really doesnt mean much coming from some nullbear in fa whose pvp experience is orbit anchor lock primary f1 so being afk cloaked which btw someone thats afk cant harm you is bad because no one can get you but being afk in station and completely safe is ok honestly lets just speak the truth here you want to do your pve in peace if you wanted to fight cloakers youd set bait and fight them there is no way to interact afk cloakers without messing with cloaking to the point where its crap why should all the advantages go to the big guys with the stations defending give the little guy a chance to pick his fights before you can blob him
these gankbear tears are the best ive had for a long while you should do your homwork betterso seraph once again your arguments are based on nothing the suggestion comes from someone who can not pvp and therefore is not worth anything says the guy who afk cloaks up i am part of svea rike the largest allswedish nullsec pvp corp in eve we love to pvp be it in smallgangs or coalition fleets and we are very active blobbing absolutely thats fun too if we are good or not is up for others to decide we dont brag or think high of ourselves and we certainly have lots to learn you are welcome to visit us and well have nice fights anyday without blobbing maybe you can teach us to afk cloak seems extremely difficultas for ratting  no i dont its boring when i need isk i markettrade i dont care for the small or big guys i want eve to be full of risks and ways for players to go after eachothers but actively not afk cloaked up in a system for a week or two unintelligent gameplay like that should have a high risk attached to it in what way does the removal of that hamper the small guys or are you just afraid a pvpnoob will kill your sb when you eat at grandmothers thats pathetic as for safeness in stations you have a point there should not be any safe places in eve but this thread was about cloaky gameplay im sure there is a thread for that somewhereand afk cloakers cant harm thats stating the obvious again i dont mind getting harmed you do mind getting harmed though but why shoud there be such a safe way and why are you so afraid of some risk if you are so good at pvp as you imply why not just safelog or play actively instead no you are a gankbear afraid your 100 safe playstyle will be removed and that you will have to work to get kills and you dislike riskseve online needs a mechanism for players to impose a threat to afk cloakers seraphs lack of arguments whine they can dock whine you cant pvp but i can by staying afk cloaked without risk for weeks whine tears whine etc proves this in it self
where is the increased risk to the pve playeryour suggestion does nothing more than increase the chances a cloaked player could be shot at by a more capable opponentor they could leave if they cannot maintain a level of defense requiring active playthe consideration that they came to attack pve assets is not only disregarded but set back considerably as a potentialwhen i jump into an exhumer i do not want a science fiction version of a farming gamei feel that the idea that the only defense is to have pve players avoid or be spared contact with cloaked play diminishes both sidesupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
only the afk player should have that risk not the active cloaky playeras i have described before this would also open up a possibility for players to act afk when they are not there will be a continued and new risk for the pve player if heshe opts to search for that afk cloaker that has been sitting in the best ratting system for 3 weeks not that i think the type of ratter who fall for afk cloakers is the type of player that would go after said afk cloaker but for the sake of argumentthe players that gets killed by afk cloakers are the same people getting killed by any type of surprise attacksganks in eve allready today adding a risk to afk cloaking will not change that and all afk cloakers would have the same number of kills anyway using other tools but the fact that you can log on and hit cloak once every 24 hours and be perfectly safe for months is not a sound game mechanic as it promotes unintelligent and lazy gameplay without any risk said i would not suggest any concret mechanism as there are others better at that than me but lets try to make this more specific why not a specific probe launcher with specific probes that would hamper any pve ship fitting making it silly to fit  forcing pve players to reship also the probes would take loong time to finish scan maybe like moon probes or worse they would not be effective on cloakers that warp around they should be easy to detect on dirscan ofcthe common hotdropper or cloaky pilot could easily aviod these probes by playing actively moving around regularly but not to often maybe once every 2030 minutes if grandmother calls and offers lunch the acive cloaky pilot safelogs out of scan or repositiones to another safer system the afk cloaker would risk getting caught while asleep after that enormous lunch at grandmother in the middle of his tz nightthere is no such thing as a free lunch even at grandmother where lunch is free you have to listen to grandmother and risk your 25 m isk sb because in eve online afk cloaking should be subject to a certain risk
this is entirely disingenuous the only question i have remaining is whether you are aware of itpve players in sov null where this has impact are only relevant to being affected by afk cloaking if they avoid all attempts at combatif they are interested in fighting or simply not afraid to operate with a hostile for whatever reason the cloaked player has zero negative impact on themthey often want that hostile there to spice up an otherwise dull asteroid or npc grindkeep in mind the foundation of this game interactionwe make isk so that it can be spent on advancing our interaction and as such is considered as a valid target for other playerswhen you put in place something requiring preparation that preparation becomes translated into leverage against your opponentsyou have the bigger ship with the better weapons and the more powerful ammunition this gives you an advantage in the fightyour opponent is also seeking an advantage so if they know you are saving up isk to kill them more effectively they are allowed and encouraged to stop you if they cansov null space has player supported protections in place extremely effective ones at that which has led many players to the wild assumption that they must own the space with their name on itall they own is the right to lock out the nonallied players from docking in certain outposts or building a pos locally that is itthis leverage is very successful because other players must rely on staging outside of this controlled areathen to reach the controlled area they either need massive forces to overcome gate camps or clevernessmassive force or blobs cant reach pve targets as is obvious they simply leave before the massive force can reach themas eve is not simply a blob vs blob game but a very complex set of options for both sides threatening your enemy and hurting their means to build ships and weapons is a needed tacticif we neuter cloaking tactics further than they already are we will entrench even further the big blocks in sov as only blob vs blob tactics will remain on the tablei believe this to be bad for the gameupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
want to know something funny i dont really afk cloak but if you do get rid of it i suppose nullbears like yourself hidden behind dozens of blue systems blue allies and blue stations will be safe from a big bad bomber pilot because they probably wont want to fly out 70 jumps into 00 only to watch you dock up the ability to be afk while cloaked is necessary because they need to have timing to fight you a bomber is a soft target that can only deal with other soft targets again you just want to do your carebearing in peace and it is you who has no argument something needs to be done whine whine whine set up bait learn to pvp
this is in no way meant to be a UFFFDfix nowUFFFD post probably none of these ideas are new but i think itUFFFDs important to keep them in talkone of the favorite arguments to why 00s population is not higher is most of the systems are junk that is a true observation most of the systems in 00 have low truesec and are therefore limited to what they can yield in terms of rats and ores the things your 00grunt is making his living withthe plea to change 00 mechanics to make those systems more viable is usually the UFFFDmoreUFFFD approach the systems needs better rats and better ores otherwise people canUFFFDt make enough money and will not live there ccp tried this approach in 2010s dominion expansion with the introduction of infrastructurehubs and sovupgrades upgrading your system increases its yield in terms of more anomalies and more orebelts it created a system that mainly produces junk having 40 anomalies in a system is pointless when you only want to pick 2 to fly again we plead for UFFFDmoreUFFFD more havens more sanctums and the plea was heard again when hubs become a decent third option for the lower truesec systemssince then many development cycles have passed and at some point ccp will have to tackle 00 and sov again and i would like to advertise another way we need UFFFDmovementUFFFD a system where you try to make everything equally good has no movement in it when your resources are endless stagnation becomes unpreventable as everyone becomes content with their share of the resource distribution nullsec needs to become fluid again and to do it resources need to become fluid not only moon minerals a powerful conflict driver in the past but also resources the 00grunt has available to himunlocking truesec is an important step in this a system that has seen little to no activity in it will increase in truesec until it hits 10 increasing the amount of value you can harvest from it a system that has seen major activity over a period of time will drop in truesec until it hits 00 this goes against completely against the system that is currently in place which increases yield the more you are active in the system it resembles more the situation in wormholespace where anomalies donUFFFDt respawn instantly and a system that has seen no activity will have a lot more anomalies available and by now some people probably think that i want to nerf everything until 00 becomes a desolate wasteland with a few gold nuggets inbetween but i havenUFFFDt put a single digit to any of the variables all i said was about a change in mechanics leaving it open what a 00system should yield compared to a 10 my personal opinion is that one system should feed more than the 4 ratters in sanctumshavens but this would require a pve overhaul that i donUFFFDt want to be discussed in this topicforumdefense aside a fluent resource system gives you many options for example you could exploit the land for everything in a short amount of time and then move on to the next or you could stay and manage the systems truesec amongst your space possibly giving you increased efficiency compared to the hit and run method it cuts out expected income from moons if you get unlucky and donUFFFDt get enough from moons you either have to periodically conquer more moons which comes with cost of war or start cutting corners in general making the resource system fluid puts pressure on people to move with it the mechanic itself should be independent from sov a new sovsystem could increase efficiency or dampen effects but it should not stop depletion of resources by spawning new onesof course this mechanic does not destroy the rental empires and huge 00 blobs and a huge empire feels the effects of the system a lot less than a smaller regional power but i donUFFFDt think resource mechanics are a way to break the blobs if you take the resources away from them you wont have anything left for the descendants to work with when the dust of crumbling empires settles anyways dealing with resources in 00 is half of the job it closely connects with sov and i hope ccp tackles both subjects
if u run run on your own merits rather then pointing at others acuse them of things u know little about run on strenghts of the things u represent rather then point fingersi am a first time csm member and am certainly not goon nor n3 affiliated i am highly impressed how the current csm members from blocks represent eve and its future i see goon csm members promoting changes that would them no good in the shirt term but benefit a game as a whole i see them debate hard work hard i see csm members spend countless hours on thr past crius change crunching numbers spreadsheets working for a change focused on industry as a platform for eve s future with seagull ponting at changes in null sec i can tell you thr amount of open ideas block or non block arr all focused on eve s future not what block u came from a dead eve holds no blocks not even pixelsdont reform for the sake of it run cause u represent people and ideas that a majority feels u represent best then u get votesgoodluck on your campaign
this could really change how pvp is handled in eve defiantly worth looking into
i have to say i agree with isboxer being advantage to one guy over many having an alt booster or two thats fine yet even there people talk about on grid boosters having alts mean you have to alttab to other window or have more screens to use those alts having isboxer is just too easy this is multiplayer game what is the point having massive multiplayer game where one guy can have 10 characters with almost perfect sync and therefore for others the whole multiplayer effect is kinda deletedits not that bad yet but imagine if there would be a corp and it might happen sooner or later where few people would isbox 20 characters you chould have 200 man pvp fleet with just 10 people running it i dont know how about you but i play games so i can pvp and i dont like the idea of being in a fleet with other people all of them dedicating theirs free time to a game they love and yet they can get smashed by one guy simply because of a programwe all understand that ccp likes money they are a company after all but ive played quiet a few mmos and all mmos with botting or multiboxing were by a lot of players ive met considered bad not worth theirs time because there is no meaing to play against something when you stand almost no chance when i started to play mmos most people didnt have alts and than it was growing and growing changing some games ive played by that a lot towards more farming and solo like games like i said now there is not so many of them but if it would grow isboxers will probably become a problem which wont help ccp attract new players at all it would most likely deter them from playingeve is known for a wonderful and live universe with many possibilities for big fights for politics economy etc let it be known for that in the future as well and not for one guy rolling over many with just few clicks
thanks forums for killing my responsesyou agree because youre a dumbass because you  like many others  assign multiboxers magical properties and lack of handicaps that are present for everyoneaccording to you a normal person is handicapped by lack of synchronization lag system unresponsivness latency issues random disconnects random socket closures client crashes and plain old missclicksmultiboxers using isboxer however are safe from all those things apparently and they win battles with a single click well its not that simplehave you tried isboxer with 26 toons so you can rightfully claim its too easy  if you have tried and found its not instant plex pinata then youve already failed in your wrong assumption that isboxer is the magical wand that transforms your legion of accounts into an active and coherent contribution to the bad aspects of this game  if you havent then youre talking out of your arse see abovethe point of having a massive multiplayer game is so multiple people from all four winds can geet together and do fun things even us multiboxers like to get together mine in supermassive fleets and do other stuff that people like you just dont understand and our dedication and hard work is well rewarded and we pay ccp the same as you do one plex per account its not like we get chars with bazillion of sp and free of charge we have to skill them up just like you do facing the same problems everything in eve costs isk and since theres just one toon actually providing the funds guess whatwhy do you think its going to be bad there are whole corporations and alliances out there who are built out of just people who multibox toons and there are fleets out there not necessarily pvp since multiboxing isnt as rewarding in pvp as it is in industryminingpi consisting of 200 characters with reality of only 10 people behind them and why is that bad have you seen the size of the universe eve is based in have you even explored it towards its edges over 50 of so called claimed space is empty and devoid of life nobody forces you to hang around us who multibox go out there make a glorious time for youself or your friends nobody is preventing you from carving out your own piece of destinysaying youve played quite a few mmos and saying you havent encountered multiboxing is talking out of your anus ive played multiple mmos and wherever multiboxing was permitted ive done it so have othershowever people who multibox by using isboxer or not dont dissuade new players from continuing to play its the underdregs of society in eve  lack of a helping hand on the side of eve that does that quite well funny how multiboxers are blamed for deterring new players but none of that blame is put at the feet of scammers thieves pirates gankers and awoxersi have a feeling youre butthurt becuse you by yourself arent willing to dedicate so much of your free time and money to have a fun and better experience at this game and that makes you angryquit whining and learn to play
i said i have encountered multiboxing and mostly only people who think its ok is the people doing itnow thieves pirates scammers gankers and awoxers are in real life as well yet they cant clone themselves to whatever numbers they wanti think you seem to feel threaten by people who do not like what you are doing your easier way of making isks pvping etc and i dont feel butthurt im simply stating my opinion ive never liked too much multiboxing since ive seen it can make bad changes to the games ive played i bet if id be using isbox id be fine with ti and defending it as you dops if by learning to play you mean use a program which can make me do the same as 10 or more other players thats not learning how to play thats learning how to cheat the multiplayer to play it solo no thank you
its blatantly obvious that you and some people in this thread have never tried to use isboxer you really should try it some day i guarantee youll find the reality of multiboxing to be nothing like the fantasy put forth by you and others like you hoursdaysweeksmonths are spent setting up uis tweaking settings overviews and control schemes the frustration of realizing that a window stuck to the cursor on one of the clients despite everything being pinned the joy of lag causing one or more of your cursors to be off target the joy of sending half your fleet the wrong direction because you clicked a little too quickly the realization that you have to do everything much slower then normal so you dont end up killing yourself horribly etcetcetcif you want to have a real discussion about isboxer and other repeaters you first need to acknowledge the reality of their usageedit  btw my first real mmo was trade wars and even in that game people had alts every single game ive played online has had alts youre deluding yourself if you think that alts are a new thing or that they are a problemif you really think that alts are causing games to focus on farming then you really are new to the scene try playing uo or lineage2 or any number of old school mmos everquest was called evercrack for a reason those were real farming games and guess what eve is from the same era
guess what i played lineage 2 and ragnarok online without alts for a long time i made them only because everyone had them and therefore i couldnt find any support characters to level with and sure i had groups of people i played with but many of them were finding solo with alt better im just not a fan of many alts and multiboxing nothing can change my mind in this matterand no i wont try something i dont want others to use  though ive seen plenty videos on it have read some stuff and met couple isboxing fleets and alts are not new thing today but when i was playing back than only few people had them than it spread and ive noticed the changesand btw if isboxer would be so bad to use and you would lose your fleet sending it wrong way why would people use it because it doesnt happen as often i guess as huge isk income or very unfair pvp but i guess today pvp is player vs program
leveling in lineage 2 without a buffbot was stupid fortunately there were plenty of prophets and such who were willing to sell their buffs in leveling areas ro on the other hand was easily playable with no alts but yet many many were made in ro the support characters were stupid hard to level solo same for lineage 2 in those days so unless you have friends or a good guild you wouldnt run into many leveling solo hell my guild on chaos had guild support characters that trusted members of the guild could log in on at any time usually hocus magebarddanceretci knew people with 10 accounts in the first years of eve just because you didnt notice them andor didnt know what to look for back then doesnt mean they werent therei watched videos and read many a website on brain surgery does that mean i can operate on you now watching and reading is one thing but actually doing is a whole other experienceisboxer has many downsides but generally i can work around them well enough to keep my stuff alive then again i can almost play my fleet without the usage of a repeater the upsides are strong though such as superior client resource management and suchas for pvp an isboxer fleet is at a disadvantage in almost every situation as long as the non isboxer fleet isnt being absolutely stupid as for unfair pvp well thats the goal of almost every single pvper out there people dont really want a fair fight they want the illusion of a fair fight that they win some people are even honest enough to admit that they dont even want the illusion they straight up fight only when its fair to them youre never going to get rid of unfair pvp and blaming boxers for that is silly
giving afk cloaking such a high importance and implying it to be the final bastion against the blue doughnut and blob warfare is extremely farfetched and clearly not a serious meant argument the frustration of the current state of sovmechanisms shines through in that argument and i can sympathize with it because we all feel the same  something should be done about it and something is cooking at ccp so lets see what happens but keeping afk cloaking without risk is not what is needed to fix eve if it was eve would not be broken in the first placeseraph you finally had an argument good timing its all about timing i agree and i think there should be a possibility to disrupt that timing if you afk cloak if you want to achieve timing in your decloaktargetingscramcovertcynobobkill chain you can still do that but you have to work a bit more check dscan everyv30 minutes and warp to a new safespot if you see afkcloakydetectionprobes out safelog when you go to sleep or fly home thats all not to hard ehafk cloaking without risk has no place in eve since there should always be a risk when playing eve those who can not achieve what they are acheiving today without afk cloakingdeserve to have their afk cloaked ships killedim more convinced than ever that eve online needs a mechanism for players to impose a threat to afk cloakers
want to talk about risk where is the risk of you hiding behind 80 systems of blues while you sit in your afktar ratting away please get out of here with your nonsense delusions im not going to fly 80 systems into your territory to watch you dock up until i have to leave because of some stupid in game timer or whatever mechanism you want to put in place so you can go back to ratting all these threads do is serve as a hall of shame for nullbears to whine and cry about something ccp will never change nor should they everwant to know what the mechanism is to hunt an afk cloaker bait learn to do it
thisit has been repeatedly proven that pve players can avoid patrol styled hostiles who simply sweep through constellationsif the intel channels did not warn them then seeing a hostile name in local served that needare some pve players caught despite sincere effortsnothey were either afk and an unmonitored client was encountered or they screwed up by never made proper efforts to begin within simplest terms any pve player can avoid a hostile entering their system if they do it rightto imply the secondary tactic camping the pve player in their own system requires some kind of limitation without a balancing aspect that only makes pve even safer than beforeby asking that cloaked player to leave you are effectively telling them that the stalemate wont be broken so can they please leave for no reasonafter all if they could use this camping to successfully catch you that would validate it as a successful tacticso a new game is createdare they really thereoption 1 no feel free to pve in safetyoption 2 yes and they might catch youyou want to believe option 1 but you are so afraid of option 2 that you are posting here to get rid of it entirelyupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
it has been repeatedly proven that pve players can avoid afk cloakers to that still does not justify that a risk free afk cloaking should stay trust me you will get kills by having your bob team ready with a few hunters roaming in cloakys playing actively those who use afk cloakers are lazy and deserve to get killed just as much as the lazy ratterslike this one hotdropped paladin ratter without afk cloaker
i dont recall asking that afk cloaking should be kept in the game at all particularly risk freemaybe you assumed i meant it shouldi did point out that it served a purpose regardless of how mad it makes youi want genuine risk for both sides while you seem to be arguing for one side exclusivelyyou say that cloaked ship has no risk and this is wrongi am saying that pve player who can effectively avoid all hostile contact they are also wrongwe can both link kill mails showing how both sides have suffered lossesi can provide links to lottery results showing how people beat those odds toonone of these links would take you to a practical method of achieving a win in either contextupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
i say that afk cloaked ships has no risk and that it should change we might misunderstand eachother ill try to be more clear and read more carefully links are for seraph he thinks im a ratter and that i know nothing about hotdropping or baiting and counterdropping hotdroppers i know one or two things but im the first to admit i have lots more to learn
i have played on both sides of this fence and while noone can claim to read the minds of the devs i have found both sides to be more than capable of avoiding riskthey both have the ability to cherry pick encounters one by staying cloaked the other by remaining docked or behind pos shieldsneither trusts the other not to hot drop so a straight fight is often avoided as a resultif a change is applied to only one side then the other will be affected to the opposite degreewe know they are in that most frustratingly ultimate form of balance called a stalemate currentlyi think we need a solution that gives both sides more risk in exchange for a path to resolving these stalemates in a realistic time frameupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
if i cant be afk while cloaked then you cant be afk in your station or pos

i would personally say the yes ccp support tickets needs a bit of a touch up however i also believe that this post if you want it to be effective to be constructed critically and professionally otherwise you will get troll comments because you made yourself available by spostingdeletetheweak
keep ignoring how a server works you really dont understand what i am talking about or you just ignoring itbut you start complaining about problems with the thrid party software  yeah you dont even understand how the internet works and lag from different clients spread out in the world but yeah unimportant for you because you are only one client with one ip you keep ignoring that exactly this is your main advantage for the perfect alphai know how isboxer works and when i read all your replys i really know that you have no clue how to use it propper for you it is just a nice window management application nothing more nothing less

i started eve online in 2008 after having created the biggest guild on my server in wow i quit wow because my son was born and my guild members couldnt understand why i took a break for a few months it was time to find a more mature crowd from there i tenaciously and ecstatically climbed the steep learning curve of eve online and the more i learned the more there was to learn after having made so many mistakes i started to meet with success from time to time my goals began to take shape and i was hookedmy corp history is pretty long i followed my pirate friend around quite a bit then turned my attention towards the rank and file of nullsec learned allot got into some massive fights watched the northern coalition crumble good times from there i joined an rp corp pretty neat actually then wh corp good money but gawd was it boring when i was the only person on back out to null whole lot of UFFFDnope dont want to deal with this  againUFFFD started to take hold went back to highsec and started my own corp i had heard dust 514 was coming out soon and it was time to prepare a foundation to bring dust and eve together in one organization and position myself and my members to take full advantage of whatever may comei bought a ps3 even though i had an xbox 360 so i could play dust bought my way into the beta as soon as that became an option i dont have a ton of money but hey im a ccp fanboy i had a blast with dust i couldnt wait for orbital bombardments i couldnt wait to join an alliance and start conquering planets with the combined arms of space air and ground combat i gathered up a goodly size of members who shared my vision joined an alliance who also became passively interested in my goals and we all watched closely as things developed i had good members good leaders came from those members on both dust and eve sides and the corporation i had developed was a force to be reckoned with on either side but the dust eve connection was not getting much bigger over timeeventually the goals began to change on both sides my eve members wanted to make more of an impact we set up a pos and started turning a profit my dust members wanted to do pc battles we began merccing ourselves out corp chat always had people in it but there was no common ground between my eve side and my dust side so these people didnt have much use for each other beyond a little small talk from time to time the point of contention came with taxes of all things we raised taxes to 10 to pay for eve bills and put it to use paying bonuses out in faction battles in dust which became even more of an incentive when those battles started paying only in lp 10 is chump change in eve but in dust it feels pretty significant and my leadership on both sides couldnt change those taxes to meet their needs without screwing the other sidemoral was waning and i had to do something to try and unify the corp keep it in one piece until ccps master plan was unleashed then each side would be of great use to each other and taxes would be a small detail pocos became conquerable and i went for it even got in a spat over one that resulted in a huge fight fun times until the corp we attacked bought some mercs of their own they achieved a pyrrhic victory and should get a return on their investment in 5 years or so my corp split from the alliance they were in the eve side wanted to see new horizons and the dust side really wasnt restricted in any way by what alliance we were in or what area of operation we chosethe new expansions came out for eve and dust and they had no new additions to the dusteve link the corp came apart at the seams and i spent a huge amount of my time for about three days sorting people out and surgically amputating my corp into two separate fully functional groups with surprisingly minimal loss of members out of an 80 man corp we had two each just under 40 membersthose two corporations are still alive and well they are doing what works for them and i have stepped out of leadership although i still retain my title in both the eve corp went to nullsec the dust corp is an enjoyable low drama corp who sometimes lends members to pc battles project legion sounds like it will suffer from many of the same fundamental problems dust does eves sandbox components are still largely in control of null tyrants and project valkyrie will be exclusive to oculus rift which i do not intend to buy im disappointed to say im painfully losing interest in my favorite hobby of the last 6 years also i have been cheating on you with other games this whole time
i can haz your stuff
tldr honestly i have no idea i read the whole thing and i cant find a pithy way to sum it up meh actually meh pretty much sums it up
strongly agree  if the server calculation is a load issue make it client side maybe when the drone returns to ship it saves its hullarmorshield stats locallyi dont know if we necessarily would then need the color coding we could just move drones around into the existing groups if we knew their condition put all the broken ones into your borken drone group
i agree with your message and will not be voting for you because the pasta menace threatens to drown us all in a bolognaise sauce of 420 no scope pwnage down with the power blocs
you seem genuine albeit naive as i once was i appreciate your input but i will persist in what i feel is right
have fun being a joke everyones tired of hearing
genuine and naive is what got me in csm
if that were true i would have won a long time ago
