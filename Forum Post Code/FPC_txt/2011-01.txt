i selected my race entirely on aesthetics not on anything else and as i dont like the new one at all so supported
supported considering that our characters are transhuman clonehoppers anyway it seems silly that we have to stick to only one racial face
heres a gallente fixlet everyone reallocate the sp to caldari
meh

based on what eve onlines carriers and battleships are designed from this proposal makes no real sense real life carriers are usually between 300350m in length while battleships are between 250300m in length so if ccp wants to base the ingame ships even partially on what sea warfare vessels are like in real life they would do well to leave ship models at the size they currently arei agree that supercarrier was a lazy name and it should be changed
if ccp had done that you might have a point i urge you to reconsider your position based upon the following dataa thanatos a regular carrier has a volume of 13095000 m3 a macheriel the largest graphic of a battleship has a volume of 595000 m3 a dominix one of the most common battleships has a volume of 454000 m3 the thanatos is over 22 times the size of the macheriel it couldnt be clearer that ccp did not model spaceships after sea going vessels of earth save loosely in namewindjammer
when windjammer is agreeing with me you know im right
i agree make em larger
we still will try our best to make it happen
putting something in quote tags which means it was allegedly actually said is not the same as a joke only someone with mental damage for example would have thought that any of the michael jackson jokes were actually purporting to be jacksons own words not quite the same as a forged direct quote in a manner that indicates its an actual quote say quote tags i see you are solely lying and trolling now i already explained it to show how you are misusing it and despite your lie now not only were you the one who brought it up but it was you who were trying to use it as proof for something your compatriot in trolling has already admitted that this was false and you are now trolling as i already pointed this out to you yet again click your assets tab use the string ship and see how many drones are returned more lying and trolling everybody understands that when you put your drones on aggressive or on guard stance then you can not commend them to attack a specific enemy out of 100 attacking you without first targeting it and directing them which is of course why you cannot simply describe how the process is done because youre trolling and lying and you made it up if you werent lying itd take what a dozen words to describe how to do it thats the trouble with lies awfully hard to provide proof for them convenient now you stop posting already proven that its a kludge and you are trolling yet again by not having actually answered the facts about its kludged nature but pretending i havent answered you no thats just you lying and trolling againsee above about you lying and trolling first part see above about you lying and trolling second part you are again trolling as a descriptive term does not lose its validity simple because it is spoken see above about how you are lying and trolling about drone functions already done see above about you trolling see above about you lying and trolling drones have absolutely no specificity just like fof missiles unless directed onto a locked target yes despite your trolling even with the assist command the ship theyre assisting must still target things in order to direct drones with specificity see above about you lying and trolling again see above about you lying and trolling again see also bandwagon fallacy lying and trolling again on the same point again theyre not ships
the quote tags are also used for identifying who a poster is speaking to and are frequently edited for the purpose of making a joke
we know that silly thats why someone created a thread titled repair yourself with your repair drones so we could get them to repair our ships with a right click command or something similar oh yeah and drones are still different from remote repair modules  in fact theyre a whole different class of items its the differences from remote repair modules that leads me and others to believe they should be able to repair your own ship not the similarities
 so you pretty much just picked a random phrase to take out of context the guy who i was responding to was trolling about how his drones can engage specific targets without a target lock just like remote repair modules are a different class from remote capacitor modules and a different class from autocannons which are a different class from lasers which are a different class from drones its been other people arguing that disparate things are fungible not me ive pointed out that the fundamental principle remains behind their usage
if by fundamental principal you mean the similarity that currently rep drones and remote rep modules can only be used on someone elses ship youre right it is a similarity i say the fundamental principle of rep drones is to rep ships oh look its subjectivethere are things that remote rep modules have in common with rep drones and things they dont the people that support this thread want to change one similarityjust because you choose to label something a fundamental principal doesnt make it so and it certainly doesnt mean you cant change anything
i see you avoided the use and context of my statement about drone mechanics in response to someone trolling about how he can set his drones on guard and still tell them exactly which ship to engage not a good sign if you do something like that and when your mistake it pointed out you change the subjectlikewise in a thread this long its somewhat less than comforting that youve either ignore my argument or are choosing not to discuss it and claiming that all ive said is that both have external effects ive pointed out that effects which are external and which rely on a target lock have a specific place in terms of balance use the overall schema for eve combat for solo and cooperative play etcits not simply that theyre used on other peoples ships although thats a facet of it and it is somewhat odd that youre claiming requiring a target lock in to direct effects at that target isnt a fundamental principle but one im just inventing
i thought you meant it was the fundamental principal as in their main purpose thats why i said i thought their fundamental principal was to rep ships but whatever cool then explain to us why it would make things imbalanced without simply stating rep drones are targeted cooperative effects we know you currently need a target lock you dont need to keep repeating it
its a much worse sign if you not only dont acknowledge your mistake but then go on to recycle it and pretend that i was simply stating that they require a target lock so in other words you want to discuss the balance and usage issues without talking about how theyre balanced and used no the fact that theyre tees is essentially to understanding their use and balance within the game the questions i asked earlier were and balanceusage issues are related to all of those which one would you like to talk about
well the whole point is that they can be killed i mean its the same thing at the moment you just need two ships for it because since you cannot put the drones on yourself you put them on eachother
nope i want you to address balance issues without simply saying they are targeted external effects you can use that phrase if you likeill make my previous post more clear if youre finding it difficult to comprehend you cant simply use the phrase they are targeted external effects you have to elaborate on it specifically why changing the behavior of rep drones will make the game imbalanced
the penalty is lower dps you have rep drones out instead of combat onesthere are a lot of assumptions being made in this thread about intentionsthe way drones work from a code standpoint without ccp confirmation all these are guesses we can ask the csm to put this forward to ccp and if there are reasons ccp doesnt like it then well find out at that stageoh and we should thank finn for keeping this on page 1
good thing then that i didnt as i said balanceusage issues are related to all of those which one would you like to talk about
lol
yes you were trolling and got responses lowell of course nobody has shown any actual good reason to change mechanics besides the fact that theyd like it and nobody has even addressed any reason why violating balance except for theyre drones and trolling about how drones are ships or drones can indeed be directed to attack individual targets without a lock or what have you
still needs attention even a year later
most excelent
bump
yes please give me a reason to train my electroinic attack figs skill beyound the lvl 2 i took so i could steal them the class has so mutch potential yet has so much fail atleast make them a good addition to frig gangs

im suprised and disappoint that ccp isnt using the same mechanism as the csm vote

i use fb and i have no plans to vote through fb

that ccp employee who decided to use failbook to vote must be fired immediately
well said i was excited by the prospect of a new competition after the whole deviant fiasco when i saw i would be required to join facebook in order to take part i was somewhat irkedi have taken one look at the competing entries some very nice work there but i wont be voting its a shame ccp went down this route as i certainly would of voted had it actually been an inhouse competition
i agree
2 just so i dont have to use face book
agree fully
full support would take a lot of balance but the idea is sound maybe rails should do more damage the longer they travel since they are long range shell based weapons in space shouldnt they be more destructive at long range i mean no friction in space so i believe if blasters did more damage the closer you are and rails did more damage the farther away you are that would be a more interesting game mechanics like oh god i got to get closers to reduce damage from that battleships weapons
aaa
supported conditionally i dont think they need a hp boost relatively weak tankhp i think fits with the destroyer concept they do need a sig reduction so they arent instapop with cruisers and above on the field they could also use a scosh more cpugrid though im unsure about adding slots id also forego more gridcpu on the gallente boat in return for being having the drone baybandwidth for at least 3 lights
so much bitternessand only at 6 hours till new year supported
if it was implemented consistently with the way the halo and nomad sets work the full coward set with the bonuses as stated in the op would grant a 64 logoff timer reduction for noncapital ships for capital ships the reduction would be 9972 causing them to disappear in under 26 secondsthe double set bonus from the omega for capital ships would cause the delta and epsilon implants to give negative bonuses when used as part of a full set happily when combined these return a positive number for the timer  reduction avoiding any paradoxical effects
i initially wanted something like this but wanted more of a risk factorhowever i totally agree with your reasons smaller groups need to be able to have a chance at getting some of the rarer mins and perhaps have a larger impact on the game as a wholece
lol because getting in a jf with a ton of probes is sooo challenging
its a simple matter for ccp to make the ganker blinks red without making an entry in character sheet the minor bit of extra coding is only an excuse if you want to use it as one
i agree so many people live in 00 and expect it to be as safe as high sec these people dont deserve the rewards 00 has to offer but they get the rewards because 00 is almost as safe as high sec for many alliances and thats wrong and ccp need to open there eyes to this
im sorry for trying to make the game actually involve skill and not just about sitting in a lagged out system not being able to control your ship and hoping i have more internet friends than the other guysilly little goonie you do make me smile
1 for all 3large alliances have a huge 1up on smaller groups there is almost no way to change the balance of power without taking months to get in a spy and taking them apartthe sov system in place lets big alliances take their time to bring all their 
jump bridges 1jb are one of the advantages of holding nullsec space  if oyu dont like it stay in high sec or better yet find the bridges you hate so much and shoot them till there around 25 hull that way there disabled and they cant put new ones up and it will tkae at least half a day to rep them unless they bring a sc swam sov pos 1unles this pos is a heavaly defended super pos a correctly set up gang will make sure that evey one of these stations will allways be in reinforced mode its two wasy of a target to control system sovprobing 1while you make a point with how if there in system they know where you are  this is kinda the norm for most space games i mean i hate to pull up old stuff but even in starwars or startrek if the enemy is in system you know where they are and they dont need to warp to 0 to get to them the main problem i have is that some fleets will slingshot from object to object ina system if they know there out numbered to wear off there aggression timers and then log off they are hard enough to catch as it is
youre advocating a system where established 00 alliances lose one of the major advantages they hold space for and apparently you dont realise that in 00 those jump bridges you hate so much make prime locations for small gangs to gank careless idiots at a reestablishment of the bad old days of pos warfare with the added bonus of a weedy little pos structure which any old bunch of nobodies can come along and shoot and trying to return the 1dimensional fleet doctrines of old just bring more t2 sniper bs guys which the new probing system thankfully helped to break upyour destroy their way of playing because its different to mine argument and appeal to skill pressing f1 to shoot your guns at the primary in one type of ship is so much more skillful than pressing f1 to shoot the primary in another type of ship is cute though
from your posts i take it that you havent played the game long for starters the probing you talked about starwars and star trek really you have no understanding of the game all you want is 00 on easy mode your the person who should be in high sec you like being able to probe easily because easy probing stops skilled gangs using snipe tactics to fight outnumber and it actualy requires some skill all you want is blob vs blob no skill boring pvpand why should the pos be heavily armed if a small gang can roll into your space and shoot a 10 million hitpoint structure without being killed then you dont deserve the space in the first place before sov people used to have to actually defend their stations when hostiles showed up instead of cowering away until you can get 51 odds in your favour know im not saying bring back station ping pong but atleast make it so alliances have to defend their space when hostiles attack
know i understand people can sit on jump bridges and gank stragglers who are stupid enough to jump through and get caught any small gang can camp a jump bridge and harass larger alliances what i dont accept is people being able to cover 5 regions and 50 jumps in 8 or 9 jumps because of jump bridges i understand thats how many people like to play this game by moving around and blobbing every region of space they can then complain on the forums on how ccps game is broken because there 1000 man blob couldnt load or shoot in system 00 is meant to be a harsh and hard place to live where there is great rewards but these rewards come with a great risk because of jump bridges that risk is greatly reduced and makes 00 to easy to live inand you talk about 1 dimensional fleets all of todays fleets are high ehp buffer tanks with as many logistics as you can get all anyone does is warp on top of each other sit there and press f1 and broadcast for reps yes these fleets come in different variations but all work in exactly the same way and all involve little to no skill its all about who has the most numbers or who gets hit the worst by lag
and from your posts i find you like to jump to conclusions just so your point is valid and to counter you first argument  my probing skills are actually lacking atm  im more on of the guys with the big guns who follows our probers and yes i compared eve to starwars and startrek cause guess what there all about space ships in guess what spaceand why should a single sov holding new pos structure be heavily armed um duh sov used to be held my numerous pos structures in a single system if this new one is not a very hard nut to crack then all its gonna take is 100150 guys with energy drinks to stay up till alliance as main fleet is asleep and 23 hours work and when they wake up half there sov is gonei do however agree that fleets atm are simply who has the more logis and higher buffer  and its kinda sad
could at least start from making jump bridges usable by alliance members only right now they enable whole naptrains to instantly travel onto the deepest corners of the galaxy
as usually if something is not right ccp will release a fix to address the problem then why care if is complete now when i can work on my character later on lets say 5 months from now i dont think that they will render my zus dysfunctional
theyre stuck in the rush for dust and wodcurrently dust is this simple lil console shooter port easy enough to build the models for an existing engine etc so its all basically finished months ago sitting in a corner gathering hah dust the original plan was to slowly integrate it but obviously theyve discovered that deploying on console you have to get a lot of the code in the initial cd rather then on patches so all these things need to be completed so that dust can be released and cashflow can be made from the wasted years of dev spent on it and the bloated relativesccp explained this when they told us they wouldnt be working on eveonline their flagship product for 2 years as a resultof course the eve community isnt happy to wait for these superfluous changes when their main driving factor is to save money on code for another game world of darkness and generate cashflow from yet another sideproject dustthe rush to release dust shouldnt involve pushing product onto eve which isnt ready for releasehistory tells us that it will unfortunatelythe ccp game i pay for is eveonline how bout you
exactly that is my biggest concern if it even takes 3 years to fix somethimng simple like rockets i dont have much hope for something far more complicated like a character editor
lol
im not worried at all that would imply there is a reasonable chance ccp will keep the ball in play instead of dropping it
i am kinda worried i have 3 different types of characters and 23 seem pretty bland honestly i mean really bland i can even make this intaki here look like a brutor male with the new stuffim just saying we can postpone it for 12 or so more days to make sure we all look cool and retain our identities
this thank you csm for being rational p
im more than unsatisfied with the current options the editor has imho it should be postponed till incarna edit oh and there are hardly gonna be much improvement to what we gonna get on sisi right nowps i want haircut tattoo eyes and robe of the char i have nowpps i selected my race in eve only by look of it so imho ccp should allow us to change race by the release of the editor
dont try to start a fire before limber arrives
id say only release it when its working to everyones satisfaction on sisi which it doesnt at all now
all ships need to have sum capacitor protection from power drainage to balance ships that already have inherited weakness for example amarr and their guns they have big cap and skill to support the weapons but when they get attacked with power neut they are rapidly disabled in higher extend of any other ship in gamethis can work like ship class bonuses like sensor strength
ever heard of cap boosters
after the changes are implemented to make agents smarter they will not even talk to you unless you have at least a hac or battlecruiserthe whole point is making agents have common sense of course i cannot forsee every loophole in a single post but ccp can because they have a army of devs
tldr i am tired of getting handed combat missions that might screw up my faction standing make it so i can run missions without having to worry about that pleasei wouldnt say no to smarter missions and a wider variety of them but as for what youre suggesting  no just no
if you havent read up on the article you can do so here 
contractual griefing
changes i would make 1 make it a every one in kinda contract 15 people can accept the contract only one can complete it or one fleet this way some one cant simply accept all the contracts for his alt them wait a while2 make it so that in order to increase you bounty hunter mojo level you have to take in lot of contacts from lots of people and get decent amounts of isk for it this way some one cant simple put 50 contracts on an alt blow up his pod 50 times and then say ya im a real bounty hunter3 i like your tracking idea but make it skill dependant with like 6 new bounty hunter skills this way if your going to be a bounty hunter you will have to train for it but you will be better than the guy pretending will all level 1 skills
summary when a ship is assembled store the timestamp of assembly and generate a unique registration number for the ship which cannot be changedi wouldnt be surprised if this information already existed in the backend database and it would just be a case of exposing the information however i also believe that the treatment of packaged items would mean that repackaging an item would lose this informationthis information would be available when you viewed the information page of the entity and the registration information would also be logged in killmailsadding this enables all sorts of extra abilities  killboards would be able to track not just pilots but specific ships supercaps would be locked to their registration number nerds can try and collect sightings of as many as possible people who pay silly amounts for the first ship off the line will be able to actually verify that their ship really is special and possibly even trade them with this special nature intact
and how do you without introducing a monumental amount of new and otherwise useless data solve the following problemi have a ship hurricane class named carebear draft dodger serial number 14321187659i repackage the ship toss it on a stack of fity other hurricanes divide the stack into two stacks one of ten one of 40 how do i know which stack contains 14321187659keeping in mind that these ships are not unique items at this point but just a stack of item of type hurricane with an integer indicating how many are in the stackedit for clarification
this is based on this thread 
they dont
seriously that thread is at the top of the page post this there
if ccp had done that you might have a point i urge you to reconsider your position based upon the following dataa thanatos a regular carrier has a volume of 13095000 m3 a macheriel the largest graphic of a battleship has a volume of 595000 m3 a dominix one of the most common battleships has a volume of 454000 m3 the thanatos is over 22 times the size of the macheriel it couldnt be clearer that ccp did not model spaceships after sea going vessels of earth save loosely in namewindjammer
clearly boats and galactic spaceships are very similar and should be kept in line with one another
also cross posting is bad mmkay
now i just think youre trolling your comparison is missing one vital point carriers in the real world navy are carrying fighters and in fact can not hold battleships inside them carriers in eve do hold battleships inside them can fit 2 in fact as long as they arent gallente so until carriers in the real world are designed to carry battleships your entire thread is moot
and the post turned into a poorly executed troll at this point
allow kill rights and war declarations transfers to individuals so they can participate if hired as assassins or mercenaries that will satisfy loner hunters to have fun with others that like aggression
kill right transfers have been discussed for a while not sure if it is a good idea or notbut if you want to kill something without consequences go to npc null or wormholes that way you can satisfy whatever crazy urges you get while waiting for ccp to decide to do anything
use for high sec wars
transfer killrights sure but transferable wars that does not make sense to me
you need to make your post a lot clearer if you want anyone to be able to judge it properly and support itwardeclarations makes no sense whatsoeveras for killrights they should be commodities that can be traded openlycsm voted unanimously for it two years ago but i havent heard any official word about it sincenot that their version is very good way to lenient on the ganker but its a start
allow area of effect weapons in high sec space by not damaging or effecting non aggravated targets and objects
um no if they dont damage all objects in range they cease to be an aoe weapon
you mean turn off friendly fire  so s can spam aoe weapons without thinking or having any skill god i hate that feature in every game and i dont think eve would be an exceptionno use targeted weapon systems or take the risk of hitting nonhostiles and getting concorded
changing aoe weapons to not affect friendlies would be dumb one of the principles of eve is that you have freedom to act but that your actions may have consequences if you wish to activate your smartbombs then you accept the risk that comes with themhowever i would like to see derestriction of the weapon types that dont currently function in empire eg bomb launchers lowsec doomsdays interdictor bubbles as long as there are consequences
allow sensor probes to be deployed and anchored to counter cloaked ships and disallow objects and structures from reviling them
really think about a post before you just open the floodgates to your mindfirst off anchoring probes is laughable as they have a limited power source second how would this counter cloaked ships they would just cloak and be undetected as usualas for disallow objects and structures from reviling them im not even sure what you mean
hi corina i am not talking of the ones you know ok lets say device of sensing cloaked ships that can be dd so it eliminates the need of using containers for the specific need it will make the game play more realistic
looks like cromo is at it again on an alt only he is dumb enough to post this sort of crap
move rigging skills from the mechanic skill bracket is too big to look through
this has been suggested before in some form but ill support it again anywayscience also needs a clean out though not sure how to go about it
please perhaps submenus within the science and mechanic menus for the specific categories
the main problem is who is to decide where simple macro ends and where bot start the thing is that both  marco and bot  can interact with the game on the same level so blocking one if ever fully accomplished will block the other and viceversastill the bots also can interact on memory level of client that macros cant do since as you said they are just series of keystrokes but one ccp have to think about the big picture and there are as many autoclickers that read pixel colors to identify points on screen where to click pi clickers old mining bots and so on as client breaching automates that play the game by itself like the one presented in article that opened this whole rmtmacrobot discusionif by blocking bots ccp will also block all kind of macroes and programs like evemetrcs adn evecentral market extractors so be it sorry evecentral i hope one day ccp will implement market api
whats really sad is that not only has ccp failed to address the problem of botting but has actually introduced a feature planetary interaction that is a perfect scenario for botting ccp this is an epic fail you seem to be more interested in distracting people with new things of doubtless quality than actually fixing existing problems lagbottingi have spoken my peace i am done back to my miningi love eve
botters are some small percentage of active players ccp create content for players and as such one or the other can be operated by macroes if it is simple enough that you can operate it with simple repetitive clicking without thinking like the pi you showed as exampleand content need to be easily accessible and controllable otherwise you will get to solve quantum equations before boarding the ship just to opose possible macroes well bot will probably solve that equation easily that player but i think you get what i meant therethe main concern is fighting possibility to interact automatically with game that what i think at least
give players the ability to sell stacks of multiple items with a single click and allow autopilot to interact with afterburners fix these 2 simple issues with the game and i will gladly stop defending macros
also i want to be able to put blue ribbons in my ponys hair the red ribbons simply wont do
and i want my char to have nose in place of mouth and ribbons coming out of ears plus of course be able to dress my male char in female victorian age dresssarcasm offguys give it time its not released yet its really good looking you may not be able to create 100 match with your old avatar but still  if you sit to it you can get really closeas for the clothes and hairstylesi guess we will be able to buy more types ingame soon or maybe some player made will be an option or avaible as microtransactions itemsthe basic sample avaible for everyone during character creation will be just for tease 
i wouldnt worry too much about the system as it is now remember it is only on sisi which means it is still more or less beta what you see on sisi is unlikely t be the final product
well its the lack of communication that worries me while some of these issues have already been mentioned in october 2010 its been systematically ignored thus far and with incursions iii on our doorstep and the same things still in part 4 of the creator i find it legitimate to express my concern theres no indication whatsoever that these points are even being noticed by ccp or the csm what thats concerned let alone that theyre taking them into consideration i do hope we do get some feedback from either i really wonUFFFDt like it if they release the editor as is and start working on the playerUFFFDs issues somewhere down the road its a questionable way of doing things releasing things bugged and incomplete and without functions and options the previous version had and then start thinking about fixing them  if at all  when you knew a lot of issues beforehand
we need a system to allow experienced pilots to accelerate their standing gains so that they are not forced to farm low level missions just so that the l4s will talk to them the system as it is now is crippling and forces players to stay in one region of space in order to stay near their supply lines this thread is to discuss ideas of how the agent system can be improved so that a multimillion sp character can freely move around the universe and still be able to fly missions that are of his skill level rather than performing menial tasks just to farm useless standings pointsat first i thought it would be a simple matter of allowing corperate standing to override individual standing but on the same note you would have newer players with little skill that can talk to l5 agents what is needed is a balance between standing and player skill that will allow a experienced player to walk into any corporation and take the harder level missions with no standing requirements while at the same time relying on standing to determine the quality of the agent and the rewards they earn from the missions
this again its bean a whole year nowp
along the lines of the customisable damage alarms i think it would be nice to have customizable overview rules for example you could set up a rule that when a drones current target has a relative radial velocity higher then the drones weapons the corresponding entry in the overview or deployed drones list could toggle to red to let the player know its not being affective or have targeted objects change colors when a module is in range of falloff and again when at optimali think this would be a much more efficient way to gleam information from the ui given a variety of information about locked targets and the players own ship made accessible to this feature it could easily be applied in a myriad of different situations this would could greatly increase usability and pilot effectiveness in combat or even miningim just kinda spit balling here does anyone else think this would be useful
the whole ui needs a drastic overhaul that being said you can already put a column on your overview for angular velocity and you can know when your weapons are in optimal or falloff
sounds niceprobably easy to implement all client sidepotential lag from overview although it would all be client side the overview is still slow to respond where there is a lot of targets  add additional layer of conditions and indication go figure would love to get more option in setting what i see and how i see in overview
i have found from expiriace with turreted weapons that optimal range is infact optimal range and belive it or not point blank shooting has the same effect as shooting from too far away next time you try to kill the space lab try to use the keep at distance option to stay between optimal and the falloffi have a harpie that is nearly 100 acurate from 50km but it cant hit anything that is closer than 10km so it is all about the optimal not the actualy speed or size
no doubt poss look like crap with everything unattached and floating around pos support general idea but guns and such should remain as a vulnerable part whether outside bubble as they are now of attached inside to pos
mmhm desperately needed poses are an embarrassment to the entire game
friendly bump to keep this fresh
im sure similar suggestions have been made already in this thread and every related thread but id like to give my 2 cents first off i support suicide ganking the danger of losing your stuff is what makes eve stand out above wow if you want to officer fit your ship and never risk it go play wow where your gear is safethat being said suicide ganking is too easy with 100 insurance payouts it is a zero cost and therefore effectively zero risk operation i like the idea of either removing insurance payouts for concorded ships or at least reducing the payout by a significant margin this means that suicide gankers will have to chose truly worthwhile targets and turn their trade into a skilled trade once againi also agree with earlier ideas of allowing these pirates a quicker way back into high sec both through decreased sec status penalties they were already penalized through isk and possibly purchasable tokens that can be redeemed with concord to raise sec status best of all make the tokens available in lp stores so for isk mrs will possibly fund their own demise yes i like irony
so they will always bring more than you have how will this help pvp 
some good ideas here 1although having to scan for plexes is really no big deal tbh as long as it can be done with onboard scanner its just a matter of a couple minutes calling for changing that is just laziness speaking imho
your problems 2 3 and 4 are common to pvp in general they are not gonna go away ever regardless what you doi agree though that plexes should in general be more about pvp the whole plexing thing needs a complete overhaul tbh
i didnt read all the post its to long for me i just like clicking the thumbs up buttonscorpionidae
first let me say that i am not entirely wed to having this particular intel given it is more important that we at least know where the plexes are being captured however on the whole i do think providing this intel is a good idea for 2 reasons1 your militia would know what ship it is so surely they would report itbut more importantly 2 i do think it would lead to more pvp consider this example you are flying in a rifter you see on the militia intel channel that there is a minor plex being taken by 1 enemy pilot 5 jumps in one direction and another plex being taken by 1 enemy pilot 5 jumps in the opposite direction now one of the plexes has an enemy merlin which you would engage the other minor plex has a thrasher which you would not engage if you know what ships they are flying you will go to the merlin and pvp will likely ensue if you dont know what ships are involved then you have a good chance of going to thrasher in that case you will jump the 5 jumps and then use your dscan and see it is a thrasher in there and likely wisely decide not to engage no pvpnow of course you might think consider a different scenario if you are in a plex in a thrasher they will bring 2 thrashers to kick you out perhaps that will be the case but then again maybe you are familiar with pilots and that they only fit t1 mods or are really bad or something and decide to fight both but lets assume the most likely result that is that you will take a pass on fighting two versus 1 in the same ship so you warp out to another system and start running a different plex now the two pilots can either 1 leave one pilot behind to run the plex you started and have the other go after you in whatever plex you started or 2 both stay where they are and run the plex you started themselves in which case you can run a plex somewhere else in the same time or 3 both continue to chase you out of plexes if they choose the first option you get your pvp fight when you fight the single thrasher that follows younow if they choose the second or third option you are winning occupancy war because you just tied up two pilots with one pilot you see every pilot is a valuable resource because they could potentially be running plexes using 2 to accomplish the same task is a wastebut the important thing is not necessarily that you are winning the occupancy war the important thing is why you are winning the occupancy war you are not winning the occupancy war because you are better at pve you are winning because you are so much better at pvp that the other side needs to commit 2 pilots in order to kick you out of any plex the side with the better pvpers will definitely have a huge advantage by making occupancy truly depend on pvp skill winning occupancy will actually be something that will be worthy of respect and therefore something of value nobody respects good pvers thats why we dont have a pve alliance tournament this is why not many really cared when caldari won the occupancy fight given the current plexing mechanics no informed person thought they won because the average caldari was better at pvp than the average gallente
this is the key to the whole thing and fixes all related issues without further huntingplex spawning mechanics and occupancy are broken beyond being usableafter downtime there are 3 systems constellation based occupancysov needs fix too in the combat zone that can be faught over by fleets of any size with any degree of numbers stacking for hours of funthree hours after downtime this is no longer possible as you can no longer find plex to force into the target system for the rest of the day factionwar is not factionwarthus you have 2 groups of factionwar pilots a there are those who have played after downtime and see the awesomeness which is factionwar the best pvp in this gameb then there are those that just pvp and think plex are pve because of the broken mechanicim here to say fw plex are the best and biggest pvp content in this gamewith fw plex you can always get a fight it will always be different it has many options of where it can occurive seen 10 cruisers be able to get fights with 40 bcive seen 5 destroyers force 20 bc to reship and fly into a hostile plex for an awesome fightive seen 1 carrier take on 20 matar for fun with the support of bs ratsthree hours past downtime when factionwar is no longer available for play the same situations result in 100 players being bored and unable to get an engagement startedwe then log for the night and go play wotedit btw had to switch to support to get any kinda focus on this major expansion that has been abandon by ccpwill incursions be the samewill incarnia be the samewill dust be the samewill wod be the samei can only assume yes
i have been playing with the new avatar creator and am probably going to be happy enough with the results to not need this butthe old avatars were just static images and the choices we made about appearence only effected a tiny little pic at the side of the screen and for those who have been around a while the racebloodline atributes were probably the bigest factor in decideing what race blooodline to go with as those no longer apply and for anyone wanting to use incarna the chriteria we would use for choosing bloodline race or even gender are now totally differentcouple that with the differences in appearence between old and new i think its reasonable to be offered the option to change for these and all of the above reasons i support this
if nothing else keep the current bloodline for the lol your choices have consequences crowd and let us have plastic surgery to assume the appearance of a new race
idk if this has ever been suggested but maybe we should change the mobility gall ships such that they can fit plates and still be as fast as they are now that would make them the fastbut not as fast as minnie and certainly not a sustainable sprint like them but rather i think they should get the slight buff in dmg and tracking and fitting capacity to fit the buffer they want and the ability to move quickly with said buffer in place i know itd have to be carefully balanced so they dont become ehp monsters that can nano everywhere but with a weak cap and short range guns theyd be damn good in a sprintslugfest which is the feel i get from blasters on another note this would bring gallente ships a bit more use in ahac gangs with their increased ehp and dpsps i support the rails bleed through thing but only to armor gives them an interesting niche edit maybe make some ships bonus a reduction to plates mass addition
do something for crying out loud
why caldari blaster ships are even worse than gallente
what i havent supported this yeta carriers need a boost in size i was packing a drake and a cane into a chimera and all i could think is you are so smallbreaks the immersion anyway free bump
please explain why this change will create an imbalance finn
i dont mind which balance issue you address finn address all of them if you like or your favorite or issue that will create the biggest imbalancejust stop dodging
youre welcome to dispute my claims that it would effect any andor all of those dynamics and throw off their balance youve refused to even address them for what half a dozen posts now its rather odd for you to claim that im dodging anything since you wont even address my points again choose any single one or all of them if thats what you prefer as youve stated drones interact with each of the game mechanics ive noted and changes would break those dynamics any of them that youd like to argue arent violated by the changes you support have at itbut dont dodge the issue that ive spelled out several times now and claim that im dodging anything cheers
well if you have no argument as to why this change would make gameplay imbalancededita series of rhetorical questions is hardly a satisfactory explanationagain please explain any or all balance issues this change will create just your favorite issue if you likecheers
100 wholly supported 200 evenbeing forced to use failbook is an insult sure use it but enable an option to use my own eve subscription that does not steal my contact list information and spam people who have no interest in eve with pointless advertising my friends  family dont care one whit about whatever games im playing and i sure as sin dont care about the thirty idiotic spamverts i get bloating my inbox every day and imagine what that inbox looks like when i log in at most one or two times a yearstupid tactic ccp just plain stupid
thumbs up for this
no facebook for me
supportim not sure if i like this new web team or at least the new direction the old web team is taking
got my vote i hate facebook and all sites like them there infested with all kinds of spy ware and virusedit it also gos way against protecting your eve account part of protecting your eve account is not just virus scaners but staying away from sites like facebook lolz
we dont need someone with a bunch of lemming facebook friends from someone who has a bunch to just hop into the voting to vote for a crappy looking shipjust give us a little mandatory pop up to vote upon login paid accounts only with the proper voting options and maybe even an abstain option
anyone else notice how ccp and possibly the csm are totally ignoring the mass of complaints on this so anyone one facebook can vote and the thousands of eve players who arent can not fail and insulting

omg this this is an excellent idea blasters and rails would finally have a deadly and totally unique niche that no other weapon system can claim full support from me

give us stuff to fill a hitchhikers guide to the eve galaxy with
the only thing i think destroyers need is about 20 more cap and 5 greater cap regenmay be slightly variable across races as the cap on the catalyst sucks really badly
imo the coercer is the only one that needs a buff one exsta mid slot please i mean its ment to be a frig killer but how dose it kill frigs if it cant hold it downi think what you said is a great idea but insted of removing 2 high slots just remove one high slot and put it in the place that it is needed the most for said shipscorpionidae edit forgot to thumbs up
if you do this though then you remove the best low end salvager in the game why not just change them to be a mini noctis with reduced bonusespersonally i did all of my lvl 1 missions in a destroyer and had no problems at all with lvl 1 missions i only ever had problems with three of the soe missions
yup
lone or pairs of logistics would stop instead get groups of 510 logistics repping large gangs remote repping does indeed need to have a penalty more than flagging docking or jumping is too easy they should be keeping range logistics cruisers have 70km range and then warping out if need be like the ewar cruisers
bump for great justice
just guessing that the incentive would be to fly from moon to moon and not sit on one moon for the next hour just come back latter
supported
supported hell i thought players already made them lolz
supported
signed ccp has been working for this anyway with doing pi trying to make everything player built
yes i support my own ideals
after your changes rails would still suck alotblasters would be edging close to working thoughimorails really need more alpha dps and less cap use to work as snipersblasters with the above changes could probably do with a smidge more damage on the medium and large versions like 5change the ammo to make it abit more complex atm only cnam null spike and now void are worth using
while the reload and change ammo speeds are annoying the only reason blaster boats are considered crap is because you dont have speed to get on people in a timely fashion is gallente the only ones with this prob torps run 3050km so not caldari minnie obviously not amarr absolutely why dont they seem to have a problem scorch omgwtfpwnwant to fix blasterboats fix null to be like scorch such that while at range we are doing good damage and when we get close we quickly can switch to void or antimatter then the problem goes away
not a good solution rails need serious medical attention blasters are just bad atm only solution i think for rails is to make their damage on par with beams while tracking is worse their range is better horrible alpha but not bothered about thatblasters need a swift 25 tracking buff and 10 buff to raw damageammo needs to be reworked somehow perhaps a tiny bit of damage type mixing bit of explosive in some types at the moment blasters never used anything except antimatter maybe weaker ammo types increase optimal and falloff
like i said in the op this is about the hybird weapon system not the ships they go on that needs to be handled semiseperatly becouse omg hybirds go on caldire ships too and not just gal omg no way dude not caldire ships there missils lmao
just wondering why you would want to make make rails damg on par with beams and make there tracking worse that would still lower dps when using rails and just make them a poor verson of beams i was shooting for hitting more offten with rails with out inc alph because alph is projectiles and with out trying to make them do the same dps as beams becouse thats a beams thing the trade off is ships with rails would be a tad better off in mid and close range combat with rails when you get caught flat footed your blast changes are not bad other then on paper right now blasters do more dps then any other weapon system so 10 more raw damage mite not be forthcoming the tracking buff and signature resolution buff will help greatly in makeing the blasters hit more often geting more of there already high dps on target im not against ammo changes for starters i do belive they should be lighter but damage type mixing at least to me is kind of steping on projectiles area
noincrease speed of all blaster ships beyond that of minmatar increase tracking and damage of blasters by 50increase dps not alpha of railguns by 50if the deimos is as good as the adrestia is right now then blasters have been successfully fixed
lol overpowered much
the true hybirds are passerine birds in the family gunnerae underpoweridius they are predominantly seedeating songbirds most are native to southern regions but one subfamily is endemic to wormholes one to the outer reach and one subfamily  monotypic at genus level  is found only in the vale of the silent the scientific name gunnerae underpoweridius comes from the latin word gunnerae for the 825mm hybird hybirdus maximus  a member of that last subfamily  which is common in gallente spacemany birds in other families are also commonly called railguns including some species in the very similarlooking waxbills or estrildid hybirds family gunnerae subfamily weakerus of the old world tropics and australia several groups of the bunting and amarr hybird family emberizidae and darwins hybirds of the galapagos systems which provided evidence of natural selection and are now recognized to be peculiar teenagers herpus derpussome species are being imported or smuggled into other empires and sold as exotic petsby the way the op is a troll
how about before we get too far with expansions someone works on improving account securitya friend of mine was hacked less than a week ago and he recieved very little back after getting his account backi understand the eula but with many of us having long term characters  over 3 yrs  account security must be on the top of our listsit hurts when someone has been playing a long time and leaves becouse all the money they have invested is thrown away by a hacker taking control of an account its not just the isk but if you lostr a carrier dread or mothership how long does it take to rebuild or get enough isk back to rebuy and refit people are leaving eve becouse of this not the hacker so much but the lack of understanding maybe we need insurance against hacking in game you pay for insurance you get hacked insurance pays back what you had prior to the dt before the hackthere must be a way of improving our security as this seems to be the worst game i have been part of lately when it comes to account securityi am no pc expert i am a player but what about1 authenticator system2 max password trys 33 email notification of fraudulant activity4 etc
i would think now would be the time for them to come out with a authenticator system why becouse there sending us to facebook to get are pcs infested with spy ware and virus just so we can vote on a ship lolz
given the amount of work that can be erased by a hacker in a handful of minutes i agree eve needs to step it up on security even wow has better security than eve for crying out loud given the volatile nature of the game and its cutthroat attitude toward gameplay an authenticator token really is needed id be willing to up to 50 usd upfront for one if one token can be linked to multiple accounts come on ccp get with the last decade and introduce authenticator tokens already melantari  how bad was the loss
10s of billions i believe and has probably caused the closure of a corp seing it was the ceo
id be mad if i got hacked and not reimbursedi play wow as well i was recently hacked on my account there it ended in my entire guild being closed down and everything sold and lost at least they reimbursed me everything with no cost to me that includes my gold my items and my gearif blizzard can do that ccp can too
account hacking in eve is rarely anything of the sort it is done through phishingyou will have received an email to a website asking for you to login this may appear very authentic once logged in it may forward you to the real eve site or just say thanks then they login with your details and have their way with youproblem is between screen and chair im afraid stupid users
while i agree with this part of your post thats not a reason not to add in additional optional security measures1 for an authenticator type system
i do agree with this it is a problem bt screen and chair but the fact of the matter is if it does happen ant it is a legit case there should be better ways to reimburse and fix the problem i dont foresee myself being hacked on eve any time in the near or distant future but t does happen and ccp should be prepared to make amends in the event that it doesit all comes down to customer service long term players are targets theyve put much time and money into this product and when they quit playing because ccp doesnt have a way to make them want to come back is ridiculous to say the leasti mean i understand yes it is my fault i clicked the site i logged in im an idiot but the first time it happens slap me on the wrist and tell me not to do it again dont say oh heres a little bit back enjoy and leave it at that
the current cost of a wardec is apparently 50m isk per week to a corpalliance that is pocket change this amount should be changed to be 500m isk so that it is a cost that a corpalliance would think about twice and wouldnt just use the wardec as a griefing opportunity
50 mil to me is a fair pricegetting out of wardecs is easy24 hrs to wardec24 hrs to set new ceo24 hrs to get all members out24 hrs to get into a new corpwhats the point of wardecs anyways
there really needs to be a defined goal to wardecs as it is they are little more than bribing concord to look away
wardecs are a bribe to concord bribes happen in real life just like they do in eve lol that is the nature of this game
no there doesnt and they are bribes of a sort you can limit your wardecs to any reasons you want but ccp shouldnt start to dictate what reasons are or arent good enough for a wardec at best you could argue for a system where the target has a chance to bid against the wardeccing corp for continued concord protection
final editbleh i like the range thing
the way i would like to see this is remove local but add in a pos mod that gives a local to the owning corp allance and remove local only in null secthis would give a real home field advantage and add to the metagameing in spys are even more worthy
the idea of completely removing local from lowsecnull is an idea that i have always supported
also i need to have one of those 00 space stations or whatever its called and my own titan for which i only will need about 24 hours to train for and build and i want them without buying from another player kthxbai omf please tell me this person is not a member of csm whatever go ahead remove the bpos remove the long skills remove 00 space where people can kill you and steal your stuff because they have been playing the game since 2006 remove anything that would give one player an economical advantage over another player remove every bit of eve culture and eve history and make endgame accessible to a 12year old that just logged inoh and add some elves and pets as well happy new year everybody
this time i will support just for kicks
i think that only reduces the earnings of moon mining in less your implying in some round about way that all real t2 bpo owners also own all the right moons tooedit and if they realy wish to remove the bottle neck on moon mins just let moon mining happen every were high sec and wormholes
you couldnt be more wrong invention is a riskfree activity compared to producing from a bpo those are a huge risk to acquire since you have no way to predict what the bpo is worth in 12 monthsapart from a stockpile of items you already produced which affects bpo owners just the same you are completely independent from changes in item valuejust image youd have invested in a heavy nosferatu bpo prior to the nerf thats right you could have just given that isk to the first tripleyourisk spammer in jitanot supported
theres an idea a cocsm member of mine came up with and though he used it to manipulate the market i think it does have some merit why not set all t2 bpos at 8 mepe and allow them to be researched up to 3 max thatll put them on par with invention and still allow the people to make some money no need for datacores or the other headaches of inventionpersonally i dont mind the t2 bpos the way they are and no i dont own any however if there is to be a solution this seems like the most viable one
id like to see this idea sentry drones being tractorable for the sake of picking them up quicker heck i wouldnt mind if they came offline forced into passive or something while in tractor and then back to normal when the tractor is off
i would like everything to open in seperate windowscurrently map and pi opens in the main eve window thus in front of your ship but in back of all other open windowsthis is very annoying one has to closeminimize all other open windows to view map or pii know you can close all windows with shortcut but you still have to open them again seperatelythus i would like map and pi and any other future stuff to open in a seperate windows and not on the eve main backgroundhope csm could bring this to the attention of ccp
change tower forcefield mechanics by adding new settingsallow a setting that would keep pilots below a certain alliancecorp standing from being allowed inside the forcefield regardless of if they have the pos password this could also be used to allow pilots above a certain standing access without having to hand out an easily stolen passwordthis would increase the safety that is meant to be provided by pos forcefields since passwords are of very little security in eve when it comes to large groupsalliances
i propose a change to wardec mechanics similar to how its 50mil x number of wars active how about also add in 50mil x number of sov systems the alliance controls the idea being if you have sov systems people wanting to damage that alliance should rather be going out to their sov systems to mess with the alliance ofcourse the change isnt exactly barring themthe change though would cost the aggressor like 25bil to wardec say goons or solar now the new change would create an effect that people who hate to be wardecced would now be looking to get out to 00 to take a couple systems to get some more protection from wardecs suddenly there are giant increase of people in 00 trying to take systems large increase of competition in holding sov systems makes those large vast alliances to shrinkbasically wars then are setup are then most likely against people who are actually in empire
careful i made this very suggestion and the amount of emo rage tears from the super power blocks was overwhelmingbut yeah pos jump bridges are one of the cancers that is ing this game over
removing pos jump bridges would still leave titan jump bridges in the game so the smaller aliances would find themselves at a disadvantage so while i agree that in principle movement of large fleets shouldnt be so easy i dont think that removing jbs is a fair way to deal with the problemthere are other options  give jbs a cooldown period so that you cant move hundreds of ships through them in a second stop capitals from using jump bridges too
i agree maybe removing jump bridges would be a bit extreme but they need a change weather its like the one suggested above that only alliance members can use the jump bridge but move fleets around so easily is not good for the gamei would be happy to remove both titan and jump bridges but any change that stopped people being able to cover so much space so easily would be welcomed
ok you havent read or understood what i said about the pos that would hold sov if someone shot it you wouldnt lose sov your pos would be reinforced like any other pos then if its destroyed after it comes out of reinforced mode then you would lose sov this would still give you plenty of notice to form a fleet and defend your home this would hopefully encourage more pvp and at a smaller scale so hopefully more fun for both sides and allow others the actual chance to take and hold sov and stop bigger alliances holding more space than they needthe simple fact with probing is it is too simple and totally takes out a valid pvp tactic and like you said it is sad that the only pvp fleets today are high buffer high ehp ships with as many logistics as you can get i prefer close range fights and small roaming gangs but i also understand and see that sniping has virtually been removed from the game what harm would it do if it was slightly harder to probe ships so quickly all that would happen is that we would get another valid fleet tactic for pvp and that cant be a bad thing can it
i agree with this a timer after each ship would be good say a minute but may result in small gangs having to wait 10 minutes for their friends to get through sov needs to be changed somehow to make it possible for the small 100200 man alliances to nibble up the worse space at the edges alliances should be focused in small areas developing it and using it at all timesprobing i think the new probing system is far far better than the old previously i just drop probes go afk and come back to see if the target has fled or not now its interactive i constantly persue the target with my probesi do agree that perhaps its too easy to get warp in on people on grid but the probe is more that long rage bs fleets are going unsupported really they should have logistics and smaller support im not a fan of lr bs fleets though they just sit at a distance aligned and warp at first sign of trouble  i prefer the close range brawl
my proposal is to bring that very same thing to all the empire and npc stations allow people to go around and attack the station services to disable them with no reaction from faction navies or anything it just gives everyone in the system the right to attack moreover there needs to be additional services disablable such as agent comms i think this would be a hilariously funny thing mission runners and everyone would want them not destroyed but people can go around doing great disruption
go ahead and do this but make sure the people shooting the stations get shot up by concord aint gonna happen
0as it stands the bellicose intended to be a gang support cruiser is the most rarely used matari cruiser while the other races share the same cruiser concept the ewar that caldari gallente and amarr bring to the table are significantly more potent in both power and flexibility of encounters and fleet composition these being jamming sensor damping and tracking disruption respectively therefore i propose that the painting bonus currently on the bellicose be swapped to a less potent version of extended web range that its tech ii variants rely onthis would accomplish several thingsit would make the bellicose much more usable in fleets and soloit would allow pilots training to use a rapier or huginn a chance to practice while flying a bellicoseit would make matari pilots more useful as an ewar fleet option rather than automatically discounting matari ewarthoughtsdiscussionflames below
supportedsmall change but it would help
this has been voiced over and over and should really be easy to implement but ccp never managed to get around to do thisthere was plenty of feedback along those lines the last time ccp touched the scanning interfacei think the only change that finally made it besides ccps own favoured changes in the probes scanning fx cause it was crippling fps was the buttonlocationmove of the destroy probes icon from next to recover probes one overif i remember correctly this took them around 612 monthstldr dont hold your breath
yeahif the probe arrows arent blending into the background they are effectively hidden by the horizon shadow oh oops i have to look from below now not from above just paint the probe graphics neon green or something
10
to be fair that argument isnt valid because in a manner of speaking you would be saying that armor repairers and shield boosters are a reason resists shouldnt be in
the problem with cap protection is that unless the capacitor of the target can be depleted to 1 or less the ship can effectively use most modules on larger ships 5 cap might not be enough for some modules yes but they arent dead in the water either the point of a neuts arent to reduce the enemy cap some but to hopefully reduce it to nonemaking the ship an easier targetif you make it where ships can maintain a certain amount of cap you effectively render capwarfare modules uselessnow if you were to propose a boost to caprechargers or similar modules on certain ships or the ability to fit a single capacitor bonus module effectively give up a slot for more cap stability then maybe itd be okexcept we have these things called rigs cap boosters and others that do this alreadyas it stands cap related modules are fine there are various threads on balancing neuts and nos though amarr do get the short end of the stick when it comes to cap but youll notice that capwarfare is also their specialty they are far from being obsolete in battle pvp or pve but like each race require their own kind of fitting and handling to ward off threats such as neutsor at least outlast them
being an active tanker with lasers i do understand the hurt problem with neuts isnt just that they drain you down to 0  but once there you cant get back out when the cap drops below the sweet spot your recharge is completely nerfed its not difficult to keep a ship at critical cap once its down there even if they turn off all their modules you may be able to squeeze off a few halfhearted laser shots but a drained ship is pretty much dead i never really liked the inevitability of neuts most ewar can if not be countered at least be waited out neuts cant be waited out once they get you you are gonenot sure what to do about it though if anythingin the meantime i guess we have to pack vampires and boostersi suppose the problem could be affected by moving the sweet spot for cap recharge from 30 to 0 itd mean you can get more modules to kick in between the neuts thats a major change though and removes quite a bit from the game not so sure id be willing to support that even though i usually am flying amarrian ships
this exactly
youd only be getting your possible recharge window if the attacker is so daft as to cycle all his neuts at the exact same time when spaced out a bit over time youll never get your cap back in as long as youre still neuted  as it should be
what you are asking for is an energy neutralizervampire nerf if you have a cap problem then put a cap booster on your ship ccp should not even consider nerfing any electronic warfare right now except ecm
why should they nerf ecm instead of putting a cap booster on your ship fit eccm
yep
eve is an odd game of unintended consequences even though neither gallente ships nor hybrid weapons have received any direct nerfs in the last two years they lag significantly behind projectiles and lasers in the current environmenti contend that part of the reason for this is the interaction between webs microwarpdrives and scrams prior to the nano nerf webs made the target 90 slower scrams didnt affect microwarpdrives which continued to function though signature radius was still a factorafter the web nerf a scrammed and webbed ship goes about 4x fasterbut cannot benefit from a microwarpdrive this seems about equal until you remember that the ship in question is not subject to the signature bloat that a microwarpdrive imposesthe result is that ships which upon close range turrets such as blasters and 90 webs now struggle to hit their targets because their targets are no longer subjected to the signature bloat of their microwarpdrives this needs to be addressedi propose one last change to microwarpdrives ships equipped with a microwarpdrive should experience a partial signature bloat when targeted with a warp scrambler but not warp disruptor i tentatively suggest a 100 increase in signature radius under this effectwhile this wont address any issues of actually getting into range it assures that when a blaster ship tackles its target it will be able to apply the damage
not supported the much better solution is to reduce signature resolution on hybirds by 10 and inc hybirds tracking by 20 this makes hybirds differnt from other gunnery weapon systems and makes them usefull right now they just have all the drawbacks of both projectials and lazers with nothing specal about them
you realize that signature resolution is just tracking in disguise right you just proposed a 33 tracking buff now if you want to boost tracking by 33 thats fine  go ahead and make a separate proposal  but dont disguise it with changing the signature resolution which is standardized among all turrets
adding a static effect similar to that of a tp might work for blasters but it also works for everything else and probably better than that which it is intended forimagine rocket boats if this was done or sm pulseac boats for that mattertweaking blasters is a matter of adjusting their attributes not making sweeping changes that substitute an ewar module and makes large hull  small hullgiving them a 1520 increase to damage mod and boosting the straightline speed of the blaster ships or similar changes are much more likely to solve the blaster problem and doesnt require a massive balancing effort to repair the damage afterwards
your argument for the change was that specifically hybrids are underpowered now you want to buff all turretsalso users of mwd are already penalized no need to increase that rip miner is correct buffing hybrid tracking or make hybrid ammo influence tracking like was suggested in a proposal a while ago is a cleaner solution
not hidding it its not tracking it will not work with tracking mods and it makes up for some of the signature problems your posting about with out adding dps to every weapon system in the game like your wanting to do
i do like the ideal of hybird ammo influence tracking but thats just riping off of projectial weapon system i suggested what i did in order to make hybirds differnt for the other two gunnery systems hell if it was up to me i would also change there reloadload time to 5 sec just to be differnt as well but thats me lol
its not the same reduced signature increases accuracy against all ships but no change for larger increased tracking affects everything
urgh no the misconception that sig res is different from tracking comes up every week and is wrong every time i have no idea where it comes fromsig resolution is just tracking speed by another name
at this point it is very good to remember the suggested problem doesnt only concern blasters but all weaponsblaster ships seem to kill stuff just fine to me not being able to wtfbbq everything with megathron isnt main problem we have here in my opinion just to give an example even autocannons have problems hitting small stuff using afterburner even if they were webbed and i am still not sure if its a problem
quite right i speculate that it has to do with explosion radius being capped in its comparison to signature radius in the missile damage formula indeed turret signature resolution is just a disguise tracking modifier
how would said change interact with missile boats if you can demonstrate that it will not be a huge boost to missiles and throw that mechanic out of balance you have my support that said it would make all frigates running mwds easy picking for all missile ships a heavy missile has an explosion radius of 125m hitting say a rifter with a heavy missile will do much less damage receiving a large reduction around 60ish from having a small sig radius without counting speed now with an mwd turned off the same rifter will take only 30ish reduced damage from said missile in effect increasing damage against small mwd touting targets with these missiles by about 1218 this is i believe a serious problem d
voting against current system works fine take some risk and go get it yourself
i agree that is the risk you have leaving stuff in a null sec station that is why i always stored my assets in a container anchord right next to the pos gun batterieson a side note i do however think that jump clones should have a remote self destruct due to the fact that you cannot sell or have them moved not to mention if your jc is killed on the way out it consumes your medical clone instead of putting you back into your body
not supported thats the risk you take for living in 00 and not paying attention when your alliance is going to loose a station system there are multiple reinforcement timers which allow you ample time to get your stuff outalso even if you cant get in a station if you have items in there you can still sell them to the locals on contract or using the remote trade skills
well in this case youd get the equivalent of a level 1 mission from your level 4 agent with the same rewardsofc using a l1 agent and sitting in a golem will get you a level 1 missioni like the idea of intelligent agents of course though i dont run missions ofc even if you set yourself neutral prompting solely pirate faction missions for your faction  empire enemies if running for pirates ect youll still take that faction hit every time your core faction standing goes up regardless
as far as your smarter agents i dont think so for your neutrality while i really like this idea it isnt likely to happen this game rewards thinking so if you constantly blast the living daylights out of the opposing empire factions you are gonna be hunted by them anyways you get the nice tag isk so theres a compensationdont get me wrong i hate antifaction missions and wish they would be shifted over to fw but it isnt likely to happen agents loyal to a given faction are gonna have you destroy the opposing faction sometimes as well as the piratesnot supported
and a level 4 storyline every 60 minutes
my first post may have been asking for too much i guess what it boils down to is just make it so you dont loose standing for declining faction missions as for currior missions why not have the agent just scan your cargo and if you dont have enough you can freely declinethe bigest issue is the 3 hour delay and the 25x standing loss for deslining missions if you are running a blitz you will in the end loose more standing than you make unless you have multiple agents
definately supporting this
easily supported its not like ud make much harm from it
i would rather see all jump clones removed and new implant set mechanic introduced where you can install new implant set every x hours on station with no limit for number of sets infomorph whatever skill could reduce cost or time limits etcregardless current system annoyingly limits the way you can use implants if nothing else at least lets have more jump clones even though its not best waysupporting basic idea concerning implants
i agree with everything you said except that i do not think that a bunch of new skills be made only a single skill need be made called bounty hunting its prerequisites must be tough though social v and ded connections v or something like that also the skill could be high rank so its not an easy train to lvl 4
not supportedi myself am unemployed at the moment and thus spend alot of time on eve this would make it so that it punishes me for spending time mining or just relaxing chatting or handling corp businesscrud just realized i didnt post with my mainmain is icewolfdw
ideas like this are why ccp goes to the assembly hall when they want some laughstldr op proposes stupid mechanic that would only penalize legitimate players
i second this one sometimes i dont play for weeks or even months and sometimes i spend all bloody weekend on i do not wish to be limited for what i have already payed rl cash for
i could do this if its just on plex but thats going to devalue plex alot and rmt wins
a good question develdrin which illustratesyour understanding of the differences between assembledand packaged ships in the item database however it also illustrates that you didnt read the original proposal that says this information need not be preserves when the ship is packaged i bet the registration number couldnbe generated on demand by hashing the primary key of the item table
theres simply no reason to implement something like this that isnt fairly pointless andor rather silly
you need to bring more then spotting and killboard trackingthose uses are slim and not worth the implementation effort imhothe repackaging problemsolution also invalidates the use of this for the often voiced wish for manufacturer labelled ships
you are absolutely correct i missed that in the op my apologies
this is the smallest and easiest thing to implement from a more extensive set of ideas ive been bouncing around registration number and assembly date and perhaps the name of the pilot who asssembled the ship are all likely to be easy options compared to more extensive changesreally unless you want the entire ship market to move to contracts the idea of manufacturers names being attached to ships isnt happening
i see no reasion what so ever that prevents you from making your avatar in the normal creator and using the incarna creator for your station avatar so what if the porterate looks a bit off from your avatar it wouldnt be all that hard to keep the origional char images and just let them make a incarna model seperatly the players keep their identities and have more options for creating a character portrate and the people who want to use the wis function can make somthing that looks close enough to get by without having to redo the entire damn thing
no
i support the implementation of the authenticator assuming that you can register it with multiple accounts i have used these in the past and it helps a lot the main issue that i can foresee is a lot of us create our accounts here on the eve online site and thus dont have a hard printout of anything that is individualistic ex a product key so that if you loose your authenticator or misplace it where ccp would be able to verify that you are the appropriate individual that has legal custody of the account

considering the whole new eden background stuff the limited options currently are seriously weak not even speaking about some deepimmersion rpg concerns which i dont have here but seriouslywtf ccp for pod pilots who spend the majority of their time in some goo that is not tanning lotion to my knowledge dont tell me by genetic engineering all humans now have a natural tan why theyd even want it serious brainfart this yeah noone ever can change their hair color in new eden right i mean restricting unecessarily stuff like that what kind of reasoning is behind that such a basic thing as hair color choices its not like we have a medieval setting mmo here ccp do weand how is this supposed to be a merely cosmetic change these days it does not determine your start in the eveverse any more which racebloodline you pick and what skills you start with true but this should not really be a justification to simply eliminate a couple of those i mean if i had wanted to look like mr achura centerfold i could have picked it at char creation back in the day i think this is seriously limiting identfication patterns with the character and thus not a good move in terms of customer content and yes this are all minor points in the great scheme of things none impacting the spaceship flying by itself but the trend is simply wrong if ccp gimps as simple a thing as a continuity of the look of the avatar some people have been rolling for years with and im not talking about some minor change in nose angle or something its basically looking like some avatars will be totally impossible to even remotely being recreated it can hardly be a technical issue its not like development has backpedaled on this has it at least they should keep the same detailoptions level as it used to be not step back to a midlast decade level of charavatar design
i just tested the new creator and came up with somthing that looks like a mutated gengas kahn with down syndrome not to mention the complete lack of black or really dark brown hairbiggest issue is that facial decorations are missing the funky gallente visors the amarrian viels the caldari metal plates replaced with  brutor sun glasses  what the  ccp give us back our  i cant belive i am saying this shudder give us back our bling
i was bouncing this of a few peoplewhat if concord didnt necessarily respond to just every attackif you are in an npc corp you cant be wardecced but you have to pay tax concord always responds to players in npc corps because those corps pay concord plenty of isk to do sowhat if it was that if you are in a player corp you had to pay concord a fee per month or what not for them to help you perhaps several levels of protection like you pay them more if you want them to respond to attacks against corp members by other members if you didnt pay concord a fee concord wont intervene but the local navy will like at a gate and what not the fee should be cheaper than npc tax since players corps can still be wardecced but enough so that interesting changes will take placeim sure a lot of people will hate this but i am just throwing it out there just an idea of sorts perhaps someone like this could be applied to the local channel as welledit the middle portion was about extending this concord protection to player corps into low sec to varying degrees what i dont know basically player corps will be forced to pay to safely or somewhat safely operate in low sec regardless of how pirates may feel this will definitely increase low sec populations being in a player corp will now become a huge advantage though i do acknowledge something would have to be done to make sure danger and risk are still omnipresent
how about something simple like being able to bribe agents
i like it but there also needs to be somthing based on skill points so that you cant just buy the isk
drafts of minutes for almost all meetings have been completed and the ones that havent are just hanging fire on getting some materials from ccp ccp should start their review and comments on 1311  how long after that the minutes are released depends on the responsewe would have liked to get them out faster but realistically the holidays do put a crimp in the time available by people to work on this

kill you twice just because i think you are the most insipid idiot i have ever ran across on the eve forums
i can safely say i wouldnt giving a flying csm is a joke already
i would sub up all my alts again to vote so you could fly to iceland and confirm what everyone already knowsthat the csm is a ccp marketing ploy that literally doesnt influance ccp to do a single thing they didnt already plan on doingall the rest is just material to farm out to gaming sites and for our lulz enjoyment on the forums when the mintutes are posted
i would probably spend the rest of my life in deep contemplation trying to figure out how on gods green earth anybody could think you would be in any way shape or form useful as a csm i would probably give up after about 5 years into it and submit myself to a mental institute after realizing that there is no hope for humankind
so no one voted for you
cry
he seems to have it spot on what the csm is really what have they done they have done so much that i didnt even care to know that anyone actually follows what they do anymore until nerds post csm is a joke always have been always will be they do look good though on that mmo blog portraying how ccp listens to the customer yet year after year the corp interface still sucks the ov still sucks everything that the customer finds out to be good gets nerfed yeah the csm rocks  right

any topics about drone implantsnext patch they are introducing 6 missile and gun implants and still no imps for drones
i agree that there is a problem here nearly 100 pages of thumbs point in this directioni dont get the big deal about putting a big bunch of new code into a so called expansion on a specific date all at once couldnt there be a more dynamic approach when a team is ready to go live with a project cant they just put up a patch to include the new content when its ready the bigger changes could still be marketed as the shiney new expansion the smaller changes could be patched as needed i would rather download a content patch than a repair patch this way projects dont have to add their code to the heap until theyre ready or is this a problem in that programmers like artists are never finished with their work maybe they could put up a page that shows the approximate readiness of each project in  or manhours or something to keep us anxiously waiting subscribers from popping an implant from frustration and maybe keep the employees on trackim sure its difficult to get such a creative bunch to work on mundane tasks or rework old code when they have so many new ideas they prefer to work on this is what good management is about though isnt iti could also see a use for questionairs to get a better understanding of what pilots usedont usewould like to use more but dont because its broke or not what they were expecting possibly put in a popup on login that asks a pertinent question regarding a feature in question as well as a link to a full page of probing questions generally try to discover where the frustration factors are for users to be used to retain current users i have quit eve 2 or 3 times out of frustration eve has a very powerful base of loyal fans that i doubt dust will ever have ive seen many businessed fail for underestimating this loyalty factor csm has become a good step in the right direction in this regardi know you ccp have a direction you wish to go keep up the good work i only ask that you strive to find a good balance between fresh content and where weve come fromwhew i feel better now back to lurking about

when in siege dreads are stationary so the ability of capital guns to track them is not an issue do you think this bonus would be necessary for dreads not in siege modeno damage reduction occurs until dreadnought sig radius goes below the bomber explosion radius of 225km thats still low enough to mitigate 85 of the damage from an antisupercap torp with a 15km explosion radius
oh my goodness almost 200 replies and only 35 votes for this idea i think it is safe to say this idea is bad dont feel bad honey you tried your best and that is what matters so stop bringing this back to the top and it is time to flush this ok 3 toffee stunner
it is a good idea and your immature gloating doesnt change that factanyone with a brain can understand the supercarriers are too good against subcaps and thats not their role
oh my goodness a replier that hasnt read any of the thread he is ridiculing vast majority are actually in favour of capital rebalance we just bicker about how to go about itso fear not you get to fly your broken sc for a little while longer with no chance of loosing it barring supreme idiocy

funny how that csm conversation turned out they actually judged the proposal by the topic aloneimagine ccp worked with a fast food chain which was popular in most parts of the world and delivered if it became common knowledge a person could buy stuff from the chain using isk the game would become more popularits like a restaurant you dont make money of the food you make it of the alcohol so sell the food and make sure they drink in eves case food would be plex for pizza which is what will attract alot of players then when they play eve they will stay careless of if they like or dislike evewith so many obese people wanting free food this would be perfect and a cool feature with incarna i think the csm need to look into this and stop judging a thread literally by its topicjust because blizzard havent done this idea doesnt mean it should be ignored think out of the box
are you guys actually serious about this
this should go well with incarna walk into a pizza chain in a station somewhere place your order and 5 minutes later your door bell rings d

anyone not understanding how stupid these two suggestions are especially side by side really shouldnt be commenting on turret changes
are you suggesting that hybrids will be op tracking wise specifically against smaller targets im not a great eft person so i can only guess thats the direction they would be headed with these 2 changes
no hes stating that anyone suggesting changes to tracking and signature resolution doesnt understand how turret tracking works and is therefore a singularly bad person to be proposing changes to game balance
think ive said this many many times but ill say it againthe way to fix hybrids is to make them hybrid weapons this is very difficult i would say impossible to do by only changing the weapons stats themselves the main problems we have are that hybrids are two very diferent weapon systems used by two different races in two different ways and the bonuses and stats on some ships are way off the mark to use hybrids effectively gallente blaster ships should be the fastest straight line ships in the game but with low agility they basically charge into range but can be easily outmanouvered by some clever piloting now the weapons themselves the answer like i said is to make them hybrids of lasers and projectiles to do this we have to mess with the ammo as it is the variable of the weapon system hybrids need ammo that does many things but doesnt change the damage profile from kinetic and thermal for exampleone ammo type will offer low damage with a tracking bonusone ammo type will offer very heavy damage with a rof fire penalty alpha strikeetc etcive also noticed that there are stats called base shield damage and base armour damage is it possible to mess with these stats that the ammo has to create an ammo type that does heavy shield damage but low armour damage and vice versa
ty goes to reread how turret tracking works
 1i really like this idea it certainly makes hybrids unique it certainly creates new pvp tacticsi compared rails to autocannonsacs in every size have a higher damage modifier have higher tracking have better rangethat pretty well everything in t
you would think something like this ccp would give it a priority

this is the only posable improvement to wardecs and another fine isk sink too i think
i used to be in a small corperation called rmt research and mining was all we did politically nutral and since we bought most of the ore from the market we neither made friends or enemies that didnt stop a random greifing corp from deccing us 3 seperate times but i will not point finger i am all for raising the wardec price war deccing is somthing that really should only be used as a tool to harrass competing supply lines in highsec durring a long term territory war and not as a tool for random violance pirates should move out to low sec where they belong wardeccers are carebears of piracy they are like the highschool gangstas who want to push the little kids around the playground and act all tough but are too scared to set foot on the streets where the real gangs roam for fear of stepping on someones toes
yes but how often do you bribe some one  not pay them and then have absolutly nothing come of it atm most decing that i have seen is a corp declares the dec fights for one or two days then fails to pay concord and the wardeck is invalidated i mean the shady guy at concord ant to smart about taking the bribes is he
support thisit would help make some of the ganking corps actually think a little bit before wardeccing another corporation as it is right now they just wardec whoever whenever because the cost is so low couple guys can make 50m isk in an hour nevermind a weekpersonally though i think the price should scale although by what metrics im not sure perhaps the best option would be some kind of bidding system where the wardeccing corporation pays say 50 million for a week and then the wardecced corp can cancel it immediately for 50 cost  25m then the wardeccing corp can try and push the wardec again paying say 100m and continue as such until someone decides that they dont have enough money to push that wardec throughperhaps have a buyout price set at something very large like a few billion isk that guarantees the aggressor a week of combaton the plus side it could also end up being a massive money sink for the economy as all this cash just disappears down concords gaping maw
my experience in eve show that corpalliance leaders are very reluctant to start empire wars even the hardcore pvp alliances like it never bother with empire warsto me thats untapped potential we need to do something to encourage more wars not less we need more pvp in empire
faction warfarewhat you seem to be advocating  gankers killing carebears in high sec  that can barely be considered pvp as it is yeah shooting a bunch of targets who cant fight back thats really impressive right there these gankers are just carebear pirates who cant or wont hack it in lownull sec i certainly wouldnt miss them
i support this but only if ccp provides something a bit less clunky than the dscanner to use to see if any hostilesneutrals are entering the system whs are one thing but to have all of space without something that allows for the detection of hostile or neutral players going about wouldnt be a great ideaedit the above is only for high sec and low sec didnt see the null sec part null sec probably shouldnt have local or anything to make up for it
get down theres a sniperalso i approve of this idea
people living in wspace also dont use jump gates so to make things even lets remove all jump gates from nullsec
i support killing local chat once a replacement that isnt as easy for bots to exploit has been made
as someone who made a lot of isk without ever owning a t2 bpo there is absolutely no reason to remove them that isnt selfish and every reason to keep them from the perspective of making eve a better place not supported
i am not a member of csm so no worries there as far as stations and titans go you actually can get them without buying from another player i have built a station and i have lost it as well it is located in 6tyrx starsystem in esoteria i personally know a player who made his own titan all the way everything mined even his own minerals over the past few years he has got it without having to buy from another player one day something will go wrong and it will be killed lost with all the hard work gone into getting it unlike t2 bpos that are safe in only safe place there is in eve in a personal hangar inside a station
why the starting 8 if the idea is to put them on par with invented bpc 4 or 3 mepe without research would be more logic and probably easier to implement than keeping the possibility to research them but capping it
its a hard life for the modern eve pilot sitting in stations trading hiding from wars being bored all the time spinning ships is all you have to do but even that takes work this should be remedied and i have just the idea to fix itship autospinthis toggle option causes the camera to automatically spin the shop so that you dont need to go through the timeconsuming effort of spinning it yourself options for autospin could include a speed setting determining how fast the ship spins a toggle for clockwise and counterclockwise spin and even a special randomspin option which quickly turns the camera in a random direction by a random amount just like a player would do with the mouse not only does this make the life of the stationsitter much easier but it keeps them healthier by warding off the scourge of carpal tunnel syndrome it could also make a handy screen saversupport for this idea means you truly care about the quality and immersion of the eve universe

a brief summary of t2 bpos vs inventionbpo build faster since they can be pe researched requires less materials since they can be me researched sensitive to balance changes hello deimos bpo owners expensive to aquire does not cause rsiinvention potentially more profitable since you can invent whatever is most profitable at the time and in far larger quantities mostly immune to the balance changes since youre not locked into producing one item type reasonably cheap to get into causes rsimost industrialists will recognise that t2 bpos are more or less balanced from an isk making perspective but its fairly clear that the system is unfairly stacked against the wrists of inventers to remedy this situation i would like to ccp to consider revamping the industry interface so that building from a t2 bpo requires 1020 times more clicking which should make it roughly equal with inventionalternatively ccp could just fix the industry interface so that invention is less of a click fest
i am here and my pitchfork is sharpi dont think 20 times more cliks would be reasonable though lets make it so that bpo owners can only build one item at a time then its not a passive income hey it would be cool  sort of like training short skills before skill que in a more serious manner i would prefer compete industry interface overhaul with needed changes within some of the fields in industry that are not quite working out properly invention vs bpo and more importantly supply side of t2 materials

dear sweet zombie jesus yesalso lol  those who didnt bother to read the op
why not change the invention mechanic so that for every successful invention there is a small chance that it will create a t2 bpo instead of bpc

signed but i wish ccp would actually fix thishaving recently made my own little corp and trying to be nrds i discovered it only took 2 weeks or so to max out 300 contacts 9 of which are blue the rest are redsccp  unless you want to make nrds simply impossible this needs fixing last i checked eve was about choice  this is a crippling game mechanic for nrdsersand if alliances can have thousands of contacts its silly that corporations cant it just becomes a 1b isk fee for a increased contacts listmaybe even introduce a diplomat skill that allows players to train up an increased contact list if you want to minimize the amount of people who want more contactsbut if the reason really is server loadlag then a personal local standings file would at least let me limp by not an ideal solution but so long as i have something
it seems a lot of recursive looping happenings in standings they made lowsec lag to death at one stage with fwgenerally if the number of standings needs to be limited then the algo that handles them needs to be changed
i decided to actually read warfare  tactics and to my surprise the caldari  gallente prop was too delicious caod can learn a few things from them i even read ign and they are pretty good posters too been really enjoying these sub forums a lotanyway the wt section has too many things unrelated to fw and i think for fw to attract more attention it should have its own section i would hardly say this is a major problemyay  nay
i have no interest either way but seeing as theyre working on a new forum they might as well throw this in with it
a one minute timer afte each jump wouldnt work it would just make it frustrating to use jump bridges i think only people from the same alliance that the jump bridge belongs to is one of the better suggestions but i would rather see them removed but thats personal preferenceas for the long range bs needing support yes they do but in most cases it wouldnt work you would have to split your gang between snipe bs and support ships so your damage would be decreased and a drake blob would just jump in kill your support fleet probe your snipers warp dictors up to them at this point your snipers have to either run or die and eithewr way your support gets slaughtered because the hostile fleet didnt need to split their fleet and just all brought the same type and thats how it is today

what would we do if someone disabled the agent service in motsu there would be 500 mission runners fitting rr to their bss to get it backor the market service in jita could the server cope with 2k people trying to rep a station simultaneously with drones toointeresting proposition in highsec wardecs but its probably too hard to incap a service to make it viable for highsec wardecs
im sorry but where is the logic in this suggestion why would not faction navies react to stations belonging to their corps being shot up besides there are no real practical applications for this save griefing it really dies right there how on earth would it help hisec wardecs the wts will just go to another station in the same system or to another system on top of that the people shooting the station for strategical reasons will have to deal with neutrals shooting them along with their wartargets it helps nobody
i support this  but only if you only allow faction militia to do it and only to their primary opponent gallente  caldari amarr  minmatars stations and make it so that the higher the sec status the greater the faction navys response ie in a 05 a few bses supported by cruisers frigs turn up in a 10 around 50 bses  lots of support turn up or something like that at any rate would be cool
let me just stop you right theremr edwards the op does not deal in logic he deals in troll hes well known for it if you simply assumed that everything thread he posts is a troll thread you would be better off and waste less of your own timethank you you may now continue
i want destructible 00 outpostsdestructible with all stuffs in station hangars
one thing that can become rather tedious with ingame communication in eve is the sheer abundance of chat windows you can get piled up over time the main reason is that they all have to live in a single horizontal tab whose name and meaning can easily be blotted out as the line growsit is possible to remedy this in part by having separate windows that hold different categories of chats but this leads to multiwindow management lots of minimization accidental closings and other problemsi therefore propose the following fixgive us the ability to activate an uncloseable window which can be closed by explicitly doing so in settings but not from the conventional x button this window should be divided into two parts1 a topdown treelike structure that organizes chats according to category or just in line with the root branch think of the way filesystems are often represented for example in older versions of windows and on linux desktops it would be easy to get an overlook of all the chats in the tree for example you could make categories to organize your chats in and they would blink as normal when new posts have arrived2 the standard chat interface as it is now this should be changeable by clicking another chat in the tree mentioned abovei believe this would make mananging multiple chats much much easier and would be a helpful update for the game ui
a simple text field viewable in the contacts tab under people  places window this contact field would be available next to each contact in a users list a 50 character field to create notes will greatly improve contact management for those of us with more than a dozen contactsi realize a notes feature exists under show info  notes but this is not quickly accessible and doesnt assist in contact management in fact its quite unusablethis is a simple modification to the ui that greatly increases usability perhaps not many people on board with it now but i believe once implemented it would be used by many pilots
useful idea but since ccp have steadfastedly refused to give us the requested contacts folders i doubt theyll make time to do this
yep make the existing notes be shown in the contacts list when you click a contact in a window below just like with emails
contact labels are on sisi right now iirc they should be deployed on tq with the final part of incursion
can my maller have a 6th turret and a dmg rather than cap use bonus first
lets focus on the discussion at hand if you dont mind my good sir that said support me and ill support your maller pallow me to stress i have never seen a bellicose in pvp evar except when fools such as i fly them because i love the ship underpowered or no p the only time a bellicose is ever chosen over another cruiser isa the pilot is young and doesnt know what to look for orb they cant afford a stabber or rupture even then its still fairly expensive especially considering its uselessness it costs roughly 3 mil for which only 1 mil more you can get a stabber or for the same price you can get an arbi
i would like to see the belicose get some love but i would advocate for keeping the target painter bonus and turning it into a missile boat swith the 5 projectile rof bonus to a missile rof bonus and give it at least one more missile hardpoint the target painter fits better with missiles
that is true and i would not ming the swap in weapon systems however the reasoning behind making the change is not necessarily to increase its viability as a solo boat although it would have that side effect but rather to make a platform for pilots to learn on as a stepping stone between the bellicose and rapierhuginn additionally the painter bonus is rarely wanted by fleets and if it is they could as easily choose a vigil for the exact same effect by increasing range on webs for the bellicose fleets would have reason to bring this frigate killing machine to the tablecheers thanks for the commentpapa
if anything i would advocate giving the vigil a web range bonus so match up with its speed as a specialist tackler having target painters on the vigil does not help frigate sized weapon systems but on the belicose heavy missiles and heavy assault missiles can both benefit from a target painter when used against small targets this combined with the decent sized drone bay would make the belicose an effective cruiser sized antifrigate platform which the minmatar dont really have caracal vexor  arbitrator are hugely effective in antifrigate roles
there should be an option to remove all labels in that screen as wellsometimes the labels on moons  planets  and other get in the wayi am only interested in the sig im scannign  i could care less what the labels are on the rest of the objects
ok so with the most recent patch mwd got a shiny new icon and it looks pretty cool bt how about giving the mwd when active a effect over the ship similar to how it looks on the icon
engine ing trails
so it seems there is no easy way to just move home with a freighter then ccp couldnt just make some sort of special containerlike one that takes say 23 times more space than the ship reflecting the fact a rigged ship would need to be more carefully packaged maybe styrofoam or giant bubblewrapanyway i disagree with this thread somewhat as i dont think this should be such an exclusive feature to be a tech 2 ship there should be some more standard way of doing it i would be most dissapointed if i was forced to train for a tech 2 ship just so i can save an hour going back and forth
well i have to admit 2 weeks until we find out what is going to be in there i hope ccp can pull off their miracle mode and include some cool stuff
i like to thank you all for responding with respectful and informative manner
it does work with tracking mods you recieve the same benefitand it does increase tracking versus larger ships as well
buffing npc corps is the opposite of what we need
sorry i mistakenly deleted the middle portion of the text and didnt realize it till now i failthe middle portion was about extending this concord protection to player corps into low sec to varying degrees what i dont know basically player corps will be forced to pay to safely or somewhat safely operate in low sec regardless of how pirates may feel this will definitely increase low sec populations being in a player corp will now become a huge advantage though i do acknowledge something would have to be done to make sure danger and risk are still omnipresent
what about a skill that increases the rate of standings gain from grinding missions in the first place that skill would represent your charismatic ability to influence people through your social circles then perhaps we can add another skill that increases the perceived standings so you have to grind even less to get to the good agents this skill would represent your aptitude at building social networks to increase the number of connections in high places you havewe dont want to have pilots regaining faction standings too quickly if they do something foolish like run lots of missions against that faction for the enemy factions navy so lets say level 5 of the social skill would boost your standings gains by about 14  its a significant increase over the base standings grind without making the grind a joke then the connections skill could give you about a 15 improvement in perceived standings which should be enough to skip right over level 1 and perhaps even level 2 missions if you know what youre doingwhy would an experienced player be allowed to walk into any corporation to take the cream missions without the grind to get to talk to the good mission agents
well i am not saying they should get the cream missions but i am saying that l1  l4 is like levels the actual missions and rewards are determined by the quality of the agent if the quality was set to effect mission gains in a much more significant manner you could have a player start at a tier 4 agent of any corp have a challanging mission but get crappy rewards the rats would have less loot and little salvagebut in real life corperate politics corperations hate each other and the administration the average employee is just a tradeable comodity and if you end up moving to another region even though you did blow up alot of their ships they dont see you as an individual they will see you as a nameless ship flying the flag of the compititionthus when you come to them they will say hey here is an opertunity to deprive our rival of a very effective asset so lets hire him his portfolio is impressive
op is officially clueless after that last postyou sir do not get eve you dont get the pvp side of it and you dont get the carebear side of it i would suggest saving yourself much butthurt now and finding a new mmo
personally i just say use the report isk spammer i know it was put there for the rmt jihad but they are spamming and they are stealing isk so i think it is apropriate to bring it to ccps attentionhowever the idea of systematically muting people with enough bad rep can easily be abused there are many corperations and alliances that have plenty of members to perform a dos style griefing attack leading to false mutings

i think what he means is a way to bind a group of drones to a hotkey and launches the group that is assigned to a given keyfor example you assign the drones to 2 groups med and liteyou can than right click the drone configuration and assign launch med to ctrlshift1 and launch lite to ctrlshift2 for example
i support this cause
thanks for the supportabout your critics i respectfully disagree locked ships bad once somethings locked in frig combat the fight is mostly over only ten or only quicker than you it becomes really confusing when there are some who pulse the mwdthe solution is to provide a proper filter so that the user is able to exclude ships from his fleetcorpalliance as it currently works with the overview tabs of course for large fleet battles this is less useful but the tactical overlay can be turned off quickly and any client side lag this would generate is therefore not an issueedit on a second thought adding a shortcut to turn on and off the overlay seems a good point for this proposal i will edit the first post accordingly
dr battlesmiththanks for at least supporting the topic i know you arent thrilled with everything in what i propose i just hope we get enough support to have csm take something to ccp but fw changes are bound to happen i agree with you fw complex pvp is the best in the game when you can get it i dont want ccp to completely dump plexing when they eventually revamp fw we need to let ccp know how they can improve plexing in a way that creates more of this great pvp lol you are right its not a big issue but i need to ask why doesnt the military already know where its own military complexes are i mean what kind of sense does that make general talking to pilot soldier we lost all of our military complexes and we need you to go roaming systems to scan them down pilot what do you mean we lost all of our military complexes general whats not to understand soldier i cant find the papers that had their locations now you need to roam around the galaxy and scan them downpilot what cant you telephone the people in the military complexes and have them tell you their locationgeneral the phone numbers were on the papers giving their locations thats why i need you to go warping around the galaxy using your scanner to find them for me pilot well doesnt anyone know the phone numbers to these military complexes general no i lost that paperwork too look just warp to every planet in these 50 systems and hit your system scanner well hit it 2xs at each planet because its sort of hit or misspilot can you at least tell me how many military complexes we have in each system or was that in the paperworkgeneral you guessed it now stfu and go find our military complexes if those politicians ever find out we dont even know where are military complexes are it will be both of our aesso as the pilot i dutifully go out and do this then the next morning guess what he lost the papers again and you have to find all the lost military complexes again and every single day the same thing seems to happen i tend to think the only reason we need to scan down these complexes was because ccp didnt think we had enough uses for the scanner now with wormholes there are more things for people who like launching probes so there is no need for this but actual immersion aside if you have 9 planets in a system then the scanning assuming 1 scan per planet they recommend 2 scans but realistically you will likely just do 1 scan that is 45 minutes if you figure about 20 seconds in between each scan for warping etc that is an extra 3 minutes so if you scan 6 systems that is 45 minutes of doing nothing but warping and scanning
well this would be true if they were unique responses however they arent
well havnt u all noticed they already got nerf dps to sub caps is been cut by 30 if u dont like how the super carriers are now then dont go hunting them for 1114 billion isk id want something that can take on anything out there hence the super capital crying that there to op has been going on since dominion
i think the true question here is how few drakes should be able to kill supercarriersi mean since nc and friends etc can field 1k drakes i think the server should just reset sov as soon as they enter system titans and other capitals should self destruct immediately and pos shields should drop allowing anything inside to be targetedoh and the 600m insurance for a titan loss should be forfieted to the killers allaince to compensate them for the caldari navy missles used to kill the 70b isk machinewhy do we have to constantly dumb down the game to make recruits from something awful able to enjoy itoh and judging from the date of the op i suspect that he is just butthurt
because they cant do that all at once they have to sneak up on it one little nerf at a time until the only thing that matters in a battle is how many three month old players one side has over the otheri say offer them some pureed carrots maybe theyll go awaywindjammer
actually they were nerfed against subcaps by far more than 30 but i think thats just the first step in what should happenas for the dice troll youre in a pretty special place to talk about being butthurt if you honestly view being unable to simply field one type of ship to counter p much anything in the game as dumbing down of eve maybe you should relook into what the concept of dumbing down meansyou should also look into your apoc fits
sounds good to me i also like the dcus give 3 extra drones each  only 1 drone extra per carrier level thing that makes a lot of sense dont bother removing that lowslot on the hel its already so very weak by comparison what we should also be talking about is making slave implants not function on capital ships too
and a billion isk faction bs should be able to kill anything that costs less than that right isk is not now nor has it ever been a balancing factor  to use it as such would mean decoupling all prices from market so they do not fluctuate except when devs wish it soreason for not going hunting i assume you mean failfit ratting sc is that you need your own or a stupendous blob to do anything should you happen to catch oneso you want to balance eve on the basis of what fotm jockeys latch on to every time they get an impulse from a stray neuronthere has only been one occasion where a player entity has been directly responsible for a major game change  wardec system and privateersas for dumbing down  how does asking for changes that makes more than 3 4 counting drakes  ships viable become dumbing down quite the opposite capitals online is boring  whatever change makes it less so is a good change
i still think the hel bonus should be changed to engine trail length per level
i havent read the last 2 or so pages but what would buffing dread dps against supercaps do or maybe a special siege module that works like a cloak toggle onoff but you cant target structures while its active so it doesnt get abused for ninja pos takedownsclose range dreads have dps that almost matches that of a mom but cost and ehp are only 10 of a moms surely there can be something done here to make them into supercap melting glass cannons when used correctly currently this isnt possible because supers melt them too fast as soon as they enter siege no remote reps cant even get outjust an idea i had the other day feel free to figure out everything thats wrong with it psupporting this thread though you might want to rethink the 1 slot on hel i think if it stays like it is while the others lose the slot might make it look like it can compete
incorporating this into the existing siege module via a script perhaps could work but since the balance issue is with supercarriers its surely more appropriate to modify the ships that are causing the problem rather than rearranging everything else to fit in the benefit of the proposed alterations is that it if supercarriers can no longer swat away tacklers and subcaps so freely it helps reestablish the importance of smaller support ships and a balanced fleet composition rather than a 1dimensional just bring more of the biggest ships approach that dominion has introducedplus if supercaps remain as anticapital gankmobiles and capitals become antisupercap gankmobiles the food chain starts to look more like a circle im assuming that the hel will eventually get some sort of reworking of its bonuses andor stats to bring it in line with the rest or that the others will be nerfed down to hel levels seperately from any reworking of supercarrier abilities as a whole if not then you have a point
confirming that spending the most isk on a ship should make it functionally indestructablefits officer mods to a rifter

certainly it was but what this is about is people wanting the cake and eating it  no one not a one has said so much as a peep until now aesthetics or lack thereof is clearly at the very bottom of the list for the people who chose the minmax approach  since a collective shift of this magnitude in personal preferences is unheard of the only thing that remains is that it is opportunistic garbage and should be treated as suchyou chose to buy a speedy car with room for 1 and now that a carpool commuter lane is opening up you suddenly want the mpv as it is better at getting where you need to go  s i say
supported bloodline or race change please
supportedbloodlines do not matter anymore when it comes to game mechanics since neural remaps have been enabled the only factor of choosing specific bloodline is in fact its appearance why would the ppl suffer from being ugly my main character is amarr khanid i chose this bloodline because it looked imo the best of all 3 now they are the worstlooking ones where is their long straight hair and cunning gaze that made them look so evil after 4 hours spend with the new character creator i cant achieve even a half of that feeling to all those who are against because of roleplay issues noone will force you to change your bloodline the choices we made in the past shouldt affect the future in the way we cannot control when creating our character we accepted the way it looked and now  noone asks for our permission  we are forced to look as someone else wants us to opposing to the choice we made the day our character was createdthats why i think we should all get a free bloodline change
it would simply be easier to take into account interracial couples and genetic contamination and just enable all traits in the creator lord knows with how often the races interact by now most genetic traits would have crossed over even if they are recessive simple hereditybut change of bloodline would be a close second

heres a quote from the contest forum thread under faqas well as the official rules it statesso as it stands there isnt anything set in stone to say its to be included bt the prizes are still pretty good
screw facebook
i have no problem with facebook being used as a voting venue but it should not be the only way to vote that is my issue with the thing
nice idea
does this smell to anyone else like a ccp stafferyour comments might carry some water if there was some way to vote other than with facebook regardless of what you say and regardless of whether any of the designs make it into the game this is an eve thing if ccp wanted to open it to the masses outside of eve no problem however to require that something of eve and for eve be exclusively run through facebook is nothing less than an attempt to force subscribers to join facebook and advertise for ccps game at the expense of the subscriber the expense would be contributing to an unethical organization facebook also lets just go ahead and define the subscriber as what he or she is someone who is already paying ccppeople dont want to pay ccp for the game then turn around and have to sign up for something they dont want like facebook in order to participate in all aspects of the game theyre already paying foryou make a big deal about how ccp is a business and how they need to generate more income to make eve a better game where have you been theyve been developing dust 514 and some world of darkness with vampires etc these will eventually hopefully give ccp more money but even dust 514 is only marginally associated with eves content costs of running eve itself have not appreciably increased and those increases that are there are more than made up for by increased subscribers a large portion of the increased revenue is going towards things that may be good for ccp but have little if anything to do with evethese concepts are obvious nothing to be amazed at and are far from short sighted they are in fact the justifiable ire of people ccp should be paying attention to their customerswindjammer
thanks for pointing me to the price section geeshizzleone thing about the contest i noted btw was how well detailed some of the ships are  and how much i liked that  it adds so much more realism with incarna around the corner or at least the new highdef character creator i wouldnt mind if ccps art department started thinking of higherdef ship models as well

while i appreciate ur sentiment im not actually affiliated in any professional manner or manner above being a customer of ccp in any way  and yes youre right about the fact that eveonlines running costs specifically may not have raised that much although a lot of money has been spent on infrastructure to keep blades cool and data flowingquite a few respected eve players have talked about the fact eve online may be benefiting from the development of the side projects youve talked about as modding old systems and code can only get you soo far drawing inspiration and ideas from a fresh modern game build can help a lot and i would not be surprised that the new redesigned systems that have appeared in eve have been first created for these new projects and then ported over to eve when i originally talked about running costs of eve online i didnt specifically mean the upkeep of the servers and its cost in resources i meant all the wages and additional requirements that a much larger team of developers require ive done business models before and when u double and triple an employee base your costs skyrocket quite surprisingly so yes running eve online isnt tooo taxing on icelandic krona but the cost of the increased size of the development staff would be backing ccp into a corner unless they find creative and new ways to reach out to new customers and therefore new subbs and more incomeim just saying that the whole facebook like feature to this competition is the personification of this drive to reach out to new possible customers at little or no cost to ccp unlike front cover spreads and feature previews in magazines which always costs money
all these new social netware data collectors like facebook twitter  co really s u ck they are badi ignore them and nobody will push me ever to use them so i totally agree and i support this1

its a very cool idea but i sincerely doubt it can be done because of server load issues queues etc as mentioned earlierthe current version of this exists a want to buy contract it is highly unlikely that such a contract would pass off easily though as who in their right mind would do the math to see if it is worth selling to it or even doing the math on the final valueso a modification to your proposalbasket contracts i agree it needs a better nameplayer puts on a basket contract that has a list of items that player wants to buythe items are each given a set price not high and low for a viewer to seethe number of units is listed and updates based on sellers filling the quota for a given itemexample basket contractbuyer alias 6322aitems to be boughtx10 stasis webifiers for 500isk eachx5 125mm railgun i for 1500isk eachx30 merlin for 5000isk eachstation jita 44 you get the idearange station mr bob browses the basket contracts and sees somebody is buying stasis webs for 500isk each and he goes wow excellent sale for me he can select on the contract the webs and provided he has them at the correct location hit sell for 500isk each up to an amount of 10 or less if someone else has partially filled the orderbasket contracts would need to be searchable for individual items to make them easy to find for folks like mr bob who only sell one item they are a flat price that can be favorable or not as a lazy option to make this work youll likely have to set a price higher than the market to ensure you get your itemsbut at the same time it means not setting individual sell orders populating the list would be similar to contracts now and shouldnt be hard effectively youre making a contract able to have individual amounts to multiple items on itthats just my take on a way to employ it the idea as a whole is very cool and id like to see some development of it

this is something that very capsuleers talked about we all know about the possible instation recreation areas the instation apartments and what not however very little often do people talk about the little things that could have a major impact on the eve market in general1 being a broker agentwhile inside the station why not allow capsuleers to become brokers themselves instead of letting the npc brokers do the job currently we players have to pay a brokers fee for any market transaction that involves the trading of isk between two players by allowing players to take the role of the broker we can reduce the amount of isk being drained into the economic sink by these npcs2 being a manufacturingcopyinginvention agentcurrently players have to pay a production fee to the npc stations with the exception of the playerowned outposts in order to put into a build order this also creates a sink in the new eden economy by allowing players to assume the roles of production agents the sink is also minimized in this area as the fee results in traded isk and not lost isk also the players would be able to watch and get involve in the production process of the ship order they received of course for the sake of the security of the customers build order the minerals components and bposbpcs will only be kept inside a secure station vault that not even the production agent can access only the customer or the customers ceo can access it like usual should they need to cancel the order in the meantime the player can interact with the construction units in the building of the ship building speed efficiency and being able to handle t2t3 build orders could be affected by training skills that way players can actually feel like they did physically build the ships all throughout new eden rather than just seeing the word in progress on the jobs window change to completethis proposal could at the very least give players a sense of purpose when walking around the station sure beats walking around all day long that way they could still have an effect on the world outside the stations while being in the stations of course certain measures have to be in place to prevent any potential abuse of these interactive systemsnow the reason i didnt mention refining is because im not sure if it needs to be touched or not ill leave that up to you guys to decide but overall at least you wouldnt have to just walk around and setup lemonade stands in jita 44
id agree if these roles require you to fill out multiple government applications for each order then stand in line to local government agency process paperwork and file your applications to another agent basically it should be a full time job doing legal paperworkotherwise people just make alts to make money for nothing
not supported frankly we need more isk sinks not less
please elaborate as to whybesides even though i made some emphasis on removing isk sinks the main point on this proposal is to allow more interactivity for instation environments while still having an impact on the world outside the stations that way it wouldnt feel like the sims

this thread is not for discussing hybrids but for discussing problems of the gallente ships themselves i believe that they are to blame for the most of our pain many have pointed out that not only the guns themselves are a problem some not very well designed ships are take the hyperion it is suppose to be an awesome ship we have a bonus to tank bonus to damage 8 guns massive capacitor i mean what else could you want from a bs the main issue is that on one ship for it to be effective in pvp we must have 100mn mwd is a must because guns are very short range8 guns that eat capacitor2 large armor repairers as a minimum to tank anything using the ships bonusthrow in a point and a web and capacitor depletes in 40 secondshuston we have a problem bs is out of cap in 40 seconds not even mentioning any vulnerability to energy neutralisers you need two t2 heavy capacitor boosters to run just the tank and the guns not even mentioning the mwd now try fitting 2 large armor repairers 2 heavy capacitor boosters and a 100 mn mwd on a hyperion congratulations you have just spent 60 of you ships powergrid now where do i put the guns maelstrom is a similar ship it has 8 guns and a bonus to active tank the reason it is so superior to the hyperion is because it can actually fit the gear it needs to fly and because its active tank is almost twice as strong as that of the hyperion and it compensates for lack of buffer tank guns are a separate topick problemsnot enough cap to run everythingnot enough speed to get in range quicklynot enough active tank to compensate for lack of buffer if you do fit a heavy tank you make the ship slower meaning that you have less chanse of getting the guns in range meaning that you hav higher ods of being suck there unable to catch up to your target being slowly killed potential solutions 1 simplest solution is to boost powergrid of ships with active tank bonus through the roof so they can actually fit all the stuff it is not a perfect solution but it does get things fixed without many changes to overall game balance yeah it a boost to hyperion britux and a couple others anyone is gonna say that they dont need it most gallente ships have about 23 the powergrid of their amarr and minmatar counterparts anyway i mean maestrom gets 21k powergrid and hyperion gets 15k maelstrom lso gets shieldtank which needs no powergrid it gets guns that need less powergrid and less cpu it needs only one cap booster and does not need mwd as much because its guns have longer range i mean seorisly how does hyperion deserve this solution two this is a more complex solution i propose giving some gallente ships a bonus to mwd overload speed bonus and web bonus the idea is that you have once change to overload mwd get in range and web the target if you are successful you end up in close range fight where you have superior damage output and horrible blaster tracking is less of an issue since your target is webbed by a bonused web if you dont get this right you die solution three give gallente shield tank shield tank does not diminish your speed and speed is very valuable when you fly blaster ships alternatively you could give galente projectile guns so they can sit around ad shoot things without having to get up close and personal if wsuch change was to happen all gellente shoul have the chanse to take their sp out of armor skills and reinverst it into shield skillsto me solution number one seems like the most logical and simple one support if you like any of the solutions above or think gallente ships are a problem suggest your own solutions as you see fit discussion is open

low sec needs pirates like corn flakes need milk buti am currently formulating a proposal for correcting some of the issues in low sec a little about myself for context i have been playing since 2006 i have several accounts done just about everything in the game cap ships fights worm holes blob fleets small gang warfare etc recently i returned to low sec as a solo player and i love every minute of it yet i can see the point that people make that it is broken has low player density no one mines the pirates have so few targets they are bored too much risk vs reward etc etc etcthe problems so people say stems from the pirates i have to say that i conditionally agree on one hand pirates are the life blood of low sec we need them they are the topend predators and need a strong presence in the area to give lowsec its sense of menace so dont think for a second this is an antipirate rantton the other hand entering a system which is still technically under empire control and having twenty 10 pirates docked at a station with their feet kicked up seems somewhat strange arent pirates antisocial murderers bent on wanton pillage thus typically relegated to back water areas of ill repute what the heck are they doing hanging out in an empire corporation stationwouldnt it be more appropriate to make it easy for pirates to come and ravage low sec systems yet harder to stay around the historical strength of pirates has always been to swoop in on unsuspecting ships in force and then disappear to places unknown to spend their illgotten gainswith this in mind i came up with some ideas i would like to float before reading please bear in mind that i am proposing this not to hurt piracy to but resurrect lowsec and thus create more player density thus more potential targets1docking restricted based on sec status as a players sec status decreases he incurs a fee to enter a low sec empire station starting at a very small amount so that novice pirates are not priced out of the game and getting progressively worse as the sec status approaches until at 5 or less they can no longer dockthis fee would also be modified by the sec rating of the system less fines the lower the rating the fee represents bribes necessary to let petty pirates dock and the restriction represents the docking authorities at some point saying your crimes are too great if i let you dock i will lose my jobwhy it should be difficult for a career pirate to interact at all in civilized parts of space while highsec is off limits to pirates entirely stations in low sec should be islands in the stars for noncriminal players with the main part of the system being an open hunting ground for the pirates2at a certain sec status the station guns should open fire on criminalswhy can you just picture the station manager looking at the view screen and seeing a fleet of hostile pirates in gun range and letting them hang out to wait to blow up his tenants this forces pirates to be more creative fluid and intelligent in their activities 3randomly and infrequently a criminal attack at a gate will spawn a faction navy response becoming increasingly rare as the security rating of the system decreases sleeper aiwhy pirates have to be able to think tactically and be ready if the man shows up again the simplistic tactics used now will have to be changed and fits will be modified in the unlikely event yet very real chance that they are unexpectedly engaged4very tentative about this one give groups of miners the ability to purchase an npc escortsleeper ai this escort would have to be broken before the miners received dps miners can be tackled however just not popped while the npc escort is intact cost prohibitive and increasingly expensive at lower security rating systemsto be continued
why industry is the life blood of the real world and the eve world it would make sense that the factions would provide escorts for industry types in exchange for a cut of their minerals they have to make their own ships after alli would rather this be a player driven operation potentially done through the new contracts system but i dont have a concrete idea of how to implement ityou may be reading this and thinking that for a guy who said this wasnt to be a rant against pirates it sure has a lot of antipirate changes well here is why i dont agreepirates have become so successful that they have chased all of the prey away from the water hole and while unprobeable t3s have mitigated the problem somewhat it is still not where it should be there needs to be a change in the preypredator dynamic what i would hope would be accomplished via this rules change i would hope that pirates would be encouraged to base out of npc null sec and regularly raid up into low sec and maybe even down into sov nullsec instead of planting themselves en masse in a low sec area which is both unrealistic and inhibitory to what their ultimate goal is more ship kills of course if the pirates wish to maintain a presence in a certain system or want to be able to change ships they can of course place a pos in system if pirates have a need to camp a station to get at a certain player or corp then they can avail themselves of the war dec mechanicwhy would any of this make a difference the pirates would have to maintain a line of logistics whether that means bringing a carrier or orca or put up a staging pos if they want to victimize an area instead of just waiting out their gcc and docking up giving them some vulnerability if the prey decides to fight back alternately they would have to roam up to where they want to go and back risking attacks from other roaming gangs also as there might be a tendency to want to have place to dock and accumulate assets the npc 00 stations would see more use and possibly more pvp as pirate corps squabble over limited office spacehopefully the more transitory nature of pirate attacks would lead adventurous players to take the step into low sec and keep them there even if they get popped a few times because they would have the understanding that eventually given no easy place to base from the pirates would move on again staging poss are appropriate as a base and while inconvenient at times are eminently doable look at the professional wormhole corps living out of poss if they can do it certainly those engaged in the pirate career can do soso is this antipirate again i dont think so the players i have met that are pirates are typically highly skilled players with a very good grasp of pvp and game mechanics i think these changes might add a sense of challenge and instill more tactical thinking as well as bring more players into low sec finally while it would be a bit of culture shock after the changes were digested i firmly believe that everyone would have more fun and isnt that the point
forgot to support my own idea
actually in rl i know i know i should never compare games to rl but bear with me pirates were often employed or at the very least given indirect support by various empires to go out and attack other empires convoys andor warshipsfor example in the golden age of piracy pirates would often attack spanish ships in and around the caribbean area cuba eastern mexico and south florida and then dock at english ports further north which tacitly supported themnow for the big difference according to eve lore capsuleers are not part of any empire per se and are instead a force completely unto themselves the only governing body that has any say in capsuleer activities is more or less concordergo the 4 empires could care less who resides in their borders or docks in their stations its not really their concernto get to meat of your proposal your idea seems geared to completely wipe out piracy from the gameonce a person reaches 10 as quite a few hardcore pirates do they will effectively be unable to dock anywhere save 00 space and we all know how docking rights are set out there ie you cant dock periodwith the pos towers a good idea but also slightly flawed you need standings with a particular empire to set up a pos in their territory unless said pirates can run missions or join militia both of which require you to dock how do you propose that pirates be able to gain the necessary standings remember setting up pos towers requires raw standings skilling up in diplomacy and connections will not affect thingsas for npc guards that kinda goes against the player oriented gameplay that eve is so famous for why join a corp or buy mercsbodyguards when you can simply get npcs to do the same thing albeit less effectively
thank you for replying shahi agree that the npc escort is a controversial and i proposed more as an idea for discussion than a concrete idea like i said i would rather it be player driven as for wiping pirates outabsolutely not and i really hope this post does not come across that way would piracy be harder yes but piracy should be hard and these players who choose to do it are up to the challenge i promise you thatit is challenge to operate in a low sec area that is infested by player pirates it is an exilaratingadrenaline pumping experience instant undocks tactical warp ins avoiding roaming gangs and gate camps and seeing if and when you can pick one off i submit that the majority of those engaged in piracy these days arent getting that experience it becomes dull rote the same old thing with very little risk i have done it myself while at the same time decreasing the odds of other players moving in to the area lets change that a little as far as empire stations not caring due to capsuleer affiliation i have to disagree the pirates are murdering their clientelei am not a role player i just like things to make as much as possible in this game of space pixels editspelling
dont really know about the viability of some of your ideas and i suspect i rather disagree with alot of thembut i do however support the introduction of consequences to the game seeing as how the only current consequence is grinding status if you want to go chill in highsec theres virtually no real consequences as it is
if you have suggestions for improving low sec i urge you to contribute to the making lowsec matter project
thing is theres a difference between making things hard and making things unnecessarily hardyour idea would force pirates a rabble rabble bunch for the most part to employ logistical tacticsefforts usually used only by 00 alliances i can say from personal experience that the main allure of lowsec is that one can engage in 00esque activities without the headache of dealing with logistics andor massive amounts of organization that nullsec dwelling essentially requires
this is a quote from a news story about a recent test firing by the us navy of a railgunan electromagnetic railgun offers a velocity previously unattainable in a conventional weapon speeds that are incredibly powerful on their own in fact since the projectile doesnt have any explosives itself it relies upon that kinetic energy to do damage and at 11 am today the navy produced a 33megajoule firing  more than three times the previous record set by the navy in 2008 it bursts radially but its hard to quantify said roger ellis electromagnetic railgun program manager with the office of naval research to convey a sense of just how much damage ellis told foxnewscom that the big guns on the deck of a warship are measured by their muzzle energy in megajoules a single megajoule is roughly equivalent to a 1ton car traveling at 100 mph multiple that by 33 and you get a picture of what would happen when such a weapon hits a targeti think this is what ccp should have in mind when they fix railguns and they need to fix railguns gallente shouldnt be restricted to drones for their only viable ranged weapon blasters need some lovin as well but you knew that from the 20 page blaster thread p
then why are you proposing changes to tracking and sig resolution what do you think that tracking does that signature resolution does not or vice versa
this sounds like it has potential if buff tracking was the answer then ccp probably would have just gone ahead and done iti support a hybrid buff but it needs more though than ops suggestion
at the moment it works like this this could be changed at the whim of ccp and with good reason therefore suggesting a reduction in sig radius might not be different from a bonus t tracking at the moment but this also might not always be the case
i approve most of this proposition except that 20 tracking might be a bit too muchstill good idea 
the problem doesnt step from hackers hacking into your account the problem is the owner of the account do you have sufficient antimalware software do you have a sufficient firewall setup do you make sure your passcode is complicated as hell do you make sure that you never share your passcode nor use the same passcode on separate webbased services do you make sure to never click on any links that claim to be from ccp even though they may genuinely be from ccp do you make sure to never get involved with isk farmers do you change your passcode every so oftenif you answer no to any of these then you are the problemi got multiple antivirus softwares a good firewall all updated and used regularly and a passcode thats so complicated that not even julian assange could figure out and they get longer every time i change them so far my account has not been hacked and i have been on eve for more than 3 years
ive used a 5 or 6 digit rng authenticator before dont remember which its been a while it generated a new combination once every 30 seconds its good enough for large companies with secured data it should be good enough for eve
as for melantaris comments about all the stuff being costly to replace id suggest that players need to learn the difference between rich and wealthy  you can sell plex and be rich or you can start a corporation and be wealthy
damn right i want a token generator
well if people still insist on a token generator then let me at least recommend tying ones cellular phone to the account googles gmail uses this method to ensure that the person requesting a password reset is the right person i have a gmail account setup in this fashion before you had to tie in gmail with another email account like hotmail or setup a security question nowadays my cell phone is the only key and i keep it on me all the timeit would be nice if ccp allowed us to tie our cell phones into our accounts and send us a randomlygenerated token number through that
everyone can fight back just cause the carebears choose not to fight its their own fault not the other sidesand carebears have it way too easy in eve they grow fat and lazy and we need to cull their herds a bit to keep their population healthy
why should they the only presence they have is probably alts to move stuff around and make a little isk on the sidemost highsec wars read grief wars are not pvp closer to pve for all intents and purposes experienced and properly skilled vs inexperienced with marginal relevant skills  would you volunteer to twelve rounds with a pro boxerthe system is pretty bad but i have no idea what couldshould replace it perhaps a corp wide sec hit if a war is concluded without any combat ship kills ie not haulers shuttles and the like  grief would be griefers for trying to run down pedestrians
the fact that they feel necessary to limit their open presence in empire and resort to alts only proves how reluctant they are to pvp in empirepeople who like to pvp shouldnt hide behind alts in empire its carebearishpersonally i dont like the whole alts thing and i really dont like how extremely safe 00 alliance transports have become in 00 its all jump bridges and cyno jumps in empire its all altshalf the fun in military battles is destroying your enemy supply fleet and how come eve is like the only military game where there is no need for escort dutyi just think we are missing out on some great gameplay here we had some of it before ccp introduced jump bridges and cynos
so basically you dont care about a good fight i mean the parallel here is pretty obvious youre telling us that its a good thing to have selfcongratulatory bullies punching kindergartners in the face and that you want more of themif you want more pvp in highsec theres faction warfare just sitting there waiting for you but hey that actually requires fighting the carebear pvpers who just sit in highsec and gank others who cannot even possibly fight back and then pat themselves on the back for it are a problem just like scamming is a problem yes go ahead and do it i have no problem with that but it shouldnt be so easy never mind so profitable i have absolutely no problem with ccp implementing some changes to make it harder for carebear pvpers to wardec noob corps in highsecbut really youre a hypocrite  you think those noob corps and haulers are a bunch of fat and lazy carebears but you dont realize that these gankers are just as guilty theres little more risk ganking people in highsec than there is running missions in highsec anyone against the fat and lazy really ought to be against the gankers toothe fact that you arent is the secret telling us where your priorities really lie
supportedright now the ost to wardecs is pocket change it should be significantly higher
i think 500m is a bit steep for deccing a corp
i agree that there needs to be more high sec conflict but we arent talking about alliance wars we are talking about small pvp corps randomly deccing small corperations for the sole purpose of high sec piracy that isnt war that is greifing but i would love to see some of the null alliances holding fleet battles in empire space could become a specator sport watching large fleet battles witout worrying about getting ganked on your way to null or hit by stray fire
yall dont seem to get that the wardec mechanic is working as intended eve isnt sposed to be a place you can afk mine 2357 with impunity it is supposed to be a place where your  will get blown up by some got if you are stupidi mean christ i learnt that about 2 weeks in when i was doing a courier mission in a rifter and got ganked in low sechellive never pirated but i am still loving these tearsyou see the thing is these pirateshigh sec wardeccers have tried mining theyve tried nosec and so on theyve found what they have fun doing do you have the right to take that from them any more than they have the right to take your precious little hulk from you no they dont and yet yes they do but heyho ive got a solution to your problemsdont look upon the people you mine with as a resource to make your isk making easier talk with them get to know them then get a few rifters and try doing something other than watching your holds fill for onceor hell for something really whacky watch local or be at the keyboard or both that works well
there is a really good tactic that works against ganking and is pretty fun you fit a hulk with a massive tank and remove the strips alltogether and than you have a fleet of stealth bombers floating around somewhere surprise the hulk doesent pop and surprise your corp gets the kill before concord even shows up
in short a check box in graphic options that turns off all smoke fog and gas clouds although they are pretty some missions are rendered unplayable due to gpu lag on older machines so please give us the option to turn them off just like with turret effects and ship modules
my mashine can handle them but i find them sometimes horribly annoing
if you dont like local why are you not in wh space
i am any more constructive arguments
currently ecm yeah facon is the only type of ewar that does not suffer stacking penalty the impactif a target is sensor boosted stacking more then 3 sensor dampeners on it will not have any effect so you can make yourself invulnerable to sensor dampening by having one or two sensor boostersif a target is eccmed you can overpower any amount of eccm by putting more ecm on target in fact ecm will always win because eccm suffers a stacking penatly while ecm does not solutioneithermake all types of ewar suffer a stacking penalty including eccmorremove stacking penalty from all types of ewar in game
granted ecm does not have stacking penalty but it is chance based theoretically you could miss 90 cycles in a row before you get your first jam through every other electronic warfare device has a chance of 1 to hit which means that you get an instant effectecms are practically useless on ships that do not get a bonus to ecm strength the usefullness of every other electronic warfare mod depends on the situation not the shipim not saying that this favours one side or the other am simply reminding that you should consider these things in your proposalregards lax
yet another thread of uninformed anti t2 bpo riotersplease do your research before asking for silly thingsif you want an even playing field the only way is to ask for a full server reset every month titans and 100m sp characters are not available to new players but that doesnt mean they should be removedso as you might have guessed i do not support this thread
many times when i am mining i look at my cycles and they are finished but no ore comesit sometimes comes midway through the next cycle  ok i can live with this  but sometimes it does not come at all till the next cycle is even completednow  if you have your hulk setup like i do  with mining drone rig upgrages  you do not have the m3 capacity to hold all the m3 when you stop your lasers and restart them thus you lose m3 ore it gives you 15 cycles of ore in 1 shot or 2x cycles of ore  whatever you were missing i propose that when a cycle is stopped  and the m3 it is returning is more than what the regular cycle m3 should be the cargo is allowed to go into overflow temporarilyi can accept the m3 ore lag  i just cant accept the m3 ore loss
im voting for myselfim tired of losing m3
1ice mining is even worse i sometimes loose a full cycle only because of lagi am not using bots or macroes so i do care about it
um no your ship has a defined cargo capacity  if youre unhappy with the size of the cargo bay there are ways to fix that change the way its fit and before you say but i want it fit like this  welcome to eve every choice has a trade off you just discovered the trade off to fitting your ship the way you didand youre not losing m3  anything you cant take is left in the rockice youre losing time nothing more
if you are losing ore due to cargo space why not cycle your lasers so that you have time to move the first lasers ore into cargo containerorca before the next lasers amount arrives
this
its actually a bug nothing to do with how much cargohold you havefor example ice mining in a mackinaw gives you 2 cubes per cycle per ice harvesteryou have 2 harvester slots so 4 icecubes per cyclesometimes it only gives 2 cubes and puts 2 cubes into a buffer that doesnt release untilyou manually stop your cyclei will try to explain with an examplenormal waycycle 1 delivers 4 cubescycle 2 delivers 4 cubesand so onbuggy waycycle 1 delivers 2 cubes instead of 4only current solutionstopping your cyclethis will put the 2 remaining cubes into your cargoholdits like the 2 remaining cubes were in a bufferif you dont stop your cycle i tested this then this will happencycle 1 delivers 2 cubes instead of 4cycle 2 delivers 2 cubes instead of 4cycle 3 delivers 2 cubes instead of 4cycle 4 delivers 2 cubes instead of 4cycle 5 starts stopping cycleyou stop your 5th cycle your buffer will release the remaining 8 cubes 24 complete cyclessince your cargohold can only hold 6 cubes at a time 2 cubes will be lostnow im not actually whining about the lost cubes if you spot your cycle only giving you2 cubes soon enough you can avoid losing cubebut you do lose cycle time by having to stop your cycles to fix the issuethis bug is here for a while since dominion i think and it might only occur when having an orca or rorqual or any ship giving mining bonuses in fleetedit clarified a little
develdrini am not asking for a bonus of any kindther is an issue that the lag does not put the ore in your cargo hold so when it finally does put it there  you dont have enough room in your hold because its giving you the last cycle and this cycleyour answer not correct  to refit a ship differently because of lag i am not using bots  i am not using macros  all i would like is my ore to appear in my hold when my cycle is over  and since that cannot seemed to be accomplished i beleive my workaround is a fair oneif you mine ore  and leave your ore in your hold  and do the next cycle and not enough can fit  fine you lose that  i am happy with thatbut if you mine  finish your cycle  and the ore is not delivered until the next cycle  then thats when the quirk  fix should be applied where you are allowed to store more than your hold momentarily to account for this dumb bugyou would probably complain more if you missioned and your salvage didnt show till 2 hours later oh wait  by that time it imploded
one thing to add to clarify for nonminers to understand what is happeninglets say you have 3 mining lasers and each laser gives you 100m3 per cycleyour ore hold can hold 300 m33 cycles finish and you get 300m3 in your hold  you move it to a can  super5 minutes pass3 cycles finish you get only 200m3 in your hold  you dont realize that 100m3 is missing5 minutes pass3 cycles finish and you get 400m3  it gave you the last 100 you did not recieve but since your ore hold can only hold 300  100 is lostthe fix i am asking for is that if a laser is giving you 200m3  but only should be giving you 100m3  that 100m3 is allowed to overflow ur hold i hope that clarifys things
that and the post above yours laying out the problem as well does clarify things considerablythat being the case they need to fix the bug not spend time making the hold autooverflow so i cant support your fix to the problem but i agree they need to fix it
i think its more a case of module lag than a actual bug ie the shown circle on the modules is further than the server which is still processing the circle like with guns ghost firing again after you turned them offor the guns running on for halve a circle after you turned them off just vague guesses
if i can control my computer from my phone why cant my computer control itself
this is actually genius and probably easy to doaddendum could we see this for previews of ships too like open up a ship preview and have it autospin for youin all seriousness though this is really neat and i bet it takes minimal effort1
not supported the camera drone union filed a law suit against spinning and got it removed as too many camera drones got sick from it and had to be retired early for huge costson a side note i would like to propose a real docking option for my ship instead of this freefloating bobbing above some hotplate which makes me nervousand please add some other ships docked there too i cant believe i always get to dock in a chamber that can easily hold 100 battleships and what not but im alone always just me no one elses ships are there never
thisi wanna see all docked ships at least the active onesi do not need auto spinand when i am inside a station i wanna have a window to look outside and see whats going on there i wanna get rid of the sometimes half minute black screen while i am undocking
amen to dat bruddah
this would be amazing
agreed 
id rather give sentries a small return speed like 20ms so they are still stationary while attacking but could be recalled by sieged dreads and triaged carriers after a bump
yes
ccp have never been able to deal with the code complexity drones represent which is why they dont work very welli kind of like this idea but on second thoughts no its too open to abuse and exploits like using a noctis or marauder etci think giving them a horrifically slow 5msec thruster would be a good plan but it would only work on return and again i dont know if the code wouldnt make them attempt to head in the direction of their targetspersonally i just want focus fire to work and their targets to yknow stick
you could make the tractor beams jam the drones untill it is turned off so they do not fire while moving that allows them to be moved but doesent let them fire while moving
excellent idea  having a lot of trouble with my internet provider internet says good by every hour or so i couldnt agree more especially with the price t2 drones cost
not if they are controllable however make abandoned drones tractorable yes
if you get some idiot deploying ishtarnoctos combo at you you get a free 50 million kill on the noctis yes you can drag them around but it is not useful for anything except from not having to go 40 km to scoop them upand having 15 frigates dragging a carriers sentries is not useful either because damage output of an frigate is higher then that of a sentry gun so the idea is dumb just make all drones tractorable
from what i have seen and been able to pry out of ccp techs the old character creator just spat out a jpeg for the portrate since these files are all small numbered files i see no reason you ant just keep your old avatar and use the incarna creator to generate your wis character seperatly and i am guessing the new creator would never do somthing as stupidly inefficiant as rendering the avatar in full 3d each time it is queriedso maby your wis model looks a bit different from your portrait but so i know alot of people who take photoshop to their online dating profiles
this isnt really a big issuebut it has meriti have always assumed that map takes full window due to its complexity and the same goes for pi as graphic representations that adjust in size this could be difficult their is an existing exception though ship preview is windowed1 because it would be nice to have pi in a window so flight in a dangerous system leaves you only with your overview
i saw a post about this a while back but it is something that should be be brought up to ccp the original post was by renderic vintrihello im using a 3dconnexion space navigator mouse when im working with landscaping software and i was in a sudden thinking of how nice it would be with support in eveonline since more or less all the navigating in eve is in full 3d this 3d mouse would make it a perfect match here is the official link from 3dconnexion to their software used for integrating their mouse drivers into your software
i think the system needs to be refined but do we really need to buff or nerf anything stuff is already dirt cheap as it is not more than a few months ago i saw a hulk on sell order for 115 mil
need moar clicking
so you want to reintroduce the bpo lottery worst t2 bpo fix everno to op proposal because intentionally making user friendliness worse goes against all design principles nor would it fix t2 bpos
tbh it would not be lottery it would be roughly equivalent of putting the t2 bpos for sale as npc seeded some people just might get lucky and get significant discount some would overpay a bit but majority of people would get them for the average price thats how statistics works  run a 10 jobs and its luck run few thousand and it has nothing to do with luck anymore ofc the few thousand is dependent on the probability of the the bpo drop although i dont like the idea of t2 bpos on the market even if they are npc seeded in my opinion it would be better solution to just get rid of them somehow in combination of small buff of the invention possibly if resulting small price increase of low demand stuff worries people
i dont care but i guess it would be useful to some people so why notalso dont forget to tick the support this topic box if you are supporting this proposal
standings are coupled to contacts which are stored server sideto store standings locally it would first be necessary to decouple them from contacts although it would cause more server load keeping them on the server and increasing the limits is the more elegant solution avoiding you having to manually synchronizing multiple clientsi support the fixing of the problem by whichever method
there is a mild problem with that soon thereafter major powerblocks would give you standings database you can download short time afterwards there would be third party application written that keeps the database updated real time and few days later it would be bacon all over again with sirens going off all over your hose when somebody that is not blue enters your local chat channel i would like to have more standings slots indeed the 300 limit is rather irritating its like facebook but hey you can have only 300 people you know so pick well and if you have been playing a long while  tough luck
indeed something that also needs to be included i dont really see why you think it is a problem both nbsi and nrds groups but especially nrds since they have way more standing slots used have issues with keeping standings between allied groups synced it would be great if there is some kind of ingame standing list you can subscribe to that sits between corp and personal level or even below personal so first you got alliance standings then corp then personal and if the person is still neutral then this standing list decides the standing it shows i dont really see how this would be in any way related to bacon hint it isnt i also think the easiest solution is to just download all standings to your client when you logon then your client can calculate the standings if that doesnt already happen and there is not much of a reason to not allow infinite standing slots really the part about downloading some standing list to your client on startup is insignificantonly cause of problems are poss and stations they also then need to calculate stuff with way more standings and that has to happen server side although docking at outposts shouldnt give that much server load and fighting at a hostile pos the relevant standings should just be cached
this is the extra funny bitits obvious that the teamleader had read a lot of articles on growing the social graphwith nonprivate features included to show contacts to your contacts to allow friends to become friends and the social network to functionhe obviously missed the part where 1 of that social network are the content creators when they saidwe did an sql query and it says the 300 limit will only effect 1 of playerslimiting the social graph while spending so much on a usless social network that is hamstrung from the start
yeah i can see it being bad
yea destroyersdestroy destroyersi cant see salvagers in there any place let me look againif i wanted to destroy something what ship should i use i need something with dps and more dps and a podhmm cruiser it is thenhow about medium guns or large guns and no shields or armer that would do oh and before hulkageddon pleasethanks in advance

thrasher that the prolem thanks for the bump dudes
first of all i did used the search box and i didnt find anything about that so if this topic exist feel free to put all the bounty you want on my head in the game second thing  im french so i want to apologize right now for any spelling  grammar  vocabulary mistakes thanks for not crucifying me for that so i always had a problem with my drones  they attack other groups every seconds im not paying attention light drones attack big targets while there is still some light targets etcwe are supposed to have the best weapons ever conceived and our drones are not capable of making good basic combat decisionsi propose a way to configure some target priority and be able to apply different target priority settings to each drones or drone groups we give points to  different types of target frigates battle ships points to different behavioractions web scramble is locked or not points for the speed points for the distance to the target i dont have anything else right nowthe drone will attack the target with most points and then the next one etcand if we ask a drone to attack a target manually it will comply and then reapply its combats settings for the remaining targetsso was i clear enough and did you like it 
supportalso please allow ceos and directors to track who put in how much items in the corporate hangar arrays so that miners looters and salvagers can make sure that their stuff wont get mixed in with other peoples loot or minerals
the proposal is a simple one that can cut down on suicide ganking if someone is ganked in high sec and concord takes action the victem will have 24 hours durring which he can post a bounty regardless of the players security status to limit abuse this only applies to high sec piracy where concord takes action meaning you cant place bounties on war deccers or for loosing a duel
it is a good idea if the bounty system worked back in the day wed pod kill each other to get the bounties so people putting bounties on pirates were doing little more than giving the pirates more money
id still pod kill myself for the right bounty i am sure i have a jump clone laying around with no implants in it
i would be fine with giving a 10 pirate isk suicide gankers arent real pirates they are loosers who dont feel like playing in null with the big boys
that is just it with the current broken bounty system you might as well be giving them isk  theyll just pod themselves with an alt or have one of their cowardly friends do it for themif you really want to hurt them then ask for ccp to investigate each and every one of them  i am willing to wager that a majority of them are recycled alts which is a huge no no
disclaimer i know most of you will not like these changes you will argue to the death with me over them but i honestly think they will improve the game i am writing this so that even if you argue with me over these changes you will at least see where i am coming from1 jump bridges  should be restricted to the alliance that owns the sovereignty in that system do not get your panties in a bunch this will force alliances to think about the sovereignty map and see if they really want their allies to have that system in the long run this will force more strategic thinking and better ally selection2 titan bridging  should not be allowed to be done inside a pos forcefield instead lighting a bridge should happen outside of the forcefield also it should make the titan unable to move for the duration of the bridgethink dread in siege this will do two things1 make the fc think twice if he really needs that bridge2 it will allow hostiles the ability to counter drop the titan with the current mechanics if a titan bridges a fleet onto a hostile there is no chance for that titan to be killed this gives it a huge power with little to no risk of dieingkind of like the remote aoe dd3 local chat  remove the current version of local chat wa wa wa yes instead replace it with a delayed mode regional chat this will do a couple things 1 it will make scouting a profession again 2 people will have to rely heavily on their own forms of intel and constantly communicate with each other 3it will allow for the reintroduction of the system scanning pos array this mod would now serve the purpose of alerting anyone in the same alliance as that pos the ability to see all ships currently uncloaked in that systemmake it a new tab on your scanner 4to help scouting you could also buff the directional scan seeing an actual cone on your tactical overlay which corresponds to the angle of your scanner would be nice 5 this will end botsok well theres the 3 major things i could see being done in the game flame on
suggestion 2 is interesting and should be looked atsuggestion 3 has been argued about ad nauseum there are many threads about it
yes i agree 3 has been talked about alotas far as 2 goes i have a secondary thought you could possibly even increase bridge range by 25 to counter the jb nerf in 1 this would allow titans to be extremely useful but at the same time putting them in certain danger making logistics possible to move fleets from one side of the universe to the other but adding a risk into it that is currently not there
nobody
tbh i dont get the point why would one want to wardec a space holding entity in the first place in 00 you can already spank em if you have the power to do so in the few key low sec choke points as well although criminal timer might be inconvinient somewhat it does not prevent or even disrupt their logistics as that is already taken care of by npc corp hauling alts all it does is to make in some cases their carebears go into 00 and thus increase the manpower pool they can use to respond to local threats and thin out the ranks of dumb people who believe they can run quick jita trip on their main instead of using npc corp hauling alt takes few hours to train in the spare slot for a npc corp bestoweri mean i can buy my stuff in jita with empire alt create a courier and day or two later my stuff appears in the 00 station close where i live regardless of number of wardecs npc corp alts ftw if im in hurry i can use my own hauling alt for jita trip as well and pick up the stuff with my main from a suitable low sec system by just cynoing in to a station and docking for making life slighly inconvinient the current wardecs sort of work 25 bil would be a bit too much dont you think  current cost of wardec is kinda fine i think considering how little real effect it has in this age of alts
as we all know new features from ccp have a tradition of not working right when they are released also recurring problems have a tradition of not being fixed ccp is always asking players to come onto sisi to test out new and upcoming additions yet whenever i go on the cluster rarely has a population above 300 let me stress when i go on i dont know whose there when im not ccp is always asking for players to come and test special events the more the merrier so ccp needs people to come along and test their new toys and the players well we just want stuff fixed and the new stuff done right i say in order to generate interest in player testing ccp hand out tranquilty sp instead of the usual sisi sp im not saying a whole crap ton certainly not 2 million and certainly a few orders of magnitude lower i wont dare give an amount but certainly a number which will not put out those that do not show up and not give an advantage relatively to those that do
no
no if you want to contribute to the future of the game go join the testingif not sit om your thumbsif you want to get persistent rewards for testing ccps code get a job with them
wow such anger
no if ccp needed more testers theyd find a way without ing off the majority of current testers hopefully the reward is you get to use 2m sp on sisi to test stuff you may want to train later
hahaha hahano
first never should sp be given to the players on the live server except in the very rare reimbursement cases like the learning skills change or what happened for that incredibly long dt which i still think we didnt deserve but free is free sp is the basis of eves play and it should never be given if at all possible as that very system of timesp keeps eve alive and well should sp ever be easily gained god forbid and ccp too then youll have a repeat of what private servers for wow and other games have players reach their peak see what they want and quitsecond your idea of compensation for helping on the test server may have some merit but the problem is that many players cannot make the testing time blocksthis isnt because ccp is cruel or awful at timing eve just has that wide of a tz base can we say the whole world because of this it is unfair for players that cannot make the tests even if they wanted to to be at a disadvantage to players who can this rules out rewards that are gains like isk or sp it makes it quite hard actually to find anything in eve that players want that isnt a gainnow incarna may introduce new ideas  for example if they do implement a cosmetic system probably for microtransactions thats a whole different can of worms you could compensate players with a point system or actual cosmetic items that have no inherent value except as eye candy this is just an exampleall in all though i dont think players should be compensated for taking part in sisi on tq in any way its a wonderful test server that is set up very well it imports your characters a bonus many other games dont have and it is easily accessible as someone said earlier you should try out the test server on those special events for the sp the server givesand when it doesnt you should try out anyways if you really love eve youll give some free time to help ccp make the game better who knows you might even have fun at the end of the day though if ccp feels players arent contributing to their tests they will tell us and add in their own incentives if they so choose
nosisi doesnt work for some people and its a testserver no action you do on sisi should ever have any implications for tq
jump bridge removal nomake jump bridges usage restricted to alliance only yessov stuff need to change but not like that probing maybyealso 3 proposals in one thread while i semisupport one of them the others make me not support this thread
reallyremove jump bridges this would turn into who can camp the most gates game and yeah jump bridges are an advantage in being in a player run empire again if u dont like it go to high sec sad when people whine when they cant have the fun toys in high sec super carriers are to op jump bridges arnt fair sov is to hard
your lowsec protection is also called a gun and a buddy
technically those scums are spamming and its all about isk so the report isk spammer option is technically the right one to usenow of course ccp needs to do something about it afterwards right right
trying to be patient but getting antsyim especially interested in not only the position but the tone of both ccp and csm when it comes to the topic of botsnot to point a finger at any one from either ccp or the csm but the cynic in me is screaming that having reps from the major alliances confronting ccp with the issue of bots is something akin to 2  addicts deciding how to win the war on drugs
same here especially after reading one of those cant remember which part was it
yes and yes
nomicro transaction will for the alpha period increase gain for ccpbut because mostly players wouldnt like it implemented longevity of eve would be in danger because income generation from current base of players will be diminished in phase beta it will affect quality of gameplay for those who use mct make it undesirable gamma phase would make eve ftp in hope that it will lure more players in game but because in eve all things are obtainable for purchase with rl cash except knowledge most of lured players would find eve r inhospitable place with mean players who would want to exploit them claiming vanity items for themselves or only destroying them for fun will not keep enough players to make eve again profitableas could be seen in current figures differences in percent of finished trials compared with new subscriptions are wast in delta phase eve could be profitable at the same level as before but with new playerbase in place of current oneconclusion it wouldnt benefit players or ccp
no
no
ok so i am sure there are toons out there that the owners would love to change the name on both for legitimate and nefarious purposes also being a protagonist of ccp and of eve i propose the followingfor some fee real currency an account holder may opt to change a characters nameby default the chars bio would have aka old name so that a corp thief cannot escape their own reputation quoted from suggestions later in this threadonly doable once a year like remapssame cost as a character portrait swaphistory of name change is on the character sheethistory of name change is on the limited apicant change a name within 48 hours of leaving a corpplease consider thisdear god please
dont you mean proponent
no i mean protagonist which is the nominative synonym of proponent except that proponent lacks the element of advocacy
fair enoughthough you just argued away the only person to post in your thread so far 
this sounds like a panic attack due to impending incarna patch and realisation that poorly chosen name is going to be a millstone around the avatars neckoops sorry but you should have given character creation more time than going for cheap lols if wanting character to be taken seriouslynot supported
pretty much this just live forever in shame with your horrible horrible namenot supported
creating a name as a joke on anotherrealising the joke is on oneselfpricelessnuff said
it is possible that this name was not chosen i really see no harm in allowing ccp to generate more revenue by extending the ability to change a namesupported
what a great amount of forethought you have put into yours 
i would also agreebeing a toon that would also like to change the namei would add one more thing to the online fee for name changing after i read your name thinking of the childrena portion of the fee goes to some charity of some sick children or somethinghow can ccp say no to that 
i dont have problems with my names though i like the idea of a history tab for our charsone point though make it bound to rl cash payments if you allow isk to be used for namechange you support scamming behaviour on a massive scale
okiei apologize looking at my response it certainly appeared snobby to say the leastthat was not my intent
you honesty has humbled me i hereby support your proposal
no it really is not only cases where a name is not a direct result of conscious thought is for the racecitizenxxxxx cases  and they still brought it on themselves by deliberately choosing a name that violated eves almost nonexistent naming policiesyou break it you bought it
actually yes there was thank you for noticing mjb is a national hero of mine
yes there should be option for name change as long as change record is visible in the same way employment history is
hirana we all like eve why not help it to grow give people another way of enjoying the game and raise more money for eve
i still say the use of the word protagonist is wrong here a protagonist does not stand alone but is set against the background of other characters which is to say theres always an element of competition either its the main character in novels andor movies or one of the main characters but always with other folks in the picture too making himher the protagonist protagonist in the sense of an advocate of something obeys the same rule its an advocate amidst other involved parties like detractors for instanceproponent certainly doesnt lack the element of advocacy see proponentin fact proponent is really the word youre looking for if you want to express that youre pro something whilst being neutral about possible other parties involvedalso even proponent of ccp is not entirely proper english you can be a proponent of ideas or plans change etc but not of a name of a company im a proponent of the existence of ccp for example would be correct english in the former case youd just say something like im a huge supporter of ccp
as a super carrier pilot capital fc and 00 fleet fc ive had some experience with supercaps both fighting as and against the supercap blobthe short of it is the issue isnt with supercaps they are fairly well balanced given their expense difficulty to construct etc the issue is with dreadscurrently i would quite happily take my single supercap against 34 dreads knowing that i would win the fight assuming they dont have support short range fit dreads do close to sc dps with the moros at just over 7k however given that the siege cycle goes for 10 mins and that they cannot receive reps they are easy killsso imho the simple fix to supercaps is to buff dreads shorten their siege cycle to 5 mins allow them to receive remote reps when they are in siegewhat will this do it means a dreadcarrier blob has a chance at beating a supercap blob it will give more of a roll to carriers to support dreads it will also mean that dreads are not completely useless in large scale warfarecurrently their only role is to shoot at poss unless you hold complete superiority its a huge risk to use them to shoot at sov structurescap battles a much larger risk than using a supercapa well organized dreadcarrier fleet could counter a supercap fleet depending on sizes etc
i like this ideal best it feels alot like how a bslogics fleet can handle a dreadcarrier fleet so why should a dreadcarrier fleet not be made able to handle a sctitain fleeti have no exp with caps i have no real love for them but thats becouse i only like ships that i can take everywere with me but the ideal looks sound to me
this idea completely removes the buff to local repairers and makes carrier swarming that much more overpowered the resist concept keeps dreads vulnerable but just boost their survivability i prefer the resist
increased resists  reps are impossible to scale each sc puts out 710k dps at what level would you raise the tank for the dreads so they arnt overpowerered vs groups of 15 scs but are still dog food to groups of 50100 a well fit dread can currently tank 45k dps in siege mode what would you raise that too raise it to 810kand two dreads could kill a sc which seams op considering the value comparison but would still be mean nothing vs 20 scsyes making dreads able to receive reps in siege is going to significantly change the balance of power however as sieged dreads are still useless vs subcaps and several can still smash down any posi think really all your going to effect is the sctitan vs dreadcarrier balance titans will be able to still one shot carriers  most dreads every 10 mins
i understand this thread and support it im just thinking of an alternative to it that might bring dreads back into fightstbh i like what my naglfar looks like and would like to use it effectively on nonpos ops one way to do this is to have dreads restored as an antisupercap glass cannonas already noted their dps isnt lacking so as long as they had the ability to get out if  hits the fan much like supercaps can currently though moms risk losing fbs if they need to do it real fast one could do strafing runs with sniping dreads  antitackle support fleet against a supercap fleetwith the recent changes to bombers where they dont fire torpedoes until they get close to their target sitting at range would give a dread wing enough time to fire a significant amount of dps into the supercap blob cluster and then bugger off only to warp in again at a different position this requires a good proberwarpin provider on your team and dreads paying maximum attention several moms yellowboxing your dread  time to drop siege and start aligning alignbasically giving people that want to fly dreads a chance at participating without certain death if nothing elsealso id give the siege a 1530 sec cooldown time before the dread can warpjump to prevent doomsdays from being useless against such strafing fleets this would also make titans a good defense against such fleetsmaybe i should start a separate thread for dreads di also like the idea of just making siege 5 minutes and allow sieged dreads to receive reps but this wouldnt work well in large fights imo where dreads get 12 volleyed by fb swarms seems good at first but doesnt scale wellsome fun facts 30 torp phoenixes equal a titans doomsday every 15 seconds at half the titans price if they could do this without getting locked down by siege and then instapopped by moms theyd be rather scary imo naglfar has similar alpha 40k from artillery and another 40k from torps if  survives long enough supercaps do maybe a script for siege module that only gives the damage mod bonustracking nerf for one shot30 secondssomething and then has a cooldown but doesnt hamper a dreads mobility to such a large extent
the problem is not really cost effectiveness the problem is that cost effectiveness is largely irrelevant what is way more important especially with the amount of macrormt financed supercaps is the pilot effectiveness it is nice that 30 phoenixes are better than a titan and not really half the price more than that but wouldnt it be much better if you put those 30 phoenix pilots in 30 super caps and that is the problem regardless of the situation and what enemy brings super caps are pretty much always the best choice
noyour proposal ignore scs roles
if cost effectiveness is indeed irrelevant then either supers are too cheap nerf build cost or too good nerf supers themselves maybe a mechanic like the office rents more supers  next one costs more to build yes this would make them even more exclusive to rich people but if you bring 50 dreads to drop one 1t supercap and get slaughtered in the progress you still end up on top as far as isk goes and if 1t isnt enough a deterrent make it even higheralternatively nerf mineral yield from all current ingame sources itd hardly hit tech1 hulls because of current insurance mechanic but everything else will be getting more expensiveimo all ships that arent basic t1 hulls should have pricetags that make them not worth flying this is already the case when you compare tech2 cruisers and teir2 battlecruisers people only still fly hacs because they are fasterthere should be a game mechanic that adjusts the build cost of tech23 faction supercap hulls depending on how fotm they are it doesnt make any sense whatsoever from a real world view mass production makes  cheaper but its the only way i can see supercaps in their current form staying without any new counters which is why im supporting the general notion in this thread supers need a nerf either by getting a proper counter increasing in price or getting nerfed directlydirect nerf is also incidentally the easiest and safest to do im just exploring different ways of getting to the same endalso im really not sure many people rmt finance supercaps 20bil would be 900 bux in gtc id assume that makes it 500 if you buy it off some shady site i dunno about people but i wouldnt pay that for an internet spaceship
actually the proposal doesnt read it againeuhm so because cost effectiveness is irrelevant you want to make them more expensive how is that in any way helpful if cost effectiveness is largely irrelevant it will still be irrelevant even if you make them 100 times more expensive there will just be more macros running to finance them the fact stays that per pilot they will always be the best optionsure you can add a new ship also to counter supercaps make it cost 500b that is so expensive there will never be more than a few at any time c ccp the only correct way is imo giving the ship a definite role besides pwnmobile for that stuff they may be good but they also shoudl have weaknessessupercaps are just the manifestation of bigger  better i thought the idea behind eve was that pilot skill ship choice and ship fitting was supposed to be better not which side rmts more and if they dont rmt they are using macro alts sure some will be bought by legimate means but if you think those 200 supercaps that are built each month are largely financed by legimate means i got some bad news for youbtw sadly enough people would rmt 500 dollar to get one also it isnt that much look at the ammount of people with 3 accounts they pay for the normal way so no plexes they spend more than 500 dollar yearly on eve
and what is their role in your eyesccp clearly meant for them to be anticapital ships but due to the nature of drone based damage they have in fact become antieverything ships that is not a role that is deification increasing manufacturing cost will not solve the issue as it will probably just result in even more csaa being spammed in bubblegum space increasing dread power through ehp andor dps risks making them the blobmobile of choice thus pushing supers back into pos for permanent storage decreasing sc power by enough for it to make a difference will most likely make them pos ornaments againin conclusion fixing the power imbalance of scs has to be a combination of multiple facets if untoward sideeffects are to be avoided
well if people are running macros to finance their supercaps then the problem is elsewhere and simply nerfing price wouldnt do much if any difference indeed this is then a problem at ccp though or maybe its just time to move to another game as if its really hilarious how no matter how terrible eve is its still the best mmo aroundi really hope ccp do something to their game theres a bunch of competition coming up black prophecy miner wars jumpgate and chances are maybe one of those will be worth playing over eve for most peoplei currently have 4 accounts i pay for two main  carrierjfhaul alt other two i use as cyno alt accounts and use plex when i need them using the jf intelligently can easily make me a couple bil in 12 weeks so its not a problem at all when i actively play at all the only reason i havent ground up to a supercap is because i dont want to have a char stuck in it and grinding for another alt to put it in said supercap is effort beyond what seems reasonable to me at this pointtherefore i get the whole price isnt an issue itd take me a gigantic 2 months of 12 hours of playing per day to grind up enough isk for a well fitted mom not really what id call expensive in an mmo environmentif macroing is really as bad as youre making it look theres not much point in playing the game anymore for legit players like me thoughedit hirana then let them be pos ornaments theyre clearly too effective at the moment if theyre being used so much despite their price tags whatever furb killer might say i still think not a large percentage of moms is financed via macros its easy to make upwards of 80milhour ratting with the new anomalies which means 200 hours 10 ingame days nets you a mom if youre willing to grind that hard i dont think this is balanced therefore they need to be either nerfed or price bumped
supercarries are excellent ships and they should be they give bittervets something to aim forare they overpowered in their current formyesany simple way to fix thisyeshow reduce their fitted ehp by 50how does this bring them back in linethis makes supercarriers vulnerable to dreadnought fleets as well as other supercarrier  titan fleets the main problem is not that they can dish out immense amounts of pain its that they properly fitted have ehp levels that are so high that any fleets which wants to kill them needs to bring so many people that they completely lag out the system
bump
i like
a change to the bonusses from ammo could be a fix curently we have modified range modified cap usage damageadding stats like modified tracking depending on ammo less for long range more for close range for abvious reasons like angular velocity adding different damage types like projectiles some slugs could have em added  lorewise the metal  alloy used creates an electromagnetic cascade on a hitsomething like that might help hybrids
boost railguns or reduce fittingcap requirements to meet their fail performance in the fieldartillery has 3x alpha advantage no cap usage 10 sec ammo swaplasers have 50 tracking advantage use cap immediate ammo swaprailguns have no relative advantage use some cap and take 10 seconds to swap ammowheres the railgun advantage whats its schtick
seriously wt ccpi pay for these accounts and you want me to join facebot to vote
i was happy to hear the voting on the ship designs finally started in the waiting period between the scheduled beginning and the actual one i already began to lose interest in the thing having to have a facebook account to vote gave me the rest and i said to myself alright ive had it with this i wonder how many votes will determine the winner of that contest

looks like a criminal conspiracy to me since its the american government however they get away with it but seeing this i can only urge everyone to boycot facebook
i lold at this vid on facebook and i lold at the reaction of people on this forum about that vid are people really so dumb as to not realise this stuff goes oni guess people think that if they make a facebook profile with their name and email address the cia and corporate companies will magically know their social security number full bank account details sexual deficiencies plus any and every thought you may have ever had that could be considered non politically correctnonpc this isnt soyes they cross reference from other sources but they can only know what you tell them and seriously if you are not surfing the web with sufficient up to date virus software and antimalwarespyware software then ur a complete fool and should expect your emails to be hacked your digital identity to be stolen and your bank accounts to be drained of funds illegally
or dont put up on facebook what you dont want the whole world to know half of my friends dont even use their real names heck im thinking about making one for this character would be fun and confusing status changes
the increased size of the development staff is largely to provide resources to games other than eve good for ccp they should try to find other sources of income outside the primary cash cow of eve its diversification and that protects the overall health of the company no argument however those decisions are ccps and if they back themselves into a corner thats their doing not oursccp should be creative in finding new customers they could use them heres a creative idea fix the things in eve that have been on the backlog for freaking ever fix the current content so it actually works as intended stop breaking the game every time a release comes out that would be novel then wed be able to tell our friends that we play a game that isnt perpetually broken and that might get more customers as well as retain the ones theyve already gotno this whole facebook like feature is the personification of ccps cavalier treatment of their customers they could have extended the voting to facebook as well as have a way for their current customers to vote without joining facebook alternately they could have had two separate votes instead they tell their customers we want you to join facebook to vote so that we can create a buzz that might attract new customers and we really dont care if you have an aversion to facebook join facebook or be barred from participationccp has an unfortunate tendency to try to manipulate their customers rather than entice them or if enticement fails to strong arm them for some time now ccp has had a facebook section and invited eve players to join the turnout has been less than spectacular so now they introduce an eve event that requires joining facebook the first of many to comesubscribers to eve current customers of ccp pay for eve they pay with the expectation that they will have access to everything in eve without further requirements from ccpwindjammer
firstly how about you dont bold and underline a personal opinion of the state of all eves subscribers assumptions unless youve polled such a thing and linked it with proper citation especially when its done in such a way as to appear like a proven fact i would love access to eve onlines sourcecode but i dont think im gonna get itsecondly thats all fair and well in a fair and just world where every1 is truthfull and mindfull of everyone else but look around you millionss die for no reason at all billions are taken advantage of because they can be and most arent even aware of these because they dont enter our daily lives if u wanna complain to ccp about doing things you didnt expect them to do and find out that you cannot bring them to account then i suggest you take a look at yourself at how trusting u are to eulas u blindly acceptbut of course u can always use the scapegoat of being part of a society annoyed at long teadious terms of agreement that always find their ways into software installations and the compultion to ignore it and just click acceptassumption is the mother of all fk ups and it seems that youre very much hurting from disregarding that fact
the measure of success with regard to facebook gathering information about you which you did not yourself provide could perhaps be said to be somewhat limited but the intent to do so is downright disturbing especially when goverment agencies lile cia and fbi are involved its one thing that facebook reads your private communication so they can tailerpush ads on you but a whole social network backed and funded by us government agencies apparently created for the sole purpose of gathering intel on people well thats a criminal conspiracy in my bookdid i not realize this was going on no actually i knew it was bad but this is downright unacceptable funny you should mention going on btw as the latter of course is something we can do something about namely by not using facebook and to urge others to do the same
not wanting to get in the middle of a rather entertaining argument helpfully keeping this thread nice and visible but while i personally dislike facebook as do many others as demonstrated here this is not a referendum on the merits of facebook per say claiming it is a spying tool for the cia whether true or not is not giving us the credability i was aiming for i as a subscription paying customer of ccp simply want to be able to participate in an eve related competition without having to join any third party website good or bad the fact that many people have a deep and well founded dislike of facebook just adds insult to injury i dont care why ccp decided to host the vote on facebook i dont care if its a publicity exercise in getting more customers or they are just too lazy to code their own voting mechanism whatever their reason i believe that not giving us the option of using in house voting without having to join a third party website is wrong i created this thread to convey this opinion to ccp and see if anyone else agreedi am deeply gratified that not only do a good number of people agree but are prepared to take the time to post in this thread in supportgiven that i would like to suggest that ccp a responds to explain themselves and b gives us the ability to vote on the many well designed spaceships their customers have spent many hours on producing without having to join facebook preferably with an extension to the voting period to allow for the time they take to rectify this oversight i dont expect to get either of those so i hope that you will all continue to support this thread till they do

yes this is the primary problem they can dock or jump instantly they can repping without danger
i support this topic but its more i think a flaw in armor tanking ships as amarr have the same problems as gallente with armor tanks but they have pulse lazers that help make up for it and fixing gallente ships still leaves caldire gun ships hanging as well
i agree solution 1 seems best just make the grid comparable to other tier 3 ships the current state is that the abaddon and the mael have 21k grid the hyp 15750 and the rokh 15ki propose 21k baddon 21k mael 20k hyp 19k rokhthis should be equalised throughout the ship sizes and tiers abolish tiers for all gunbased ships drone and missile based ships need less fitting and should be looked at seperately
the big issue with gallente ships is that they were designed around the game as it was before a large number of changes happened and the new ships since then have been given roles and bonuses that are left over after the other three factions were created take info warfare links and some of the utterly nonsensical roles dished out for the sin and kronosthose two ships are quite literally the wrong way around as the megathronbased kronos would make for a better black ops ship than the sin and a marauder based around the dominix would have been a far better preposition than the idiotic application of blasters and nonrange bonused stasis webs to pve mission runninggallente are a complex race that are exceptionally difficult to balance as the game mechanics are arguably too simplistic for most of their gimmicks to work properly ie  blasters dont perform due to the chance to hitsig radiusside of barn mechanics drones dont perform due to code issues and server lag railguns dont perform  because well they were obviously added at the last minute because someone realized without a token longrange weapon nobody would have a reason to bother flying gallente everlocal active tanking is broken by the disparity because of several factors including the effectiveness of logistics or capital support and the problems involved with mitigating incoming dps in almost any engagement  because its very rare to see fights involving less than five players these days the ability to tank even 1000 dps pales in comparison to being on the business end of two battlecruisers for instance this means that buffer tanking with remote rep support is the only effective way to fly which means any hull with an active tank bonus is relegated to solo pve activities at bestive had some success flying some gallentean ships in pvp smallgang warfarethe taranis is a bruiser of an interceptor that can dish out some extreme dps if it gets closethe lachesis is a fantastic tackle as long as its backed by some decent supportthe ishtar kicks butt in its intended role although i dont fly it often outside of pvea properlyfit killdozer dominix will slaughter anything stupid enough to engage in scramweb rangebut these examples are few and far between the faction has many many more broken and useless ships and ive covered nowhere near all the examples i would strongly encourage both ccp and the csm to take up the issue and find a way to redesign gallentean ships so that they are more tuned with the game as it is now not how the game was in 2006
battleships absolutely need some rebalancing in 00 you dont often see battleships unless its in large fleets alpha maelstroms for example because the costbenefit of battlecruisers drakes and canes specifically is just more attractive i can get a decent tank out of a drake and enough dps to kill pretty much whatever comes through a gate for under a hundred mill fittings included a fully fitted battleship on the other hand costs signifigantly more and are really useless against anything smaller than a battlecruiser because of a tracking speeds of large guns b cap stability and vulnerability to nosneuts  c speedmaneuverability a battleship is rarely afforded the chance to determine the range at which an engagement will take place smallerfaster ships always move to their optimal and start orbiting inside the tracking at that point you may as well be throwing cans out the window at them for all the damage your guns will do battlships should by all rights be the scourge of any battlefield come on ccp make the battleships the harbingers of doom and destruction theyre supposed to be i dont even care if they cost twice as much per hull as long as a 5 man cruiser gang coming in sees an abbadon on the gate and their immediate reaction is run
gallente or hybrids do need some looking at ccp have accepted the notion i believe but cannot decide on a good enough answer at presentsupportps been a while max 
gallente ships need to be the fastest to use blasters effectively yes faster then minmatar no minmatar does not loose their roll or anything as they have a much better range on their guns as gallente and as gallente blaster ships cant kite they should not be able to get kited also some of their ships need a general buffhyperion and brutix those two ships suffer from bad fitting stats and their active tank bonuses imo their active tank bonuses should be changed to resit bonuses that would buff those ships overall and make them more useful but the best thing would probably be to buff their active tank bonus so they can get a good tank even with only one reper
well see if ccp does anything to fix this doesnt seem they care about doing it
hes actually proposing a 33 increase in tracking he just doesnt know it because he doesnt know how turrets really work
of course it does its right there in front of your eyes in plain maths
we need a properly indexed hybridsgallente rollup threadsupported because i want the issue looked into  but i dont really think a stats boost is the answer
this is false many carebear corps in highsec are corps with mostly new or maybe 12 month old characters from sp alone they cant compete with the players who have been going on for years it is funny to watch a carebear corp cascade out of a station in t1 frigates no less but it is important to remember that these are new players that need to learn the game and not just be roflstomped out of existence in the very short time theyve had to play the game especially when they have absolutely no chance of even defending themselves in the least griefing has its place in eve but a certain delicate touch needs to be used when dealing with the carebear corps in highsec due to the reason mentioned above however i think 500 mil is a bit steep so i would suggest something closer to 100 mil so that the much smaller corps will still have the option open
to be fair even 100mil is still a little steep for corp to corp war most corps that dec regularly dec several corps at once so what by the 5th corp you will be paying over bil in total
while its instantly available to merely leave corp as required and rejoin as desired at no cost whatsoever we should only ever be considering revising the price of wars downwardswhen the costs to avoid war start exceeding the cost to start them then we can listen to what you have to say
you got the number wrong wardeccing a noob highsec corp is only 2 mil its higher only if you dec large alliances or have multiple decs going at once 2 mil is chump change by anyones standardsif it had been 50 mils to dec a corp it would still be on the low side but considering increases from multiple decs it may be enough to deter dec spamming highsec noob corps for the purpose of kbpadding as it is now anyone can just go shoot a rat to finance a wardec
except that in eve all concord officers are on the take theyre not even being covert about it
or make a filter like the overview that would allow you to turn off sensor booster effects but not eccm or tracking computers while turning off gas clouds
id really love it if these were toned down alot id also like to be able to disable the background nebula incorporated into the star field sometimes id just preferr good ol black space stars and a more reasonable sun for systems from 20au away it simply shouldnt be a supergigantic traffic flare like it is nowrant
indeedi get a 300 increase in frame rate by pointing the camera away from the clouds and another 300 increase in framerate by pulling the camera back from the ship model when its being shot at or running shield hardeners
i support thisi honestly dont think theyre that good looking in the first place rather blandlooking and just a cpu hog imo
do this please
ill take an option to disable the clouds an option to reduce the sun glare an option to turn off backgrounds in favor of black space and an option to alter the space color pleaseregarding the last sorry space is too dark and my room is too bright i much prefer a look like homeworld 2 had with the bright vibrant space backgroundsin mostly solid colors
this pleaseevery now and then i have to use my old laptop for eve and the gas clouds really hurt the performance
my mac can on a good day give me 30 fpsenter a complex scene and i get 27 fpsget into the vicinity of nothing except one cloudnebula and i get 5 fpsits ridiculous theres no graphic setting to reduce the cloud complexity to a sane level only thing i can do is zoom out 100km and play the game purely on overview data sucksi get the same effect if i look closely at an asteroid being mined what in a laser impact uses that kind of gpu powertotally signed
supporting
even for people with newer computers the 1080 and 720p resolutions for big screen moniters can even tax the best gaming laptops
yesalso lets turn off the sun if we want to
these clouds are an embarrassingly bad legacy graphic and need to be reworked or disposed ofsupported
yes this would make things so much easier

why do we have the ability to have 3 characters on one account but can not train all three at the same time i would like to be able to train them all three at the same time i have a feeling it would bring more people to eve if this were possible i have never understood why it was not set up this way to begin with at this moment i have 2 on the same account both training one is my main a caldari missile specialist and the other i am training for manufacturing i have to pause the training on one to train the other that is such a hassle really i feel if we could at lest train 2 at the same time would be so great i would even go so far as to say i think a lot of people would find this extremely helpful i know i would just wanted to bring this to the councils attention and maybe see something done about it thanks for your time
paragraphs ftwbut yeah i find it a hassle too
as soon as you can find me one other mmo that lets you train two characters on the same account at the same time ill buy your argumentthink of it this waycurrently if you want to train two characters at the same time you have to have two accounts which means 2x the subscription fees for ccpwhat part of you really thinks theyre going to say meh we didnt want that money anyway
you cant play two characters on one account the same time in world of warcraft star trek online aion or fallen earth so i dont see why we should be able to here besides the last thing we need is a thousand alts spammed on the character bazaar enabling every idiot to fly carriers into lowsec with no experience wait i do want that
sure just add a divider to the training speeds of all characters equal to the number of characters who are training simutaniously on that accountif you want them all to train at full speed then lol no
the session change when jumping between systems is handled rather cheaplylets have some nice graphic effects like you see in the movies while the client loads up the new session off screen rather than the cheap and nasty pop up boxi remember being hugely disappoint by the wormhole effect when jumping between systems 6 years ago when i started playing  there wasnt one eve was new back then and i thought to myself its probably not a priority item for a new game the pop up is obviosley somekind of placeholder while they develop something betterlol i guess i was wrong about thateve is now a mature product and should not have these unpolished edges anymore
smotftw
it is rather crappy but i guess people get used to it very quickly it usually doesnt last long and it doesnt affect enjoyment of the game in a serious way i dont see a reason not to change it for better though and it propably wouldnt take much work to implement
great wonderful ideathe thing is though im pretty sure ccp is pretty fukking busy this would probably have gotten done regardless its just theyre busy with more important e like walking in stations we gotta be patient too bad well be dead before eve is a finished game p
very good would probably add more feeling in2 the game aswell 
it takes ccp 2 years just to change the cyno jump effectsits very naive to think they are capable of doing this extra work
add me but dont let it cost extra money why that  its not only the user interest its ccp interest that users can login safely without fear their accounts can get hacked easily

how much money do you need to spend before you feel securemy bank doesnt feel it necessary to protect with unnecessary hardware and i rather imagine theyre a lot better at account security than ccp or the op
i can support this
if they are to only remove a system or two from local its not going to be an effective test remove local through out 00 eve or dont do it at all
look it this way if t2 bpos dont have advantage do you really think that there would be people who are desperate to keep themi wrote on akita t topic in science forum why i believe they should be removed until now my observations are undisputed but while i believe that t2 bpos should be removed i believe that reimbursement to owners of t2 bpos would be fair
t2 bpos do have an advantage an advantage every player in eve can have if they buy one of the many for sale on the forums dailyremoving them fairly isnt as simple as giving the owners 3 years profit as you can see some bpos sell for 1 year profit others can sell for up to 7 years profit not everything is so black and white the issue of t2 bpos certainly isnt as wellanyone can afford a t2 bpo if they but just a tiny bit of work in people still think that there are some massive advantages to t2 bpos when in reality there is only added convenience for a high price same as anyone can afford 100m sp chars if they put some work in yes even those old unique ships in eve given out as prizes for events those can be used in alliance tournaments wouldnt that seem like an unfair advantage to the opposing team dont see anybody asking to remove thoset2 bpo are also in some cases just collectors items
not all tech 2 bpos are unfair in a market and production perspective but there are a few that are for example the production of 100 tech ii mining crystals of veldspar scordite plagioclase omber or pyroxeres tech ii bpono copy hassle  no job slots neededno invention hassle  no job slots neededproduction 100 runs per batch  duration 35 hours per blueprint of 100 runs  1 manufacture slottotal duration 35 hourstech i bpocopying 20 blueprints with maximum runs  100  duration 67 days  1 copy slotinventing 50 invention chance with max skills  duration 6 hours 40 minutes per blueprint  10 runs left per blueprint  20 invention slots  on average 10 tech ii blueprints left  there are no meta items to increase invention chance  decryptors for mining crystals adds 830 million isk extra cost most of the time not worth it if you want to compete on the marketproduction  duration 3 hours 30 minutes per blueprint of 10 runs  10 manufacture slotstotal duration maximum 168  133  35  336 hours approximatelytotal duration minimum 144  133  35  1608 hours all job slots are available to characterproducing tech ii mining crystals from a tech i blueprint bpo takes up a lot more time and effort in comparison to a tech ii bpo next to that there are 45 widely used mining crystals the amount of work to keep all supplied for the markets increases significantly in this case the numbers add up the amount of crystals needed on a regular basis makes the tech ii bpo variant much more favourablemy view is that the tech ii blueprint originals are denying the potential and possibility for new inventors to become a profitable mini profession on all tech ii matters future changes to invention will try to nullify the current tech 2 blueprint original advantage in that respect it would be better to remove it and replace it with a better system ie work time and investment equality for all inventors to let the profession really flourish
it looks to me that high mepe levels of researched t2 bpos are a little bit more than just an added convenience or not having to invest your skill training time in training invention skills to an acceptable level not having the lottery based invention not having to own or copy t1 bpos not having to invest in a pos and fuel to do all the copying of t1 bpos not having to spend time buying and hauling datacores not having to split your characters skill limited research slots on invention and copying because they all fall into research category not having to buy utterly expensive decryptors for getting a chance to get a better copy while drastically reducing your invention lottery chance not having to deal with ridiculous invention timers for modules which requires you to be online every 2 hours if you ever want to start getting profit from your investment in a reasonable amount of time the list goes on and on yeah its just a slight convenience im disappointed in you grendell i thought you actually knew how this game works instead you just happen to have a lot of isk because of your third party service and nothing moreand the price is high because t2 bpos are relics from the pastmy support for this suggestion still stands
supported however i dont think the actual game items should be removed just made so that they cannot function as they still have value as collectors items
lets see your point one at a time high me levels partially true for ships but look the research time for modules it mean that the builder use slightly less asteroids minerals as the t2 components arent influenced by me i repeat for modules high pe levels again look the research time you are speaking of an advantage on 1 build line out of 11 unless the guy has invested hundred of billions and own several bpo  having to invest your skill training time in training invention skills in exchange you have to train for the skills needed for mepe research check them researching a bpo require more skill and at a higher level than inventing it  not having to split your characters skill limited research slots on invention and copying you dont use a barely trained alt for the copy job there is no need to use a highly trained char for that  not having to invest in a pos and fuel to do all the copying of t1 bpos ok  not having to buy decryptors not used for modules and most of the ships when you use them it is worth using them  2 hours module invention timer what is exactly the complainyes for the price it is a slight convenience that will pay back in several years it go above slight convenience only if you have hundreds of billion to invest and buy multiple bpo at that point you dont have the time to manage your isk to get better returns so it become a worthwhile investment on the other hand it is the only investment in game for people with multiple hundreds of billions till some investment worth in that ballpark is put in game the t2 bpo have a function for those players
support and i wanna see other peoples ships docked in the station too
we had this option a while back im not sure why they removed it
i love you  best comment of the year you just made my day signed
incoldblood suggested something in this thread that i think has meritall hybrid weapons become blasters ie railguns of a given size are automatically converted into blasters of a like size and typethese weapons perform as railguns if loaded with a certain ammo type sabot comes to mind and perform as blasters with another type loaded increase the reload times a bit if you must and have the ammunition confer the appropriate tracking damage rof and range modifications to the weapon to make it perform just as the current weapons dothe upside is that no rebalancing is required presto two crappy systems combine to make one viable one
i believe medium and large neut drop rates need to be adjusted specifically for the meta 4 versions the meta 4 medium energy neut is exceptionally rare its much like what yt mwds used to be as such they cost roughly 11m isk at this moment at any major trade hub they should cost more than t2 given equal stats and lesser fitting requirements but not that much moreon the opposite end of the spectrum is the meta 4 heavy energy neut it drops stupidly often so often in fact that the meta 4 heavy neut costs only 300k isk a meta 0 costs about the same given that its equal to t2 with less fitting requirements i think it should cost more than the t2 version but this just isnt the case due to its high drop rate i looked at it in amarr today and i could buy 4x meta 4 heavy neuts for the price of a single t2 heavy neutanother problematic drop rate is the republic fleet captain tag its supposed to be a low level tag thus really cheap but in reality its as rare as the 5m isk admiral tag given that many lp store items require dozens of them the drop rate needs to be significantly increased to make a number of amarr lp store items more viable for production i dont think ive seen a single one of these tags drop in the past 6 months of killing minmatar npcs in lvl5s get dozens of commander and high captain tags per mission but never a regular captain i suggest replacing 34 of the high captain tag drops with regular captain drops alternatively they could be paired so they drop one of each or somethingi know this isnt an exciting or even interesting proposal just one of those minor details that would help out a lot if addressed
i agree someone also needs to look at the drop rate between meta 4 cruiser and battleship sized weaponsthe price difference is 10mil in favour of the bs weapons with cruiser guns costing up to 15mil a peice
just bring back the pretyrannis drop table its well balanced as is instead of proportional nerf they introduced a new unbalanced table for lolnerf to rub it in macrominers filled the gap maintaining the low mineral prices so missioner nerf ended up being a macrobuff instead of helping human miners

because amarr have huge high damage laser beams that use no ammo racially theyre a bit crap at designing drones
you mean amar laserboats actually use amarr drones as opposed to minimatar drones

like when i turn off my afterburner why doesnt it just turn off i gotta wait like 10 seconds or some crap same with when i turn on the heatim supposed to know 10 seconds in advance in the middle of an intense fight that i need to overheat my afterburner it wouldve changed the outcome of some fights if my modules did what i told them to do when i told them to do ithonestly its pretty ed that it would behave this why like who thought of that
because the cycle havent ended
so you think its fine the way it is lol
not true one bonused sentry outdamage and far outrange one small gun not to mention its not one sentry per frig but several and some frigs have more high slots than gun slots which can be fitted with tractors but not guns btw the noctis can be buffered pretty good viable with logi
the aesthetics of the game would be all over the place if they kept them in gamejust capture portrait and store it in a few places so you dont loose it if you are that worried
from what ive seen id rather keep my avatar than create another one i support this tell the new character creater has a lot more hair and body styles as i look at the utube videos im left thinking wow how they all look the same and im sure walking around in station is a pipe dream its never going to happen
im with this times change and this time its your avatars turn to change you can hold on to your old portrait privately as many people will do but i see no reason to keep any of the old stuff in the game if the new cc lacks options it would be much more constructive to suggest to ccp that they need to add those missing options to the cc and try to improve the system until people find it satisfactorynot supported

how many people actually use this mouse i only ask because if were asking them to support devices that nobody uses then i want them to support one of those motion sensing things that consoles use so i can flail my arms around to make missiles fire
this would probably suffer the same fate as trackir if ccp even put it in
given someone at ccp thought it was a good idea to waste time making sure the eve client worked with the blinky flashy lights on a few alienware computers this proposal might actually have some tractioni remember when these controllers first came out was thinking about grabbing one soon

unless ccp changed it recently jumpcloaks currently last 60 seconds on tranquilitysupportedlet a ship transition from jumpcloak to its onboard cloaking device without being directly visible if needed for game balance then a nondecloaking object called a jump signature can be created on the ships position that anyone can approach this jump signature would appear either when the cloaked ship starts moving or 60 seconds after jumping into the system whichever happens first that is this jump signature would appear on cloaked ships whenever the jumpcloak would have broken
not supportedi can currently catch roughly 30 of all the cloaky transports that jump into my lowsec gate blind unscouted ie the way you should never jump into lowsec if this gets changed the number automatically goes to roughly 0 unless the person jumping crashesdisconnectswhatever
the only difference to a lottery here is that your chance of winning does not decrease with the number of participants and introducing more t2 bpos into the system is still one of the worst possible fixes why do you think ccp stopped the introduction of more

i see what you did there op supported i too am lolling at the sheep who didnt read the opalso this is actually a fix the bloody industry interface already thread for those of you who read down to here and still dont get it
i am convinced that ccp does have a way of dealing with the bots since they have done it before on a much smaller scale they just refuse to do so the reason they wont is twofold first bots are still accounts and ccp wants to show off how many accounts subscribe to the game and they want the cluster to be as populated as possible waiting on busting through 70000 second people are right and bots are possibly the largest producer of minerals in the game so what would happen if ccp removed all bots the mineral market would tank due to lack of supply and prices would shoot up like crazy prices would skyrocket now this is not really a problem for existing players who have seen astronomically high prices but those high prices were back in 2005 when everyone had low skills now its 2011 and people have brawndo skillsccp does not want to dump brand new players into an environment where prices are through the roof and where other players have an 8 year advantage against them while neither problem presents itself as major to us current players to a new player it could seem like swimming with sharks in the middle of the pacificof course if botters were done away with then mining would become an extremely profitable profession once againccp is a business and they are smart they know existing players dont care enough to leave so they will focus on getting new players in
all theyd need to do is bring back the npc buy  sell orders as a relief valve let npcs buy  sell the 8 minerals ice products  p0 pi goods with the price control slider in the hands of the good dr e so he can adjust price caps  floors as required to keep the economy from grinding to a halta broad price bracket like jita trit buy12 sell45 would allow for some pretty dramatic price swings before the npcs kicked in as long as things are working then the player economy will continue without the npcs as it does today if moving numbers start getting close to a cap the economic team can look at why and decide if they should let the npcs catch the price or if the fundamentals are sound and the price cap needs to be moved if the sky starts falling or the floor blows up the npcs can catch the pieces contain the damage  keep the game from choking on its greatest feature until ccp can put eve back on track
very true but then those that are convinced that eve is a player run economy will cry when they realize ccp is directly interfering which they do anyways now
atra hasis speaking only for myself id rather have a player driven economy with npc safety nets on core products than a bot driven economy that floats free

teadaze passed the word that they sent the first release candidate back for a reedit so it might be a couple more days
hopefully this wont delay the release too badly but in their current state they dont accurately reflect the csm concerns in a couple of sessionsonce the edits are agreed there is a system taking a couple of days for the ccp community team to process and release them

there is a place  a magical place  on the eve online website where one person can write new content and others can edit it over time once the article is published it has its own life independent of its creatorthat magical place  is the evelopedia but the csm stuff is a maze of links would anyone complain if someone was to go in there and provide meaning full organisation to itsuch as headings for each csm session linking to the members and the issues raised for each csm ie one link to members of the  csm and another to csm  candidacy which you currently do have to burrow a bit to findthen we could update the members list to link their player name to their blog perhaps add the csm devblog to the main csm pageill work on it over the next few hours once i get home from work

no
ok point taken however think of it this way you may be a proponent of for example peace you would not be a protagonist of peace however unless you took some form of action to bring it aboutwhich i do for eve i dabble in fiction i subscribe i get others to subscribe to me that is a tad more than just a proponent of eve
because eve is unique in the respect that it does not cater to the instant gratification crowd like practically all competitorseve rewards perseverance intelligence people skills etc once you start down the path of rewarding more than already whomever has more cash to burn in real life eve may make more money but it will be worse for itwhat would be next sp for isk shipsmods for isk how about a store like those of the freetoplay gamesif you  up in eve tough  you get up and go out mess someone else up to make yourself feel better  it is the human way it is the eve way
im fine with them murdering caps it just silly that they can do the same to subcaps without any support fleet of their own

there is no reason for the melons and wangs to be more prominent than they already are in the character creator the only difference is that guys can have melons and girls can have wangsthe gender ambiguity simply allows for a wider range of artistic expression we already have men dressing as women generating female characters we have women dressing as men so why not allow some mix and match in that costume selectionclothing optional scenes are a separate issue we will have bars run by players complete with strippers eventually in the next iteration of incarna no doubt so why cant gallente clubs have the appropriate style of stripper no doubt matari strip clubs will feature heavily tattooed dancers while caldari will no doubt feature very expensive bodies of some form or another what exactly constitutes exotic dancing in amarr establishments is left as an exercise for the reader but no doubt involves scriptureinspired interpretive dance
im going to say that i support this but i really am somewhat on the fence about it and this is mostly because i do not want to see this game go into a tailspin and get crapped on by the american media after all the american subscriber base is a very large portion of eves total subscriber basehowever what i am mainly concerned about is what the media attention will result in such content would be deemed very inappropriate by certain parties in the us which might result in the game receiving an ao rating this would kill eve in the useven with all of this being said i support this for one very good reason sexual topics and differences are not something that should be a taboo subject in american culture but rather something to be explored there are younger children who should not be exposed to strip bars and such environments but honestly i think something like this would be a small move for the us to a better set of cultural ideals that dont idealize violence and abstain from all sexual topicswith that being said add prostitutes just for realism please i dont understand what it is with mass effect and not having pros but having all sorts of nasty bars and suchedit also it should be noted for all that once incarna goes live theres a good chance that the female portion of the subscriber base will shoot up just because eve wont be purely about space ships and such but avatars also just something that should be mentioned

how about i post the way i choose you refrain from directing me and generally cool your jets you seem to be getting a little excited you dont need source code to discern common senseyoure arguing rights under the law im arguing ethics and customer relationspublic relations your argument is that people are taken advantage of and as long as its legal its okay or if you can get away with it its okay given that i can understand why youre having difficulty understanding peoples objection to facebook or what ccp has done here with facebookim not arguing rights or law if ccp wanted to hold the votes for the csm entirely and exclusively on facebook they could do it its their right and it would be legal if ccp wanted to charge for each expansion they could do it its their right and it would be legal why dont they do these things the first is not that large a stretch the second isnt such a large stretch when you consider how they make such big deal out of the expansions being free the answer is simple customer feedback would be negative and of large volume ccp wants feedback from customers theyve publicly stated it any number of times were customers and this is our feedbackseems youre the one making assumptions and fairly careless ones at thatwindjammer

more info is needed on this subject before theres any reason to oppose this decisionthe main piece of info i need is whether or not they use a facebook app for voting that accesses your data i specifically avoid any apps on facebook that does this for obvious reasons and if it was like this then i would understand completelyotherwise if its just using facebook to join a group or click like on some subject then its not that big of a deal imo
good to know thank you for the informationbest regardswindjammer
trying to get advertisement for free on the expanse of the eve community baaaad idea
my condolences then i have dealt with marketing departments before and have found they can be very frustrating to deal with so focussed on new gimicks and yet blind to current customersif they think forcing eve players to sign up to other companies software is a good idea to drum up attention they should just go all the way and require eve players to sign up for wow trial accounts in order to vote for eve content then maybe 10 million new people will get introduced to eve might sound good to the marketing dept on paper but sounds rediculous to many of usno i wouldnt roll a fake blood elf in order to vote then not touch it ever again and not a fake facebook entitiy either
i have no interest in interacting with facebook for any particular thing the voting should be through the eve online website or even better the game client
well its not us who need the credibility but the voting system and right now i say facebook has none in that light i say the topic of facebooks trustworthiness is more than relevantas has been said before ccp should of course have used eve gate or another ingame voting mechanism if for nothing else because it would have allowed only eve subscribers to vote but as the guy from csm divulged choosing facebook was a commercially motivated decision and greed has a tendency to take the place of common sense
as with my original post on this thread even before a csm came on and told u i was correct about this its a marketing strategy to increase eve onlines visibility to non eveplayers and yet again windjammer your remarks fall short of the obvious point of this strategy so give it a restin actual fact it was you who started the whole assumption fiasco when u wrongly accused me of being a ccp staff member waaaay wrong m8 unlucky plus talking as if youre feeling wronged in some way because u need to sign up to a random free website to take part in a vote on artwork that wont see the light of day in eve for a hell of a long time if not everive voted and made a fake facebook profile and you want to know why not because i particularly want to see any of those ships in eve and not so i can have a small temper tantrum when it doesnt happen then threaten ccp with cancelling my million or so subscriptions but because i appreciate the time taken by all of those guys and girls who spent cumulative hours that im sure turned to days creating their own 3d masterpieces i personally feel that spending 15 minutes or less making a fake facebook profile liking eves facebook group and voting for 3 ship designs i like best shows respect and credit where credits due on good honest hard and skillfull work regardless of ccps inability to respect their player baseto me this is about appreciating the content creators in this contest not using it as a massive workhorse to say fk you ccpbt thats just me
unequivocally yes
yup you did say it first  no contestits not the amount of minutes it takes to create a facebook account but what that account stands for and the people behind itrespect you say funny thing about that respect is a twoway street if ccp wanted us to show our appreciation for the makers of those models than they should have respected their userbase enough to use a reputable voting system like their own not the fault of the ship designers of course at the same time im not gonna jeopardize my own online security by creating a facebook account just so i can show appreciation elsewheresomeone at ccp was drooling over the facebook hype and at that point became totally unreasonable seeing only the dollar signs in his own eyes and becoming purposely deaf to the more than reasonable objections people might have against facebook and why an ingame voting system would have been much better thats also not the fault of the ship designers but it aint mine either

thank you for posting this and i welcome the csms position on this issuei have no issue with ccp advertising on facebook or anywhere else for that matter i do have an issue with them making eve related content only available via third party websites if ccp wanted to advertise eve andor this competition on facebook then thats fine but the voting should have happened only on ccps own websites and the facebook adds should simply have directed people here if ccps decision was purely a marketing and pr one which they have every intention of repeating i would hope we can make it clear that this is unacceptable and that a petition like this will appear every time they outsource eve content i would hope that the csm would bring this issue back up with ccp with the added ammunition of having a large and pd off player base behind themedit for grammar

i dunno if this has been mentioned before but why not just add a voting feature to evegate since it is eves inhouse social network i will go back to scratching my manly chin now ty

yes anything to reduce clickingthis would be nice for 00 sometimes it takes you longer to fit a ship than to lose it
1 needs more adventure random events stuff like that
as long as its not the text you mentioned i would like to see it rather i would like to have a voiceover by the voice that does warp drive active and such interacting with the ship ai ftw
need moar loar
suport this
can it be try to not be as much a spaz as you were yesterday you know what i mean by default
being a broker nohowever building an area  upkeep in money to provide manufacturing and such is okay because that would require work
removing isk sinks would cause hyperinflation and destroy eve economy other mmos in the past have fallen into barter economy where money is worthless and one type of goods must be exchanged for another in trades due to this effect interactivity is fine but it cannot remove isk sinks in the process
too much inflation is bad at the moment it looks like the average wallet is increasing by 30 per year qen 32010 page 17 fig 4why dont you think of something else then stuff with fun not this bureaucratic for example gambling protected by concord in that case a sink the house concord always gets a cut and thus isk leaves the economy
i think this is a great idea it give traders some value over and above everything just trading may introduce other entry professions and give value to in station discourse
so we have super pretyy moving avatars the size of an infants thumbnailsure add more useless crap to the game
always supporting new  improved features
o wack heyand bump
supportedid personally like to see gallente ships with the active rep bonuses ex brutix myrmidon hyperion get that bonus changed to an armor buff ex 5 armor per level in this way gallente ships dont need to fit plates keeping them lightish and can field sufficiently meaty tanks despite having less lowslotsthe downside with this is that people would create some wicked brick tanks using the new bonuses and plates ex with the myrmidon i can get 100k ehp with two 1600 plates 3 eanm iis a dcii and lg slaves with even a 5 per level bonus this would push the ehp up to around 125k way too meaty for a mere battlecruiserhonestly though i would like to see the gallente be given an upgrade as a whole the whole active tanking race bit and being mediocre to inefficient in a fair bit of pvp situations just isnt cutting it anymore
what are these armor repzors you mention never heard of them are they a new module solosmallgang pvp which is the only place it is useful is becoming increasingly rare so unless ccp sits down and reexamines the whole buffer vs active tank side of things id say discard any and all active rep bonusesoption one is not worth considering unless ccp does something to make active repair worthwhile compared to bufferoption two goddess no have you seen what the serpentis ships can do with their godwebs no way in hell those things should ever be reintroduced in the mainstreamoption three looks like the way things are now the shield craze of 2010201 having 34 of the races as shield tanks makes for a poorer game so noactually looks like a decent way of doing it dont worry about the possibility of the 100k tank as it can always be tweaked through related attributes  hasnt hurt the drake to have that kind of buffer my take increase speed of all blaster boats to matari levels but decrease inertia gives you straight line speed to catch and manoeuvre under tackle while limiting kiting shenanigans that is a minnie trademark replace all active bonuses with either raw ehp as mentioned in post above or gundrone bonusesnever did fathom why the megathron is the only blaster platform with a tracking bonus give hybrids a make over similar to what was done for projectiles just not as exaggerated please 
definitely supporting an improvement to gal ships theyre practically dissapearing in pvp except for a few exceptionsi prefer the idea of bonuses to armor resist strengths rather than armor hp increase per level as certain aspects of performance should change with an increase in armor amount the same way you put a plate on u decrease speed and increase mass and therefore inertiai do also believe that some gal ships do desperately require pg increasesedited to support
some pretty reasoned thinking there  would probably support option one
supported
true only role of dreads atm is docking anyway scs are overpowered now you can boost all other ships to compensate or you can nerf one ship class the scs that really sounds like a better solutionbtw normally i would have supported this but there is already an imo better one a bit down
supported id like the chance to blast charisma skills for a few months without shafting my skill plan like many other people have the opportunity now to do so
ill further simplify the equation to hopefully make it abundantly clearhit chance  12transvrangetrackingsigressigrad2 max0rangeoptimalfalloff2now the piece of this equation in question is thistransvrangetrackingsigressigradnow multiply the two halves of this and gettransvsigresrangetrackingsigradnow let us for examplewe wanted to reduce the signature resolution sigres by 10 we would represent that in this mannertransvsigres910rangetrackingsigradthe fraction 910 is commonly known as 90 or 10 less this can mathimatically be shifted to the denominator simply by inverting ittransvsigresrangetracking109sigradas you can see this means a 10 reduction 910 to signature resolution has exactly the same affect as an inverse increase 109 or 111111111111 in trackingso you can see there is absolutely no difference whatsoever between decreasing signature resolutions and inversely increasing tracking making modifying both of them pointless misleading and generally fail and yes it works the same with all mods bonuses and anything and everything else
railguns are good at snipinglike me
aaargh yes it will signature resolution is simply another modifier to tracking  just like tracking modsship bonuseshardwirings there is no difference between a turret of sig res 400 m and tracking 0004 and one of sig res 100 m and tracking 0001
adestria and vindicator are the only gallente ships with real gallente bonus and where hybrids work fine in papernow some people talk about drones well drones everybody can use them so this is not an argument if all gallente ships had 10 or 5 hp and dmg per level then drone argument could be reasonable but its nothybrids get me 
railguns are also terrible at posting killmails  like you
im not really sure what part of me proving them to be exactly the same you failed to understand as in exactly in every way you know as in having the same effect in every way do you really not grasp the concept of exactly the same you know completely the same thingdo you understand math at all i showed you how a change to one is exactly the same as an inverse change to the other any change that kind of includes all bonuses hardwiring and tracking modslets go back to the simplified trackingsig part of the hit equationtransvsigresrangetrackingsigradnow i really didnt think it needed to be simplified any further but lets remove all the variables were not even talking about simply to see the relation between signature resolution and trackingsigrestrackinglooks suspiciously like they have an inverse relationship doesnt it now lets pretend your bonuses hardwirings and tracking mods happen to increase your tracking by 50 nicesigrestracking15now what happens if sigres is reduced by 50 too this is also commonly known as dividing by 2 so we put a 2 on the bottom of the equationsigrestracking152whoa did you see that that division by 2 multiplies with any tracking modifiers in this case the 50 tracking in case you missed itsigrestracking152wow they multiply that means changes to sig res and trackign stack perfectly in every way wow
u mad bro
there are even software token generators i believe i saw a friend running one on his smartphone to get a starcraft 2 code just link it to your account then require it as youre signing on tie it to 3 computers max requiring email authentication for each one and youre golden they would have to compromise your email address your account and then get the software token generator although this would probably take a little deployment time and a little bit of expense it would probably be worth it
how about you just mark ecm as passive modules sure they stop you from targeting someone but other than that they are completely harmless so make concord ignore jamming and only kill for damage and warp scrambling and other overtly offensive tactics i for one would like to be able to use this whenever to wave off the curious guy with a ship or cargo scanner so i dont support the complete removal concord protection but i do belive ecm and target jammers are harmless enough not to trigger concord and sec losshowever unprovoked ecm will trigger corperate level killrights for the person you jammed otherwise the gankers would just sit in belts messing up the miners instead of killing them totally killing productivity
remove concord protection for stupid people hauling billions in noobshipsseriously space is large it doesnt make sense concord appearing in a second to everywhere and not being able to escaperemove hi secit is needless waste of space it only gives people false belief that they should be safe wherever they fly and discourages social roleplay
1 opgankers have the smallest consequences ig for their choices highsec therm is laughableforce people yes youre right this is the best wayand has i dont like your ideas so id say that concord should insta shoot you under 05 ss gankers insta 
the fix to suicide ganking is very simple make killrights commodities enforce the norecycletoavoidrepercussions ruleanything further is overkill and goes against the whole sandbox theme that is supposed to be integral to eve might consider a penalty to security status gain based on whether a killright is active removes the gankbydayratbynight people from the equationthe only way i have ever managed to make more isk than 00 was when i dabbled in marketeering  gave that up when it became apparent that it is filled with 001isk macros  please stop with the omg golden highsec goose getting oldyou neglect to consider that a vast majority of the high population are casual player nonsociopaths or alts forcing people to live in dramallama land is more likely to make them drop their subscriptions than put up with the current state of affairs in nulllooks good on paper but humanity sheepish as it is very seldomly engages in activities that goes against its naturewishes  except when no other option is available which in this case would cost ccp money
this againto stop the lion eating you you do not need to be faster than the lion you just need to be faster than your slowest friendthe moment you become the fattest slowest friend youre deadi typically forget to insure 2 out of 10 of my suicide ganking vessels but never once regretted pulling the triggeronce they remove insurance and that still doesnt stop the ganks what are you going to ask for finesbecause frankly ask for that now because thats whats next and wed like our entertaining threads to stop being so samey
insurance should refuse to pay for ship losses to concord this is way more realistic than the current system
sorry i dont support this it isnt even close to game breaking in fact youd prolly find that ccp is kinda grateful for them forcing missionrunners to spread out a bit rather than every missionrunner in the game piling into just a few systems motsu dodixi etc are overcrowded already imagine how bad itd be if everyone whos left due to the gankers suddenly came back
at present a storyline mission is offered for every 16 regular missions that a player completes of the same faction and level each factionlevel combination has a separate counter tracking the number of regular missions completed and these counters hide in the game engine serversideproposal have the neocom journal include a subtab with a list of counters tracking how many regular missions have been completed for each faction and level since the last storyline mission offer the display would be a simple twocolumn tableamarr empire  level 1 6amarr empire  level 2 2amarr empire  level 3 4amarr empire  level 4 13amarr empire  level 5 0ammatar mandate  level 1 9ammatar mandate  level 2 1ammatar mandate  level 3 0ammatar mandate  level 4 2ammatar mandate  level 5 0blood raiders  level 1 8and so on
then i could delete the note that is in my neocom notes that i do this with
after some research i shamefully found that i was in err about how storyline missions work which is bad considering i run missions all the time in retrospect supported
you cant do that now separate tab
supportedsimply because it will not break anything what i would like to see is that the level of storyline mission you receive is based on the level of mission you do most so if you do 15 l1s and 1 l4 well poop for you you will get a l1 storyline if its a tie well give em the better mission also i would like to see a storyline mission be given randomly like its between 10 or 20 missions imo its way too easy to get storylines especially after you get the skills to just blast through missions its too easy to get high faction standings
confirming that this is not how storylines work you must do 16 lvl 4 missions to get a lvl 4 storyline each mission level is completely independent from one another supported
sounds like a good ideai accidentally repackaged all the cans in my hangar onceit was a freakin mess if i could just have 1 can with tabs i would be able to see the new items easier without scrolling past all my cans first
wtb bpos for all cans except jet cans
heck no to the op if anything must be done i would like the cost lowered significantly for increased warfare capability for smaller corps as it is i have to keep my main busy to feed my pewpewing alts wallets 50 million isk means just too much precious time spent in the sewer of missioningninjasalvaging just to make isk to have fun and even then most of those gooey carebears just dock up for the duration so that 50 million might just go to waste anyway but its probably safest to keep things the way they are with no one completely happy and no one completely miserable youve probably got a good compromise
how about thiswhen you declare war dec pay the cost you get to shoot them but they cant shoot you until you aggro kinda like can flipping mechanicand if they want to shoot you they also pay the war cost or they declare war mutual and neither of you pay anythingthat sounds a lot more fair in terms of costs
if you meant the current 2 mil fee to dec a corp should be increased to 50 mil then i agree
on the issue of relevance highsec wardecs have none i agree completely that they cost way too little money this is not to say that i want the price of wardecs to increase to such a degree that they become completely infeasible but 2 million to wardec a corporation is kind of ridiculous the reason that it is ridiculous though is because there is very minimal risk involvedtake a large 00 campaign for example even though there is no mechanic in place to facilitate the campaign weeks and sometimes months are spent in the planning and execution of them alliances and coalitions plan out cost effectiveness vs risk involved for the highsec wardecing corporation the cost of initiating what we can laughably call a war should represent a modicum of intent to begin some sort of meaningful campaign instead of i just want to shoot things nowplain and simple if you raise the cost it takes to wardec an entity the wardeccer will think harder about doing so they will have to research their opponent not to say they dont now and determine whether or not there is some relevance behind what they are about to doyet again i must stress i dont want to see pvp come to a grinding halt in empire i just think that people should have to think more critically about declaring war
500 mil is fine with me if you want to go to war it should cost you and not just be a gratuitous griefing tool1
wardec price is too highmy corp only has like 3 million how we are going to kill people insulting now this is not fair i demand lower wardec pricesseriously i dont want to buy isk from chinese just to wardec some griefers
lol you can buy your isk from ccp too legally besides highsec should not be wannabepvpelitists heaven either im all for raising minimum wardeck fee to 50 milweek  random chance concord official to screw you and you get concorded anyways p
whilst i agree that it should be a bigger commitment from the organisation that is declaring war the numerous cheap loopholes that make it trivial to avoid a wardec also need to be closed if youre going to advocate that corp a has to spend 500 mill or whatever to dec corp b then corp a are entitled to actually get a war for their iskreally the whole wardec system needs to be reworked from scratch
declare a war on pvp corp and you will get it dec a mining corp and you wont either members leave or you get to pop a few barges neither of which constitutes a war
and that there is the fundamental misunderstanding that people who dont leave rens amarr jita or dodixie have regarding wars and pvp cost effectiveness whatagain its about enjoyment griefers enjoy the game a certain way carebears enjoy it a different way you and the others supporting this hilarious proposal are arrogant and conceited to think yours is any more right a way to play than the pirates or the griefers i know its a tired old cliche but if you cannot take the heat if you cant cope with the fact that undocking is implicitely agreeing to lose your ship then get the  back to wow
in some way this affects just about everythingnerf cloaksnerf localmake high sec safermake high sec less safestop the botsbla bla blawe have problems in this game that in most cases is connected to the system of security rating and safetyhigh sec i think this was intended to be reasonably safe but still possibly to gank a high value target these days though gankings happen for fun with no profits and little repercussions the people that dont pvp here want it to be safer the pirates want it to be less so i can the points from both sides but neither solution will make the majority happy im not sure what functionality war decs were supposed to have but it isnt much of a tool to eliminate competition now its little more than a way to gank people legally and many people dont even leave the newbie corps as a result high sec is a messlow sec probably intended to be the area where pirates end up due to sec rating and where industrialists go to increase their earnings by risking exposure to the pirate population unfortunately while many pirates are here  theres at least as many in high sec possibly due to a lack of easy targets in low sec lack of easy targets is an obvious sign that the system in place doesnt do enough to encourage high sec people to venture into low sec low sec should attract industrialists  but currently it seems more like high sec attracts pirates this cant be rightnull sec i guess this was intended as the unsafest area but its been redesigned over the years into the place where you build empires as a result you are now relatively safe here while you do pve and industrialist work but the profit margin is still through the roof  and the amount of botting out here clearly indicates that something is wrong in spite of the current safety people are asking to have afk cloaking nerfed as it makes them too unsafe and the other side want to remove local to make it less safe  and personally i think the number of bots indicate that this is probably closer to the truth though maybe the problem is the profitability of the area not the safety null sec can be is very inaccessible to people without connections and only a very small section of our pirate population operate out here null is a bit of a messthe only thing thats crystal clear from looking at the forums is that all areas have a large section of the population thats rather unhappy with how things areid like to suggest that ccpcsm actually figure out what to do once and for all first step must be a survey one that reaches as many players as possible and tries to find out what we actually want simply asking for opinions on the forum isnt really enough as we all know the forums attract certain types and never gives a proper representation of the player baseonce ccp have a good grasp of what people actually want to get out of the game they need to figure out what they want out of their game and start working on merging the two and hopefully come up with a system that functions better than the mess we currently have im sure ccp can come up with something better than thistime to stop trying to fix the system and just make a better system from scratch
hello alli shall start my tale on the eve of christmas it was a snowy snowy night in the dales of yorkshire when a man logged into his email their in the inbox was a mail from ccp entitled this character is being transfered to your account if you are not expecting this transfer please let us know by clicking this link ok ok ok well i was a mug and i fell for it a few hours later my wallets were dry my bpos were gone and i was left to write a petition gms did what they could i got some back but not allso i have been sat for a while now thinking how the incresing problem of hacking and rmt can be tackled and i hate to say it but a solution may already be in place for world of warcrafti will wash my keyboard latersee i was chatting to my mate he plays wow and i told him what happened to me he simply showed me his authenticator and explained it to me seems like a good idea to me can a similar system be put into place for eveif you dont know what it is just google blizzard authenticator
this idea has been proposed on numerous threads please support one of those such as this one or any of the other ones while i do agree with you the multiple threads just limits the impact of a proposal to ccp
clicking on links in emails were a bad idea five years go not sure why you suddenly thought it wise never ever click anything you did not specifically ask for simple enough rule that keeps you safe from 999 of all the evils of the interwebzorhaving an authenticator is a good idea for the easily distracted but for goddess sake dont make it mandatory
the reason most people get alts is not to train them seperatly it is so they can dual box a miner and a hauler missioner salvager tackler ganker allowing alts to train seperatly would not deprive ccp of their 2x subscription because although they are training they cant log in at the same time
i never understood the point of making more than 1 character on 1 account for this very purpose right now all i have is 1 alt that sits in jita to check the prices for me honestly i do think we should be able to do thisand of course no other mmos allow you to play on 2 characters at the same time on the same account but this is eve and the ways to level up your character are very different you can get on a different character on other mmos and train them up but in eve its just a waiting game its not really a valid comparison between them
thisthe training system on eve is unique to eve comparing other systems to eve is unreasonable as it is so wilding different from your garden variety games players dont work for their skills completing mindless actions for sp to go up a silly level ccp could also make bank with this as a lot of people will sell plexes and gtc to get isk to pay for training all their alts since one character can only be used at any given time on a single account the abuse factor in normal gameplay is limited though still existent this could tho lead to the farming of characters but since you still have to pay considerable isk since you have 3 toons to skill up to turn a significant enough profit to do so it is limited remember bots can only use one toon per account too so they will be largely unaffectedwhen properly thought about the elements really balance themselves outin eve you have to pay for your skills so i say if you have the isk then why not sure there will be a lot more highly trained toons but that just means more isk is gonna get thrown at those skills and so everyone has less on the sheer basis of it becoming a huge isk sink i uber support this as isk is way too readily available as is
not supported you want more toons training at a time you gotta pay for it on separate accounts theres nothing stopping you from training two characters on separate accounts and combining them when one is finished or training a second once youve gotten one where you want it theres not a lot of reason to have one toon learn to do everything in game anyways just makes for a more expensive clone when you get podded and if you ever want to do something new a focused toon sells better in the bazaar
as soon as eve lets me train faster by logging in you might have a point
supported
my pointyou missed it
your pointis meaningless since there is an mmo that does that
personally without comparing eve to other mmos i am in favor of a limited version of this if we had the choice to pay for one month for a month of skill training on one character or pay for two months to train all 3 it would save both overhead at ccp and give them more income since you cant play more than one character at once on the same account anywaysif they implemented this idea i could see a winwin situation admittedly character trainers could abuse this but that would be fairly limited given the number of accounts that are outright selling obselete characters in a personal sense anywaystentatively supported
if you want to train 3 characters at 13rd the speed sure if you want to be able to add int the que skills for different characters i would accept thisif you whant to train three times as many charactes at the same speed while paying for one as much as i would like thi i think ccp would not
i know that this will just get a chorus of youre trying to dumb down eve but just try to read through my logic and see if it makes sensei would like to see medical clone costs what you pay to get a new clone after you are podded or your sp gets high enough for the next level be completely removedright now only a complete idiot or a new player forgets to update their medical clone upon crossing the sp threshold or getting podded however the costs of these clones do provide yet another isk cost to pvp and the more isk cost to pvp the less likely some people will be to participate no matter how hardcore eve is a lot of players are very risk adversecurrently if a bunch of 23 year old mission runners decided they wanted to take the plunge and try pvp they could jump into rifters and head for combat however even with jump clones they arent just facing a 1m loss for a cheap rifter but also an additional and much higher charge for their new medical clones if they get podded for a lot of characters the cost isnt much but every extra bit is a further disincentive for pvpadditionally its a very flawed game mechanic the only people who ever lose sp are those that are forgetful or new players unfamiliar with the concept punishing the forgetful is funny at times but not conductive to maintaining subscription numbers as some of these people probably quit in frustration after losing some sp new players are the ones we want to stick with eve and any mechanic that may cause them to become frustrated and quit for no discernible benefit in gameplay is flawedconsit would remove an isk sink but i imagine it is an incredibly small isksink when viewed across the entire eve economy
are you that densewhats next free insurance free shipsseriously where do you get off making such outlandish ideas over something you obviously do not understandat least the people who complain about high costhigh sp clones have a rational argumentyours is just utterly off the walland to top that off your in eve uni memberi would have thought the first thing they taught you was you dont fly what you cant afford to loseits more to it than that eve is about risk vs costevery time you go pvp your taking a risk to offer free clones removes the risk and makes the whole affair more like wow and less eveyou want wow that bad quit and go play wow
i dont think i would mind making clones free but you should still have to update themthats the consequence of death if you forgot you lose sp that established mechanic i see no reason to take out you are right about the old players its simply too costly to go have fun p at no point in the game should you have to make another character so that its not as expensive to pvpinvest some sp in reading dumbass hes talking about clone cost for those people that have lots of sp not ships every time someone over 70 million sp gets podded it costs 15 million to get a new clone getting podded can happen when you go through the wrong gatehaving clone costs so high makes pvp a very undesirable experience even when using jump clones i dont think high sp characters like reformed carebears should be punished because theyve played the game so long
supported
the options provided and the costs associated punish a player the longer they are with the gameif the player stays past the 70sp barrier then they are punished harder againthis has no bearing on what ships theyre flying or how they use their characterit is not flexible and grossly inflates the costs at an every increasing ratethis makes fun not
old players shouldnt be penalised for flying cheap tackle in 00
counterproposal double clone costssince the average iskhour income has gone up considerably over the years the costs of clones became too cheap and almost entirely insignificant furthermore since the costs of standard 3 implants has gone down almost 75 the loss of pod has become just a minor nuisance clone costs have to be increased to adjust for all the other cost reducing factors people have to fear getting podded
not supportednot even sure why this was suggested in the first place
can you add undocking animations in this proposal too for stations it could play a client side animation of a few small drones tractor beaming your ship out of or into the station depending on if you are dockingundocking this would also make a more visible session change timer you can visually see your ship still being towed into the station while getting the ship is still being towed into station message instead of having to spam the change ship button and guess when the timer reaches zero like your currently have to undocking would have your ship being towed down the hallway at the same speed as the bar currently goes it would be smoothed so your ship doesnt jump foreward all of a sudden this would also be better because the game would have already loaded most of the meshes and textures it will need so you wont have a terrible graphic lag upon undocking
tired of sitting at the sidelines during the great rmtbotting revolt of 2011 read this quick guide to get your feet wetback on planet earth circa 2003 a new online game called eve started up one of the best professions was mining because minerals were in extremely short supply you either had to buy the expensive minerals or mine your own to make your ships eventually people started mining and some really lazy folks started bottingfastforward 7 years and the people are ed the massive influx of minerals have made the mining profession a joke for pretty much anyone and the massive stocks of minerals sit on markets for quite a while rmt has made the ingame legal choice of gtcs become more and more expensive because people buy isk and use that to buy plexes driving up the costs law of supply and law of demandsome bots even went as far as ratting making the officer mods more common and could threaten to bring the prices down eventually entire forum posts and events were created to eliminate or curb the amount of bots ccp in all their mighty goodness said they were working on it and it the end to bots would be coming soon as players waited and waitedand then my auntie got scared and sent me all the way to belair
confirming that i have purchased sufficient minerals to build multiple titans in jita in the space of a few minutesin the absence of any official statistics on the incidence of plex purchased using subsequently confiscated rmtbought isk i think we should tread carefully before speculating on what people do with it it would be interesting to see what rmters tend to buy though and i would welcome the publication of some statistics on this matter at least they got rid of quite a large chunk of the bots that were consuming the most server resources a while back the ones running missions
yeah project unholy rage was nice but i think its time for ccp to take the next step and adjust their focus from rmt to all macro activities some regions are even renown as macro havens or at least accused with some facts to back it up stain et al it has been confirmed by some macroers such as the ones discussed on the recent threadnought that isk goes in part to buy etcs so the rl investment is minimizedtldr good job with project unholy rage now its time to step it up
thats not how the song goes 
i remember seeing in project rage that the banning of the bots caused a severe reduction in cpu useplayer needless to say it all indicates that a botcontrolled player eats up far more cpu than real players like 100 more at least im wondering if this couldnt be exploited as a first step in tracking down suspected bots at least until the bots are updated that is
you guys just got bel aired and didnt even notice it
then its a nonissue as you can and do live in a area with no localproblem solved
unlike any i am not making a proposal selfishly because something is an annoyance to me as you ha noted i couldnt care less bu i thought that such a great community deserve me throwing an idea with some potential out there
i agree if concord cant help you  they should not put you in localall low secs should work like whpeople can gauge your talentskills by your toon in locals employment historyage whenever anyone travels in local  you talk to your fleet  corp  not people on the local channel low sec is not a chat program like high sec isas if i would want to go to war and the first thing i would do is tell everyone im less than a year old toon 100 supported  low sec local to work like wh
why not set up like in wspace for null space if you do not chat in local you do not appear in local but local is still there so if someone wants they can talk smack to the losers like it sometimes happens and you wont have to start a private conversation to do so or be used in some odd strat for pvping
ok reworking proposal give us an option to chose local just add a cross if you close it you dont apprea in local but you cannot see who is there you get the option
not supportedalso being able to opt out of local is a terrible idea
each ecm firing is independant of all othershaving one ecm on a ship has no effect on whether a second ecm on the same ship will work or notie ecms do not stackhow do you propose to stacking penalize a mod which does not stack 
dear goddess no i still have nightmares from the old days when your targeting and gun range could be dampedtded infinitelyserver obviously has the information since it sends the attempted jam to target client  so shouldnt be a problemecm core mechanic has to change everything else is just spraying deodorant on a decomposing turd in a vain attempt to make it less offensiveno support for bandaid measures
you either jam a target or you dontyour ecm has no effect on the target ship if it does not workso a second activation would stack on what attribute ship jammed from first jammer second jam activates but its irrelevant if penalised or not because the ship is allready jammed and cannot be jammed furthership not jammed on first jammer second jammer activates and is penalised on whether or not the target is allready jammed target is not allready jammed by anything so jammer is not penalised

good idea
ive done my fair share of invention and ive owned over 200 t2 bposall purchased from other players id say im a well aware of the difference between the two each has its pros and cons and is quite balanced as is not perfect but not that far eitherthat convenience with t2 bpos over invention comes with a very large price tag so while it might be convenient time and click wise it certainly isnt convenient on your wallet due to the huge prices of the bpos so its a trade off of work and time spend time and clicks to be able to afford the convenience of a t2 bpo or spend the time and clicks to be able to avoid the huge overhead of owning onejust to clear some things up i currently own zero t2 bpos i also do not plan on ever going back either ive moved on to better investmentswhile t2 bpos can be vanity items they are also investments so their price isnt solely derived from their rarity their price is determined by profits production overhead ease of sales logistics in movement and slightly affected by their raritycool factorim fortunate enough to have played since the start of eve and it has given me a lot of time to personally try just about everything there is to try in eve so im very well aware of how the game worksi do consider myself well off but the majority of my isk didnt not come from t2 bpos id say about 7080 of it came from other venturesinvestments while my 3rd party service can be quite profitable it doesnt even come close to my other income earning activities as boring as it sounds it actually comes from large scale investments and tradehope that clears things up for you

in basic termst2 titandoomsday activation creates 10 minute gridwide interdictor bubble meaning nothing on grid can be hardcoded 250km radius can warpcapitals can still jumpprice something like twice or three times a titan
can you list your projected tactical and strategic implications of such a devicei suppose it also prevents an ongrid warp 150 km from your location on top of enemybut people from off grid can still warp on top of your selected targets  a bit unfairat first glance i fail to see what good can come of this seems like the main purpose is to ensure a complete turkey shoot  destroy weaker force completely allowing no escapesand the fact that caps can still jump out makes sure caps arent committed to the fight can always bail when the turkey shoot is over
doesnt work mostly because you can pop up cyno everywhere except hi sec without dedicated ship and without warning go figure it would also make bringing sub caps even near capitals pretty difficult since as it is now essential part of game mechanics is to warp out when youre damaged and then warp back
some merit yes but rails and blasters are a bit too different to do that especially in fitting stats if you would take the fitting requirements of rails the boats using the short ammo only would get gimped in tank too much using that of blasters would give sniping ships too much tankimho i think that long and short range weapons should all have about the same requirements but as that is never gonna change also how would that be done skill vise would you only have to skill one specialization skill and thus take longer or shorter to skill for t2 than the other weaponsalso having a jack of all trades weapon is kinda overpowered by itself and nerfing that would result in a weapon that cant compete again
no need to mess with skills just apply blaster skills when blaster ammo is loaded and rail skills when rail ammo is loaded donesniper boats arent short on tank for lack of grid  cpu but because theyre sniper boats and their slots are filled with damage  tracking mods so new blasters have blaster fitting reqs done jack of all trades gun has unique niche of vast range flexibility but still the fail of hybrids now needing cap to fire being either super short range with subpar tracking or kinda long range with wimpy dps  alpha and subpar tracking so jack of all trades master of none sounds fair done
hell im starting to think there is one weapon system to many in game lolz just delet hybirds and give gal projectiles and caldire lazers let them remburst the sp in hybird weapons
i agree that there are too many weapon systems to balance fairly there are just too many factors that result in imbalances how much weight do you attribute to cap usage and damage type selection id ditch the projectile weapon system and rebalance the blasters and rails machine guns in space seem a little silly to me
smart man 1 internet for you sir
also improve the friggin missile meta drop rates theyre absolutely terriblejust compare them to guns for ships of equivalent size and youll notice the missile launchers cost up to twenty times more
probably because they are used 20 times more
i support this
i support the motion these ships need some adjustments
if i listen carefully even now i hear my acolyte crying in my station just wanting to fly with all the other dronesplease think of the acolytes
imho caldari and amarr drones have no use they exceed at nothing and i never use them so they should get their own niche
give amarr drones the most ehp or something
pondersi dont know the nature of this problem all that well but this is supported since your logic is sound
im not a doctor either

but why do you always run away in your dual warp core stabbed rifter when i try kill you cearain
that must have been in a mission not a plex i do missions in pve ships and i will run when i am in a plex i am usually in a ship named something like fw plexxer so even the very dumb should be able to find me if they want a fight the only reason i open plexes is to try to speed up the process of getting in a decent pvp fight in a plex i usually just turn away from the rats so they dont aggro me or the enemy what do you think of the proposal
thissupported
id love a normal name d
i quite like my name but if i could have a real name as well as a callsign yeah thats be cool
ill support this for what its worthim not a massive fan of having everyone i know suddenly change racebloodlinegender but seeing how much they have changed for each bloodlines i understand the need for changewe took our current characters based on the looks we liked now they have changed some bloodlines so drastically the looks we wanted just cant be achieved any more so yeah we should be given the option to reassess our new looks
complete bull the only indication choosing the minmax approach is of is that aesthetics were slightly under the minmax approach in importance remember you could only choose one  it was either minmax or aesthetics some people get lucky and get one that coincides with both thats just luck and has nothing to do with actual decisionmaking on the players part as the given statistics are completely arbitrary in the first place i personally chose based on stats because there was no racial appearance preview i wasnt even aware that there were differences in appearance between the races only now with the new creator do we actually see the different looks before we can commit not to mention again there are no longer any stats your fatalistic clearly you chose one because it was far above the other ideal is more indicative of personal issues than anything to do with anyone elses decisionmaking
this is not a jokethis is very serious stuffi propose that some attention be brought to boobies in incarna marble boobies are no fun they also detract from the ambiance of the game seeing a female character walking while her boobs do not move in a realistic fashion makes me wonder if they are meant to cut diamonds or serve dinner i am not asking for dead or alive style boob movement here i am asking for some semblance of realism to them some movement is better than no movement at allthe videos that ccp has presented showing off what the carbon system can do proves that this is possible i am not asking that it be immediately appearent with incursion i could care less if the boobs dont move on a character i cannot see the body of but it would be nice to see this put into incarna it is the little things that make or break the ambiance in a game such as evei know there is a joke in therenot gonna use itso what do you say ccp you got the hair downthe eyes look real as do the clothes and your character models are by far best in the industrytake it a step further and make gravity do its thing god i hope i dont get banned for this
would be nice but there are about 50 other improvements changes and fixs needed before this needs looked intobut hey if it can be done in a day why not
i have it on good authority that no less than hilmar himself has explicitly forbidden research into breast dynamics on the grounds that it might destroy the company when you consider the possible negative effects of permitting breasts to wobble even slightly i am sure you will agree it could be catastrophicjust a few examples game design would spend months working on a set of 4thorder differential equations that properly model nippletrajectories instead of fixing sov art would be consumed in an orgy of bradesign legal would worry about lawsuits from victorias secret qa would spend months possibly years ensuring that faction undergarments have the proper stacking effects and finally when the serverside costs of properly modeling the effects of gravity become clear team gridlock would stop fighting the war on lag in favor of the more important war on droopbottom line its a bad idea
i also dont think that that is a useful usage of dev time
do new clones have perfectly rounded breasts  not sagged by a lifetime of joggingthese things keep me awake at night
some sacrifices just have to be made for the greater good
how can we have a totalscifigameimmersionexperience without wobbly norks
joke or seriousnesshonestly if it does require a set of fourth order differential equations which i find a bit strange for this case for them to be that high of an order then similar equations have probably been solved already since many games already employ this mechanicas for the rest of this really
im not joking either here boob jiggling has been in lesser and crappier games and it indeed does make a big difference in how good a character looks usually you see the affect well in games where you have to use mods to get some realistic jiggling effects added their movement doesnt have to be absolutely realistic or complex they just need to have some movement to them instead of being solid lumps of steel naturally the more realistic and better you can make the better
aye do it right
i have to support this for realisms sake boobs are not made out of steel and plaster people for that matter neither are bras going to keep them still as stone through all physical activity unless like its really uncomfortably tight
i ask for this for the sake of quality and realism not so we can get off to moving boobs in a video game frankly if i want that i can look at  it is simply for the sake of immersion as stated before there are lesser games out there that do this one good example is a yet to be released game called tera online one video i watched was showcasing how they actually got breasts to move the character would even bend over and they would hang and not be set in stone was it perfect nobut it was done fairly well and is something that would be noticible in eve here is a link to one of the videos as an example tera online high elf emotes againthis would not have anywhere near as realistic of a feel if they were stationaryccp has stated many times that they want this game to be a space simulator a simulator implies realism which is what i believe they are striving for especially with the new character creator and incarna later this year last time i checkedboobs still move in space and i am sure they would move on a station with gravity that said i think it is a reasonable request to have boobs move in the game as realistically as possibleagain i want to point out that i dont think this should bring any kind of perversion to the game in any way shape or form if you are afraid to see boobs move then dont go out into the world at all im not asking for nudity or futa the other threadi am asking for realistic movement and nothing more that is not perversion
victorias secret could launch an eve online selection instead also the poor art boys draw boobies anywayswar on droop
i fully endorse and or support this product
can we get the barbieboob jigglers their own server with only a single station so they can stop interfering with a spaceship game
when server lag falls behind real time slow down real time to match it so simple
i dont believe that a little bit of nudity or even futa in eve would cause its downfall in the us my biggest reasoning for this is that most of the game is comprised of adult players to begin with alsoits primarily a download only game i know you can get it in stores now but how many of us have done that alsostrip clubs can be made in gameupon entering said strip club a disclaimer for 18 could appear if thats even necessary i dont know what the big deal is you pay for this game with a credit card for the most part using said card is an admission that you are either of age or a supporting parent who is of age is paying for youalsocould have male strip clubs for the ladies
for all the people saying that it makes no sense to repair yourself with your own remote repair drones because they are a remote ship module and thus are like the remote repair modules on your own ship which of course cannot repair your own shipsi hope you realize that you can repair your drones with your drones currently and you can repair your drones with your remote repair modules almost as if your drones were a separate vessel floating in space who knew

i like these ideas anything that keeps a game modern and updated i agree with but i feel they should fix the lag issues first only because i fear all of these suggestions will add lag to the system ship damage will increase the amount of textures you will have to loadmissing hits damage that trails down a ship hull etc will increase the amount of calculations during combatshrinking asteroids wrecks exploding wreckage will increase the amount of models and textures you will have to load and not just on our side but also the number of commits server side as well look at how much lag was caused just from the spawning and despawning of missile modelsi like all of the suggestions i think that stuff would be really cool but not at the expense of gameplay performance perhaps later when the number crunching has gotten streamlined enough to handle the extra load without causing lag but not now
100 supported so many beautiful things in this game but also so many things that are very obviously from 2001 still needs work
these are all client side operations eves lag problems are server side i dont think these changes are going to impact performance noticably unless youre running a gpu thats two or three years old and if it does well thats why we have low graphics settings some of us have gtx480s you know alright so i pulled that out of my arse i cant honestly say i know how these changes will impact performance but i do know the eve client is having my computer sitting around twiddling its thumbs most of the time especially the cpuwell if you read the drake lag devblog youll see that the vast majority of the server load is caused by notifying clients when a missile is createddestroyed wrecks are not created at anything like the rate of missiles and they stick around a hell of a lot longer theyre not collidable are they and they only move when you tractor them so the only times the server needs to worry about them is when theyre created when a client loads the grid when someone interacts with them tractorlootsalvage none of these are common occurrences unless maybe you bring a dozen noctises but that would be sillyi suppose theres the implicit assumption if were making wrecks larger and giving them volume that wed be making them collidable as well i suggest we dont do that whatever happens because well i ran buzz kill and the blockade yesterday and the thought of having to navigate between all those wrecks agreed but the only people equipped to accurately assess the performance impact of these changes is ccp and they can6t do that if the proposal never reaches them
large parts of the pi market is distorted by large numbers of players selling pi goods significantly below their real costin other markets this situation is automatically regulated through recyclingi propose that pi goods can be recycled into either p0 or the previous tier what ever the csmdev consider is most appropriatethis proposal is seeking support for the principle of recycling if pi rather than focusing on a single specific mechanic but feel free to make suggestions for the csmdevs to consider
if this was implemented with a bit of a material loss and the pi goods turned into lowerlevel pi resources it would be a good idea not so sure about finished products though like poses n stuff
before i can support i must know what do you want pi goods to be recycled into back to p0s or minerals
i support the topicps i trained gallente race about 1 year the gallente problem is solved now for me i have trained ammar and minmatar stuffit is fantasticpaladin can shoot 15km and 50km with same dps like kronos but without refitting pulse with mf or scorchminmatar ships can switch damage types they have free high slots for neuts or any other stuff without dps suffering incredible alfa with artiammar ship does not need to move scorch gives incredible optimaland other argumentspps i used proteus it has very good paper dps but i discovered strange thing when i shoot webbed and scrambled drake at my optimal 22km with am and orbit my dps is about 23  12 of dps when i just stay and shoot i think blasters need more tracking
my fix was to train amarr after about a year of burning gallente when im feeling nostalgic enough to fly a gallente ship its fitted with artys but for a few t2 exceptions gallente ships are just presalvage the drones are nice but gate guns and sleepers love to snack on them
i do support the fact that gallente ships have a focus problem but i do not agree with all your fixesimo if you want to fix gallente you need to do 3 things1 remove the repper bonus and replace it with an armor hp bonus this will give gallente ships the ability to get close2 reduce the mass of gallente ships gallente ships should be slower then minmatar without speed mods but gallente ships should be a close second fast by givining them a reduced mass this will allow gallente to be fast and still have plates on3 increase base drone bay gallente are supposed to be the drone people right
as i read somwhere galente were first designed to hull tankyoull notice that the hull repairer is a medium slot module and galente have more mediums and less low compared to amar wich makes sencehull tanking modules do not give speed penalties like armor modules so the silly problem of armor tank and blaster range goes awayalso current hull tanking modules dont use as much grid as armor so thats another issue solvedonly needed change for that is a massive boost to hull repair modules and a few new hull resist modulesand a lot of balancing issues afterwards that dosent fix hybrids but thats not the topic hereon secont thoughtthen we have issues with rr and fleet boosting and a lot of other stuff to solve that would be a major change basicaly scrap galente andf make whole new race
errrrrrrr try fitting a dominix with all hull reinforcement bulkheads in the lows youll move slower than a constipated whale in molasses those hull mods add ghastly amounts of mass to the ship they are fitted to which in turn severely reduces agility ie acceleration deceleration and turning
sry didnt check before opening my mouth ok so chanhe the hul modules to not slow down the shipminor problem if anyone would start implementing this huge change
i say remove all hybrids give a boost to drone bandwidth and bonuses limit drone link augmenters to one per ship and makes drones only downable via something like the defender missiles iow make gallente all drone that takes care of the speed issues and the power issues while eliminating all hybrid issues
support op
id be all for resist bonuses for armor like caldari have shield resist bonuses thatd mitigate more damage and still keep performance of the original hull as well as reduce the requirement to have 2 armor reps as a minimumbonuses to drone speed and drone hp would be great gallente are ment to be pioneers and experts in drones so it makes sense that they could get the most out of them and itd mean the higher dps drones would actually last longer and may actually get to a pvp target for once without a few being taken out along the wayitd make sense to limit the drone bonuses to particular types that way you could sill balance things eg the keres could have ecm drone bonuses ships designed mainly as blaster platforms could have light and medium drone bonuses and not heavy ones and vice versai do believe that drone bays need to be increased too
how about solution 4change the armorrepair bonus so that it also increases the repair amount received by remote repair drones and modulesother then that i would increase range of blasters by at least 20 and tracking of blasters and rails by another 20 and descrease their cap use by 50
i have through about the remoterepp bonus that you describe and it does sound alright we still need more powergrid or something though
that kind of rr would make armor rep bonused ships effectively invulnerable unless they were alphad in fleet fights
i did not understand anything you wrote care to explain
support op1 adestria or vindicator have the bonuses that all wallente ships should have2 hybrids sucks3 ship sucksguns sucks  crosstrain walleship with autosartys best option for ccp delete wallente race and hybrids no more problems to resolve and we can finaly train something funany new char that asks me witch raceship to train i allways answer matar mabe is intended by ccp but in this case please be kind and give me back my sp so i can spent them in the good race
try reading it again slowly
he was probably originally going to suggest a 33 boost to received rr primary buffer and local reps  but thought it might be overpowered
at issue is the closer a ships engagement range is the faster it needs to be able to fly amarr is able to cope with armor tanking because they have a long engagement range for pulse caldari cr missile boats work the ones with good range bonuses others are long range only platforms due to how slow the base speed is on caldari ships minmatar are fast so their engagement range isnt much of an issue gallente are horribly crippled by being armor tanked and requiring the fastest speed to engage pick one and it can only be armor tank when it comes to cr engagements put any tank on a gallente ship and it cripples its ability to engage further speed and range need to match up either increase blaster range or increase gallente speed in some wayas for fittings i think all bs fitting needs to be looked at across the board they are tighter fits than bc and that is a fairly big problemas for maxsims solutions gridcpu needs are more influenced by the ships tank than the weapons shield tanks usually lack cpu and armor tanks lack grid why gallente have substantially less grid than amarr has always baffled me minmatar can get away with their weak cpu because part of their tank usually comes from speed
look at the last designed gallente ships vindicator and proteus think why they are good blaster shipsvindicator  true dps monster with web bonusproteus  has 10 armor hitpoints per lvl and 15 reduction in microwarpdrive cap consumption per lvl subsystemshere are answers how to improve gallente ships
i just showed exactly how it is in fact effected by tracking mods and how inverted changes to tracking and signature resolution have identical impacts on hit chance making your proposal to change both pointlessi bolded the part of the hit chance equation that is actually effected by tracking mods aka stacks withhit chance  12transvrangetrackingsigressigrad2 max0rangeoptimalfalloff2youll notice that the bolded part of the equation consists entirely of variables being multiplied together some of which are inverteddivision and that it includes tracking and signature resolution obviously if everything is being multiplied together any changes to them are multiplied together as well this means those changes stack
if there is some reasonable ways to make accounts more secure it is nice
if missioning is so risk free easyisk then why are there suicide ganks at all could it be that suicide ganks have way higher payouts for far less comparative time and risk than even missioning which is more out of balance herewhat they should do is allow fleet members to engage the aggressors yknow that whole armed escort idea or hey how about using that third party logi idea that is so popular among the griefer corps
wow you know what ive seen this suggestions so many times ive decided to back ityes ccp please please please for the love of god remove high sec for at least 6 months i want the people who keep suggesting this to see the results first hand with their own 2 dumb founded eyes i think when they begin logging in after the first month and and see the markets fumbling and the server populations cut by 60 theyll finally get the true picture of eveiow removing high sec wont make the bears start playing the game the way you want itll just make them go to another game and if thats what you want then good luck in the next mmo you end up in after eve goes belly up
definitely on to something i thinki think theres even more to it though much of the gankings these days are quite pointless and doesnt even bring in a profit ganking hulks for example is a wide spread hobby and whatever a hulk drops will barely even cover the cost of the disposable destroyers feels like with every year intelligent pvp is more and more replaced by stupid gankingspvp for territorial control i understand mostly a null sec thing but even eradicating a group of pirates or antipirates in low sec makes sense at least if they cant afford to immediately replace the ships over and over pvp for profit i understand piracy as well as the occasional high sec gank pointlessly blowing ships out of the sky for s and giggles though its just pointless when pointless ganks become commonplace its a clear indication that it is too easy to gank and theres not enough repercussions for doing itwe should also consider that we might get rid of many gankings if piracy was actually more viable in low sec problem is that low sec is pretty underdeveloped and appropriate targets can be hard to find people have been saying for years that we need to give high sec people incentive to move their operations out into low sec and risk losing a portion to the pirates currently the incentive is just about none try to take up mining or missioning in low sec and you will very soon find that the small extra income in most cases doesnt begin to cover the cost of the ships you lose to piracy and ganks i do well in low sec  but thats because i work 90 in wormholes and with pi which really only needs a little hauling now and then doing any actual activities in low sec systems is not in any way worth the risklast time i scanned down a low sec site and decided to risk it and work on it hacking i think someone dropped a freaking tengu on my battlecruiser i believe the correct term is wtfpwn i return to the wreck only to see that hes left my t2 drones floating in space and hasnt bothered to salvage or even loot the wreck this is what pvp in eve is like now ganking for the sake of ganking just for the sake of ruining my day pvp outside of null sec has lost all meaning its depressing
are you serious its called lowsec for a reason stay out of the kitchen if you cant take the heat and what is with ganking for the sake of ganking its not gank its a 1v1 fight in lowsec one which you lost no he didnt take your useless t2 mods but thats what pvp is supposed to be about the fight not the farming the only problem with highsec missionrunnergankers is that they are farmers on steroids who have no interest in actual pvp they farm billions in a window of seconds for no cost while taking advantage of concord protection so no one can shoot them while they are scanning at gates unlike in lowsec the result is influx of second hand deadspace mods into market hugely reduced demand as carebears learn to buy cheaper faction mods that they dont get ganked for with their own lp build up of excess supply and rapid mudflation this is the distortion effect on the market when someone finds a loophole to make billions of easy money in seconds it must be filled or the sector of the economy will collapse
what is your malfunctionthe only thing youll ever get with your sucker ideas is some more empty lownull and an empty high sec nice youve finished the game next step find another game to destroy is that how your life goes finefacepalm
very well put i agree with everything you said here
do we have any proof that suicide ganking is still overly lucrative given the time and effort involved the insurance nerf must have hurt suicide gankers as did the changes regarding concord reaction time and sec status hits sure every now and then you may hit big pay dirt with a billion  drop but id imagine many times the prey tanks the attack or the loot is destroyed from what i am hearing suicide ganking is not so profitable and may actually need a boost i know my alts have tanked a few suicide attacksthe reason they get concord protection is because they win favor with concord by helping fight pirates
i loledseriously suicide gankers are for the most part not in it for the insurance money i still say all insurance money should be taken from them mind you but more out of principle really its simply absurd to have concord subsidize their piracy still im not under any illision whatsoever that removing suicideganking related insurance payout will make any noticible differencelucky for you but i say those gankers were idiots if they scanned you and still brought too little to kill you then well it would at least explain why they couldnt cut it as real pirates in lowsec nani kore they are the piratessuicide ganking exists and becomes more rampant even it seems because of one thing killmails its no longer about ingame benefits such as loot insurance etc but its all about having your name on a killboard with a juicy victim preferably a t3 ship they often dont even bother to scan you any morekillmails killed eve  ranka mei
the proof is not any arguments and theories made by either side it is in the market itself build up of excess deadspace mods supply rapid deflation aka mudflation which killed many past mmos and decreased demandtrade rates you can argue that suicide ganking is not overly lucrative but the state of the market indicates it is
suicide ganks are lucrative if you are willing to wait with a team of other guys off a gate for a couple hours until your scout identifies a haulermissioner with a promising loadmodules to gank each person can make over 100m isk but you have to sit there at the ready for what can be hours honestly in general i can make more off mission running than ganking other mission runners but the chance that cnr has an officer module or two that drop is what does it for me it is more like gambling and thus more exciting than mindlessly running mission after mission
before going on with emorage it is good thing to try out how fun it is to live in low sec with macrohaulers people are more than willing to put pirates in low sec but hey who wants to go there to be robbed people could probe out your level 4 and gank you with concord doing nothing omg and youd lose your t1 fit drake and drop loot for 1 mil or something theyd get rich thats how profitable low sec piracy is counting out lightheads who autopilot freighters in rancer of course its about as intelligent as autopiloting noobship with capital ship skills in it this thread is sorta fun more pls
so much iskenvy thats what i think this all boils down to people feel missioners make too much money compared to how they like to play the game so they want to penalize the bears for not playing how they want them to whats next a proposal to raise the taxes on traders to 50 because they make money out of a station and not pvp
train afterburner skill to lvl 5afterburner now runs for 15 seconds per activation instead of 10 secondsnot a problem until ccp introduced heatnow if you have afterburner skill trained you are a worse pilot because it takes you up to 50 longer to activate oh when neededeasy fix is to change afterburner skill to be10 cap reduction instead of 10 longer activation10 less damage done by overheathard fix is to get heat to apply instantly rather than waiting for cycle change
fix please so that training makes us better pilots not worse

the hard way is the better way because then it would be implemented across all modules not just afterburners lets face it if i need to overload my tank i probably need it right effing now not after the modules cycle
i agree this is a change that needs doing running heat at cycle change really takes a lot of the use of heat when you need heat you need it goddamn now
yep good point
this does sound a little silly
supsupsupported
i have thought about this and theres 2 sides to the coinyou mentioned the bad side  you cant switch on overheat for 15 sec unless you do it right away before fighting startsbut theres a good side  you can overheat your ab longer it would take same amount of heat damage on 10 and 15 sec cycle so on 10 sec cycle it would damage faster youll be able to overheat it lessi actually quite like that i can overheat my ab longer and its easy enough to prime the overheat button before combat

helloafter a brief skim through evesearch ive noticed that the cloaking subject isnt actively being discussed id like to rise the issue to public attention againfirst a tldr of what is to cometopicthe cloak  philosophy and usageissue cloak allows people to evade combat encounters enables people to use macro for ratting greatly defeats point of roaming through hostile territory afk cloaking is metagaming character isnt being used for days on end home space cannot be purgedbased on these philosophies everything can be hunted time is on your side 00 is the final frontier for corporations and alliances teamwork is key nullsec has to be fought for defended its resources are the reward ninjaing should be possible but risky cloaks obscure numbers key ships covert ops need only slip behind enemy lines have eyes on enemy movements both could work without being permanent the game should be more about active play safety is something you can work towards by sticking together by placing assets investinga cloaking device as i perceive it is a module that allows ships to slip past enemy lines and perform reconnaissance in hostile territories it allows hostile movements to be monitored discreetly for as far as it is possible with player visibility in locali cant imagine that the device was meant to be used on ships to reap the rewards of nullsec cloaking up whenever an enemy gang enters local safety is something that should be built up invested in starbases should be placed to harbor ratters and safety should never be absolutetoday ive led a roaming gang throughout the deep reaches of the great wildlands performing the divide and conquer tactic we came across about 15 people sometimes wed catch a glimpse of a raven on scan only for it to disappear before the next scan could be performed you cant scan them down you cant comb through an area no theres nothing you can do there he is a juicy target not docked in the great wildlands completely safe from the wolves not surprising that macro ratters can existi can live with the regular cloak being a method of evading attackers but it should not allow someone to stay cloaked indefinitely being able to hide for 5 to 10 minutes obscuring where you are and what youre in buying you time to get backup thats how it should be noremember the motto 00 is the final frontier bring friends and isk nullsec is controlled by cohesive groups of players working together to maintain land you need friends to rely on still the cloak allows people to just solo it up heck we ran across several unaffiliated solo ratters toothough i have several suggestions on changes to the cloaking devices such suggestions tend to become the main focus of critique rather than the problem itself i therefore leave only the suggestion that cloaks only work for an x amount of time before needing a cooldown a time window in which a ship can be locatedi ask my readers to discuss the desribed philosophies first and foremost before suggesting fixes i want to make sure that my philosophies are in line with player expectations and if so stress these to the csmthank you for your time
well the matter of the cloak goes a bit beyond just the cloak extending among other things into the nerf local discussion the whole thing also looks very different depending on what territory you are in what side you are on and what ship the cloaks attached to the matter of the cloak is widely argued in numerous threads though very rarely discussedto begin with lets just look at the areasclaimable null sec space  here the discussion revolves around how safe you should be able to make your own space afk cloakers are attacked on the forums for making things too unsafe while risking nothing on the flip side if the cloaks nerfed  pvemining becomes 100 safe as you can simply dock up as soon as a ship appears in local safer than in empire with system upgrades its even more profitable so do we nerf local to compensate and give pirates a chanceunclaimable null sec space  i guess here as you describe the cloak is largely a way for ratters to avoid pvp and the use of it here is questionable especially on what is essentially a warshipwspace  this is the new null sec lawless and there isnt even stargates to use the long sessions you spend scanning down a system to find everything makes the cloak priceless and necessarylow sec  low sec as we all know is swarming with pirates and gankers and theres not a whole lot of mining and pve going on even with a cloak you can barely work due to the large movement of people in the systemsand then theres ship typescovops frigates  as a core scanner the ship is in desperate need of its cloak as a cyno ship maybe its too powerfulcovert cruisers and battleships  while they have specific uses they are also subject to abuse as ratters that just cant be touchedblockade runners  a harmless ship thats heavily reliant on the cloak to move small amounts of cargo between a and bstandard ships  normal warships with no cloak bonuses ratters and to some extent miners i guess they do their thing and vanish if something looks scary questionablequestion really is how in the hell do we make all this work all at the same time we cant just nerf the cloak to solve some issues and screw everyone else who rely on them most of the time people only look at these things from their own rather narrow point of view the changes claimable null sec has gone through introduction of cloaking t2 cruisers cloaking t2 battleship cynos and caps its all made the cloaking situation more and more complicated its been crap planning from ccps part but it still needs to be worked outits messy and i dont even know where to begin to straighten it all outedit and i definitely support discussing this matter
i think maybe the main issue of the cloaks are tied to local chat the main ways the cloak is exploited can be tied to local in one way or another in claimable null sec the cloaks are the only element of uncertainty and as such nerfing local is beginning to sound pretty goodas for unclaimable null sec  its again tied to local but in a different way this time its grinders that use the cloak  and ironically its the appearance of players in local chat that make them warp off and cloak up maybe here too nerfing local is an ideai dunno just thinking
thinking is good different scenarios based on the type of space are a nogo though i dont think its possible with game mechanics and it would make things complicatedtheres another thread in the assembly hall about being able to stay cloaked when jumping through a gate not giving your position away unlike now where youll show up quickly not sure if a session change allows recharge states to carry over to another system otherwise it makes sense for reconcovert ships to move to safety before going on another scouting runlocal is an issue but on the short term i dont think we can make any changes to how it works short term thinking is how we can get this hotfixedhaving to cool down a cloak periodically depending on the type of cloak is what im thinking of it takes away the afk in afk cloaking ships that are specialised in cloaking can sustain it for longer require less time to recharge you name itreally black and white thinking no cloaked ship should be able to stay cloaked for long periods of time allowing defending parties to remove intruders and keeping covert activities as an actual job one that needs to be attended tostill open for debate however
i typed a nice long smart response then managed to delete the text before posting so heres the short stupid versiona cloaker has to enter your system  dangerousexit system  dangerousand rat very carefuly  active playthe game dosent support any kind of gtfo option except cloak that is the only chance the guy has against anythinghe has to move sometime if you wait him out you can still get him its a battle of will and endurance since the guy dosent stand a chance in combat thats for shurea afk scout dosent scout anything hes afk hes useless untill the time he comes back and then hes actively collecting info and playing the gameany change to cloak would just make him log out while afk no difference here except the panic because of hostile in local remove cloaked ships from local and problem fixedthe only real issue is macro ratters you cant play a waiting game with them they win every time but they too need to enter system sometime and need ammo and need to drop off looteverything considered i dont see the problemonly issue is with gangs that feel cheated out of killmails because they dont want to invest time and effort for a single kill whell that ship and pod are worth a lot to someone and he does want to invest time to protect iteve is already all about huge blobs the bring a buddy rule shouldnt be the only option every time
righta cloaker has to enter your system  dangerousits very freakin easyexit system  dangerousits very freakin easy do you really think that all gates are camped 237and rat very carefuly  active playyoure actually right on this it is active playthe game dosent support any kind of gtfo option except cloak that is the only chance the guy has against anythinghe has to move sometime if you wait him out you can still get him its a battle of will and endurance since the guy dosent stand a chance in combat thats for shureand you think we are going to wait out a ratting raven for hours on end be realistic yeah he has no chance in combat thats the soft ratting core in nullsec that should be defended by a pvp group nullsec  pvp survival of the fittesta afk scout dosent scout anything hes afk hes useless untill the time he comes back and then hes actively collecting info and playing the gameany change to cloak would just make him log out while afk no difference here except the panic because of hostile in local remove cloaked ships from local and problem fixedwhen logged out he cant feed intel he doesnt show up as a threat etc when hes logged in hes active hes tangible not having cloaked ships in local would work too removes the psyche effectthe only real issue is macro ratters you cant play a waiting game with them they win every time but they too need to enter system sometime and need ammo and need to drop off lootever done this yourself youre basically asking us to camp you out for hours playing karaoke on ts only keeps us entertained for this longeverything considered i dont see the problemonly issue is with gangs that feel cheated out of killmails because they dont want to invest time and effort for a single kill whell that ship and pod are worth a lot to someone and he does want to invest time to protect itsee previous commenteve is already all about huge blobs the bring a buddy rule shouldnt be the only option every timewait blobs i cant even solo in a recon ship because local cloaks up blobs have nothing to do with this a ratting ship dies to a pvp gang anyway thats why nullsec entities need to be in groups because nullsec is the barren wasteland where you cant hide i understand from your reaction that you believe nullsec is meant to be consensual pvp
i just said that its a possibility just like catching him on entry and exit hes not invulnerable all the timeno you misunderstud i said that is an issue and you cant do almost anything against a macromacro rattercloak is a real issue just because a macro has more time and patience than any human beingno but i believe that a player or a smaller gang should have atleast some options of survivaland not create situations where if a bigger blob enters a system you all diethe current option is cloak which is boring for both sides but atleast the losing side gets a chance of surviving if the attackers give upi support all those guys that want to remove local from null that way your targets wouldnt know your there if youre skilled enough and wouldnt cloak up and thats the sollution they still have a chance of surviving and cloaking but its all dependant on attacker and target skill and the situation thats just my opinion thats why i live in a wh makes pvp so much more fun if you can find it 
beginning to sound ok if and only if cloaks are nerfed alongside it like becoming scannable and probeable else it goes from an element of uncertainty to absolute uncertainty cloaky fleets would reign supreme especially with the nice ai that makes you fit gaping holes in your defenses and the nice industrial ships that ccp so thankfully gave paper thin tanks the better to be gankedccp made people performing money making activities in this game gimp themselves make themselves prey their only defense is running
i was going to say something rather lengthily but all i can come up with is your doing it wrongtheres nothing wrong with the cloakits all you pal learn to play the game oh and its all in your headps you obviously didnt search hard enough we get these damned anticloak nooblet crying fests every bloody week and like all of them they get ignored change local to delayed and you still have the same problem you just cant see them and i suspect youll be crying then too
nevertheless they still face more risk for a lot less rewards than your blob1 u wanna be realistic a while ago ive had an alliance try to scan me down for an entire weekin npc 00 yeah they were that desperate2 translation u think 00 ratting profits should be split to the point where its not even worth doing rightor maybe ppl can gasp adapt 3 blob mechanics gank small gangssolo pilots scout counterblobs and run from them thats even more skewed in risk vs reward than afk cloaking which nets 0 kills u wanna stick to what ure doing finejust dont cry about one person that 100 of u cant get epeenboosting killmails onwait u said an afk cloaker is not active but now u say he is well im sry if 100 of u cant handle one person who cant even harm a fly i mean thats the nature of 00 which u cant seem to handle so apparently u just want 00 to be a easy riskless killmail faucet well im sry if your targets wont automatically submit to your nonconsensual pvp but just because he doesnt consent it doesnt mean he has to fight same reason why a blob wouldnt fight a counterblob heres an idea thoughu wanna be entertained there r plenty of other alliances u can fight if u really want to just attack their possessions ditto1 omg lmfaou do realize that ure doing the exact same thing a ratter would do because ure in the exact same situation hes in oh who am i kiddingof course u dont realize that get some perspective for oncedamn2 wrong again 00 is completely unrestricted simple as that u have your blobs they have their cloaks u have your nonconsensual direct pvp they have their adaptation to itor to u nonconsensual psychological pvp and it looks like ure the one who cant handle 00 since ure the one on the forums crying to nerf your targets do u want to force ppl to fleet to even jump into 00 maybe drive down the individual profits to nothing or in your case maybe the ty pilots can carry each other to their easy ratter killmails tldrhtfu and find someone else to farm killmails off of if u can even handle that
not supported cloaks work just great as they are
qft
cloaked ships should be probable but it should require alot of training and maybe tech2 probes and even then there can be innacuracies maybe 10km in accuracy of warp in pointat least this way macro ratters can be killed easier where as cov ops pvpers can avoid it by constanty movinganother alternative could be single ships can be probed out but more than one cloaked ships in fleet become harder to probe down upto a maximum of 10 where they can not be probed down at all
drake you have no killboard records mind telling me how you can possibly have an informed opinion on thisanna you have killboard stats in highsec killing mackinaws the only nullsec experience youve had is in a bomber bombing the pf gateso anna where do you get your informed opinion from
hahahahahaahhahahahahehehehohohohohoahahahahahahahahacoughcoughsputteryou actually think killboards are an indication of skill and level of experienceare you really that big of a dumbassfirst off this isnt my only toon derp derpsecondly battleclinic is not an authoritative killboard it doesnt update livethirdly killboards are the games worst and largest intelligence leak in the history of the game i intentionally avoid showing up on them in the first place hard to do but its possibleall you did there was prove to us that you are the most unqualified person here to propose any kind of change of any kind if thats all you got for an counter argumentthis isnt carebear online noob this is eve online cant handle the heat get outi will proudly show up and afk cloak your system with gleethanks for the laugh needed that
of course i look for killboard stats if you claim to know all this  you surely have had your experiences with it and having experiences with afk cloakers  cloaked ratting ships would mean that you actually go out and roamyour lack of kills and losses and your residence in a carebear corpalliance suggest that you dont know  about what youre talking about your arguments are invalid you fail have a good one post with your main if theres a point to be made
local needs to be removed but id rather not change cloaking as it is getting through thick enemy territory and surprising enemies would be much harder should you make cloaking have a time limit
thats because this is my industrialist account you idioti specialize with stealth bombers btw i know all to well what covert ops cloaking ships can doi dont need to prove anything to anyone specially an kill ing noob such as yourself
get out of this thread if you have no credentials to back it up theni understand where youre coming from i realise that a time limit would not be the best solution still would you agree with the line of thinking when it comes to the purpose of the cloaking device as it is and should be
personal attacks how maturethis is an open forum if you can post stupid ideas i can post my invalid credentialed opinionsu mad
if youre referring to the afk cloaking vs infiltrating enemy territory or scanning down unfamiliar territory with lowered risk then yes i agree to me afk cloaking is an exploit but thats just my opinion
i propose that a feature be added to allow for the unlearning of skills the skillpoints from this process minus a penalty should be available to use on other skillsa time limiting factor like remaps should also be put in place
the key phrase time limit i was looking for was in your third sentencei absolutely 100 undeniably support this
absolutely not supported if youre bored with your hulk go to the character bazaar
not exactly a new topic butpersonally i dont see the problem a time limit and losing a percentage of the sp you shuffle around should prevent any abuse such as jumping on every draketrain that is currently popular any attempt to change too much too often will soon nerf your character into noobhood
i like the ideai see no reason why this shouldnt be possible especially if you dont get a 11 ratio back on skill points and you have to pay to do it
i support this whyit lets you correct training mistakes so long as their is at least a 50 sp reduction penalty the system cannot be abused by training high attribute skillsit lets new players explore different race ships without being permanently stuck with ship skills they do not wantit lets players that are tired of their current job to switch albeit with a penalty to something new and allows the game to stay freshwith 50 penalty to points1e you lose 50 of the trained points on switching a yearly cooldown and being unable to pay for the switch as a micro transaction i think this would go a long way to helping eve and increasing player retentionsigning offpapa
not supported
whywhyi mean hey its fine to disagree but at least try to be constructive offer a reason what will it unbalance or is it just fun to deny people a possibility to correct some mistakes
supported the reason being that due to poor mechanics certain skills have negative effect on you in some situations you train up negotiation skills and suddenly your favorite highsec mission agent reach the effective quality threshold to reach into lowsec you train up afterburner and suddenly ab cycle is long enough that ab warp no longer saves you align time there is no way to unlearn skill youre stuck id settle for a significant penalty for unlearning even no sp return in acceptable in those cases
insert bitter vet comment here
supported i see nothing against redistributing that which you already learnt
depends on the ratio as wellturning 1mil sp into 750k sp unallocated seems fair as well as only can do it once per yearthis means people can start out mining then move to pve then remove mining and perfect pvepvp skillsthis also means high sp characters no matter the skillset wil have value a trader alt with max trade skills might not be worth much but with this 75 of thier sp can go into whatever you want
my arent you the clever one in lieu of a legitimate opinion you just insert juvenile and churlish smack for anyone who disagrees with the op
sp remapping makes sense in games where there are hard limits on how many points you can spend on developing your character but in eve such restrictions dont exist here the feature serves to satisfy three needs sp farming getting rid of unwanted skills and quick skill switchingsp farming isnt a big problem if you apply a huge penalty to the transfers this way it would be inefficient to change sp even from max attribute training to min attribute skills from sp maximizing standpoint a remap would always be a loss in spgetting rid of unwanted skill is unnecessary there is no limit to how many sp you can have so you have only lost time with that training and you only consider it wasted now you could very easily change your mind later and find a use for those wasted sp until there is a hardcap on how many sp a character can have there arent any wasted sp in eve it also makes the characters more vulnerable when someone with malicious intent gets access to the accountquick switching of skills goes against the eve design philosophy of making choices that matter it isnt necessary either because of the infinite sp you can have and caters mainly to the fotm chasers with sp remapping you can always chase the fotm exclusively and remap when the inevitable nerf comes to the next fotm setup without having to wait or suffer any negatives for over specializing in training allowing this will reduce even more the variety of setups and ships the players will fly from what it is today not a change im willing to supportbasicly the benefits of this feature are miniscule for eve with negatives mixed with the benefits and the feature just largely caters to player behavior that ccp shouldnt try to cater to anyway not supported
not quite id love to be able to forget a bunch of the industrial and science skills i havent used in years and downgrade to a lower class of clone unless you have a few billions of isk to spareor a few hundred in cash to buy yourself a character from the totally ok and supported bazaar because obviously when we say choices that matter we mean choices that matter for poor folkid go for the idea i would say you could forget one entire skill every few months or even better you can forget an entire skill but cant forget a new one for the period of time those skillpoints representat base stats or 2x that period also cant reset prereqs of course lastly doing this means you would have to purchase the skill book again if you ever changed your mind
stealth reuse useless sp thread detectedgrow up noobletsno one said you had to train that skill in the first place learn to live with your mistakesif it offends you that much repeatedly pod yourself peventually youll lose that skillsps
it makes sense to integrate such an atrocity into the npe but for everyone else one must assume people know what the hell they are doing since they are manually buying a skillbook manually injecting it and manually clicking train
one of the first things i did was research and did a little reading before i chose the skill books i needwantfor some reason there are a lot of people who blindly go forthi think i have 1 skill book i found not so useful but then it could be useful in a number of circumstances but i have yet to point out any useless skill as it isi find the concept of useless skills rather hard to identify maybe im just that weird
hence the mention of the npe tutorial dumps all manner of books into your lap as rewards with just a short description of what it doesmakes sense to use a skill refund system as a final step in the tutorial but not elsewhere
1 op lots of people for many reasons should be able to do it so wy not once per year like the remapi would realy like to refound all my skills in useless hybrids and gallente useless ships to minmatar or amarr shipsguns
we meet again once again you have completely failed to read the discussion going on herethis is not a simple i trained this now i dont wanna have it no more  waaaaa type of deal this is an introductory sp swap for new players its been highlighted over and over new players spend alot of sp in areas that theyll end up not using allowing a new character to once or very strictly regulated reassign some of their spent sp at a 50 cut will not only encourage new players to explore all the racesshipsroles but will in the end reduce frustration and increase retention really the end of the tutorial so like an hour after starting the gameiirc the only book from the tutorial that i didnt end up using was projectile weapons because it was already trained all the rest were good support skills shield and armor skills ewar electronics etcprimarily i think its ship skills that need to be relearned let me give an example of my beginningwhen i first started i hadnt a flying f what was going on i had no friends that played the game had no guide i had no idea what i wanted to fly what i wanted to do or which race i should specialize in whats a noob to do i trained them all i got each race to battleship class to see which one i liked best the end result was i enjoy amarr and minmatar ships and weapons really do not like faildari and gallente how was i to know way back when that those ships would not appeal to me i couldnt so now i have several million wasted sp in caldari gallente and hybrid weapons which i doubt highly i will every want back id prefer to specialize
i wholeheartedly agree with this especially after ccp changes something in the game that makes all that learning feel wasted
not supported
yeah i like to be able to remove the skills ill never usethey mess with my ocd
an hour you must either be an insanely fast readerlearner or skipped a lot of the contentalso sounds like you only did the combat tutorial during testing of the new system there were 34 different paths if i recallpoint still stands though after the initial learning curve has been conquered the handholding should stop when that should be is up for debate but around the 2m sp mark or so seems reasonable ie approximately same point where old accelerated training stoppedsorry for your plight if only you had read the rather extensive material available both official and unofficial on ships modules weapons etc before deciding on what path to focus onwhat this whole thing amounts to is a person buying a product then uses it until something better comes along and then demands a refund  world does not and should not work like thatinstant gratification in eve should only come from the billion ticker in wallet the boom and the squish of combat and the tears of virginsonce you start rewardingprotecting laziness you attract all the adolescent turds floating around in the mmo sea which will be the deathknell for eve highish average age plus serious spaceship business
if im the clever one then i guess youre the rather dimwitted one since you copied what i did also your opinion is not valid until you explain why just like those responses which had no reasoningalso umadbro
ccp can and do change the game balancing radically but players cant change their choices if all choices are final they must be final for everyone with the incoming of sleeper ai on rats drone users will be hit hard many of whom do not have sp invested in other fields in order to maintain an income stream to replace pvp ships buy plex etc should they be pushed out of the game just because they had no warning that ccp is going to invalidate droneboats for pve at the time that they learned those skills
the only frustration i see here is someone has a couple of low tiered skill books they want to get rid of well thats your defense skills you picked up from tutorialget over yourself man up this is eve onlinedont like it quityou can stop training on any and all skills you can crosstrain at any timethis would solve nothing nor would it achieve nothing but balance breaking mechanics and increase char farming something fierceif your not smart enough to figure out the fact that sps being reimbursed tilt the balance of training very much in your favor your really are a noob
i do quite like this ideait would provide a minor balancing aspect for older players wishing to retrain quickly and the fact that they would lose some sp in the process would mean evening out the field for younger playersit would also reinforce the fact that you should be more attached to your characters if ccp are aiming for an ultimate scifi simulator they should be looking at ways to make people more attached to their char and adding any kind of flexibility like this is going to help that along this will help reduce character trading the the accompanying fraud by enabling people to better respec their chars into something that is usefulin real life if you stop doing something every day you get less good at doing it you dont just take your life to a character bazaar and trade it in for one that does what you want it to do  that cheapens the whole experience from a personal perspective  which isnt going to help immersion anyof course youd be an idiot to reskill your 5555555 titan pilot or whatever but youve already hit the endgame thereps  i wonder how many sp in total across tranquility would get lost of hybridgallente skills if this were to become a reality  any bets
def like this idea ive accidentally trained a few skills projectiles that i wouldnt mind removing even if i dont get the sp back looking at the impurity of a projectile skill nestled in with all my laser skills makes me sad in the pants region
500mil for corp on corp might be too much but if alliance is involved then yescurrently wardecs are broken because its just about grief nothing else then that
if ccp catered to majority then this game would only push carebear ideals it would quickly stop being a hardcore pvp game it would gradually become more wowlikeand even tho subscription numbers for eve would be rising the eve we know would truly be dead
the eve i knew died ages ago there was a time when pvp doesnt have the same meaning as grieving carebears and 1v1 exist ah more innocent times engine trail keeps popping up in my head when i think about it for some reason
and that attitude certainly helps who in the hell said anything about catering only to a carebear majority im talking about everyone so stop being a jerk for a moment will ya i said figure out what people want and combine it with ccps vision  and then come up with a functional solution i never said give people what they ask for  that was all your own negative doomsday visionsince i clearly need to clarify myself im sure a solution can be found that provides a batter situation for pirates and carebears and nullsec empire builders and hell  everyone the current system is crap we can do better we can do better without turning it into the nightmare you want to seetry to be a bit constructive will ya please
as for letting ccp know what players want they setup a system of csm representativesit is the job of csm to convey to ccp what people want it is up to csm people to make surveys and deliver results to ccp survey cannot bypass csm otherwise whats the point of having them in first placeand if they cant make a difference a simple survey has no chance in hell
well fine i suggest the csm makes a survey then because so far csm seems to be mostly receiving complaints about nerfs and buffs  all of them onesided egocentered and selfish in nature and i seriously doubt they will make everything better in any way
just to explain where i come from and what im hoping to see happenive spent a long time doing the carebear thing in high sec and if theres one thing i can say for sure its this the profits are way too high its no problem to grind up 50 million in a day on a single character right now i live in low sec mostly because its the least screwed up place in eveits been said about a million times there needs to be incentive for people to leave high sec whats happend so far pretty much nothing we have a situation where massive numbers of people grind in relative safety in high sec and spend their money on high sec ganks or playing antipirate in low sec high sec grinding easily pays for the loss of ships hell i even did that myself for a whileso what does this do to low sec well it floods with even more pvp ships making it even harder to make a living on pve mining etc out here and high sec well since theres no targets in low sec  pirates run around ganking in high sec because thats where the grinders are so yeah we could make high sec less safe and think it solves anything but it doesnt itll just  off the true carebearsi think what high sec needs is a massive profit nerf missions mining bounties loot  everything slash it and slash it hard its not exactly hard to make a living in high sec you could easily slash profits down to 50 or more and itll still be easy as pie we can leave level 1 missions unchanged for the nubs anyone that keeps losing ships in pvp though will have to enter low sec space to pay for their habit they might not be overjoyed either but its what eve is really about isnt it if you want to gank people  you better be prepared to get ganked right back when you are in a squishy ship having a good influx of people into low sec gives pirates something to do besides harass people in high secwhile we are at it  increase sec rating loss massively for ganks in high sec send the pirates into low sec too where they belong make ganks rare again high sec will be the domain of newbies and true carebears anyway so whats the point in ganking there besides hiding in high sec and ganking carebears is not what eve should be about anyway again  if you want to gank people  better be ready to be ganked right backas far as im concerned this should both secure high sec and bring life to low sec  pirates industrialists and all ok so the true carebears will miss their profits but the pirates will leave them alone that could make for a better situation over all the pirates shouldnt be too unhappy either they have targets now in low sectheres a lot more that needs to be addressed though like the null sec situation where half the camp screams for cloak nerfs and the other screams for local nerfs the big question is actually what should null sec be in the first place should it be the scary unsafe area it was originally designed as should it be the opposite  a place to build empires allowing you to secure your own territory and protect your industrialpve operations if its the first i guess local has to go  but if its the second sure nerf cloaks but you need to cut the profits of all operations in there as well after all  they arent risking anything any more and their profits should suffer maybe we need both types of null sec but in different places heck  isnt wspace actually a replacement for the old dangerous nullsec already its truly lawless like null sec used to beof course these are all just my opinions and musings which is why i think its important to find out what everyone else wants too to find out whats best for eve as a whole  all of eve i sure as hell dont have all the answers and i dont speak for everyone i know we can create a much more awesome eve though if we stop the selfish whining for a while and try to figure out some long term solutions that work
problem with highsec only safe area for solo or small group of players cant go low or null because of blobs and all those who kos whoever isnt blue also wardecs are too cheap and its more of legal griefing you cannot stop a wardec if you are the ones deced it makes no sense its not a war its a nuisance with my personal money i can wardec an alliance for over a yearproblem with lowsecis that there are so many yaarr tards that its impossible to do pve or mining in low without being swarmedraising rewards will not help there needs to be something to deter pirates more then blob them or run from themnullsecs problem is everyone is friendly i think nullsec was envisioned to be about holding small areas of space with you and a few allies not high we own 300 systems and will blob all who enter i mean sometimes you enter there space and no one is home im also pretty sure the highsec nullsec logistics was supposed to be the idea with jfs or better yet large freighter convoys in null issues you can throw in moon minerals are not spread well bots will be in the place of most profit per hour with minimal losses if thats in highsec then they will be there if its deep on 00 alliance space then they will be therei think the biggest issue at the moment is botting and lowsec yartards if its safer in lowsec more carebears will go there and get ganked occasionally meaning those pirates might not qq over lack of targetslowsec is a good place to get feet wet in null so many corps and alliances will take space or try to take space even if renting eventually space will run out and conflict will erupt
instead of nerfing high sec why not buff low sec you suggest nerfing highsec to remove the high rewards in relative safety the thing is players will still be able to grind safely in high sec regardless of reward people who mine or run missions will keep doing what they are already do why because there is no reason not to its safer than low sec unless a substantial buff accompanies any nerfing of high sec no one is going to leave a crappy grinding life of safety for a crappy grinding life in the line of firei cannot support this
well i guess by yarrtards you mean well i always made a distinction between pirates and gankerspiratesin it for the money they take down anything that is likely to give a good profit either as cargo or as expensive modules they do not attack cheap targets and they do not pod  these things only make sure itll be even longer before the same character returns with a rich load to hijack in fact ransoms are preferred over death  less risk of things being destroyed in the explosion and it hurts the victim less better for everyone involvedgankersattack anything the weaker the better pod everyone too itll improve the size of the epeen they dont give a crap about making a profit they grind their money in high sec and they dont care if they ruin people they are in it for the tears personally i respect pirates i dont like them but i respect them gankers though useless waste of space thing is im not sure much can be done about gankers  except possibly remove the crazy profits of the highsec grind they way things are now ganking is encouraged piracy is real hard and a main reason is a plain lack of targetsim ganked a lot these days but very rarely do i feel like ive been a victim of piracy
sighthis is not a suggestion to nerf high sec im suggesting we make a survey to find out what can be done and what should be done in order to get this game back on tracklike i said those were my personal opinions and i dont have all the answers i was merely posting some background on myself and some of my own personal opinions to put some of the doomsday prophets at ease  to show that im not trying to create a carebear space version of farmvillebesides buff low sec nerf high sec whats the difference its all about how they relate to each other anyway and theres null ec to take into account and wspace we need to balance everything my point is merely that when i can grind high sec and buy a fully equipped battleship every 2 days  something is freaking wrongid like to think you would support the topic because you dont agree with my personal opinions the alternative to collectively trying to figure out a good path for eves future is to do it with selfish cries for nerfs and buffs and god knows where thatll lead us surely it cant be so bad to figure out what everyone wants to get out of the game could it
your skill at doubletalk is so amazing you should run for congress heck run for csm im sure youll get most of the idjut votesorry perhaps you should think more about your stance on a proposal before you make such grandiose claims i cannot support this
i can second this and also say i still dream of engine trails but realy one on ones and low sec can be fixed by puting in place the old scaning system for misson dead spaces at least in low sec that is what mainly killed off low sec and finding one on one fights in my own opion so take it with a gran of salt
its a shame you cant separate the message in the original post from my personal opinions in the latter ones nowhere in the original suggestion does it say a god damn word about nerfing a god damn thing it merely suggests that we actually find out what the situation is like before we start doing anything we got one big portion of nullsec screaming to nerf the afk cloakers and the remaining portion is screaming for it to stay and local to be removed we get countless posts on reducing high sec protection and just as many stating the absolute opposite i was just suggesting that maybe just maybe it would actually make sense to find out how many people think what about which things before we start trying to make decisions on how to improve the gamebut  it i should know better than to write anything and expect people to actually ing read what it says and take it for what it says lets just lock the topic shall we and next week ill rewrite the suggestion in language that even a 5 year old cant misinterpret
oh null sec with no stations or pos how i miss you 
the problem with surveys is you get idiots who post one thing and say something else only to reveal they have no bloody concept or idea of what they speak ofwhile ccp is obviously and massively screwing up imho they do get at least this much rightthey dont just take anyones word or opinion for it it being your viewpoint on any number of subjectsits quite obvious from the op that your favoring one of two camps hereas to what i wont get into because its a waste of timebut as to why you should get this clearly in your head before you say an another wordeve online is not pvp online nor is it carebear online nor is it greif online nor is it yar onlineits eve onlinewith a yingand a yangit must have balance it must have both parts one cannot live without the other and vice versaits not as easy as saying nerf this or buff thatfor every idea there is a consequence people always ignore that it seems blinded by personal desire or greedthink of others before you jump to your own conclusions no im not saying think of your friends and mates think of your enemies and the people who oppose you try to understand why
the problem of that is that it would require months before having an effect on carebear population in low sec while piratesgankers will scream from day one and it will impact fleet combat too so we would have another set of screamers from there end result is that it will not happen
thank you thats the first reply in the thread thats actually worth the space it occupies its definitely not as easy as nerf this or buff that unfortunately 95 of the suggestions around here that affect balance are exactly this  simple demand to buff or nerf usually hopelessly onesided and inspired out of personal greed this is exactly why i was asking for some kind of survey to find out what people want how many want it and whether any of it is actually a good idea to put into effect  after you take it all into consideration as a wholei certainly have a whole lot of personal opinions and i expect everyone else to have a whole lot of other opinions however they are just that  opinions we are all entitled to them and in the end our opinions of how things should be can end up affecting the shape the future if only a littleeve is a huge interconnected puzzle and we need to see to the balance of the whole before we run off and make quick fixes the whole nerf cloaks argument for example is pretty much completely seen from the null sec alliance perspective its rare that anyone bothers to even consider how a change would affect gameplay in low sec or wspace or unclaimable null sec like the great wildlands thats kind of my point before we start making decisions about the cloak maybe we should listen to what everyone else have to say  especially those that arent involved in claimable 00 spacesame thing goes for the nerf local argument and the high sec is too secure argument and the stop gankings argument and all the other arguments all these issues connect with each other we cant possibly nerf cloaks and not expect it to impact how local is used and vice versa anything that affects balance in one place ends up affecting pretty much everything else as well more or less directlya first step should probably be to find out what people want out of the game yes there will be a lot of unrealistic ideas but there will probably be quite a bit of useful information and statistics as well who knows maybe the bulk of the carebears would love to head into low sec and risk the wrath of the pirates if the profits were better maybe the gankers wouldnt be ganking if there were people to pirate in low sec i simply dont know because as far as i seen nobody ever bothered to ing ask its mostly a shouting match between small groups of people and theres no telling if one side is in majority or notsince most people dont bother to visit the forums in the first placei was hoping just cms or ccp or someone could start gathering some information so theres actually a foundation on which to start making decisions
most true carebears want a game to relax they arent interested in getting an adrenaline rush fighting another player in fast paced combat some of them dont even get the adrenaline rush the reaction to a gankfight is more bother now i need to spend some time to get at the same point i was beforemost true pvpers live for the adrenaline rush of exciting combat and when they get a semifair fight or a canny prey they are happy when they cant get it they try to compensate ganking but for them it is a substitute not the real thing they are the same people that will love being hunted with a decent chance to outfox the hunters most gankers love the true or imaginative tears of the target so fair or exciting is less important what they want is to do damage that they hope will make the target suffer the ideal player would be a mix of the three aspects above sadly as time pass we tend to polarize and as a reaction the other players tend to polarize faster the carebears will try to avoid every nuisance as a reaction the gankers will steep up work to make griefing more efficient both of those action will remove the exciting pvp making fair play pvpers more angry and prone at attacking anything the result is the current situationit is a negative circle where middle ground gameplay tend to disappear but short of redoing the mind of most players or drastically reducing the server population so that having large swats of empty space will dampen the negative feedback i doubt it could be changed
its exactly as venkul statedi might a well just come out and say itthe various camps ive seen and analyzed in my maddness of a mind are pretty clear1 high sec the carebearswe got miners industrialists and mission runnersthey complaint of pretty much 2 major areas herewar decs the mechanics that no one could fix but needs but is horribly and stupidly broken beyond reason used as a tool for greifing in their definition and nothing butsuicide ganks  the ability to fit a tempest and alpha strike pretty much a large number of ships before concord can show up and get insurance for that ship and be able to take the security hit or walk away without punishment this sort of thing urks alot of people yet being able to kill an npc player is a needed mechanic as ccp clearly said im starting to think its a mechanic that is heavily abused to the point of exploitation these days2 pvpers  yarthese guys have a large number of complaints but its usually summed up in the following low sec sucks  the ironic thing here is they did it to themselves they caused the problem here not ccp they want low sec to be grander betterin reality all they want are more targets to shoot out for lols and their ever growing dumbass epeens be honest now its all about your shiny killmailsas a result low sec gets ignored avoided and completely hands off in many corpsalliances caseswhy because while its got some good stuff its all to often heavily exploited as an easy prey so pvpers literally cry for more when they continue to dig their own gravehigh sec wars  they often wardec and station camp pretty much sums it upthe war dec is a joke all it is is to bribe concord and gain the ability to shoot targets in high sec conceptually its a good idea but all you end up doing is wasting an entire week of your time or more sitting at a station or a stargate waiting for a target that will never come unless they have a backbone or the gumption to risk their ships there will be smacktalk there will be crying dont fool yourselves most of that smackcrying is from the pvpers who are bored sad thing of it is they come here to avoid 00 warfare and complain of blobsyet they use the very same blob tactic via nuet rrs and everything else pathetically ironicthe suicde gankers  they sit there and claim that they do this stuff for profit most of the time yes yet you get these yahoos who defend this so called career with the reasoning of affecting the markets in minerals and ships hulkageddon of which is utter tripeall they do is make the market worse by ramping up prices and demand for the very ships they lose9 times out of 10 i always see the pvp forget the very tools he uses where made by a carebear in most cases the pvper himselfherself is that carebear hahacont
and lastly00  these guys have it really badyou have to be a member of a coalition or a filthy rich bunch of guys to pull off a sov holding alliance you end up paying rent to someone who pays rent who pays rent who pays rentyou have to protect your holdings so you can afford to pay rentyou have to build a larger fleet than your neighbors to avoid losing your spaceyou have to upgrade your ihub and equipment to make your space more profitable and pay rentyou get an afk cloaker in your system and your pilots stupidly forget that all they have to do is pay attention to their environment and have defenses on the ready if something happens defenses get bored and go roaming offyou get steamrolled by a coalition with a bigger blob than you haveand end up fighting a unwinnable battle or by luck the server node crashesnote i never mention the fun in this messthe people who have fun in this area are the ones who are larger or have a roam and carefree days or causing trouble much like low sec only without any rules to get in the waynow this is my viewpoint my opinions may be wrong or they may coincide with yoursfact is holding a survey would never work because ccp would always get the whiners of each campthis is why you dont see me making proposals because by the time i weigh it out and simulate the arguments it would be an big fat epic failonly thing i can do is well you already know that i will say this much ccp is screwing up but it has nothing to do with their inability to listen to playersits their stupid marketing department pushing quantity over qualitythis incarna  is going to be an utter epic fail in my opinion as all it is is just second life for eve with vanity plastered all over it and asking you to pay money for something that will result in nothing but vanity and not so much blowing stuff updust 514 is just an another halo expectations will be overinflated sure it will have great graphics but the ability to nuke the hell out of a planet with a maelstrom class battleship will never happenim just scratching the surfaceyes im increasingly getting mad and bitterbut eve is still a great game so i push forward hopping ccp will grow a brainand they have with the fixing of rockets and such but they can do much better than this
hehunfortunately i think you have quite a few pointsthing is i think much of it could be made better not perfect but better by rethinking the systemim a pretty rare breed myself i think i dont much care for pvp occasionally ill go look for a fight but thats like once a month at best most of the time i get my kicks out of making a profit while i play hide and go seek with the pirates i absolutely do not make a bigger profit now than i did when i lived in high sec im in low sec only because high sec bores me thats not enough incentive for most peopleive also found ways to make a profit thats hard for pirates to interrupt pi and wormholes they rarely find me in a position where i can be scanned down of course i need to haul my goods out of low sec to a trade hub and at that point im open to attack funny thing though so far no one has hit one of my haulers well one but it was empty  they shot it for the epeen its no problem though to risk a cheap hauler and 2 days worth of goods if 4 out of 5 shipments come though im good i dont mind feeding the pirates a portion of it if they catch mebut anyway i think we could build a system that lets true carebears do their thing in relative peace and gives the semicarebears incentive to venture into low sec and gives pirates targets and something to do without resorting to high sec ganking biggest problem might be that the pirate population is too large to create enough targets for them and still let people make a profiti dunno
unfortunately theres no system that could be made that would accommodate everyonethe fact is its already there but people insist on damaging the balance in favor of one of the camps while nerfing the others horrendously sowhich is why i say ccp is listening but they see a bigger picture more so than we dosadly that bigger picture is at the mercy of profits and advertising
those of us who frequent grav sites in wormholes have experienced the frustration youre told that the max spawn time is 15 mins so you wait and wait but then you realize after 15 mins have passed that someone must have already killed the sleepers at the site what fun my request is to reduce the max spawn time to just 5 mins to reduce the ambiguity and increase the fun whats the point of sitting around waiting 15 mins i guess the sleepers need time to powder their nose or some rubbish like that at any rate 15 minutes is way too long and i hope that the council can push this issue up to ccpthanks for reading my post
o7currently there are eight assault frigates in game seven of which can be used solo the eighth is alone and afraid unable to mount any tackle and be usable this poor little guy that needs our support is the retributiongoing along with his tough name damage is the game with this little guy he puts out impressive damage can mount an ok tank and looks good doing it but still all the other afs mock him for you see retribution is a gimppoor poor retribution was born with only a single mid slot which we all know must be fitted with an afterburner or mwd frigates cannot survive without their speed this leaves the poor little guy with no tackle making him completely unusable and unloved for solo or even small gang work look at the terrible things people say about retribution sure he hits hard but hes a total gimp with no tacklehahahahahahaha retribution good joke broi love every ship in the game except retribution hes stupid and i hate him and i want him to die in a fireso my friends let us rally around and give retribution a hug here is what we will ask of the devsremove one of retributions high slotsthe utility slotadd a mid slot so retribution can mount a point or scramthis willallow the retribution to be a great solo ship andnot tread on vengeances toesdifferent roles and weapon systems andmake retribution feel like a real ship not a midslotlackinggimpmonstrosityplease leave a thumb for this topic even if you dont fly afs if anything it will give you a new ship to encounter and add to you killmail pilegood huntingpapa
needs some more cpu to fit anthing in it aswell
1 for 1 mid slotbut not for the utility highit would need to be 1 mid for 1 low imho
reason i steered away form this is twofold firstly this would possible reduce flexibility because that fifth can be used for more damage mods speed mods or tanking mods secondly i did not want it to have the same slot configuration as the wolf no two afs share a slot layout so i figured ccp would be more open to 1 high rather than low
loosing the high means no nosneut makes it a nice specialised laser boat lots of damage lots of tank but can be screawed by cap warefare
i almost agreethe thing that stops me is that assault frigates as a whole are suffering from some fundamental problems and that switching the retributions slots would still leave it with all the other problems associated with the assault frig rangeas one part of a general revision sure but not as a standalone hey we gave you another midslot the retribution is awesome now right guys measure
supported dunno why it only has 1 mid slot but thats a bit stupid it needs one more
the basic fact of eve pvp is that frigates need at least 2 medium slots to be effective 1 for mwd or ab 1 for scramble or disruptorif a frigate does not have the minimum requirements it is little more than a fancy toy impractical for real pvp
did it occur to you yahoos that the retribution frigate is not designed to be a solo pvp frigate
i would not take a retribution as fleet support ship eitherits not just solo pvp its all pvp if you want to be useful and not just  around get a real tackler
no thank you why is it that every ship must be judged on the basis of solo pvp when that genre is all but extinctit does not need a second midslot it would be nice sure but it performs its function of damage  projection superbly without itactive tank relies on a nos in that utility high remove it without compensating and you force it to buffer fitremoving a lowslot is also a crappy option as it impacts not only active buffer but also gank fitsif you remove a high then at least give it a capacitor approaching that of the slicer
true afs do need a little love but retribution right now needs a fix it might even prod the devs into more af changes crosses fingersdesigned or not right now it is the only one 1 out of 8 that completely lack soloability personally i fly afs solo because they are fast light not too expensive have great gtfo and are frankly a ton of fun to fly each race has 2 soloable afs save for amarr which only has onei disagree firstly solo pvp is alive and well secondly even if flying in a gang this little guy isnt a great choice for damage take a hac or even a tech 1 cruiser afs are for strong tackling and enough dps to usually kill their targets they are not great gang ships in the first placethirdly the retri is the only ships in the game that lacks a second slot that says something that means the devs dun goofd when designing it sure theres specialty ships and whatnot but in terms of general combat ships retribution is alone in his unimidslottedness as regards to your complaint about losing the high i propose to you that its pretty damn hard to fill all the slots anyways without using a fitting mod personally i leave the utility slot empty and go for the high damage pulses ab repairer and sinks with anp fits without a mod but barely tank runs long enough for what it is the heavy tank af is vengeance
there is not just a problem with the retribution other afs have problemswould anyone really fly a wolf in 1v1 gangwhat about the hawkor enyo
solo is exceedingly rare and usually a failed gank calling it alive and well is a massive exaggerationyadayada bring cruiserhacbstitan if you want dps  and what good does that do in a frigate gang retribution is the single most powerful gang af if you know what you are doingretribution shares its one mid with the ship it is derived from the coercer they are almost the same with one being faster and tankier in exchange for trackingall the carthum gun boats have painfully few midslots with near max highlow tank and spank is what they do retribution is just stuck with the one due to being a frigate and zero wasnt an optionso again it would be nice but not needed especially not by sacrificing active tank capability
wow i never knew that the retribution a frigate was a t2 version of a coercer a destroyer i was totally fooled by the punisherlike modelwould you mind updating
totally supported
you could always use the vengeance but then youd complain about no laser cannons vs rockets
well played sir you set me strait i was unaware that the retribution was a tech ii destroyer i am doin it wrong supposed to have an interdiction thingy consider this your argument is that losing your high will break the retributions tank therefore rendering it less potency than its current incarnation fair enough how about we go through with the change and you mount a cap booster instead of tacklebamnow youve got an even better tank than before are immune to nosneuting and you still dont have to sully your starling reputation by using something as underhanded as a point or scrami have no problems with the vengeance imo one of the best afs there is if a little low on the dps side still it has a great tank can run an mwd perma without tank running and its damage is still not bad retribution has dps comparable to wolf but better range can run an active tank but has no tackle
a certain bot program requires modification of the eve client to work properly this is needed so that the bot can recognize the status of modules onoff ect my proposal is that ccp should monitor the accounts that have such settings and if they are logged in for a inhumane amount of time they should be banned for botting the way the settings must be adjusted has as only purpose botting it makes no sense to adjust these settings because it looks better hbot settingwidow mode 
confirming that i run with these exact settings on my laptop so your idea that the way the settings must be adjusted has as only purpose botting it makes no sense to adjust these settings because it looks better is most assuredly falsethis isnt even a clever attempt to detect bots
hbot user detected
hell nothey have no business reading my preferences its an invasion of privacyyou people are getting a little too blind deaf dumb and stupid when it comes to tracking botsyour assuming they even use the client in the first placeccp will never discuss nor will they ever disclose this because to do so would make the problem go out of controlasking ccp to poke and prod every account would cause some pretty stupid lawsuits to crop up over the fact they start behaving like a trojan and less a police task
thisccp has made it known that they have a slim client no graphics you dont think the main macros are using this or something similar
user submitting  idea getting it pointed out that its  and then still trying to stick to it detectedseriously though it really is a rubbish idea and not only because of the legitimate use of the settings that ccp supply
i seriously doubt that the real botter even use the client fact is they can do it faster more efficiently with their ownthere seems to be a misconception that botters are using a regular client and then they have a program setup tomove mouse to coordinateclickpress f1press f2etcthis is really a dated way to bot the few that actually employ this method are relatively harmless compared to the streamlines nongraphical clients used by ore farmers
most mmorpgs have a game mechanic to allow players to have a duel which both have to accept in a more or less fair and controlled way currently in order to prevent concord from joining the fight you have to join a common fleet which is risky because you dont know who else is part of it and trust is kind of rare in evei propose a system where two players or even better groups of players can agree to have a duel you loose if you dock leave the system change the ships and of course when your ship goes booom it is a draw if both are alive after a certain amount of time like 5 minutes or 10 or so concord will not react on the rivals shooting each other but will react on any thirdparty in the normal wayas money is everything it should also be possible to bet money on the outcomepro it is a new kind of controlled pvp and more pvp is normally considered a good thing new content for jita local i bet 10m isk you cant beat my new frig fitting without the current risk of being scammed players can organize their own turnaments more easily a way to earn isk with pvp that does not rely on lootsalvagecons trade hub systems could get even more crowded when large numbers of duellists hang out there but you could just disallow duells in jita and all is fine if its too bad
supportedpoint of fact shooting fleetmates is not in and of itself a concordsanctioned activity you can only shoot a fleetmates without concord intervention if some other condition applies such as they are in the same player corporation as you they stole from you you have kill rights on them you are in null security space or so onthat said you shouldnt fleet with people you dont trust anyway because they can keep you locked in sessionchange timers by constantly moving you around in the fleet hierarchy
i only duel with childrens trading cards because internet spaceships is serious business
great idea might actually simplify a few areas with this in mind
yep there isnt much reason to force us into typing out the name of the item just to see the contractsi would also like this option available in the variations tab on item info as well as adding check contract and market from items in the compare tool
who wants everything on the sexy sexy females and some males staying still while they jump up and down and run around not meso i have a very simple proposal have jiggly physics for incarna avatars it will seem more realistic and will be full of awesome incarna will be much grander for this level of detail along with the futanari thread thing and will become the greatest walking in station expansion ever released
lolsomeone told me to go make the thread and so i didyou just beat me to it i also approve this message
support jiggly moobs man boobs
we dont need an another damn second lifethis is eve online id be more interested in flashy moving parts on my ship who gives a flying crap about an avatar that would only interest most people for 10 secondsif you want perversion that bad go use the internetccp could spend there time doing more constructive things like fixing all of those nasty glitches
totally agreed id much rather see ccp spend time on things that matter rather than trying to fulfill some boyhood fantasies with vg characters
haters translated asses gonna hate translated pooptheyll have plenty of time to fix all those nasty nasty glitches after they get done with incarna which it seems theyre going to do anyway and they have about 6 months i doubt its a huge requestbesides it adds immersion p
why not they already have nice swinging hair so other such things should also be introduced
how old are you people
old enough to know that my maturity level does not hinge on a single thread about bouncing bountiful jibbly bits on a forum for an mmo thank you
you could have fooled me
my only question did we really need two threads about this
this type of retort suggests whos really the immature one also supporting lovely bounciesedit  develdrin no we need 3it was originally an accidenthowever i still support a third one go make one plz
a thumbs up wouldnt hurt i havent seen one of these threads in assembly hall recently and the fact that there may be a few of them has an impact all its own this is a good if not urgent idea lets see if we can give it the support it needs to get it to the front portion of the backlog if dust 514 takes off hack attempts may become even more frequent than now i dont think its mandatory in wow eitherregardswindjammer
some people just cant get enough if ccp did it soon theyd be calling for being allowed to log in all chars on the account at the same time and the only arguments for the change are other mmos have it managing skills is so annoying and i would so like this changehtfu
whybecause they said sowe dont need a bloody altexplosionits bad enough as it is already
noyou should be able to pause or start new skills on a character whilst logged into a different character on the same account thoughyou should also be able to switch between characters without exiting the client
people often suggest odd or unreasonable things this recurring request however is rather shameless to boot no youre not getting 2 accounts for the price of one please stop asking for that its embarrassing
instead of making clones free just streamline it by having only one clone at a price of a percentage of your sp i agree that it is rare for someone to forget to keep an updated clone but thats part of the death penalty pay isk to keep an updated clone or lose sp just remove the lose sp part and force the purchase of a clone the net effect is the same as what we all do already just less cumbersome
apparently its not enough for vets to have a total sp advantage over newbies in experience dps tanking ewar and shipmod options too for some stupid reason they think theyre entitled to be pampered in eve news flash theres no veteran gravy train waiting for u when ure out of your newbie phase u want something like that go back to wowbut heres an idea since it never crossed your mind even after all these yearsdont get podded and dont train what u dont need if its not even worth the cost to u u knew full well what would happen if u were to train it that high and most likely no one forced u to either so its your own fault
i can understand the view that this is another drop in the bucket for dumbing down eve so i suggest this alternative instead of having to pay an exorbitant amount every time you die make the current clone cost at 10x as much as now but you dont need to pay again you get that clone level permanentlyyour rookie clone the basic clone now given to you when you diethis way you still have to pay out the ass if you get podded 10 times in you current clone its paid for itself from here you can pay the difference to a new clone level to upgradefor instancebasic clone is 900k spyou want to upgrade to 25m spit costs 6 million isknow if you get podded youll end up in your station and still have a 25m sp clone when you want to upgrade to your 4m sp clone you pay the difference in cost between the twothoughts flames nerdrages
i have a better ideastop dying
something like this would also work i just want to encourage more pvp and allowing older players to do pvp in risky areas and cheap ships without the clone costs might cause people to get in more fun fights implants already provide a consequence for pod loss
i propose you are able to fire the resurrection technician that forgets to upgrade your clone automatically you may have to fire a few but eventually youll get one that remembers to do his job might help to tip him a few millions now and thenan option to automate an oft repeated selection is not dumbing down anythingas for clone price eh i do think the prices start getting out of whack when they go above 20mils but other than that its not that big of a dealof course ideally if you want a cost assigned to death id just say put a cost on the ship podkills have only ever been the equivalent of teabagging anyway something you do to someone that is no threat at all to annoy them quite a juvenile mechanic all in all so you lost a ship thats x amount paid out in life insurance for the dead crew not as much as clones since it is more frequent and could have some small multiplier for character age it would definitely make flying cheap ships more enticing after you have tens of millions of sp
if you cant handle the threat of losing your sps because of expenses you should learn to play smarterthat makes you the dumbass here not meeve should be a game of challenges and risks not hello kitty onlinewhen you pvp you should put your chars sps on the line with the rest of usmaking it free would make the whole cloning business pointlesstop that off with the fact that larger sp clones while expensive wouldnt take much to fund with just a bit of ratting or some missioningif your that hardpressed for isk your seriously screwing up 15 million please i make that in a single level 4 and then some cry me a damn riverpvp should never be free or very cheap it should require effort and hard workpractice and experience makes it cheaper but that should be earned not given
prices are about right for the lower tiers it does get ridiculously expensive at the highend a single lost pod costs several days of subscription 1mo350m it is ok for t3 which at least offers some bling while losing days but a random smartbomb clone upgrade upon moving to higher tier should recoup someall of previous installment if a bunch of bears want to try to show teeth and cant get a jumpclone perhaps adjusting jc requirements is a better path or even a complimentary jc courtesy of one of the militias if a person is forgetful then hopefully he will learn his lesson at least you get a second chance whereas forgetting your seatbelt in the real world rarely offers that luxuryno to removal yes to higher tier adjustment
im open to higher tiered adjustments as highlighted but i cannot deny the fact that higher sp counts should indicate more experience and practice in the art of affording expensive toyscarebears who never pvp before with that kind of level of sp would be pretty bloody rich enough to afford a few screw ups even should have jcs by then of which are easy to get thanks to a few jc corps
this really
i always fit 4s for my 2 learning attributes i have 100 mil sp so a clone cost 20m my favourite ship to fly is the minmatar dictor the sabre everytime i lose a clone it cost 70 mil if clone costs wernt so expensive i would be encouraged to go out in small ships more and engage more
yes they shouldbecause they understand the risks and should know betteri say remove medical clones alltogetherand make pods invulnerable to aoe disruption and weaponsyou lose a pod its your own fault and you pay the price in sp
not supported id like the costs to be higher tbh
i support a revisit of the highertier clone costs
sure as long as the animation doesnt make the session change take longer than it mustagreeing with a dav proposal
first of all i strongly support this secondthe blizzard tokens are from a company called vasco data security not rsa rsa the company are encryption specialists vasco are authentication just to make it easier if youre looking for more information either companies tokens would be better than none but only if optionaledit  since preview deselects the support checkbox
weve been spotted run
they should find and ban all bots im sure some people bott for personal isk not just to sell for irl money
yea but if your hunting you also have to scan down everyone and everything in the wormhole meaning combat probes will be on dscanin nullsec its warp to asteriodbelt and kill the miner who never know your sb was in local
i think it would be advantageous for more certifications to be added like to reverse engineer build t3 stuff and other productions the last update was for pi but before that i have no clue when any changes were made theres a bunch of small skill sets that could be added which help new players map out career paths
no one really saw the point of certificates when they were released but theyre here now so i agree im seeing a pattern of features being introduced but left out in the dark afterward for instance when was the last update to factional warfare and cosmos missions have been left to rot since they arrived same with bounty hunting and smuggling and we havent heard a peep on t3 not to mention poss which everyone would like to be updated in one way or anotherrant
they should at least remove clickfests like mining and pi so there would be no pressing need for mining bots or pi bots f whole mining and pi mechanics can be too easily exploited if you can just leave your client on and clickityclick in case of mining it just doesnt require enough effort it would be much more fun to find a rich asteroid and mine it out fast than just wait x hoursin pi case it just doesnt make sense you need to clickityclick constantly to create passive income if you need to click it is not passive income
not that ive ever flown a supercap but the requirement to leave scs floating in space have a shared sc pilot or have a dedicated valet alt so that an alliance assets can be safe while unused is imho poor game design and yet another example of ccp ignoring low hanging fruitive never understood why a docking module for poses hasnt been introduced just like a pos shield or secured container if you know the password for the docking module you can unanchor board  fly anything anchored to it if you dont you cant the ui doesnt need to be anything spectacular hell if it was itd look out of place with the rest of the pos ui
they are meant to be stolen
there also has to be a way to get someone land into the bubblemaybeavoiding everything sounds pretty good plan at start but when you try to catch something it suddenly doesnt feel alright
just a quick headsup  the current diabolical plan is to release the minutes in 3 chunks mwf this is being done both the provide a bit of extra time to finish a couple of segments as well as to group related items so that discussions of them wont get lost in the crowd
guys in big alliances just want cheap jump bridge machine but then they already have titans and they complain blackops are uselesschange blackops into small gang vessels with decent fitting for damage and tank with sensible sensor strenght so someone would actually use these ships more often i personally think blackops were balanced to be used by people who have no actual need for them at first place plzx

well thought idea thats alot better then what we have now itll also make the game better at lorewise
i would love it if there was a punch like effect to the warp in eve ive seen several variations and they all look awesome
faster accelerationdeacceleration do want
you will never see this in game because 1 it looks cool2 the only effect changes ccp makes is to put the generic wormhole phase in  phase out effect on everything3 they cant even fix the rubbish cyno effect after 3 years so why would they put in something like this
i support this endeavor the current warp effect is very obviously from 2001 needs an update badly
after what is it 2 years of complaints about the unfinished expansion that was hyped from the roottops bought in a lot of new subscribers then was abandonid like to hear wtf ccp has to say for themselvesa devblog why we dont want to fix fw would be good
no
noin the end ive never seen a game use it in a way thats agreeable

i support this motion boobs are very important

i support this only on the ground that if ccp has any plans at all of using carbon as a selling point it should replicate fat jiggle not just with breasts but with all deposits of fat

baring the fact that all of incarn is a wast of dev time and resoures they mite as well make the best part of it look good
i personly think incaran was a total waist of devlement time and resoures for eve but if there going to force it on us anyways then i totaly support the war on boob droopage
loli agree
i like the realism aspect of this game its just not right for boobs to be made of bone same goes for other parts of the body that are soft such as thighs belly muscles cheeks etc i havent seen the models but i hope they move realistically not just look like wax sculpturesit would be so much easier to make games look realistic if we were anthropods but alas we are vertebrates

yes i know the hybrid topic has been beat to death and back again but luckily for all you boys and girls this isnt about hybrids this is about their main platformsits no secret that gallente ships are outperformed by their racial counterparts in almost any match up it could be recons bcs bs even cruisers gallente are bested in almost any match up here are a few proposals to help balance them and make them more effective in small gang and maybe even fleet warfare so that were not relegated to drakes online1 increase the dampener bonus on celestis hulls t1 plus the recon ships from 5 per level to 10 per level the numbers are themselves are less important than the fact that gallente ewar ships need a buff its ridiculous that the only way to effectly dampen a target is with 3 damps from a ship designed specifically to field that ewar buffing these hulls prevents the return to rsds on every goddamn setup known to man but allows more options for dealing with both ecm and nanogotry alike and the fact that the optimal only extends to 45km with max skills keeps it from being too op2 change the penalties on armor rigs gallente ships are already slow but to force them to further gimp themselves by fitting trimarks if they want any sort of usable tank is just completely unfair and bad design maybe an additional agility penalty on the armor rigs across the board would be acceptable but honestly forcing armor ships designed to fight at close range to kill their max speed and even agility even further is just cruel ideally we could make the penalty less shields or something that doesnt have anything to do with speed but anything is better than the current situation and this would be great for other races too as wed see a lot less bastardized shield tanked hurricanes and a little more variety in gang setups3 boost the base speed on gallente ships this is the big one kiting is just way too easy in this game theres a reason in a lot of fantasy games ranged chars are forced to fire while stationary its so the melee units can catch up the fact that the race with the shortest range is not the fastest is just silly i mean think about it pretend youre a game designer coming up with a new game and you try to pitch the idea of having a slow melee unit trying to catch a ranged unit that can fire while moving and is faster than the melee unit to begin with its an impossible situation even if you get a warp in your target is already moving 12kms add another 67 sec thats being generous for lock time plus another second for module lag as well as the time it takes you to get up to speed against a ship that is already faster than you and its damn near impossible to get webscram on a nanoed target and thats assuming that you literally land on top of him and if anyone comes in here with that bs about matar have to be the fastest cause thats the way it is should just not bother posting its the height of stupidity to keep an entire race of combat ships gimped because of some stupid fluff or grandfathered reasoning4 add more pg to the ships or lower hybrid fitting requirements it is almost impossible to fit a decent tank on a gallente ship even with ions which means they have yet another disadvantage added to the extensive list of existing ones and why are 200mm rails so much more pg heavy than dual 150mms its so far and away from the jump between electrons and ions that it doesnt make a lick of sense5 lastly change the rep bonus or alter armor reps somehow boosting the rep bonus would make too many op wtfpwn boats but trying to fit a dual repper setup with anything besides the very lowest class of guns is impossible without totally gimping yourself perhaps lowering the pg requirement for armor reppers and reducing their cap usage would help improve the setupsthese changes are needed as well as hybrid fixes but both need fixing tracking esp
supported but we need to come up with fixs for caldire gun ships too there even slower then gallent and not a one of them get a tracking bounse
boost gallente
supportedwallente ships need fixhybrids need to be fix
all gallente needs fixing as will as the majority or all of caldari hybrid boats
damps used to be uber now their overnerfed  a boost to the hull bonus would be good exact numbers would have to be done through play testingi agree speed wrecks the setups not to sure what would be better as you posted agility would be worth a go dosent have to be faster then mim just  faster the deimos for example is slower then the zealot wtf yeap this would fix alot of the issues with the hullsarmour rep bonus applies to recieved rr aswell  fixed if you leave it as local only its aways going to be useless in either a buffer fit or asoon as theirs more then 2 guys shooting at you
any change is welcome and much needed
you sir hit the nail on the head1 imho it should be even 15 on the razu and the lach tho damps should not be able to damp lower then 10km but one damp should be able to make one ships have said 10km lock range2better idea make the rigging skill reduce 20 per level making the skill more useful and when skilled to 5 removing the penalty altogetherthat goes for all rigging skills and rigs3 gallente ships should be the the fastest races ships in game they should not be able to be kited by their minmatar counterpart except by specialized ships vaga huggin rapier etc4both needs to be done lower blaster and rail pg and increase the base pgcpu on the ships a brutix needs to be able to fit a rack of ions a med cap booster a mwd and dual rep ffs same goes for the hyperion5 change it to a 5 resist bonus and you got a deal that would make those ships so much more useful and keep em able to use dual or even triple mar setups triple hype onlyand despite all that blasters and rails still need a buff in damage and tacking 25 in both i say yes it would op them in close range fight but seriously every weapon should stand out in its niche also for med blasters with have a optimal of about 5km it is not too much asked to have them omgwtfspwn in that area 
at first i was going to say that you should post in one of those topics taht already exist we do indeed need to consolidate i dont care whose post it is 234 i simply could not agree more armor rigs and speed please guns need fixing as well for crist sake

gallente ships arent underpowered theyre just not the top pvp race that being said theres plenty good gallente pvp ships such as the incursus myrmidon megathron and nyx to name a fewthe reason everyone flies drakes is because drakes are overpowered i fly a drake and have to agree drakes are overpowered my combatoriented skills are so puny that i have difficulty soloing level 3 missions no matter what i fly in unless its a drake i can solo some level 4 missions in a drake drake is the only ship i have a chance of defeating another players ship in i havent yet but ive come closeother battlecruisers arent underpowered at all in fact theyre great allaround ships that dont do any one thing too well drakes on the other hand can tank better than most battleships while maintaining the mobility and signature radius of a battlecruiser if you ask me it should only have this potential if its damage were rather pitiful my damage in a drake is pitiful but ive seen plenty of drakes that can really put out some dps drakes should have shield recharge time nerfed
with the current system you must pay 15 per month for each character you wish to be training skills the drawback to this is that in order for someone to train 2 characters at once those characters must be on separate accounts both accounts must be active in order for even one character to be used at a timei propose that ccp might allow players to spend an extra 15 on their account in order to be allowed to train a second character for a month or 30 extra to train both other characters it would be nice to be able to train an alt to do things we dont want to put on our main skill queue without stopping the main one either then every once in a while it can be useful to switch to the other character to make use of that characters unique skillset
why would you pay the same price as having a second account but with less functions but in a way i agree with you somehow
the main advantage is that i could pay for only one month of training and then keep using the trained character later without having to pay to keep the character active unless i want to keep training skills
the plus side is you can have a trader alt on the same account training for about 60 days then stop training but still play with himnot everyone can run 2 accounts at the same time so having 2 accounts is redundant if they only want 1 alt

tldr  why the hell didnt they use eve gate and sendreceive feeds with facebooki really dont get it eve gate was this big deal about social networking they put together and it wasnt used for this facebook allows feeds so even a hack job to parse results from facebook should have worked and taken little development time to implementno concerns about using facebook a good use for the effort invested in creating eve gate and marcom gets a new set of toys to play with plus gets to hype eve gate if they so choose same endresults but more participation from the user community and the ability to use the same mechanism to pipe things to and from facebookeve gate in the futureit seems to be a lame decision by the marketing group and a missed opportunity
do you realy care of some  social network where you have hundreds of cyber frineds that will never be there for you if you are realy social person then you go out and meet people irl not in that  just good enough to change sexual adresses
ummmyou seem to be against having to use facebook this thread is a proposal protesting the use of facebook in voting for art intended for evehow about a thumbs up supporting the proposal theres a little check box for that when you postregardswindjammer
so whos gonna stop the folks who decide to create 9k fake facebook accounts to influence the results with evegate ccp has some measure of control thereand you can believe me when i say that i know some folks that have multiple accounts so they can cheat at farmville
i dont think this causes ccp any concern the primary purpose of arranging the voting to be done exclusively on facebook is to market their game to people who arent playing it of course if people are creating fake facebook accounts to vote it defeats the marketing purposeso angering current customers effectively barring a section of the eve populace from voting opening up voting to noneve people and now a point is made which completely voids any semblance of validity the voting might have had at all this was supposed to have been a fun contest it appears to be failing on multiple levelsregardswindjammer
i will never use facebook
i dont just not like facebook i have experience with it and i can say firsthand that there are few places on the internet more annoying or confusing than that website dont use myspace either that one is arguably slightly worsei wish i could give this more thumbs up but i guess one will have to do
there needs to be adjustments to the current t2 production andor moons to address the current technetium market im not trying to bash the nc in anyway i personally think cutting the r64s value some was a great idea but putting all the value of moons into one type that is greatly located in one area of the game was not beneficial to 00 pvp or politics money plays a huge in wars if ccp wants to increase pvp wars and over all motion of empires in 00 to keep the game from getting stagnant then money high value passive incomes can not be so confined to select areas of eve where alliances or coalitions can take control and monopolize themi think a great method of spreading the value of moons would be to change t2 production to use moon materials for each race from moons in their respected areas the idea would make all regions relatively equal in value for moons large alliances and coalitions could greatly impact the market as they do now by manipulating t2 materials but only for one race this also allows ccp to keep eve realistic in several ways a race would develop its technology from the resources around it after all if each race is unique why not have the raw resources to make their technologies uniqueanother option which i dont believe would be as good is to redistribute all moons in eve to be more evenly spread out major issues arise addressing what happens to moon mining towers that are on moons and the major database changes would be unneeded pain the issue of how realistic it would be if moons were not unique to areas of space which honestly they would be specially over such a massive expanse
or you could just let moon mining happen in wormholes there total lawless wtf is going on there anyways who the f is stoping moonmining in wormhole space no one just ccp
i like the idea of moon mining in wh space firstly it does not add to a wh being self sufficient taking ice out of them took that possability away all by itselfand speaking of wh being self sufficient personally  i would like that lets put ice in them too you stil lwould have to defend them fro mroving gangs  miners would stil lbe at risk durrign the mining of that fuelwhy make it so that you have to take a monthly armed escourt trip into low secbut as i said i support moon mining in wh space
the result would be stronger pvp groups holding the empire static whs and keeping them in control that would push out smaller groups who like to live in them but couldnt deal with the difficult of whs above class 3 your basically going to cause a restriction in whs that clenches null sec now
hoping more people see this idea
the proposal itself is not good no idiot wil leven out a ship on the same grid as the pos might as well selfdistruct would be cooler if you had to position you ship between the pod and the moon in the way of the tarctor beam and leech off the resources that pos pulls from the moon then they would hve to go after you and the tractor beam would also prevent anyone from cloacking withing x km of it
i am still puzzled why is it that gallente ships are so inferior is it slot layouts what is it slot layout underpowered capacitorkronos vs vargurvargur is faster and more maneuverablevargur has 3x more range with autocanons then kronos does with blastersvargur can fit 35 more tankdrone capacity is equal whykronos does 60 more dps the 60 extra dps really compensates for all of the drawbackslistd above and when you compare hyperion and maelstrom its even worse
not exactlythe problem is fivefold gallente ships are mostly geared for armor tanking however plates and armor rigs slow ships down the gallentes main weapon system blasters requires that a ship be able to get in range sub 10km quicklythe above 2 problems lead people to ignore certain builtin bonuses and shield buffer ships like the brutix myrmidon and hyperion in order to has sufficient speed to close range which leads to another problem blasters have trouble tracking things of the same class within their optimal range effectively negating any paper dps advantage they have over other weapon systems to compensate gallente ships usually have to fit a web or two to slow things down enough but this is becomes a problem when the ship has been shield tanked to get into rangeedit added some stuffcombined with the first 2 points gallente ships are supposedly the active tanking race intended to use armor reppers to their fullest potential however this leads to 2 more problems  armor reppers use capacitor capacitor that is needed to feed cap hungry guns not as cap hungry as lasers but still and the almost mandatory microwarpdrive they need to close range for their very short range weaponry to compensate for this people fit cap boosters but then this leads to another problem armor reppers eat up powergrid powergrid that is needed to fit very powergrid hungry weapons as well as the almost mandatory microwarpdrive plus to continue from the last point to active tank sufficiently well one needs to fit a cap booster mod or two which also eats up a lot of powergrid this leaves some active tanked gallente ships either very tightly fit or sacrificing some major aspect of their fit examples give up the mwd for an ab then you move slow and cant close range quickly give up high end guns for smaller versions but then you cant do the facemelting dps needed to compensate for having to close distance etc
werent gallente ships all the rage in pvp three years ago i remember a time where people said unanimously gallente is eves easy mode
so tldr we didnt even get the value of fraction of an implantand the real real advantage that other playes were given was the stacked nature of the implants that allow significantly higher training speeds in less common primary skills for the less than year period neededits not the other half of the 5 that is the real issuethe issue is the stacking getting an remap stacked means that you can make a plan where you train something for less than 6 months before switchingextremely valuable for something like a pvp player moving to a capital ship and needing 3  months of drones and 4 without remapping specificallythat is not an unusual situation at all there are others like getting up to mega corp managment or super wcommand etc where charisma would be the key for a few monthsover 3 or 4 months you can easily gain 1 million more sp during that short peirod if you have stacked remapsthat they gave out so liberally to maybe 60 plus of charactersalso the fraction of a remap are really far less than the fraction they implyoviously if you just remapped you wouldnt want to remap again for at least a few months but most of us think ahead peopel make a plan to expire exactly when the next remap was due my 3 of a remap is worth nothing because i need the current attributes to finish up some stuff before i map the opposite wayremapping means planning ahead a suprise shortening does no good unless you planned poorlyno if they gave something like a 5 of a remap that meant i could remap again in 6 months  lol ok im warping the concept irreperably the point is if we had known 8 months ago that we would get a fraction of a remap perhaps it would be worth that whole fraction if we had the time to plan aheadso tldr we didnt even get the value of fraction of an implantand the real real advantage that other playes were given was the stacked nature of the implants that allow significantly higher training speeds in less common primary skills for the less than year period needed
i think those who got their timer reset should have had the same amount of time remaining till their next remap if this is not the case then i am in support im sure there were some who were an inch away from getting their remap and got screwed over by getting it just a few days sooner that doesnt really count as an extra
something needs to be done and this looks as good as anything alse i have seen
this is painful rip why do you want to change sig resolution instead of tracking you must think that doing this will produce a different ingame effecttell me what happens in the following situation how much damage as a percentage of the eft maximum is donetransversal is zero a turret of signature resolution 400 m fires at a target of signature radius 40 m sitting at its optimal range
snap i did not think of it like that i was wanting to use the sigres as a way to inc tracking for caldire ships with out making the guns overly fast on galante ships with tracking bouncesthough mybe its still a good change on rails they need a damg inc as well and a tracking inc for caldire gunboats mybe a 10 damg inc on rails and lead adds a 20 tracking inc editthe problem is the two diffent races ships make them near impossable to balance realy ether need to remove hybirds and hand gallent projectiles and caldire lazers or give hybirds to gallent and make a 4th gunnery system for caldire
once you realize caldari gunships are mainly rail focused while gallente are mainly blaster focused it really isnt that difficult
by rail focused you mean cant fit them due to pg and got no tracking and usually no damage bonus greatly complementing a weapon system with great range low damage and poor trackingand by blaster focused you mean slow armortanked ships ideal for use with shortestrange weapons
ya i loled at this too mybe its the fact you get better usage out of the gun bc ferox with artilery that makes them rail focusedor mybe its the fact you get usage out of acs on the myradon that makes them blaster focused
as long as caldari railboats have the range to use faction ammo theyll have far better tracking than their gallente counterparts and any other turret using t2 longrange ammo remember range bonuses are damage bonusesi suspect that fiddling with rail range will offer a more targeted boost to the caldari railboats than just a straight damage boost looking at rokh and eagle pg will also help of course some more damage may also be needed but id start with looking at the range myself i havent run any numbers on this
ya becouse we all know that caldire boats are so fast and agile that you can keep range righti also take it you have not used beams on a apoc or artilary on a mel the better sniping dps is going to lazers and the better alph to artilarysare hybirds useable ya any weapon system is useable with a big bloband everyone can use fraction ammo
you what come on man think before you post were talking about rails hence sniping ship speed is of little consequence for snipers especially on the bs scale and caldari ships have good agility alpha is artillerys theme its no bloody surprise that its more than rails and of course beams have more damage they have less range and no not everyone can use faction ammo because they dont have the range look if youre to propose the boost that rails need you need to have a basic understanding of the weapons after seeing your utter confusion about tracking i have zero confidence in your ability to do so nowstop whinging and try to propose a coherent idea for boosting rails backed up by specific fits and comparisons more tracking on rails isnt really necessary particularly not in the halfbaked sig resolution fashion that you came up with originally the fundamental problem is damage at range which can be addressed via increased raw damage or increased range
i posted yet another mathimatical proof of the direct relation between tracking and signature resolution but after considering your apparent inability to read numbers andor do math at all ive given up and deleted it
yea now that you mention it the ferox does have this bonus to projectile optimal range the myrm does not have any turret bonuses so it can fit whatever it wantsif you are looking for blaster focused platforms i suggest you take a close look at deimos or astarte210 for trolling attempt though
you dont need to be defensive no justification is necessary the fact that it can be done is enough in itself and its all that matters the problem is that it destroys the market for deadspace mods this is caused by too many people doing it which is an indication that its too much of an easy money the economy is distorted whenever someone finds backdoor to get rich quick disproportionally to amount of workrisk to put market back into balance and preserve this sector of the economy measures must be taken so that fewer people does it the proposed mechanics does just this
translation u actually want it to stop completely because as long as ppl continue to be stupid they can be punished for it u wanna be stupid and be rewarded for it go back to wow in fact do u even have any proof that its destroying the deadspace mod market instead of just throwing a random assumption out there did u ever think that maybe ppl dont want to spend billions only to spend months just to earn back their investment even without being ganked instead of spending it on pvp and with your logic suicide ganking is hardly a problem at all compared to scammingthis just boils down to pure blatant riskaverse whining without a single ounce of intelligence or thought behind it
fully support thisplus itll increase the fighting that goes on in highsec ill be able to group up with some people and take some gankers down whats not to lovethe only people against this are gankers
why not have this tied to sec status and faction standing and have concord or faction navies attack you directly as soon as sec status drops too low you could make it so higher security space requires a higher sec status to enterholy  this has already been implemented
the whole point of this is to not stop it completely but adding a degree of risk so that not everyone and their mother is doing it stopping it wouldve been easy they can just destroy all mods on ship destruction disable highsec targeting etc thats not the way to go as for proof its in the market itself search contracts compare current prices and backlog amount to the past hes not going to compile a spreadsheet for you it all boils down to you wanting to farm the loophole for big easy riskfree money regardless of the damaging effect it has on eve economy and player base as a whole
greetings all im 10 seconds old and will be biomassed shortly i wish to bring up a topic thats been gone over already ad nauseum and im too lazy to necro itthe dramielomg wtfive been in this game since castor and ive seen my fair share of fotm ships come and go but this little devil beats them all theres just no way to catch it and the little blighter does insane damage for an untackleable speedboatit needs to be brought in line with other pirate faction frigates and for that matter the cynnabal in accordance with other pirate cruisersthe major fault is not its damage or tank or whatever its all the speed nothing in the game has been more modified than speed and even the vast speed changes when coupled with web changes did not fix things much at allno other vessel in the game can go 8ks now except the dramiel no frigate that can even come close to that speed can come anywhere close to the damage output it enjoys coupled together theyre an iwin button bar nonewhen webbed they just warp anything that can scram them and currently only the lacharazu can try but by the time they lock a dram pilot is 70km beyond range dies near instantly to their omfgpwn damage output for a frigate currently the only possible way to catch one is with no less than two ships and even thats pretty much a nonpossibility only the very careless ones get caught or a very very lucky shot from a sniper ship can bring one downccp has always in the past balanced a ships speed to its damage output or cloak ability you can either have speed or cloak but almost always sacrifice dps to do so bombers are tissue boxes and slow and are for the most part unable to put dps on small targets save limited use bombsproposal simple bring dramiel top speed down in the range of interceptors or other fast frigates no need to change anything else keep them zippy for their class but not so much it stomps t2 ships into the dirt keep their dps up so theyre still viable antitackle just make them capable of being caught by those tacklersor keep them stupid fast like they are and reduce their damage there must be trade offs for speed and the dramiel and cynnabal simply currently lack them the machariel on the other hand is almost identical to every other pirate faction bs as far as damage output tank and speednothing is more annoying to anyone than seeing dramiels all over the place like flies not when there are so very very many ships that are being rendered trashbin tossoffs as a resultoh and yes i fly them ive got 62 left from the days when they were dirt cheap im quite familiar with their capabilities and weaknesses  there are too few counters to speed which ccp has been forced to adjust many times in the past and need to once againokay its off to the biomass bin with me flame on i wont be here to care
obligatory thumb of course
the problem with the dramiel is that its an assault frigate with interceptor like speedagilityall other frigates are either assault frigates or interceptors so the dramiel naturally does dominatemake it either a faction interceptor or a faction assault frigate
dramiel is an elite ship of frigate class and eve needs more elite ships and not only on supercapitol levelthe only problem with dramiel is that it is too cheap for the power it provides the true cost should be around 150 milbtw i managed to kill 5 dramiels within 1 week 1 at a time so its not like it cant be done
badgers are overpowered
uhm so every other pirate faction bs does outrun cruisers easilyyou obviously have no clue what you are talking about the one angel ship that is op is the macharielbut hey it costs a billion isk thats fine then
gimp your drone skils take drone mods and this will be enough 
because of dramiel
dramiel can be fended off easily by any semidecent droneboat but killing it is very difficult unles you have a webbonused ship or arazulach on it its a damn simple calculation8 ms speed24km disruptor rangeyou have to kill it in under three seconds so to kill it you have to do one of the followingoutmatch the dramiel pilot in skill quite a lotsnipe it off and if the dramiel pilot is sitting ith 0 transversal in range of a sniper he is an idiotcatch a pilot afkgank it with a bunch of droneboats arazus and huggins and a serpentish ship with 90 web is preferable and yeah it is stupidly fast i have noproblem with it being uncatchable if its dage output is near harmless or it has weak tank but it has more effective hp and dps then most afs and some bad cruisers around thats just silly
a faction frigate that costs four times as much as a t2 should be a lot better than a t2not supported
other pirate frigates dont cost this much it only cost this much because its so good supply and demand and for something this good it should cost more btw
i agree with goose99the dramiel should not be nerfed but its price should be increased as it is arguably the most popular faction frigate and clearly the most discussed it should cost more than other faction frigates
wtb rifter with 100 resists  250b its fair cause i paid a lot for it
screw this cost has nothing to do with it the dramiel is overrated but it also is overpowered even if its only a little bit actually screw that its not overpowered all its got is speed and all its good for is running away i have never been killed by a solo dramiel guess whymaybe get rid of the drone bay or decrease the speed a little bit but you definately need to buff the other faction frigs not just the cruor and succubus and worm but the af as well retribution definately eaf sentinal and kitsune are decent and t1 frigs breacher inquisitor atron condor slasher ect
flip sideafterburners can be used to kick a ship into warp as well we all know the trick right start the ab initiate the warp  your slow ship reaches about 40 of its top speed and then the afterburner stops  bang you are now doing 90 of your top speed  and you are kicked into immediate warpits a shame that the afterburner skill makes this less of an option by increasing the duration timer id much prefer the cap reduction over the duration as it preserves this mechanic as welltheres more reasons to support this besides just the overheating thing
afterburner skill should reduce mass penalty by 15 per level
nice one want
simple yet filling i want more
and while your at it remove tactical shield manipulation which does actually nerf shields
or just change it to something else like longer hardener duration
this not supportedseriously being able to constantly heat is vital to abonly frigates your proposal would cause serious damage to a whole fitting style
im completely in favor of minicaps but it needs a lot more work
how about put a que on the online offlining anchor and unachor for the possesno wonder people left this game
98 of persons i polled believe that when you give the stop ship command either by right click or cntrlspace it should disengage the mwd  ab modules the other 2 either didnt understand the question or refused to answer why would your prop mods continue cycling if you have order a halt where does the thrust go is there any benefit to continue to have them running after full stop has been given i asked a game insider these questions and he just looked at me sheepishly almost like he was embarrassed to answer smiled slightly and asked if i had any other questions really does it make any sense to anyone that they dont cycle off i dont mind when i bomb someone d but for myself id prefer the prop mods to stop cycling that is all
makes perfect sense
good plan
yeah like no one would activate mwd while sitting stillthink again
going to disagree with thisuntil theres keyboard shortcuts for 33 50 66 and full speed stopping the ship and then doubleclicking in space very fast is the best way to simulate half speed without the huge risk that moving the mouse to the hud is when manually flying an interceptor the mouse is way too busy to do anything else than keeping on doubleclicking in space so theres no time to go and click on the hud to slow the ship down and the ctrlspacedoubleclick in space trick is still the best way to simulate a slower speedi would support this if there were speed shortcuts ala tie fighter you know that game from the mid 90s seriously why is this not implemented in eve yet
yeah i hate sitting stopped at a gate camp with my mwd cycling and killing all of my cap
supportedits a waste of capacitor for a mwdab to be on when youre not using it
not spportedalternate solutionabmwd consumes the portion of capacitor proportional to the speed you are going at or yet better the proportion of thrust that is being used
i agree the max speed your ship is currently trying to obtain should determine the amount of capacitor drain from the module when full stop is called it should stop draining capacitoralternatively there could be a menu toggle that would turn on or off the feature proposed by the op
it would be great but sadlythat would only work if cap drain was constant which wont happen in a 15 seconds cycle it would either need to track and register every single speed changes and acceldecel every few frames for the duration of the cycle or calibrate cap drain at a specific point such as at the moment of the end of the cycle or a random point during itfirst possibility means lag potentially lots of it second possiblity means it quite probably wouldnt be representative of the energy actually spent or exploitable or both
bring back the aoe ddsomething needs to be done about the annoying drake blobs that have replaced cap ship warfare now that titans can oneshot lesser capitals there are fewer and fewer of them being used for anything more than rattingi hate being in these mobs but have been rather point blank ordered to crosstrain to caldari so i can join the eye watering agony of the drake pos bash blob  gah id rather be mining its less laggy and more entertainingincrease the cap usage increase the cycle time increase the stront cost do whatever needs to be done to make the aoe dd a onetrickpony but please for the love of eve bring back the titan wipethefield popgunits off to the biomass bin for me ta ta
giving titans aoe dd will not fix drake blobs it will have an equal affect on all ship blobs if drakes are a problem then petition to have drakes fixed
drakes arnt broken the servers arenerfing drakes means we will see cane blobsdrakes just have more ehp and amaing passive recharge so in high lag survivability is better as well as missiles always hitting a target
heres an idea lets have ccp give ships horns for a rorqual it would have some deep base horn that would sound like blapapapapapapapapan orca would have a ships horn hooooooooooooooooooooooooonkand a rookie ship could have a bysicle bell gingle gingleand a rokh could have a train whistle no doubt someone will come up with why this would be unbalancedbut lets have a vote for funzies anywayhorns could be activated by the spacebarand cloaked covert opps ships could have some kinda phantom honkhave fun with it ccp its just a nice bit of polish
i dont see how this would be a good thing to have or funny for that matter
i think it would be hilarious but no not good
eve has soundcouldnt resistthis would be cool for a week but then just annoying also there is no sound in space a horn would be about as usefull as a screen door in a submarine imagine the noise clutter also in jita all the suicide gankers would just hold down the space bar and think of the poor servers needing to transmit startstop events to everyonealso the devs need to spend more time killing lag instead of developing pointless features
im pretty new to eve but it seems to me that to cloak is to play its just another valid tactic thats open to anybody to use you dont like cloakers in your 00 space well i dont like your scaryss gangs in 00 space  thats why i dont go there yet you either adapt and deal with it or you gtfo as they say
if youre pretty new to eve then you dont really understand all the implications of an afk cloaker yet its not something that you can just adapt and deal with
the problem isnt cloaks its local being used as an intel tool making offensive cloaking impossiblefix local and then see if cloaks are still a problem
the biggest issue to cloaks is afk cloaking people want to address it but they dont want to destroy the usefulness of themmy proposal would be to have cloaks stop cap recharging while ships are cloaked and have the cloak use cap ships them are meant to be cloaky ships would get a bonus to reduce the amount of capacitor a cloak uses the advantages of a system like this are easy to see we are not stopping active players from using ships hiding from people is still a possible task what we are capable of addressing is someone going afk cloaking to stop production of a system afk cloaking does not stop npcing and honestly we shouldnt be trying to stop it npcing is part of the game and it has its risks while outside of empire those risks are still there
fair to say but the other issues such as cloaked ratters for example arent really issues they are just another way to play eve isnt that one of the things that is great about this game  youre not restricted to one style of gameplay i think so anyway
you have to admit though if you do remove the afk cloaks  what do you think should stop the production of a system then in low sec you can barely operate for more than 5 minutes in peace hell even in high sec you are atrisk of having your hulk or mission ship ganked if you have control over local and no one can afk cloak in your alliance space then wheres the risk for you as soon as an unknown ship appears in local  dock up pirates cant touch your pvemining ships enemy alliances cant touch themill be the first to admit that afk cloaking is a borderline exploit  but hey they actually do serve a purpose if we get rid of them we need to put another system into place on purpose no pvemining ship should be safe  especially not in 00 right
the fact that the op complains that the juicy target cloaked flor longer than 10min means that he and his gang were willing sit camp said target for at least 1001 min if we made cloaks quit working after 30min would his gang have moved on or waited around spanking thier monkies thinking about the countdowncloaks are fine on warships they allow for ninja activities and create whine threads what more can you want from a modulesrsly m8 htfu
many of these so called afk cloakers are not afk at all they really are there watching you that is their job have you any idea how long some players are capable of watching a targeta genuine afk cloaker is no threat to anyone all they do is sit there it is up to you how you perceive that as a threatcloaking is working just fine
1 some of my hulk ganks were confirmed to be 1000 alts im merely instilling the only risk they ever had to face and if ure gonna criticize internet spaceship scoreboards check yourself first namely the fact that most of your kills were with blobs fyi racking up kills behind the safety and risklessness of your blob does not make u a better pvper or whatever higher notion u have of yourself all it proves is that ure even more riskaverse than the afk cloakers u cry about2 from both sides of the equation as a cloaker and when i was roaming i cant kill anyone in a covert ops frigate so why should that be a problem and when i used to roam i only went for targets that wanted to engage because unlike u a i can actually handle the risk of not having an army to hide behind and b i dont waste my subscription camping one insignificant target who simply isnt gonna and doesnt want to fight this stupid notion of yours that ure somehow entitled to a guaranteed constant flow of internet spaceship killmails the instant u jump into a system get over itoh and way to ignore the whole post and therefore show your blatant selfishness and complete lack of credibility u want easy mode go back to wow u wanna cry about risk learn to handle it yourself without requiring your blob to protect u against one person pathetic
if they dont cloak they will just log off making suggested cooldown and fuel usage change completely obsolete there are other ways to catch them leave cloaks alone
youre probably right about the logoffski dealing with one problem would bring forward that old problem i wonder why macroers dont do the logoffski bit anymore they used to do it by default back in the dayif you know any ways please do let me know there is only one guy i know that was able to pull it off hes in your allianceanna ill admit im terrible at soloing ill say it out in the open if anyone is likely to screw up in a fleet itll be me still im the one that actually plays in nullsec and thus encounters this  on a regular basis  also i did read your entire first reply which is full of you talking out of your arsemimiru  another one with no killboard history to boot i can only judge people based on what is visible throughout statisticsseriously is it really too much to ask to get input from people with field experience
experience  skill and u just admitted it so u try 00 for so long yet u still fail at it and thats why u want easier killmails by making it easier to gank one defenseless ship well im sry that despite your selfproclaimed experience ure not able to comprehend the fact that afk cloaking is actually the least of your problems since u cant even take a loss from that one person so lemme break this down slowly for uthere r plenty of other fish in the sea learn to play move on and get your killmails from someone who wants to fightyes theres a 1 chance that u might gasp take a loss but guess what thats 00 htfu and maybe u wont have to wait forever in vain and end up crying about it in the forums speaking of which if u cant refute an argument dont bother proposing at all
hey annaplease come to the great wildlands have a fly around try to catch something report your findings okaynullsec is supposed to be risky needs to be defended its nullsec not highsec
so what ure saying is u cant catch  but if hes runninghiding then hes not attacking right so whats this problem u have about defending cause fyi thats npc space which means u have no sovereignty over it its not yours face it the only thing ure really defending is against a single loss on your precious little killboard so is hiding behind 100 to get a similar feeling of high sec still not safe enough for u against an army of one
wasting your time anna hes just a killmail  who cries and cries of tears over not getting that cloakyhe will not understand reasoning or rationality
aww but fail pirate tears r so delicious
for once which is rare i agree with you
there should be a change to local and cloacking together the whole concept of using a chatroom as an intelligence tool is just wrong changing it will unbalance cloaks and they will need to be adjusted maybe after local change we will have fights happening somewhere except for gates for a changeyou say nullsec must be defended but there currently is nothing to defend you just dock and wait for them to leave need some sort of targets that would force people to get their asses up and defend them make system uprades damageable or something today roaming is about going through 30 systems untill you hit a gatecamp and then it is a question of numbersor if defenders are feeling generous they might drop a supercap or two on your cruiser gang
yet you feel cloaks should be nerfed because they allow ships to hang out in your space giving you the heebiejeebiesnot supported
i think it should be possible though difficult even with max skills to scan down cloaked vessels even getting a faint signal without a lock can let you know approximately where to move to to get closer to the cloaked vessel once you get close enough you might be able to get a lockalso i think autolocal should be removed from nullsec perhaps a corporation or alliance could pay an upkeep to keep an updating local channel in a particular system and allow all alliance members and friendlies access to that channel while neutral and hostile players entering would be unable to tell how many are in the system the channel updater should also be destructible
supported it should cost isk though not plex isk also there should be a limit on it just like remaps other restrictions should apply as well
as long you dont mind huge surge of old characters being converted to titan pilots
this feature will either allow abuse or be useless not very productive in the entire lifetime of this char he has trained one skill branch that is not very useful and even then i would rather keep it just in case
you train up negotiation skills and suddenly your favorite highsec mission agent reach the effective quality threshold to reach into lowsec you train up afterburner and suddenly ab cycle is long enough that ab warp no longer saves you align timei feel so sorry for you for training a skill whose description and purpose is exactly what you complain aboutquestion comes in as why do you train them thendrones useless in pvebecause everything that is not sansha incursions or sleepers are getting the new ai what are you a time traveller or something coming from the far future by the time pve missions are changed to the new ai if they are going to be years will have passed and if a drone pilot who had basically three years to train about two months worth of skills didint well sucks to be stupid i guessas for mistake skills starting at level 1 you can have a good taste of what the skill is doing at worst youre gonna loose a week or two worth of training youd gain what 150k sp from it what are you gonna do with that and if you trained a whole lot of skills to v for something you hate then ill repeat myself sucks to be stupid and dont try to be witty saying but it got nerfed waaah waaaah there is only three scenarios possible  you trained something after knowing it was an exploit in the hope of getting an edge knowing full well it will be nerfed such as the nanophoon it will be made usefull again in a foreseable future once its fixed again or it simply isint as bad as you say it is simply because you dont even know what youre comparing it with the most classic case on the forum either way theres no real reason to refund itsp refunding wasnt ever brought up before ccp removed learning skills sp refunds have been maybe twice for a few hundread sps during extended downtimes gone wrong but thats itrefunding was never intended it has extremely limited usefullness barring exploiting or abusing it and it just overall smells of minmaxing epeen insecurity overall its a bad design ideaby the time youre done arguying over it you probably finished training up the equivalent of whatever amount youd gaini wonder how many sp in total across tranquility would get lost of hybridgallente skills if this were to become a reality  any betshybrids serves a purpose you might not like it but its still that
causing lowsec missions to spawn wasnt in the skill description as dev stated in general section post sleeper ai wont come to all pve right away the first partial incursion patch will only cover sansha incursion rats with sleeper ai implemented into other types only later on so there is still a few months to train up gun skills of course your existing drone sp will still be wasted due to game changes but you wont be left without without a means to fight as long as you keep current with the forums sp refunding was intended by ccp because ccp implemented it as in the past if enough people want it refunds will happen sp training is passive so forum arguments has no effect on it
i support the time limit but only to prevent griefing stolen accountsi like the idea i dont think ill ever do it myself but thats because im a purist and value each sp as much as the next one but people who want to try something new should definitely be allowed toim going for 1025 loss as you should maintain the majority of the sp but it should still come at a high enough cost that it wont be done frivolouslyi think there should also be a limit set that would allow a maximum of say 10 million sp to be redeemed per month that way when accounts get griefed or players make an irrational decision it wont hurt as much i think 10 million is plenty to redistribute into a new path of gameplay 25 million might also be reasonable since it can be done once a month a player putting 2 million a month into the same path theyre training will be training that path twice as fast overall
dont forget that sp gain is not standardised accross skillslets say you are completly specced into percwill you shouldnt be able to train a capital ship skill to v and get the refund of it to split amongst for exemple leadership or industry skillsas for refunding meant as a feature no it was meant as a dev toolalso drones are never useless and if negotiation got you into lowsec chances are that relationship from simply grinding missions for that agent would have eventually gotten you at a point where he would have started shipping you to lowsec anyway
and you didnt predict that among all those choices some would suit you more than others and you admit having a preference for specialization yet you never bothered to ask for advice in the corp chat or on this forum or yknow maybe just reading the damn manual and dont tell me you didnt know how or where you willingly subscribed to a massive multiplayer gameim sorry but youre the only one to blamethe last reason there should be sp reallocation is to patch up players mistakes youre not the only one who trained useless skills but training all factions up to battleships thats an epic failalso i would add that its your own damn problem if youre too stubborn to appreciate any of the gallente or faildari ships im an exclusive faildari pilot yet im perfectly aware that every factions have useful and worthwhile ships you have to be a terrible nitpicker for not appreciating a single ship from those factions
linkified linksdont tweak war decs  fixemoriginal proposal  locked  
perhaps the price should be based on how many members are in the corp that is declaring war that way larger corps have to pay more
not a good idea all the griefer corps are already 3 man corps supported by countless neutrr who are in other 3 man corps they are actually one large corp which use one ventts splintered into many small ones this is to maximize cheap 2mil decs
i believe or at least hope the focus is starting to shift from new features to building a solid game afaik incursion is one of the highestrated expansions put out so far although i think apocrypha comes in firstthe different camps will never be completely satisfied but it is also not good to focus on one side over the others during my term on the csm i feel they understood that pretty well and tried to make a mutuallybeneficial resolution such as the orca  ive seen pvpers use orcas to good effectdespite the mistakes theyve made in the past i believe ccp is the mmo company that cares the most about their players im not a fanboi nor completely satisfied but the actions they took with issues both during my term and thereafter tells me that they love and support their ip and the players that make it great
definitely agree  theres no solution that will make everyone happy its a complete impossibilitystill i think that we could find solutions that make a large portion of the player base in all different camps go hm well i guess its better than what we have i suppose i can live with iteveryone is driven by personal ego its not a surprise that many people would like to grind in peace but at the same time demand that everyone else should be fair game when he wants to gank them obviously its an unrealistic wish maybe im naive but id like to think that most people can step out of their comfort zone for long enough to try and look to the games best interest as a whole
no most people are casual gamers they arent serious about the gameonly the most hardcore eve followers can have serious opinions gamers that understand the game in and out and spend hours testing the productif there was some way to filter out the useless people and amplify voice of hardcore followers id be all for that
a concise and accurate description of the current state of eve
ccp listening to the players is what has progressively made the game worse imo nerf wardecsnerf suicidesboost amarrnerf nanonerf falconboost minmatardboost gaylenteenerfyou get the pointccp listened to the player base so if you dont like things blame yourselvespersonallyi would like to see ccp grow back the hair they once had on thier berries and tell people who dont like things that hellokittyonline is that way
maybe ccp could use some kind of threadnought where everyone states what he doesnt like about highlownullwhiskywhatever without telling ccp what to do about iti lately like to read posts who state what they dont like about game mechanics or where they see unbalance and step aside to let ccp figure out a way to deal with it read dont propose a fixnerfboostthere probably should be another forum besides featureideas to just bring up areas of the game that people dont like and what they dont like about themthe assembly hall could be used for this but most of the time its a featureidea forums with voting
that is why the thousand paper cut thread was born go add you two cents over there
the thousand papercuts are about specifics and details this is the absolute opposite  its about the overall game balance its mostly about safety vs profits in all different areas of eve and the side effects itll have what areas become attractive will pirates have anything to do will it be possible to make a competitive profit despite working in pirate infested areas and so on and so forth
bump
uhm just trying to see the point there why are you sitting around in a grav site waiting for toysoldier spawns surely there are better places to find a fightunless its becuase you are trying to secure the grav site so you can send in a squishy miner in this case im not really sure about the point i know a battleship miner has no problems at all dealing with it heck even a t1 covetor barge can deal  ive done it a hulk would easily manage worst case warp out when the rats come calling and send in a combat ship  like everywhere else drone handling is a pain in the arse but i guess ccp wanted it that way for mysterious reasonsif theres any issue with solo mining in wspace gravsites  id suggest its not the spawns but rather the way how the viability of solo mining especially in dangerous areas has been almost completely ignored by ccp since the release of the game
supported
they suck sometimes
ERROR
sounds decent not sure about the capabilities of the server and if the code allows it but supported nonetheless

seeing as more people fly titans this should be fixed that the black ops should be more widly flownafrom a couple threads i have read through and conducted i think peoples main concerns with the black ops are 3 different things does not warp cloaked like ever other ship that goes through a covert ops portal not enough jump range not a big enough fuel bay as to not require an alt with a cover hauleri think any of one of these things mainly jump range would make this ship a bit more popularragepeace through power
ill take any one of thesesupported
pls continue futher in the back op topic that has been running for 14 months and still not a single sighn of ccp that they are working on it
retribution does absurd amounts of damage at close range and way more damage than any other t2 frigate at skimish range 17km while being able to swap between those two roles on a whim it can do all this and have way more tank at the same time than pretty much any other t2 frigate retribution is the best assault frigate in any situation where you dont need a point eg when youre not solo or playing a bad interceptor in gangs
the retribution is certainly an oddity among the assault ships and its tempting to fix it still im not sure its necessary if we operate under the assumption that all afs should be able to operate as tacklers or solo fighters then yeah it makes senseon the flip side though the retribution is a lovely ship in its own right assuming you use it where it makes sense  as a cheap source of dps and tough as nails to boot its great to fend off pirates if you are ok with the pirates escaping with their lives its a great ship for any kind of fleet warfarei kind of both want to sign and unsign at the same time is it necessary for us that all assault fighters can take on the role as a solo ship
not sure i agreeyes it does go very good damage however its not that much better than a wolf in fact i would say its dps is lower than a wolf when you factor in damage types while a wolf is able to loaf fusion or titanium sabot to take down explosive and kinetic resists the only think ret puts out is em and thermalsecondly while it does have good skirmish range its at the cost of damage sure with conflag at 5km its a beast but at 15km with scorch its really not that fantastic high but not too high also to mount face melting dps comes at the cost of a buffer tank because high powered guns and damage mods soak up grid and low slot respectively and b using high damage crystalsguns makes your active tank suffer seriously personally i think it would be fine ret would still suffer from slow speeds lack of other damage types and running tackle would further inhibit cap well it sure seems odd to me that ccp would make 78 of them soloable then just leave on glaringly unable to i can understand your points but in my opinion it should at least have the option as as its already been pointed out 999 of other combat ships havea second mid for at least the capability of being flown solo cheerspapa
only thing wrong with the ret is the lack of a 5th turret and the fittings to fit it
not supported unless its1 low1 high1 midstop homogenizing eve
you think thats stupid take a look at the amarr destoryer too lolz
gonna give this idea a big  noamarr does not have to be the best race in every ing ship class that and the retribution needs that high slot for nos you make it sound like its a gimp ship and its not leave the retribution alone ffs
for all intents and purposes yes the only gun af that does not conform with it is the jaguar  but since they had to create two gun platforms for the minmatar i guess some toes had to be cut for the shoe to fitlook at them again gun afs have damagerange bonus 1 low compared to the destroyers and comparable damage it is accurate all the way down to the token drone of the enyo but it is probably just a freaky coincidence so in your own words active tankers gain nothing while you hand the buffer crowd a tackle slot wonder how that will affect the way it will be fittedutility highs may not have as much crap that fits in them but they are just as useful a mids
i consider the retribution to be one of the best afs out there for its role which is antidrone and antifrigate theyre tanky little things that are quite hard to take down feature good damage projection compared to other ships of their class and have high dps to boot theyre even capable of being pretty quick considering theyre amarr ships tackle is the only thing they cant do well but thats why you dont run a single retri on its own they might not be the best at any one of those things but theyre good at all of them which makes them a wellrounded and dangerous platformthe retribution is fine as it is in my opinion its one of the few assault frigates that lives up to the name assault frigate
we need a way to tell that the client got our command and tries to send it to the server this might also solve as a way to alleviate server stress in fleet fights as some people dont try to push even more commands onto the que though i have no idea how the server handles command requests by the clientshere are some examples what im talking aboutyou activate the overheating of a module but the icon doesnt show that it got your command until the server did activate it serverside and did send your client the info that its activated now if there is lag you can deactivate the overheat again or reactivate it and burn your modulesyou activate the cloak at the incoming gate after giving your ship the command to move the icon of the cloak does only show its been activated when the server actually did it serverside and told your client about it if there is lag you can accidentally deactivate the cloak againyou activate your guns in a laggy situation fleetfight but get no response as the server doesnt have had time yet to activate them serverside you activate your guns again and add to the pile of commands the server has to chew through but still got no idea about your client getting that you want that gun activatedideas give us a little in progress icon make activated icons distinguishable from notactivated ones by flashing blue or white make activated icons distinguishable from notactivated ones by keeping them recessed and not popping back uptldricons resembling toggleswitch functions should not act like pushbuttons
that would be nice the quick answer would be to make the interface most people use in fleet fights to track commands sent popup automaticly when the server cpu reaches a set zone or if the ping to the server gets to highit might need to be reworked so it looks better i have never pulled it up its like a 4 button combo ot activateso you know why your modules are not reacting as fast as they should working around the 1 second tic of the server makes module response work diffrently then if you are operating a fast twitch game

i like that direction maybe ccp can think of some new way of finding resources for gathering that would require some human interaction  something like scanning when will we see those comets we heard about for such a long time something like gas mining but without the boring part of spending half an hour on site the new sites could replace the old gravimetricsthose sites would obviously had too reappear in new place after mined like other miniprofession sites and the ammount of minerals avaible on active sites have to corespond with amount of minerals avaible on asteroid fields so a lot of sites that have significant yield in short timethe fun part would be the fact that when a lot of players mine in one system it would shortly be depleted from resources so miners have to move to next system and next system since the site respawns in different systemit would all come to calculating rewardtime ration of current mining so it is unchanged or higher since it may reduce botting hopefully lets say that today it takes 1 hours to mine 20m worth of mins for the sake of argument i dont know the real isk value for miningso if a player would have to spend 510 minutes to find a site and than only 1520 minutes on site itself he should make something close to 10msince scanners can find sites in like 30 seconds it happens often with 7probe scanning the would have to be some twist for finding those sites maybe instead of scaning to 100 you can only scan to theoretical 100 warp to 0km launch some mining scanner that would have some 2 minutes or so scaning time to get the actual site location it would also add the thrill of racing with other miners to get to the site fastthere are a lot of complications with this  the problem with scanning of those sites by miners with combat probes on the other hand why not with huge yield before they get to the site you can have half or so mined and there can be sig radius reduction while on site maybe to make it harder  problem with getting today miners to suddenly learn new skills just so they can mine maybe mining probe would be available using today mining skills they would still have to learn scanning but they could just get bms to theoretical 100 from friendly scanning player on day one  and many more some that i dont even realise yet pwow and i planed it for a short response but got carried away with this idea pwell i dont remember them saying its a passive income pwith incursion you will be able to set up 2 week internals thats pretty passive

this could definitely bring more player corps into lowsec from a storyline stand point it could be as simple as concord has agreed to extend protection to those that are willing to help support the operation fees would be a sliding scale based on how far into lowsec the corp wants to go
i do like some aspects of the idea
so how about we create a bookmark then edit the coordinatesor even better a warp to coordinates feature where we just type in random numbers
ok science aside lets talk real gameplay if you want true physics to run the game well its not that game pfirst of all this idea of strategic bookmarking is totally missed since you can bookmark in mid warpsecond ability to warp to few au from target warp x kmau at the aligned direction and so on  disturbs delicate balance of today mechanic of of flying bookmarking and finding other players and escaping pursue bookmarking ccp clearly stated that they dont want bookamrks far away in space they even moved all bookmarks that where more than 20 au from last warpable objects to exactly 20au if you can warp in any direction even a short distance you can just keep pushing the distance further and further from system  today players have to make safe spots to be more safe from others its simply dont require any sophisticated knowledge to start with other players can look for them either by scanning probes or directional scanner if a player didnt make a bms in system before he got attacked he is put in disadvantage since all he can do to escape is warp to other warpable object that can already be camped it fits nicely into eve reality and requires players to prepare before ratting in unsafe system and escaping itself now to be able to warp away quick you have to aling to something or in general direction of something to begin with if you are not aligned to some escape object like station gate bm or something than you pretty much always flying most of the time at full speed maybe orbiting at full speed or approaching enemy player or rat when you decide its time to flee you have to spend time aligning to escape with warp in aligned direction it would pretty much be a big red button with press to escape label on it

i love this ideabalance the changes so that hybrids suck just like they do nowbut you can switch between a sniping and short range dps just by changing amo not refiting a shipthat way you get all the penalties of all weapon systems just like you do now but you also have a 2in1 weapon system which creates unique tactics and is completely diferent from any other weapons
and heres yet another good way to fix hybrids if youre reading this and the other posts about blasters and rails ccp there are plenty of options for how to fix hybrids just choose one please

ive found the solution for me instead of waiting im starting to crosstrain minmatarin fact gallente race shipsweapons is the tutorial of eveit shows you what you should never do in the game train for them
make derm biggar
agreed i love the idea behind the ships close quick and whammy however that is not what we get out of our blaster boats supported
yes i do agree that gallente ships need a boost and a hybrid fix but i dont agree with all your ideas1 yes this is awesome idea 2 nothis would affect all ships that armor tank ammar dont need a boost personally i would like to see the armor tanking bonus changed to an armor amount per level this would affect the brutix myrm hyperion astarte3 imo gallente dont need a base speed boost they need a mass reduction that way when you use a mwd with armor plates you will still beable to go fast
wrongcorrect because theyre way underpoweredwrong when was the last time you saw a fleet megathron people are discouraged training for the nyx in favor of the aeon due to its lack of ehp the myrmidon is rarely used outside of pve and the incursus is outclassed so heavily by a rifter its not even funnyso come back in two years after you have more experience flying various ships and claim gallente arent underpowered then youre somewhat right about drakes but thats because a drake is a dumb mouthbreathing brick with insane tanking ability but it suffers heavily in other roles
as far as 2 goes amarr would still be some of the slowest ships so removing the armor rig penalty really wouldnt change all that much since relatively theyd still be behind the other races except maybe caldari an armor tanked harbinger is still not going to catch up to an armor tanked hurricane if this change went through at least id hope not and as far as reducing mass im fine with whatever puts the blaster boats over the top as far as speed goes but if we keep the armor rig penalty as is theyll always be inferior because the penalty will hurt even more the faster the ships go
hmm in that case i could see the penilty being split between agility and speed so base for rigs would be 5 to agility and 5 to speed that way with skills at v you get a 25 reduction in speedagility per rig so now 2 rigs  1 old rig in max speed reduction
good points op i just hope these can be taken to heart and implemented in some fashion time will tell i suppose but it appears itll be later rather than sooner
another thousand posts about gallentehybrid fixi support

some good ideas some bad main issue with gallente is hybrids though
yes and no hybrids are indeed a big issue mainly the tracking at close ranges which prevents the ships themselves from outperforming others even when theyre right in the exact sweet spot of their optimal ranges ie webscram range but even if we fixed those issues the speed issue would remain i fly gallente ships exclusively in gangs of all sizes and ive gone through these problems first hand with perfect skills and no implants and nothing but a mwd fitted the gallente bc line all the bc lines go the same speed with their mwds on regardless of tier goes 1112ms this is without armor rigs or any kind of plates at all the caldari bc line goes 1038ms sounds like a reasonable difference on its face right lets add one armor rig to the gallente bc instantly the gallente bc goes down to 1057ms anyone whos flown an armor tanked ship knows that you cant really tank it properly without 3 armor rigs so lets add two more rigs this brings the gallente bc down to 982ms this is well below even the caldari bc line and right off the bat we know one thing unless the gallente bc lands right on top of the caldari bc it can never catch itfor the sake of argument lets go down this road farther lets say the armor rigs we put on are for active repping but we need a fleet setup so we switch to trimarks to give our ship a usable buffer tank still the same stats that we had for the active repped bc but now lets add a 1600mm plate instantly our speed goes down to 872ms try catching a drake now even worse try catching a harbinger or a prophecy which actually have better base speed than both gallente and caldari bcs  and just as an aside with 3 eanms and a 1600mm plate going that speed the myrm only gets 80k ehp with max skills you can add another 1600mm plate to push it up over 100k ehp but then you have no slots for mag stabs or gyros however you fit your myrm or tracking enhancers or anything like that and no pg left over for medium guns after you fit the second 1600mm plate on sure youve got ewar slots in the mids but what does that matter when you cant even get close enough to another ship to apply your dps and this is for a myrmidon forget about getting decent ewar on a brutixall this would still be ok if the weapon systems available could project damage and the ewar could help make the ship usable but in the case of the brutix even neutrons barely take you past scrambler range with antimatter ammo so we have incredibly slow ships designed to use the weapons with the worst range trying to catch ships that have to make no compromises between tank dps and speed even if you fit autos on your myrm why would you fly it when you can just fly a hurricane which is faster and can get better dps without sacrificing tanktry fighting a drake with a myrm if you land 20km off firstly you cant catch him because if you armor tanked your myrm like you should youre at a disadvantage in speed secondly your tank is worse than his if he fit properly assuming buffer tanks thirdly youre doing less dps than he is if hes ham fit which if this is a solo fight i would hope he would be if you swap out the myrm for a dual rep active tank youre still slower than he is though by a less margin than the plate and you have a better tank but guess what your tank is only as good as long as you have navy 800 cap boosters if you cant web and scram the drake you cant apply full dps to him add to that more than half of your dps is drones which are easy to kill especially with missiles this is just a solo situation extrapolate this to fleet warfare and you can see why gallente ships are left in the dust the only way we could fix this problem without altering the speed of gallente ships is to give blasters with null a longer range than lasers with scorch which kills variety in the game
this makes sence to me why not
i could support this if the price was lower but as it stands now there is absolutely no reason anybody would do this i figure a 11 ratio to train one character or 21 to train all 3 simple and ccp winds up with more money in their pockets winwinedit marked the support box
wellyou could train the character on a separate account and then later after you have finished the training transfer it to the primary accountbut somehow i dont think you approve of that
the transfer fees amount to way more expenseproposal supported

i guess you cant take the last one off the list until you have new forums that make the old ones archivable or are you talking about something else it has been stated that the old forums will remain available but with no added features once the 18th hits you can update the list
edit having just watched the current live stream mention was made of this option for incarna it seems that ccp are willing to consider such a choice if there is enough support for it so im bumping this thread back into viewhaving just spent a good hour messing around on the new carbon character creator on sisi it struck me that we can change virtually every aspect of our physical appearance except our heightnow since ccp have worked hard to achieve a sense of realism with this new piece of software it strikes me as short sighted to not include a variable for height after all i can walk 5 minutes up my street and meet 30 people all of varying stature now i am aware that ccp do not want people to go crazy with an idea like this and making characters that are 2 foot high and 6 feet wide or similarly ones who are 17 feet high and 2 feet widewhat i propose is a max height differential of 1 foot now i realise that doesnt sound much but it should suffice to give a more realistic range of heights the minimum height would be locked at 5 feet and 5 inches going to a locked maximum of 6 feet and 5 inches im aware that this doesnt cover anywhere near the range of real life but i feel it would be much more realistic than the current limitationsthe difference in height could be increased or decreased in 2 inch increments giving 7 differing height values for each character or if thats not enough then perhaps 1 inch increments could be employed hopefully a change such as this would appease the players who like to be as unique as possible without providing too much extra work for ccp to carry outplease vote as you see fit hopefully i dont get flamed into oblivion

really this is a nobrainer i dont buy ccps excuses about this particular feature its better to have it in there even if its minimal than to not have it at all its unacceptable to have everyone at the exact same height especially in a supposedly nextgen game
supported females characters should usually be shorter than males ect height is an important dynamic
oh i would so love to read the answer to a petition covering thisby design is what it would most likely sayand from behind the office doors would travel a voice why the hell didnt we think of thatregards lax
they thought of it and decided against it its not like it is a secret and people have been upset about it since it was announced iirc the reason given was something like height variations would require a much more complex animation system and extra work we think those resources are better spent elsewhere males will be bigger than females thoughill still support this since even limited height variation would be a nice thing to have
im struggling to see how this could be a problem i certainly cant see how it would cause any issues with animation it is simply amtter of scaling think of it almost as a zoom function the animation should not need to be tweaked and surely if women and men are different heights already then the ability to change scale and keep things consistent already existsthe original issue that ccp had and please correct me if im wrong was that people were asking for a massive range of different heights ranging from the very small to the stupidly huge such massive differences would of course lead to animations for walking and environment interaction needing a total overhaul and thus a great deal of extra work i cannot see how a 1 foot height differential could lead to the same issuesclearly skeletalmusculature resizing whilst keeping proportions relative is possible as you can already do this on the version available on sisi if you increase the characters weight everything else scales along with it if you move the positioning of the hips the posterior and adjoining musculature shifts as well why then when such subtle changes are possible and we are talking fractions of a millimetre here is it so hard to implement an incremental height change
you should be able to change height not width as long as it stays realistic

i am not the only player who thinks information is too readily available to the masses between kill mails local and the map statistics it is actually a challenge to be an unknown quantityso what i aim to do here is effectively remove easy passive intel methodology there have been numerous ideas fronted about how to do this but nobody has addressed the secondary issues that will arise such as dscan being relatively cumbersome and myopic by design probe mechanics lack of effective system control tools station situational awareness or lack thereof and the way the tactical grid worksthe goals of this thread are as followsremove local as an intelligence toolremove killmails potentially replacing it with a less information loaded systemlessen the immediate accuracy of map statisticsfix dscan or replace with something elseadjust probing mechanicsintroduce a more active method of sovereignty system port controllessen the absolute effects of cloaking devices possibly by introducing a decloaking module for ships that can use covert cloaksincrease situational awareness while dockedlets start with killmails killmails and killboards have been around for as long as ive been playing and they have only gotten more accurate and informative possible solutions could be removal of kill mails entirely or reduction in the amount of information they supply to merely the who where and what ships no fitting information should be in these mails let that be a mystery to be solved by loot im personally for the removal of them entirely since they only promote carebear pvp aka blobbing and hotdropppinglocal is a tougher sell while everyone agrees on principle that local needs to be changed rarely are actual solutions unanimously accepted this is typically because other game mechanics need adjustment and players in general never figure out that more than one thing can be changed at a time i personally think local needs to be delayed requiring you to speak before you show up in itmap statistics can be helpful but certain information can actually reveal too much the only things map statistics should show is average number of pilots within the last 24 hrs and average number of ships destroyed within the last 24 hrs any more info than that and you cross into the realm of being able to local analyze a system without ever jumping into itthe directional scanner is a relic that has never actually been an effectively useful tool other than for some niche uses the main problem is the range i propose that a ships sensor strength determines the range of dscan this also allows larger and slower ships more warning that trouble is coming if your sensor strength is 33 your dscan range is 33 au dscan should be added to the overview window as a seperate tab dscan will refresh automatically every 5 seconds when it is the active tab or at will when player clicks the refresh button overview and dscan are mutually exclusive only one will function at a time and that is determined by a toggleprobes no longer provide a bm instead you find a target using dscan select it and activate the probe launcher the probe will have a chance similar to how ecm works now to track or lose a target the sensor strength and signature radius will impact success differently if the probe locks on it launches and becomes an entity that the owner can warp to similar to warp to fleet member the probe will chase the target till the target exits system or the probe duration ends probes are vulnerable to ecm burstsremoving local will create a need for a more proactive means of controlling access to sovereign systemsport of entry towerpos style tower needing fuel and having half the fittings of a normal tower this tower can only be anchored in sovereign systems 100 km from a stargate or outpost the tower can only support weapon and ew structures and has no bubblecontinued
as a rule cloaking in eve is fine it is the utter lack of anti cloaking tools that is the problem however the paranoia surrounding the afk cloaker infection will cease to be a problem with the other changes listed in this compendium yet there is still a definable need for a way to actively counter a cloaking device on grid most people think there should be a way to deactivate a cloak but i have another thought on thatlightwave distortion rectifier arraycan only be used by ships that can fit covert ops cloaks has small medium and large versions large being unused until the advent of bs cov ops the module does heat damage to all cloaking devices that are active within the aoe similar to overheating and subject to heat damage reduction effects excluding thermodynamics skill ldras will damage any other fitted ldras within range same ship includedduration small 5 s medium 10 s large 20 sheat damage 100 200 400radius 15 km 30 km 60 kmcpu 10000 reduced by role bonusespg 10 100 1000situational awareness when docked at a station needs to be adjusted not because players prepared outside of a station shouldnt be able to camp it but because undocking into a complete unknown should not need to happen allow a 250 km dscan inside the station this will give a docked player an idea what is outside but not who or why

currently the skill marginal trading allows people to put up buy orders on the market without having the full amount of isk to cover it this is a very useful skill when say the minimum amount to buy is in increments of one or two items at a time allowing the trader to invest money elsewhere at the same time to develop a good incomein no way do i want this aspect changed except for one thing if the buyer does not have the isk to cover the minimum buy amount their buy order should not appear on the market until they have the money to cover a minimum buy amount so if a buyer puts up a buy amount for five hundred items and then turns around and empties their wallet the buy order will immediately disappear until enough money to cover a minimum buy amount is back in the walletcurrently people are abusing this skill in what is still being investigated as an exploit they put up for sale about a thousand items of something at a high price then turn around and somewhere about ten jumps away with an alt put up a buy order for the same item but they have a minimum buy amount at almost the amount of what is being sold elsewhere in the region they immediately zero out their wallet on the account that has the buy order so when the seller goes to sell to the buy order it glitches out and the buy order vanishesnow any heavy market trader can see the same item being sold for a high price and then being bought up for an even higher price and have reservations but it is impossible to know if the buy order is for a scam or a legitimate one on contract scams you can carefully look and see what you are getting with this it is impossible now i fully expect those who use and endorse abusing this glitchscamexploit to come running in here and rallying their friends to derail it but i am hoping the realistic market traders will give support to this changesome arguments will be that the person putting up the buy order is losing isk in the brokers fees and such in all actuality it is negligible at best another argument will be that the person will simply wait for what they are selling to sell and then immediately cancel their buy order that means they have to actually be logged in and paying attention whereas the current glitch is a fire and forget scam risking virtually nothing and abusing a mechanic that the seller has no way of knowing it is real or fake buy orderi look forward to the comments and rage from the exploiterstldr  if you dont have enough isk in your wallet to cover the minimum amount in a buy order the buy order immediately disappears
i concur

i dont support this change for three reasons although im not adamantly opposed to it either on the condition that the checks dont cause much stress to the servers no reason to make the gameplay experience worse for all because of the ignorance and greed of few now on to my reasoning for objecting to this changefirstly i dont care for the fact that the server has to continually monitor peoples wallet and compare it to their market orders to achieve this and they will have to do this for every person who has trained the margin traiding skill and every trader and many other characters will have it seems like a lot of unnecessary work for the servers for almost nonexistant benefit bad way to use limited resources in my oppinionsecondly your money isnt being stolen with this the fact remains that if they cant cover the trade you get to keep your items you bought for a price you deemed acceptable you cant lose anything in the actual trade what it does is exploit the greedand bots of people to make them blind to the actual value of an item by dangling the possiblity of easy money in front of their faces you still have the items though so you can still sell them on to othersthirdly there is a user based solution to this issue this is because the scam is partly based on abusing your ignorance about the value of the item this is basicly just saying to the initial buyer that there is another customer willing to pay even more for it so it is totally worth the nonsensical price the solution becomes obvious if you dont know the actual value of an item dont do trades with it if the item is commonly traded or you know its value you cant be fooled by such simple tacticsnot supported and strongly against it if the extra server load caused by this is anything but minisculeedithow exactly do you see the negative wallet thing working in practice i think you end up either shooting a fly with a cannon or creating a super man eating mutant fly if you just put them in to negative you will heavily punish the scammer for something that is allowed by the rules of the game if this scam is the problem and deemed as unwanted exploitation then surely the solution should just be to fix the exploit part of the mechanism on the other hand if the intent is to pay the seller from nonexisting money supply as in create the isk from nothing you create a much bigger problem you just made it possible to create isk out of nothing either way you cut it if you still allow the exploitation mechanic to happen its not really a fix to the exploitation problem is it
i would like to comment on this statementignorance what ignorance please enlighten the rest of us on how you are able to look at a buy order and know for a fact if the person who has the buy order up has enough money to cover itgreed someone puts up a buy order that says hi i need 50 t2 cap recharge and i want to pay 600000 isk for them so a person comes along taking time to move said cap rechargers to the location to fill the order and you are saying that guy is being greedy on what groundsnews flash the server already monitors everyones wallet so your doomsday day theory for the servers are irrelevantjust like people who lose a ship and claim because they mined the minerals for it it was free so they are not upset your statement is incorrect you lose time any business person will tell you time is money so moving goods to a station with a bogus buy order cost you the time which means it cost you moneywhere to begin with this one if someone is willing to pay a lot more there is several legitimate reasons they might have one is they might need the items immediately for something another is maybe they are predicting it will become extremely valuable soon you are making the assumption that if they are willing to pay top isk for something it is always a scam which is nonsensenegative wallet was not part of what the op is proposing
i agree even with margin trading a buy order should not appear unless there are enough funds to cover the minimum buy quantity
in case this was for memeh youre right i just scrapped two tries to argue against that and it always ends in exploitable mechanics or no use at all
fyi query order button would use almost no db resources because you are targeting a single orderid when requesting something from a db by a single address look up it takes almost no resources the wallet lookup is also a minimal single address lookup evemon uses it in massive massive amounts bottom line query order from the market browser window while in the same region as the order would take almost no resources and would solve the blind trader exploitglitchscam that this original post addresses while adding a fun human interactive aspect to the gameregarding the remove order trading fishing as i like to call it this is almost okay but that brings up a wholenother bag of bones think of how a player is removed from a corp they have to wait a market order should be the same way an order can be canceled immediately within the first hour of creating it but cancel the order after that and a 1 hour countdown timer starts for the order to cancel i think 1 hour is sufficient for scammers to get their jollies off given the right circumstances but also makes the game a little more even in the whole yinyang thing placing buy orders would then be more like placing a contract in the sense that you really have to pay attention when typing prices i digress from that until a later dateno multiple wallets or trading wallets with the red that would just be a nightmare and confusing to players that were legit i can already see the helpdesk light up with hey where did my assets go i didnt mean to argghhh ahhh loli think we are pretty much on the same page but i liked to post all the options so we can see the bad ones with the really good ones that make eve a better game for all

i dont think it makes sense to go through these convolutions since the only way to get the result the op desires is to remove the margin trading skill altogetherthe whole idea of margin trading is to leverage large trades using minimal isk there are high volume traders that use this mechanic to play the game negating all 10 of my orders while liquid isk is moving in another system will cripple this toolccp implemented margin trading for a reason the op assumes that the only purpose of margin trading is to scam which is not the case in the first para of his post he tries to explain how it works and in the second he says he wouldnt change anything except make it not workcreating all kinds of cheetahflip mechanics in a pointless attempt to descam a game mechanic is a waste of time and energy until ccp comes up on the net and says margin trading was a mistake and were removing it a la learning skills then this mechanic is working as intendedas stated abovethere is no scam involved in the problem nobody loses anythingthe person attempting to move items gets to keep the hardware to sell somewhere else and the person posting the trade is out only the broker fees if the person attempting to move the items knows their value he wont purchase overpriced or under traded items its all about doing homework before jumping into a limited time offer call now tradekb
wrong the result i desire was if the person placing the buy order does not have enough isk to cover the minimum amount he wants to buy the buy order is automatically cancelled stop changingspinning my wordsa simple solution to this is to cancel your highest bid order on an item to lower the total minimum buy order amount if you zero out your entire wallet why i honestly cant think of a reason anyone would do this unless they are hoping for the bugscamexploit to happen all your orders would cancel because your broke and can not pay for anything you said you wouldalso by cancelling the largest isk wise on your buy orders is easier to keep track of instead of starting with the smallest ones if you are a legitimate trader than there really is no issue here unless of course your hoping to have your order cancelled in which case a right click  delete works fine tooagain your putting words in my mouth i never said anything of the sort that the skill is only to scam the chance would only affect those who willingly decided to go broke all of the sudden so please stop trying to derail my proposal by lyingi think you are trying too hard here there are many things in this game that do not work properly and to state unless ccp says otherwise it is working as intended like it is the law is being very obtusethe person that attempted to do the sale loses time like i said earlier time equals money do you deny thisim sorry if this proposal goes against the good thing you have going but raising all kinds of fake red flags and shouting the end of the world for trading because of this change is very transparent thanks for playing
because the armor resist hole was moved from thermal to explosive then nano ships were nerfed then drones were nerfed then webs were nerfed then projectiles were buffed basically the gallente ships and weapons systems have remained static whilst the rest of the game has evolved around them and now they are utterly obsolete
supportedthe only good use i could find for the hype was as a mining ship
this doesnt seem to bother other people anything like it did to meas ive said elsewhere its more a matter of being treated as im accustomed to by other non gaming companies but perhaps i shouldnt have that expectation im really not that concerned about the sp just dont like the way it went down as a matter of principal especially the presenting the gift as a free remap  and pretending like they dont understand the value differential or that there were simple fairer ways of doing itand still can be correctedooops sliding into the gripe modeif this is what people expect as par for the road and dont see it any differently than a game mechanic adjustment done for the good of the game that effects players differently well ill just readjust my thinking still  i wish the communications were different
i love nosneuts however unlike all other unconventional weapons in eve there is no counter i propose a new low slot module that would reduce the effectiveness of nosneuts and would maintain a small amount of cap for the ship no matter how many nosneuts are being used on it i would also like to see the effectiveness of the module tied to the energy management skill heres just some rough numbersmeta lvl  nosneut effect  cap protection 1  50  5 2  55  75 3  60  10 4  65  125 5 t2  70  15again just rough numbers and would still like to see energy management skill get worked in there somewhere and i think fitting requiremets should be similar to damage control so there arent a bunch of different sizes required and it can easily be fit on frigates and cruisersonly one module could be fit like damage control making it a lowslot module means players would have to sacrifice a tank or damage mod to protect the precious capacitorideas comments suggestions welcome trolls take a 
support one of the reasons that neut is the most used form of ew is that unlike other types it has no opposing mod specifically countering it sensor dampner has sensor booster ecm has eccm etc stats will need to be balanced but such a mod should exist
i could support this as long as it does not work on capital ships
no absolutely no cap protection on capital ships have you ever tried to kill the cap on a thanatos it already takes foreverthis mod would have to be restricted to subcapitals only
its called cap boosters
take your recruiting attempt to the recruiting thread dont post it here

i have a better idea bring back old school nos
i am all for fixing hybrids but i have not a clue what a hybird is can it fly
only for a short amount of time if you drop it in orbit over a planet from your cargo hold
interesting enough sig res of guns has no ewar that negatively affects them but tracking comps affect the direct tracking of guns so in a way haveing a reduced sig res for guns will help hybrids against tracking disruptersthough i heard that if they balanced out the optimal range and falloff on blasters so that both would be 50 of max range this would help them out a whole lot which would negate having to give blasters a tracking boost though i still think a reduced sig res is a neat way to increase chance to hit
last time i checked the apoc can reach out just as far with more dps then the rohk and the apoc is more agileas far as boosting raw dps then you end up with a kintherm beam with worse tracking and reload timeswhy dont you go and get a basic understanding of the bs sniping platformsif you did you would already know that you need 15 rohks to match the dps of 10 apoc snipershow ever if you inc there tracking they would make a good middle ground gunnery platform for fighting in mid range reather then inc the dps for a kintherm beam ripoffedit think about that right now if i run into a hybird bs with my bs i go for mid range why becouse its out of blasters good damg range and under rails good damg tracking range also if they were good at mid range fighting the lower dps and alph and other drawbacks would make more logic right now they have all this drawbacks but no good reason for themalso range dont prevent the loading of fraction ammo i dont know why you think it would rohk 10 to hybird opt per level is right close to apoc 75 opt perlevel becouse beams have a longer base opt to start withedit as for the sniping caldire at least they have sniping missil boats that are not fail so long as there is not overpowering missil defence going on there gold amarrs gold and mins are gold galente just have to roll over with failrails and drone sniping lolz
yea now that you mention the ferox does have this bonus to hybirds opt range on med hybirds but med projectiles get out to the same range hit harder track faster capless with better ammo options and lower fitings costfunny thati cant belive your pointing to the deimos as a working blaster cruiser at least we still have the astartei too give you a 210 sir
hey clusterthere is a ton of forum and response on the idea for the modular posim not sure if anyone has done it already but i started a survey to act as a partition then we have a real asset towards getting this idea into the game along with supporting this topic i think we could get real responseyou can do the partitionsurvey at

i fixed your links so they no longer go to nullanyway i think this is a great idea and how the forums should be
hello allive been working on the market and one thing ive noticed is that while you can change the price of items you already have an order on the market for you cannot add more of those items to the order we should be able to change this on the modify order screenfor example i have a sell order up for vm15 invulnerability fields and after running a few missions i get a couple more at this point i could either offer both for the same price in separate orders undercut myself or wait until the items sell with the modify orders screen i could add the other two to the already existent order paying the appropriate costs and not fill up another sell order
isnt that what hi sec pve is mostly about 610
okay remove insurance for the gankers so you can have your realism also remove concord if there are no witnesses or do not have time to dial out to concord as soon as you enter mission deadspace you are in deadspace if someone does not tell on you for what you did then you get away with it the victims clone has no memory of it happeningproviding no one snitches then you have a free gank without concord intervention and are now also able to keep your shipsometimes murderers get away insurance wont pay out to a ganker who lost his ship to concord if you manage to contact concord before you lose your shippod while in deadspace
and when they dont get away they get hunted for life and cannot show their faces your realism fails 010were talking about filling a loophole thats destroying the deadspace mods sector of the economy to bring it back into balance and prevent mudflation internet spaceships dont have to be realistic
actually nugget i was responding to someones complaint about realism and insurance what i would prefer is everything to stay how it is there are many ways to prevent a gank i have been a part of themand we did not always get to kill the guys we were aiming fornot because we were not effective it was because they figured out a way to stop it from happeningnugget906does not run missions or gankfail alt troll 10 months old 0 standings
1 100 risk of losing your ship when u suicide gank with it 100 sure is steeper than low sec00 and it wont stop either even if this goes through and when u finally realize that ull just continuously cry for more nerfs instead of adapting unless it stops completely weve adapted and u havent so aint gonna happen2 i never asked for a complete spreadsheet did i no i didnt i asked for proof and urehes the one with the burden of proof so either put up or shut up3 captializing on ppls stupidity in not safeguarding their assets is not a loopholeits social darwinism and all it hinges on is your own unwillingness to adapt4 fyi hulk ganking is not for profit but thx for trying5 if no one loses it no ones gonna have to replace it demand plummets and then the prices no difference than if ppl kept everything without having to replace it at all only now 1000 alts can hide easier to avoid a battle they dont want to risk even one loss to6 if anything is damaging on the economy its the mineral faucet

i think almost all frigs need a buff and dramiel speed needs a small nerfretribution cant pvppunisher is nice but rifter is considered superiorrockets dont seem good on frigsto be honest i think the only good frigs are minmatargallente to begin with
thorax with 1x 800mm plate and 3x armor pumps goes at 1184ms with a mwdmachariel with 3x 1600mm plates and 3x armor pumps goes at 1267ms with a mwd
speed should be closer to that of interceptors kind of ridiculous that you cant keep up with them much less catch them  not as if a speed fitted inty will survive long against one the blasted thingsand how many got away or killed you instead or are you using some gimmick bait ship not supported as i do not see the speed as the main issue with the dramiel or any of the angels for that matter problem is that fitting room is too lenient on them and allows them to surpass everything else in their respective classes by a huge margin
so let me get this straighteveryone supprting a dramiel nerf is afraid of someone with perfect navigation skill with the absolute best faction mods and the best implants you know what im afraid of that person or i want to be their best friend too but not because of a dramielhell i could possibly build a dramiel that could conceivably go 93k ms and have an ehp even damage distrobution of 48k but that is with the absolute best equipment implants and over heating does anyone think that i or most other people could hit anything with 2 small projectiles and maybe a missile launcher youd have to time that thing very wellwhat kind of orbit radius would you be able to get at those speeds without perfect skills i doubt it would be good enough to do much damageso i just dont get the hysteria
it is absolutely wrong to judge ships effectiveness on how many times it gets away i can grab a shuttle and be invulnerable in empire or covert ops frig and be nearinvulnerable in null sec that doesnt mean those ships are overpoweredi was using sniper loki2 dramiels got killed cause they were dumb enough to sit still 0 traverse 1 at the gate 1 at jump bridgeother 3 were ones that tried to tackle me from 30 km awaydramiel is an elite ship it is supposed to be good it is supposed to be better than other ships of same size just like a supercarrieris so much better than a carrier or dread the dramiel is much better than a t2 intyif we allow existence of extremely powerful expensive ships such as nyx why wouldnt we allow an equivalent on frigate scale it is wrong to cater only to the blob small scale fighting needs perks toothe only problem here is the price which is too low right now price should be balanced against performance same way with battlecruisers  they are too cheap for the great performance they provide
you got it wrong if only what you say was the case then there would be no problem it would be on par with the other pirate frigates which only really start to shine once you throw on some bling fedweb daredevil for instanceno implants just maxed skills which all frigate aficionados havedramiel is so fast that a crusader has to use two2 t2 overdrives just to match the speeddramiel is so fast that its ab speed when using two2 t2 overdrives is near or equal to the mwd speed of t1 frigatesthat is the speed part of the hysteria get it now
actually the gms said that the nano nerf was so that no ship can outrun unbonused t2 warriors which clock in at 5040ms yet the dramiel can reach 7kms with an mwd wtf ccp
wtf are you doing with plates on a machalso on topic theorycraft dram with overheat snakes and gang boosting will go 15kmsmaybe a tiny nerf to speed and a bit to cynabal too or the cynabals fittings cynabal isnt that bad thoughimo dram should go fast as interceptors but still maintain the damage and buffer currently pilots fit
i still dont get it i thought it was pirate faction  t2  empire faction  t1i still dont see a dramiel that is traveling at 8k ms as is always the premise for the nerf threads posing much of a threat of damage even with the tracking bonuses of the ship its going to be awful hard to hit another target moving at 15k or faster when i was less than a month old i fought a tengu going 6k ms we could not hit it it could not hit usshow me the evidence that this is something more than hysterics you know evidence and i can be swayed show me video of fights to prove your points they can be from sisi too
theoretical ship is theoreticalthe dram is an actual ingame ship
daredevil does outrun standard combat interceptors as well has better tank and puts out damage levels that the large majority of t1 cruisers struggle to achievejust putting this out here
that is probably the reason for your inability to understand what is being saidit was always equal to or slightly better  not just better than all the other pirate frigs are monsters in their own right but they require some pimpage for optimal performance and they each have their achilles heel cap range fittings speeddramiel has 15x the speed of interceptors drones af tankdamage no real fitting issues has no readily identifiable weakness and works better than most others using a plain namedt2 fitps if you are unable to grasp what it means andor have not foughtflown the stupid things then no amount of video or diagrams will help you understand
only idoits thought the nano nerf was meant to make it so ships were too slow ccp knew what they were doing and just now players are starting to notice ccp didnt destory speed builds smart players have been doing it for years and its working as intended
the nanonerf was made by ccp to erase elite playstile from small gang warfarei emphasize the word elite because most of the nerf was applied to expensive faction mods and snake implant set ccp just made sure that people who spend 12 billion isk on their pvp ship did not have significant advantage over people flying 15 mil drakes after insurance
this is not correct in order to achieve the performance people regularly quote it to have you need fitting mods even with these fittings are very tight and you especially need factiondeadspace gearto have it reach the performance some people claim as standard you even need t2 rigsnot so much for the daredevil that one does actually work splendidly with plain namedt2 though the base hull is more expensiveif you had flown both or either one you would know this
that only applies to dualprop fits which granted are the most popular but fotm fits should not be the basis of balance discussionsand yes the dd works well with namedt2  but it becomes godly with pimp kind of what i said so meh 
 thismy vigil goes 78 when heating and it aint an expensive factionshipi dont see the problem ofcourse there should be a type of ship in eve that is faster than everything elsetake the hyperion everything looks liek  compared to it why should it be dif in this caseps if u hate it train for it
translation my hysterics and hyperbole are enough evidence and anyone who disagrees is unqualified to commentall i say is give me some eveidencei have flown flown with and flown against dramiels i just dont crap myself in fear when i see one trying to kill me
there is a reason these fits are popular because they are the only useful onesthe other ones have little to no extra survivability over t2 alternatives and actually perform worse in some areas while better in others

only if they have the tank of a shuttle

danger will robinson flailing armsadding an entirely new type of mini caps and allowing them free roam in high sec is definitely going to present balance issues there is a pretty large section of the player base that contributes much of the games current problems to the fact that its way too easy to grind crazy amounts of isk in high sec myself included id think long and hard before i sign off on adding ships that will make level 4 missions even more ridiculously profitable than they already arei cant even imagine what itll do to pvp balance  as i have little experience in proper fleet warfareim voting a big nasty no until it can be proven that it wont have a negative impact on the game
if theyre going to introduce mini carriers then i think at most they should be able to use one drone control unit which gives them a maximum of 6 usable drones and no fighters the main purpose of a carrier after all is not damage but support

i like this
this has most likely been put forward before but i supporty
it seems to me that its a little unfare how manufacturing facilities in noob systems are used by non noobswhen you are trying to do the career agents and they give you a bpc to build but you cant because all the manufacturing slots have been utilised by someone doing 3 days jobs3 day jobs are not noob jobs someone has come back to the station to do their manufacturing jobs that arnt related to the noob career missionsthis is really annoying and it prevents or discourages noob players from completing the noob career missionsi propose that the noob systems manufacturing facilities only allow manufacturing jobs which last as long as the longest career agent bpc job assigned this would prevent someone using a noob system to build their bs or other nonnoob items it would also ensure that noobs arnt required to trek around a region to get a manufacturing slotthere are other issues with noob systems ex vet players going to noob systems scanning down the discover tutorial sites and stalking the proof of discovery cans and taking the proof so that noobs can scan down the site but not get the loot as a vet has already taken it the vet puts the proof on the contract system to sell back to the noob this is outright farked up and should be stopped at a game levelccp should be doing everything it can to restrict the abuse that can happen in noob systems it prevents new toons from completing their career agents and even if 1 customer gets turned off by the situation its one too many
i agree but find a different way to apply the restriction character age perhaps like that implant that only works until you reach 35 days oldand yes to the other thing
fair enough supported
if ccp had any business sense they wouldnt have tolerated grieving in so many ways from 2mil wardecs to insanely profitable suicide ganks each griefer costs hundreds of subscriptions and tens of thousands of dollars case in point certain tutorial agents are still sending noobs to lowsec missions and pirates are still permarunningsmartbombing noobships there in other words dont count on ccp doing anything
good point maybe a second amanufacturing facility at each noob station being only for toons less than 30 days oldthey do need to sort out the proof of discovery situation also but i dont hold out much hope for ccp fixing that issue
in one way or another definitelyi remember doing the different nubbie tutorials on an alt and i had to dart into low sec to do the jobs bad planning its not much to ask that nubs get to do their tutorials quickly and easily
ccp bends over backwards to accommodate griefers in order to think out its subscription base
manufacturing slots are somewhat limited which is why players do this its not necessarily griefing just producing goods at the location you wish to sell themhowever i agree that the manufacturing slots in new player arc systems should be limited to younger players only i support this proposal
i dont think this is griefing just a lack of vision from ccp ccp often find people using ligitimate methods of play which have undesireable resultsin this instance i agree make some system to ensure toons 30 days get a manufacturing slot in noob stations
while were tinkering with research slots why not rework the pos labs a bit to make them truly public and then remove all but a small amount of station lab slots leave a few for the noobz of course this would make the research business more player oriented it would also be a good opportunity to rework poss themseves thinking of the dead horse herethough it would remove a large isk sink which would need to be addressed
dont take it off topic this is just to ensure that the tutorial and career missions can be completed nothing else research slots are not required for the career missions manufacturing slots however are required
uhm how much of travelling around to find an empty manufacturing slot are we talking about here 3 jumpsid rather see that manufacturing jobs installed with this particular bpc cost nothing and the noob in question has to learn to find a station with an empty slot first science windowinstallationstldr not in favor of spoon feeding
jeez dont get your panties in a twisti only suggested it incase someone of some importance read this thread ccp staff or csm you know rather than make a whole new thread on it
you failed to make any argument everyone playing this game learns every time they playpreventing noobs from completing their career missions is against the eula but its not my responsibility to police this its ccps its in their intersts to ensure that noob players become regular playersthe current situation is that noobs are a soft target which weak players abuse for their own sense of fun np with that but imp id rather abuse someone who knows what there doing and win than taking candy from the babies
one way of addressing this issue would be to place maximum duration limits on assembly lines thus noob corp assembly lines would take jobs up to a maximum of 3 hours assembly or logistics stations would allow a maximum of a week other station types in the middle ground pos assembly arrays will have no limit
when the tutorial missions were introduced there werent industrial facilities in the starting stations doing them with a alt i clearly recall going to a production facility 10 jumps from the noob system to produce the famed perpetual motion machine now from what i see all the starting stations have a production facility a noticeable improvement seeing people that ask on the forum or local how they can produceresearch as the slot are already filled i dont think that teaching from the start that science and industry jobs can be queued is a bad thing adding a noob only or similar option for some factory will require some serious reprogramming of the si system if we go that way it would be worth going the whole mile and redo it completely
the op seems to be halfstepping this concept if this amount of work is going to be put into coddling new players and creating a false sense of how eve works then the logical conclusion is to create a newb island a system that has a oneway jumpgate so that it can only be populated by new players with no interaction whatsoever with experienced playersthe griefing bit with the mission loot is also a fact of eve life better to learn such things earlier rather than take a perverted view of how the game works out to the real world of new eden youre simply creating the next generation of whinerskb
not an unreasonable idea subject to the usual implementation gotchas
i suspect that the current job time limit of 30 days or 1 run whichever is longer is a hardcoded global setting rather than something that can easily be adjusted for some stations but not othersinstead of removing any of the existing slots i would suggest adding some new factory slots in the starter systems that can only be used for building items required for the tutorial missions this would probably be easier to do as there are already lots of restrictions in place on what can be built where
is the manufacturing of that noobthing restricted to noob stationsis the volume of either the bpc or the raw material or the finished item bigger than a noob ship can handledoesnt the noob learn before this manufacturing how to fly a spaceship how to dockundock or how to use a stargate
sounds reasonable
im not sure that limiting the manufacuring facilities to those less than 30 days old is the best idea because anyone may do the tutorials regardless of character agehow about some sort of flag that only allows the slot usage only for those currently doing tutorial missions
initially i was in full agreement of thisbut now that ive thought about this not supporting thisi dont hear of this particular issue in fact this is the first timei ran across a manufacturing job from a mission agent didnt have a problem finding a slot and it was a noob systemi agree to the problem being a problem but there is no problem imhoits not really that hard to find slots most manufacturers travel to quieter systems but try to keep close to market hubs for a reasoncourse my information is based more so in minmatar space so i suppose it could be a problem elsewhere even then i dont really hear about this from say my alliance mates or other contacts
this has been proposed many times and since ccp wont touch pos code with a ten foot pole this still needs supportin
supported once supported again

hm thinking along those lines how about thisthe speed setting determines how much cap your propulsion mod uses each servertick 1hz this would make it principally possible to set a lower speed and become cap stable it would also make it possible to stand still with activated propulsion mod but not drawing cap or just some much lower cap usage like an combustion engine running on idle the speed setting would actually be useful to micromanage your capacitor once this mechanic is implemented it could be reused for other mods to enable micromanaging of your capacitor usage
i fly a dramiel for fast tackle in gangs and there actually is a reason to have your abmwd on while sitting stillas soon as there is a gate fire i turn on my mwd and just sit when the target decloaks i can accelerate toward him very fast since i dont have to fight my own inertia and realign if i happen to be moving in the wrong direction when he decloaks
just turn it off when youre sitting still not that hard to do
if implemented this needs to be optional there are rare situations where one wants the propulsion module running while sitting still
im usually running with a fixed fleet setup it would be really nice if one player ie the fleet booster  leader could save the setup  who participates who has which rolesfurthermore it could be nice it we could save more than one setupwhen loading a fleet setup whom ever has loged on gets the usual participate in fleet question
good idea supported
this is a great idea
i like the ops idea and this one
the idea of microtransactions is that you buy store credit in bulk so the vendor has your money and then you spend the store credit in dribs and drabs witness lotros turbine points which you buy by the thousands and spend by the hundredsif microtransactions become actual transactions the costs associated with payment processing will end up becoming larger than the cost of the item itselfto convert plex to a microtransaction currency would be easy enough add a new faction or npc corp ingame which has the microtransaction exclusive items available through their lp store with agents who convert plex into some number of lpim not even sure that breaking plex up into daypasses makes sense from a gameplay perspective id be marginally interested if i could convert a 30 day subscription into an x hours subscription
ill keep it shortwe all know that eve is an intensely competitive game and im not just talking about pvp so why are we still waiting for a proper stock market with corporations being in game from the very beginning and shares too its seems like quite an oversight that a market hasnt been created for them to be traded on wider scaleim not sure i know enough about the inner workings to make any useful suggestions but i thought it was time for it be suggested at least
enron
that a no then
i proposed a system a while ago the thread went idle thoughhere
market expansionyou mean something to deal with all the little and big irks of this aspect of the gameeven industry got shafted with their expansiondont hold your breath or think any kind of support will do something
titan dds should chain through currently locked targets by the titan exampletitan locks two dreads with 20 mil ehp damage would go to the first dread causing 20 mil ehp of damage killing the dreadremaining damage would be dealt to the second target locked the second dread causing 10 mil ehp in severly weakening the dreadthis would do 3 mil would be 3 mil damage applied to the first target then the second and so forth this would make dds more powerful for clearing the field while making them not as powerful as they were back in the time of the aoe dd which was really fun to try to escape
no please lets get rearview mirrors firsta coworker of mine hasnt stopped ranting since he got the keys of his first procurer about why in hell he could have headlights but no rearview mirrorsso pleaaaase rearview mirrors at least on mining barges then horns
less thinking more pew pew
depending on the parameters of your idea with cloaking im not really sure if i like it or dislike it honestly im leaning more towards dislike since it seems that if you kept mechanics like that it would make it much harder to break through gate camps
current mechanicsyou can wardec an alliance that has a corp with a hisec pos that you want to blow up or ransomyou put the pos into reinforced which exits reinforced 36 hours laterjust before 24 hours are left on the pos reinforcement timer the corp leaves the alliance so you have 24 hours left to shoot said corp but during this 24 hour period you cannot wardec this corp so as your war ends with the corp the pos comes out of reinforcement and you can no longer agress it without being concordedthis isnt an exploit as stated by gms from several petitionsok so you can now wardec the corp and after the 24 hour cooldown period you can commence shooting the fully repaired and often more defendable pos due to them being readyalso they can now rejoin the alliance and repeat the whole processapparently not an exploit yet again from gm responsesthis wouldnt be an issue in lowsec or 00 but due to our wonderfull concord officers it unfortunately is since its in hisecto me this seems a seriously flawed mechanic and having had a response from 1 csm member to say they agree with this id like to hear what others on the csm or even a dev but i wont hold my breath have to say regarding this loophole which makes a destroyable asset pretty much invulnerable due to current war mechanics thankyou for your time
i believe that abusing the timers in this way should be classed as an exploit it is clearly not working as intendedthere have been a few suggestions for how to stop this specific issue but the whole wardec system could do with some reworking too

i like aspects of this idea with a few tweaks it could actually be applied to help people move into lowersec areas the only thing that i can see is that there would be protective postures and who and how gets to buy protection npc corp memebers would have to buy there own protection and starts small in starter corps and moves up based on your age capping out at 3 months to a standard fee that everyone pays for in npc corpsplayer corps should have the ability to pay so much per member at a discounted rate this would be the advantage for being in a player corp this protection can project into lowsec but for limited amounts of time and with significant less force used maybe something on the scale of npc faction militaries rather than concord lowsec protection should be based on an hourly rate and should cost much more than a regular highsec protectionpeople not protected by concord would have a special symbol on there portrait in local and same for protected memebers in lowsec the lower your security status the higher amount of isk you need to pay for highsec protection when it hits 50 concord considers you an outlaw an refuses protection while high security rating characters get a considerable discounted rate this way a positive security status has an effect on actual mechanics and not just another notch in the belt when you hit 50just my 2 iskac

increased jump range  fuel bay size why yes that does sound more tempting
ooopsi did post this in a wrong place before i had intention to post here but not into eve general discussion that is why i am repeating it heresorry i didnt read all tread too long but i think black ops need fixing without doubtsaccording this
1 extend the max rage of the jump portal if nothing else the ship can be used as a transport ship best friend 2 allow covert cynos in high sec this will allow high sec war decs the opportunity to set up recon ambushes in high secthose two things should give the black ops ship a good role within eve both in industry and combatmake it happen ccp
as it is black ops can already bring 1000 unscoutable dps adding hardpoints and fittings would render them really op id really love your definition of respectable dpsthe tank sure aint their strong point but then you just portaled a falcon and you have the option not to jump in the fight if it doesnt look good the 1400ms that my panther does go a longer way to keep it alive than a tank ever will anyway well yes they are not a progression from covopsrecon at all theyre a side effect of capital training for most people and thats good that way i thinkprotip  youre a lot sneakier out of system that cloaked in it i cant remind a single instance of me warping to a target anyway always jumped to oneas a blackops pilot i dont think there is much wrong with them except perhaps the sin sure i would be glad if they were buffed more fittings more slots more tank moar everything but the covert ops cloak would be of no use on mine
i would love the cov ops cloak to be given to the bops is it needed not reallya bigger fuel bay better fuel consumption and longer jump range is what they need and out of all of those i would settle for the longer jump rangeas far as more damage  tank that is really not the role of a bops if your standing toe to toe slugging it out with other battleshipssomething went wrong
only the redeemer has 850 dps and 1000 with drones all l5 decent 80k efh buffer tank phanter got 900 damage fitted widow with torps 30 km 600 sin 450 drone  200 rails or 350 neut blaster no tank at all i agree with u that some ships are fine damage  i know redeemer is decent and slot layout but dont talk like every bo is the same because im gallente and i feel offended if u claim the sin has a good slot layout and a 1000 dpsit surely isnt the drones for the sin takes too much time to apply damage and sentries are fail due range issues compined with sentry optimal and fall offi would like to add a new fix to them if u jump to cyno u get 70 cap bonus thats a pain
fail fits i guess my panther is 1021 dps before overloading for all level v rf gyros and 1073 for my actual skills and implants and it bring an heavy neut toobigger fuel bay and range while nice would only make eve smaller and the hotdrops gankiers not sure we want that
the damage a bops can do on its own is nothing compared to the damage it can bridge on top of you

i mentioned my problem with this in another reply which is that it makes supercarriers into antidread gankmobiles and dreads into antisupercarrier gankmobiles and so the capital warfare food chain becomes a circlesome minor tweaking in particular some reworking of logoff mechanics so that the default option for a supercarrier tackled by a midsized fleet can no longer be to ctrlq and wait 15 minutes while they try to grind your buffer down would be fine but halving ehp doesnt do anything to solve the main issue with supercarriers that theyre unfocused antieverything platforms rather than a tool for a specific role
the catch 22 is always going to be that the moment they nerf sc wo nerfing titans titan numbers are just going to explode yes sc need a defined role nuking their drone bays to only allow fighter and fb use is a good thing but hammering them in any other aspect is going to convince people to upgrade to titans the hp issue is only really an issue in terms of log off mechanics this is true of all supers in combat and when trapped by small fleets a 25 reduction in hp wouldnt be terrible but its not really needed rr still continues to be a problem an aeon with 1 rr can mitigate nearly 75 of an enemy super carriers fighter bomber damage this is utterly moronic when other sc cannot be jammed and thus provide a  ton of repping powerboth titans and sc need to be brought back in line the dread 50 resist boost in siege does this quite well it reduces the effects a titan can have with a dd on a cap fleet and it prolongs the survivability of dreads vs sc long enough for them to actually project damage so its pretty simple remove sc effectiveness with regular drones and give dreads a defensive bonus only in siege keep the 10 minute siege timer its a good negative for dreads to have
i do agree with your argument but i do believe the fix to super caps is in the rebalancing of dreads though the rr argument i 100 argee with and as i stated earlier if you removed the range bonus would greatly limit the ability to rr as they are big ships and slow to move also one could give them back triage mode but change it for scsrange bonus not immune to ecm no drones no neutssmarties and no moving basically would be a last ditch rep effort or an after combat rep effort and to effectively rr friendly caps youd have to remove yourself from the dps chain problem is any change to super carriers rr ability is negated by carriers and sacrificial triage altsthis is why i believe that dreads need a significant boost there stationary attack tactics limits ability to chase their target but gives them a large damage bonus in my eyes this needs to be increased damage wise by 1 more turrets worth of damage with tracking to counter moving super caps and torpsmissles that can catch moving super caps and do damage cause right now pheonixs suck when you start moving as a target furthermore their needs to be a reduction to neut range on super carriers by a third this would make them vulnerable to hics with focused pointsalso just a thought but why not make them jammable that would be just reducing the sensor strength it wouldnt affect their ability to be immune to other ecms but would make them jammable just a thought thoughas lag is fixed scs will be more vulnerable to smaller ships clipping their claws this and dreads will bring super carriers into line at least thats my opinion
bff dear friendsc need ehp changes but titan not need nerf just one single changejust need to change the titan bridge passage methodsif the fleet want to move to other system need move with titan to targeted systemnow open a titan bridge is too safe for titan pilotsno danger  no loss this is why titan numbers not decreased year over year this need to change and not need titan nerf titan would be move with fleet if the fleet want titan bridge this is the solutionjump to hostile space would be reduce the titan numberstitan jump to hostile space with fleet  more dangers for titans
removing the jump portal generator is removing 50 of the entire value of having a titan in the first place it is an unacceptable nerfthe only relatively simpe solution i can see is to make them more expensive and longer to build including motherships but this would harm smaller alliances while not really affecting the large megarich ones too much so solution is pending
nonono nobody talk about remove jump portal generatorbut change the jump portal generator working methodnow titan pilot open a portal and the fleet jump to targeted system but the titan not need to jump just left behind at starting systemchange titan bridge rule move titan to fleet command position and jump to targeted system with all fleet members jump with those pilots who where is at titan within 50km range
fixing supercarriers by buffing dreads is problematic because it affects dreads in other circumstances eg dreads vs subcaps if every supercarrier was deleted from the server tomorrow dreads would be more or less balanced like they were predominion where nobody used motherships and titans were useless against capitals the only real problems with dreads today are supercap related  that dropping supercarriers on sieged dreads is low risk killmail printing unless the numbers are stupendously uneven or the server craps out randomly and the fact that a supercarriers damage output beats a dread when shooting sov structures unlike the old days of pos warfare whilst again being lower risk due to the lack of siege mode required ideas such as siege module resist bonuses or allowing sieged dreads to be remote repped dont just if even fix that they have further knockon implications across the board

funny i did the same thing it started off with me training projectile turrets for my myrmidon which is a decent enough ship with drone and armor rep bonuses then decided to screw it and cross train to minmatar completely it only takes 23 days to train to a hurricane thank god battlecruisers isnt race specificmaybe if enough gallente capsuleers cross train to some other race ccp will take the hint that gallente ships arent that great i still like my myrmidon though btw i like to add things in parentheses if you havent noticed
look on the bright side the 5 medium hybrid damage implant zgm1000 is dirt cheap
i would still be far from my dmg output with autos and no implantbetter w8 and buy the one for autos best
iUFFFDm supporting a buff to blasters and railgunsthere is absolutely no reason why anyone should use hybrid guns over any other turretweapon in the game todaythings that are bad for weapons are capacitor usage short range low tracking speedhybrids have all these bad attributes  generally have ships that are aimed at active tanking and are slowwhile lazoers also have capacitor use they are compensated by their long range and good tracking  amarr ships that are generally bonused for passive tankingacs have a moderate range longer than hybrids but are compensated by having fast ships minmatar and projectile doesnt use capacitor  they have a good tracking

i support this idea
buffing hull tanking could possibly mitigate the speed and web problem two ways 1 add hull buffer rigs armor and shield tankers have them why not hull tankers 2 remove penalty to reinforced bulkheads and buff their percentage increase a little bit and then provide some sort of stacking penalty to keep them from being opagree with the overall argument supported
some good ideas be nice to have them boosted back a bit after theyve been hammered to death by the nerf batswindjammer

approve i already suggested that several times at the feedback thread just i think range would be better in the 160 to 200 cm and to top the cake a certain control on shoulder  hip width should be allowed people are both tall and short thin and widealthough we could get used to an armyofclones onepodsizefitsall incarna it would be quite a loss from excellence btw i found the suport buton supported

lol i much appreciate your vote and your enthusiasm the only problem with the idea of adding things like extra weight is that given the lore that is already in place regarding pod pilots it is highly unlikely that one of them would have anything other than a reasonable physique and while i am aware that this is not entirely realistic i can appreciate why ccp would choose not to include itone of the main objections apparently to including variable heights was that ccp apparently claimed that it would require extra coding and lots more manwoman hours to modify the animation of our pilots too large an increase or decrease in height and body weight would require those pilots to walk in a different manner as each character has a weight which affects the motion of their bodies as they walk and the way in which their indvidual limbs movethis is why my proposal is limited to just a simple 1 foot variance in stature it is as far as i can work out the minimum amount of coding change for the maximum impact this is what i hope will push ccp to change their collective mind about introducing this option in a final iteration of carbon character creation before the realease of incarna part one it wont require a change to the portrait we will already have created and we would just be able to go back in and alter our characters heightas someone famous once said the simplest ideas are sometimes the best im hoping this proves to be the case

yes this is a topic which is by no means new but it is still a highly relevant one since the topic in question is a key aspect of nullsec pvp as it is todaythe problemthe current hotdrop mechanic allows pilots to fit a cyno generator to a t1 frigate pop it and instantly jumpbridge a fleet on top of some other fleet or pilot in its current state it is near impossible to defend against if you do not have a cyno jammer installed in the system which is not very often the casethe proposalmy proposal is to balance this by adding a time factor to the entire process in one of two ways note that they ultimately would have the same effect and just present two different ways to achieve itgive the cyno generator not the covert ops cyno see below a chargeup period before activating during this period give a set ammount of penalties to the cyno ship modelled after the penalties to an interdictor when using an unscripted wdf generator this can be justified by the cyno needing time to build energy or the like which takes time and causes drainage of propulsion and defensive systemsleave the cyno generator as it is instant cyno but give capital ships and titan bridges a timer after locking on to a cyno that has to expire before they can actually jump this can be justified by a jumpcalibration process or the likethis would only affect standard cynos and the ships that use them it will notapply to covert ops cynos and their users which due to their advanced state both of the cyno itself and the ships that use it would be void of such penaltiesi believe this proposal would add balance to fleet pvp and provide gangs and large fleets alike a way to better deal with hotdrops without per necessity penalize the hotdropper too muchedits other ideas garnered from the discussiongive jumps a certain transit time depending on the number of ly to target destination in effect this would mean that bridgedjumping ships would indeed jump spend some time in transit and then arrive on grid regardless of whether the cyno is still active when they arrive just how much time this should be would need some serious debatethe dec 15 csm summit actually discussed a mechanic similar to thisnote however that the context is capital ships not hotdrops per se read the full summit summary here link
nr 1 would just kill hot dropping and i therefore cant support itnr 2 is ok i guess but what timespan are we talking would caps still be able to jump even if the cyno ship has been killed during charge up
just chiming in here with a random comment i was always thinking giving the light dictors a role that is viable even in lowsec would be some kind of cynosural suppression probe30km radius masks cyno fields inside the bubble no other effects would at least give some kind of protection against the typical lolbaithotdrop
good question i actually thought about this after posting i guess it can be debated but my stance is that you can do it in a few general ways depending on how much rp you want to add to it my belief is that the practical side should be favoured not rpif the cyno ship is destroyed before a certain time elapses the titans  capital ships will lose data needed for jump calibration and abort jumpif the ship is destroyed after the said time period ships will still arrive on scene but slightly scattered from the cyno though still on the same gridtitanscapital ships only need to lock once in order to succesfully and accurately fulfill the jump process regardless of if or when the cyno ship is destroyedi think the last one is the more practical one
not supported
because
reason it restricts game play beyond what you are proposing all i see here is someone touched you in a dark place and you are proposing a change out of personal injury or frustration
how on earth does this restrict gameplay beyond what i am proposing this is being proposed because hotdropping as it is is simply not balanced it is an extremely powerful feature which simply lacks any effective counter apart from having your own titan and gang on standby to counterdrop something the majority of roaming gangs do not have this is not a major nerf the dropping fleet will still arrive but it will lend the dropped party an opportunity to respond
i would normally not support a hotdrop nerf but since covert ops cyno isnt covered supported hotdropping shouldnt be disabled but its fine if its not cost free all it means is it will cost isk to hotdrop as opposed to using a completely throwaway frig this is how it should be anywayit does not actually nerf hotdropping whatsoever only increases the cost thats a good thing eve need more sinks
hotdropping is out of control and should be severely nerfed interceptors are fastest sub caps but still with some scouts in surrounding systems there is no way they surprise you battleship fleets will take arround half an hour to cross a regionsupercapitals do it in the blink of an eye it just doesnt make sense and isnt in any way balanced in general the way caps travel is way too fast in arround 30 minutes they can travel from one side to the universe to the other side the same ammount the much smaller battleships and interceptors not that much faster will require to cross a single regionhotdropping doesnt generate pvp it gives some easy ganks and then makes sure the fleets that got ganked will never engage anything without overwhelming odds so they can always gtfo from the two options i am in favuor of option 2 simply because it allows for giving supercaps longer delays than regular caps which is imo pretty reasonable option 1 has as advantage that you can make it cyno only appears on overview when on full strength so jumpable that way it only hurts hotdrops and less regular movementbtw if cyno startup timer is used than that last option in your other post is a bad idea the first option is the only good one if you are going to bring them on the field you just have to protect yoru cyno ship  you need a real fleet and then you can reinforce them with caps you cant use a t1 frig anymore to bring several supercaps
not supported as i have never supported changes to cynos that would make it nigh impossible to hot drop people the whole goal of a hot drop is pick a ship with good tackling skills throw a cyno on it and then find something to drop when the ship opens the cyno it cannot move so its tackle is short term and yet you still think its unfair the ships will take about 20 seconds to appear on grid and be combat capable further more they have to lock youcaps are easy to kill if you build a fleet with the purpose to bait hot drops and kill capsfinally it adds an undesired drawback to jump frieghter logistics having to wait where ever you are longer than you do already makes a ship worth 45 bil  cargo worth utold mils or bils sit longer and jump into more hostile cynos also makes jumping into lowsec nearly impossible cause everyone kills cyno ships and if theres a chance that when the cyno ship dies that the c ap will appear off station noone would do it
something has to be done about the cyno mechanics 3 seconds is not enough warning the hostile forces are unscoutable  no game mechanic exists to know whos coming from wherewe need some sort of mobile cyno jammer at least for very limited short ranges such as 25 kmadding strong random factors in combat breaks tactics and strategy  i hope someone in ccp office is smart enough to figure that out
i would support delayed arrival of ships that use the cyno and some kind of cyno supressor ability on limited ship types1 or 2 i dont feel it is necessary to tie the ability to use the cyno on the survival of the ship which lights the beacon i want cynoing to still be actively used in all kinds of situations but i want to slightly change the way it is used basicly just remove the ability to drop a fleet without giving any chance for the ships already on the field to react covert cynos need not be affectedbasicly some kind of delay before the jumping happens or alternatively initiate the jump immediately but have the ship travel to the beacon with some kind of loading screen simulating the traveling basicly the loading screens purpose would be to ensure the ship jumping isnt too vulnerable during the delay such vulnerability might be a positive thing too but im just throwing it out there for discussion since i dont have interest in increasing the risk to the jumping ships during the proposed delaythe reason i want a delay is to change it to so that when a beacon is lit it just informs all the people that potential reinforcements are on route with the delay the people already engaged would have some limited time to flee regroup or try to finish things before the reinforcements arrive and ruin the fight that was already in progress you could even make it so that smaller ships arrive sooner so you could still bridge in support fast but it would take time before the bs and capital blob can arrive on the field
i strongly believe that the proper strategic way of hot dropping should be offgrid cyno your forces on another grid then warp in your force on targetthat would be most fair way allowing all sides in the conflict to adjust their strategy accordinglyfailing that some other limitation in teleportation speed is in orderif you seriously believe that the current status quo is fair you just have no proper understanding of what balance means in strategy games and this is a strategic thing we are talking about
i am not sure what you base this on i have never seen a fleet appearing later than 5 seconds after cyno popping the locking period is neglible as a bubbler is usually on field within moments notice after cyno pops the only exception i can think of would be dropping into a heavily loaded system did this a week back myself took us almost 20 seconds to load gridgranted but the majority of small pvp gangs would be hard pressed to do that and no sensible corpalliance will drop capitals without subcap backup unless they have near perfect intel on what they are dropping onwhat if the timer was 20 seconds is that waiting foreveras for the second point as stated near the beginning of this discussion post 4 it can be debated just how the mechanic can work so the problem you see here is easily worked around
it seems strange that logon ganking was declared an exploit and after ages fixed then ccp introduced an easier ingame version of the same thing wtf
ive suggested changing cyno mechanics before somewhere many many many timesjust suddenly dropping capital fleet or bridging 20 battleships on target just doesnt make sense i personally like idea of just locking jump drives on large celestial objects like stations poss stargates planets moons it would also enable jumping without 2nd account for daredevilsdefinetly cyno which you can place precisely and immediately jump to is a bad thing 
thats just it use cov ops cyno and there is no difference in gameplay whatsoever use regular cyno in a throwaway frig and you get what you pay for all this means is that hotdrops are no longer costfree
hot dropping capital and super capitals breaks rr bs gangs and ruins the game for everyone who is not in an alliance that can afford to have counterhot drop fleets on standby 24x7 the attitude of super caps are easy to kill if you have the bigger super cap blob is foolhardy  it does not lend itself to properly balancing the game for all playerswandering around with a jump freighter where there is any danger at all is foolhardythe delay necessary to push hot dropping out of the instantiwin niche it currently enjoys is only about 15 to 25 seconds some ships already enjoy a bonus to the cyno duration so all you need to do is make sure the ship lighting the cyno can live for 30 seconds while the target is tackledi would actually prefer to see a combination of the two proposed mechanisms first the cyno is not available to jump to until it finishes its first 1020 cycle and then larger ships take longer to transit to the lit cyno a few seconds for jumpcapable sub caps bobs jf ten seconds for capitals and twenty seconds for super capsthis delay at least allows time for noncapital fleets to gtfo or call for assistance cynosural jumps should provide a means for controlled  planned deployment of assets not a means to react to targets of opportunity with overwhelming force

not at all
remove local eh we all know where this is going
you didnt read the thread so you have no idea
currently it is well known that are beloved ship class the battleship has more or less been replaced by the battle cruiser both in affordability and average firepower with bs having a little more but not by muchthere have been many threads about how to fix this but unfortunately swinging the nerf bat never works out well and we all can at least agree on that my idea is simple by combining a little t3 technology with regular battle ships each ship receives a battle bridge section not enough to require modification of materials for construction as where not replacing whole sections of the ship also unlike true t3 ships there is only one per ship and any bs can fit any battle bridgeevery ship comes equipped with a default bridge that can be replaced but not removed think of it like those combat games where you can give your guys a brand shiny new gun but if you take it away he still has his old pea shooter from the start of the gameadditionally at this time there will be no visual effect when changing your bridgelastly most bridges have a passiveactive effect setup when you install the bridge x things happen and when you activate the bridge more things happenideas for sections are as followsdefault bridge  this is the default bridge that exists if you dont install a better one its a replaceable but not removable item and simple allows battleships to do exactly what they do as of current does not have an active modepoint defence bridge  this bridge is designed to reconfigure the battle ship to intercept smaller targets while giving up its ability to effectively deal with larger targets when installed all small turretslaunchers gain a 50 faster fire rate but the ship loses the ability to equip medium and large weaponrywhen the bridge is in active mode any small turretlauncher will automatically attempt to use its shots to block shots by other hostile ships against you or your friends in this mode you cannot lock hostile targets and shoot them as all your weapons are focusing on disrupting incoming fire this mode takes 5 seconds to cycle on or off and you can warp in either modedevastator bridge  this bridge is designed to configure a battleship to fire one super powerful shot instead of multiple shots when installed to a ship the ship can only fit one turretlauncher but that single turret deals 8 times more damage but tracking is reduced to the point that anything below curser class is a garneted miss while bc up are still viable targetswhen in active mode the ships speed is reduced by 80 and its damage is increased 300500 with tracking taking a further hit making it only really effective against capital class ships lastly it gets a 2550 bonus to resistances it takes 5 seconds to chance modes you can not warp while in active modefor an easier graphics standpoint any shot from a bs equipped with this bridge comes from ship center and not a rendered gun pointbombardment bridge  this bridge reconfigures the battleship into a sustainable bombardment platform when installed the battleships speed is increased by 150 and its agility is increased it is however unable to fire any weaponrywhen in active mode the ships speed is reduced to 20 it gains a 40 faster rate of fire and 20 bonus to tracking this system takes 15 seconds to spin up so to say as well as cool down and you cannot warp while in firing mode  the fluff behind this is pretty simple fire a shot to knock the others accuracy enough to cause a miss also as it does not require a lock to do its active mode it gives a layer of protection that ewar cant take awayoriginal post here
there is a dirty little truth in eve many of us know about its existence a small few actually exploit it in recent months its been an increasing topic of conversation in the eve community with articles on eve24 and forum threads in kugutsman this truth is the existence of players who use bots and how potent is their effect upon the way we all play eve i have a proposal that will first describe how the existence of bots is a problem for all of us and then go on to describe what i think is an elegant solution to fix the problemwhy you should care about botsbots come in three main types the most common are probably the mining bots if you type eve online mining bot into google it will produce thousands of hits you will notice that there are several programs and a few software companies that charge 40 to buy a copy of their mining bot programs if they can make a business selling this they have probably sold their product more than a few hundred times the links to free programs have been downloaded over ten thousand times this tells me there are probably thousands or even tens of thousands of mining bots in eve right now messing around of eft you can get a single mining bot to easily generate 1500m3 per minute at current jita prices running 237 mining veld that makes a billion iskweek a solo miner in high sec can go largely unnoticed clearing the preferred belt or two daily the sheer amount of minerals these players produce has an overwhelming effect on the mineral market most players who like mining find themselves discouraged that their minerals have so severely depressed value perhaps more worrisome is the ratting bot who is positioned in a system with enough roid belts and simply claims bounties all day and night warping to belts and killing npcs the people who sell these programs claim they generate 40mill iskhr that is about 900mill iskday this is a problem because it injects staggering amounts of isk into the eve economy causing inflation and devaluing all the isk that everyone else self included works hard to gethow to stop miningratting botsthe solution is very simple and stops ratting and mining bots at the same time all you have to do is stop respawning roids in belts when there are no roids left the belt itself despawns to provide the supply of minerals needed for the eve economy just increase the number of grav sites by 10 times and make them easier to scan down maybe higher sig stength without roid belts and an endless supply of npcs or roids that can be found using simple bookmarks then bots will have a much harder time getting to the right places where you can mine or kill npcsfrom a storyline perspective roid belts never made sense to me you have these stories that suggesta mystique of mining for these roids finding them and extracting them is a rare thing that makes you rich and drives you to take risks but you have an endless supply of them that just reappear every day also consider that every day sansha supposedly a genius mastermind sends a few hundred thousand of his minions to these roid belts so that players can blast them and claim bounties same goes for all the other pirate factionsthe very idea that effectively limitless amounts of rare minerals appear every day in places around the universe and that hundreds of thousands of poorly equipped disorganized minions go to the same places to die every day in wave after wave after wave is sillyprostops all ratting and mining botsconrequires mining characters to scan a sig or take a mission in order to mineotherencourages players to work together more since the roids in mission spaces may be more desirablemakes better sense from a storysetting perspective
its been suggested before macros would just scan at the start of the day bm and leave macro running for 23 hours it wouldnt actually solve anythingthe reason 90 of eve playerbase highsec carebear dont care is because they were told all the grieving and tear farming is legitimate part of the game eve is the only mmo where this is the case if they are forced to tolerate things that directly harm them why would they rage about something that does so indirectly in a intangible way bots in other mmos provoked far greater reactions in the user base precisely because of this
i support this1this is something that i was thinking and i think this shuld workand i would add one more thing maybe to make npcs that guard belts faster smarter stronger and that they warp scramble real ppl will need to put some extra defence on ships and use drones to kill them before warping out ppl in smaller ships will warp out quicker then hulks so new players will be safe or ppl will mine in groups with defance shipif npcs can warp scramble macros that will make them much less costeffective becouse they will stuck in belts or be killed if they dont have defence at allpsand about scaning in the morning and boting all daywell i think that it can easy be solved in the way that when there is no one left in the belt after some time the belt itself despawns and respawn on the other place and need to be scaned down again
i thought about if macros could scan and its a valid concern it just seams that the scanning interface is substantially more complex than simply mining so it would be more difficult possibly even prohibitively difficult to automate the scanning process more likely players would scan a site and set the macro to mine it while they are gone but that is easily prevented by just not supplying a site with that much ore if a standard high sec grav site has enough ore to keep one miner busy for 3 hrs then you wont be able to mine all day and night with one sig scanned in the morning after dt not to mention that this suggestion of removing belts will completely eliminate all ratting bots which generate enormous amounts of isk for the rmt world according to recent interviews on evenews24
the easiest way to stop a botter in 00 is to put a cloaked alt in localcan you imagine all of 00 bot free make ccp put cloaked alt chars in every 00 system
dynamic belts are a very old idea ccp themselves have spoken about the possibility several years agoif you really want to mess up bots then make the sites small enough to keep a high rotation rate exploration system for sites so you have scan repeatedly throughout the daybenefits of using the exploration system besides the respawns is that they will move around so there will no longer be a monster system with xx beltsadjust size of the sites to make it worthwhile for legitimate corps while at the same time acting as a wrench in the bot machinery few hours worth for a hulk should suffice per sitecaveat bots will always be here the best we can hope to do is make it as bothersome to program one as possible to cut down on their use
your defeatism is showingif a miner bookmarks a site whos to say that the site will still be there 10 hours later presumably other miners will be looking for grav sites toootherwise i agree with hirana yoshida
this is a great idea it solves both problems and adds realism to the game there is already a scanning tutorial and free skill books for it in said tutorial there is really no excuse not to do this 100 supported
having been on a few roams through neutred 00 space i dont think the scanning mechanic is beyond the capabilities of some bots either that or someone runs around and scans while his bots chew up the things he finds much of the suspected bot activity i have seen is in scanned siteswell that and hauling missions definitely tons of bots running hauling missions a couple friends and i harassed one hive of bots in low sec cranking on hauler missions for maybe 23 hours until our sec status was shot didnt stop the bots killed a couple hauler ships on one character alone and it would just keep grabbing a new bestower and continuing on
i 100 agree with the entire opit would also be nice to have more control over the graphics engine just tick boxes for dont render nebulae and stuff like that
maybe not but some neut logis there too
i agree with this last part the idea of shaming someone to not do something that is within the rules is suboptimal your attempts at shaming may just be seen as delicious tears if a mechanic is stupid enough that people should be shamed into not doing it ccp should change the mechanic if you rep someone who cant jump or dock due to agro you should have that count down too that way you could still rep someone when they are not in a fight you should also be seen on killmails and imo you should have gccconcord if you are not at war with or have killrights with the people attacking the pilot you rep you can still stay at 6070 km and rep people they may want to increase the range of the reppers on these ships to put them more in line with ewar in gneeral but these agro mechanics are stupid
opposed this is market pvp
badthis is what youre askingeverytime i view a market window id like eve to extend that database query into other tables pulling more information for each and every line item on the market thus lagging the whole system to death all so that an escrow can be confirmed before any item is purchasedunneeded lag for a case that isnt the most commonno thanx
thats not at all what he is asking what he is asking is that when the scammer empties his wallet the system looks at his orders and cancels any order that he cant cover a single minimumunitvalues worth of it has nothing to do with when you open the market but when the scammer empties his wallet
you both missed itthe requested feature would not make the query unless a user specifically requests it on an individual ordernothing would change in the way broad queries are run on the market currently this is a button or right click selection that only works on a single order at a time and only when requested by a user in the same region or buy range of the order which ever is easier to code into the gameand as for the previous poster previous to this quote if this is market pvp then i want a gun to fire back with buddy
against these orders stand out a mile for a diligent trader who knows the market this is market pvp and there are several ways to profit from countering these orders adapt
going to give this a thumbs up if nothing but for the tears of those who currently exploit this bugi also find it rather hilarious those screaming how there are several ways to know if the owner of the buy order has the money in their wallet to cover the minimum buy order or not yet they never list any at all
agreedi saw this scam in jita local and felt powerless to warn others this scam is completely passive and undetectablewhiners who use this exploit should lose all of their isk work for your isk adapt
its not a bug nor is it an exploitguess what margin trading is used daily in the real world the only difference between eve and the real world is that in the real world if you dont have enough cash to cover the margin and the deal goes south they come and take your housein eve they just cancel the buy order and you get to keep the stuff you were trying to sell to sell to another buyerso let me see if i understand this1 you have 200 units of widget a to sell2 you try to sell to xxdrthvd3ruberleettradebotxx  cause it seems like a really good idea since hes paying about ten times more than his next nearest competitor3 guy with stupid name cant cover the cost so the order gets cancelled and you losenothing except whatever time you spent mentally spending all the isk you failed to make since you still have the 200 units of widget a4 you go sell widget a to someone else for less of a profit you did do enough research to insure you could still make a profit righti fail to see how someone with even a minute amount of sense can actually lose money on this  except by being suckered in by greed over a sure thingeditfor those of you uncertain about why sure things should be handled with the utmost care and even more diligence than normal please go watch the first half hour or so of lucky number slevin
ops proposal will not cause any appreciable lag because the market orders only need to be checked for that character when money is transfered away from that character alternatively the orders can be checked every our te problem you are describing is not an issue i fully support ops proposal if the buyer is incapable of paying for the good he should not be on the listhalf of the players are not even aware of this mechanics well until i can do that this should be removed
there is no bug and there is no exploitif you try to sell to someone who doesnt have the money to complete there buy order then the order gets cancelled and you keep your itemsthe fact that you just brought the items off a sell order for vastly inflated prices is entirelly unrelatted to the buy order and is due to your own gullabilityits your brain thats bugged not the game
where on the buy order does it list their namethe bottom line is there is no balance between the risk and reward aspect of the scambugexploit it is just straight up profit no risk at all and before you start waving your broker fee flag around that is peanuts a drop in the bucket compared to the insane amount of isk you make exploiting the bugpeople in here like to throw the word greed at the person trying to complete the order like they are some evil bastard for selling to the highest buy order what about the person exploiting by zeroing out their wallet and not honoring their buy order you act like he is a sainti am not proposing that the person putting up the sell order lose his house if he cant complete it just simply that it is automatically canceled when he can no longer cover the cost of the minimum buy amount
supporting recycling back to previous tier
the main problem i have with this is most stuff you make is not easy to reverse so to saylike how am i going to turn a pile of reserch notes back into cows and what ever else if i have allready cut up the cow or reduced it to a pile of goo i dont think im getting it backor how am i going to take a vial of vacine and get a virus out of it i personaly dont see how being able to recycle pi materials is going to help and honistly if you are going to buy those pi materails that are so cheap put them to use by 1 billion units of water and ionic solution and produce coolent having some one sell you something at 14 regular cost is not a problem its an advantage
i support wykes proposal that some sort of pi recyclingreprocessing should be made availablean exact mechanic would need to be worked out quantities balanced etc however this is a necessityt2 components can be retrieved from reprocessing t2 ships etc cap components can be retrieved from reprocessing capital ships minerals can be regained from reprocessing cap components or anything t1 salvage can be recovered from reprocessing rigswe should be able to retrieve pi products from higher tier pi products especially if they are an end product used for things other than pi ie coolant robotics all the p4 etc
bump
anybody else interested in thisor do i have to panda to the masses and cry afk cloaking or nerf lvl 4s before anybody gives this idea more than a cursory glancedo the csm care about interesting new game mechanics or getting voted in via supporting mass whinging ok silly question but stillthis idea generally is liked should be looked intoce
marauders unlike ordinary battleships have a lowered sensor strength with recent changes to faction ships this became unnecessary as most faction ships outperform marauders there is no reason to keep them out of pvp secondly why is caldary ewar privileged again why are they only weak to jammersis does ccp have some caldary ewar only policy if they should have a weakness they should be weak against all ewar typessolution one bring their sensor strength up to normal valuebenefit since prices of faction ships spiked like hell we might start seeing marauders in pvp diversity is always good solution twogive them an x vulnerability to target painters stasis webefiers warp disruptors sensor dampeners and every other type of ewar if they are to be weak to ewar they should be weak to all types of it not just caldarysolution threegive ewar weakness a racial flavor each marauder would be weak against ewar type of their own and racially and strong of their enemys ewar just like with t2 resists golem would be undampeneble but easy to neut and jamm kronos could be sensor dampened by one mod but would be impossible to jamm so on would make things interesting conclusion make ccp change things or we shall rise in mutiny i prefer solution three because it makes things most interesting it really is about making things fair wee will prevent shipclass from becoming redundant spice up pvp and put caldary ewar back in its place these are all very positive effects please support the motion to falcon pilots out there please troll here and keep it on the first page i will help you by nucking whatever counter arguments you bring up
once upon a time the way to redeem lp was via lp offers iircagent would make an lp offer and you either accepted or declined it and had to wait for the next offerthis was a pita and was replaced by a lp store which worked much betterpeople could choose there lp offers rather than waiting a random amount of time for a decent or the right offer to come alongi think the same type of logic shift would be useful for missionsinstead of the get mission offer  accept  decline  wait for 4 hours etc if second decline pitawhen you ask for a mission from an agent you are presented with a list of current missions5 missions are in the list as a base10 missions in the list with max effective standingsyou can now select the mission you want to do from the liston completion  failure the mission is replaced with another random missionno need for offer decline wait 4 hours get fecked off etcunaccepted missions would get replaced by new random mission after 24 hours
supported i would definitively like to see the possibility to choose missions to a greater extent than now
smotftw
it seems to me that this would encourage mission farming as there arent all that many missions at a given level i would like to see this be skillbased and standing based so you may have the standings for 4 options of missions but only have the skills for two or vice versa having one base mission and more based on levels of a skill would probably expand the mission runners ideals but the skill should have a decent multiplier like rank 6 or 8it sounds like a good idea overall with just a few tweaks but i believe the 4 hour limitation is there for a reason as ccp doesnt seem to like people running missions for now marginally supported
what this would really end up doing is becoming a workaround for border agents giving lowsec missions after tyrannis patch it would spread out carebears and undo some of the damage tyrannis introduced therefore supported
bump for more support needed for caldari justice

ya i just resubbed and was like hey why did i even stop in the first placethen i started fitting shipsthought about rerollingtraining for other ships but really im nearing 10m sprage
this received a lot of positive feedback from the features and ideas discussion forum so ive decided to post it here alsomost of us fall within two campsthose who love 00 local and those who hate it to me the current state of local isnt very satisfying and neither is the prospect of completely removing it so i propose a change that would be a small step making local a sovereignty upgradebasic overviewthe mechanics are simple unclaimed 00 space does not have local chat however upon claiming a star system the holder can immediately install a communication beacon on the infrastructure hub the beacon creates a local channel within the solar system that everyone automatically joins and cannot leave the beacon is created in a predetermined bookmarked spot in each solar system and can be warped to via overviewso what does this mean for piratesterroristsgankersthis communication beacon is very fragile a single battleship shooting at the beacon could disable it within fifteen minutes upon destruction of the beacon the system becomes dark a dark system no longer has local chat and acts similar to wh space this remains so until the sov holder repairs the beacon againa small gang could roam enemy systems destroying beacons as they went these systems would become dark and its inhabitants would be easy prey a single raid may not score very many kills as all of the inhabitants would still flee upon seeing you in local however under a sustained campaign of raids and roams you could easily catch enemy ratters miners and travelers off guard in dark systems it offers a lot more to those who are determinedso what does this mean for sovereignty holdersthis change is not completely onesided for the terrorists there are benefits for the carebears also the catch with communication beacons is that the owner can choose to turn off them off at anytime upon turning off a beacon the system becomes dark however the beacon can always be onlined immediatelyimagine if you are about to stage an assault on a neighboring sov holder your fleet forms up in one of your own star systems however as many of you already have experienced the enemy already knows that you are coming long before you ever reach their territory because of scouts watching local now imagine if local could be turned off you could turn off local chat on all of your neighboring systems your fleet could form up and travel stealthily of course your enemy would be suspicious at seeing all of your beacons turned off however he does not know how many ships you have and where you will strike in addition you could send groups of covert ops ships to pop the beacons in your enemys territory further adding to his confusion scouting by visual confirmation becomes more importanthave you ever felt frustrated with terrorist gatecamps a group of terrorists camps one of your gates as soon as you get a fleet ready and jump into the adjacent system the gatecamp immediately scatters because a scout on the other side raised the alarm its almost impossible to catch them but what if you could turn off local if local were turned off in the adjacent systems of the gatecamp a fleet could bounce them at anytimethe uses for turning off beacons are nearly endless for sov holders if you are planning a fancy mining op you could turn off the beacon in the system to conceal yourself however you risk being jumped its a trade no one knows you are there but you dont know if anyone else is thereto be continued
edit doh posted with my altan example scenariohere is how i envision this system playing outimagine that you are a generic 00 permanent resident you log in and immediately glance at your intel channel it lists in the announcementthe following systems are dark system names made up jkl9h mnb7n zw8utravel through these systems at your own risknaturally as a generic 00 permanent resident you would take care to avoid them but if those dark system contained the only nearby outpost your corp pos your alliance jumpgate or the system was located in a pipe you may find yourself going through them anyways some systems are prime targets for knocking down communication beaconsnow let us imagine that you are faced with a dilemna you need to do x but to get to the location of x you have to go through a system that is darkyou really cannot wait so you decide to ask in local jkl9h statusand then you get the response i went through a few minutes ago didnt see anything on the gatesso you then decide to jump through the jump into the dark system and hold your cloak you see nothing on dscan so you uncloak and prepare to warp but suddenly a red recon uncloaks next to you and points you oh noes  a few moments later a gang of red ships warps to the gate from their distant safe spot  life can be cruel in short the average resident is still fairly safe however there can be times where extensive red activity can make things extremely dangeroussummary tldrunclaimed 00 systems do not have local upon claiming an alliance can immediately anchor a communication beacon for a fee this beacon grants local chat to the system the beacon does not have a lot of health and can be destroyed very quickly by a very small gang destruction of a beacon removes local until the beacon is anchored again the sov holder can choose at anytime online or offline the communication beacon at will this can be used to great effect as a concealment or defensive tooldiscuss
i cannot support any solution that does not remove local from npc 00 regions
i see no reasion this wasent already implimented the loss of standing from declining an agent mission combined with the long timers upwards of 4 hours was implimented to prevent players from farming the most desirable misions the down side is that players cannot decline faction based missions that will negativly impact empire standings i propose to ballance the decline timer by making it reset when you sucessfully complete a mission from the agent in question this will allow you to decline multiple faction based missions more eaisly as the next mission will count as a blank slate
first to the frigatecruiser thing if ab frigates with nos already counter neuts how exactly will they suddenly become unkillable when fitting mod to counter neutsand secondly i find it saddening that active tanking is so uncommon on a pvp ship that it doesnt even occur to you that such a mod would be a huge buff to it lets see you try to fly an active armor tank mwding blaster ship against anything in your size class that has even a single neut
without need to be in nos range you get higher speed which makes tracking tanking easy as piewithout nos you free up a lot of fitting room on a frigate that can be used for more damageewari pretty much exclusively fly active tanked laser boats so am well aware of the feeling but lets say this module was fitted you lose a lowslot tankdamage for 1015 neut secured cap  now cycle your mwd once and see what happensyou wont be capped out as such but mwd goes inactive and gunstackle become dependent on natural recharge at 05 which is sod all  no changeyou are better off fitting a capacitor relay
nos used to be the best counter to neuts till ccp nerfed it into uselessnessnow people sometimes fit neuts but barely ever noscap injector is the traditional defense against neuts it works well enoughthere was a neat idea once to use smartbombs as defense against neutnos so activation of smartbomb would cause damage to anyone neuting you and maybe have some other protective effect
no the farther away you are the easier it is to track you it takes less tracking to hit an orbiting inty at 15km than the same inty at 5km with the same weaponbattleclinic doesnt have anything besides one geddon you lost a long time ago you have this evidence on another character what besides possibly a legion armor tanking active tanking nonfrigate hull with lasers do you flyi was more interested in the  neut effect the ops suggestion has rather than protected cap as such 15 protected cap isnt going to do a lot of good unless youre using capless guns
sum nosneut resisters can be added in to the damage control or if ships had inherited resistants to them with variable effects depending ship class and faction
isnt this basically what cap boosters do
do shield boosters and armor repairers mitigate incoming damage
in the same sense that fof missiles and drones counter ecms eccm is the direct counter module of ecm rest are workarounds same concept as cap booster vs neut the idea is introduce a direct counter module for neut which decreases its effectiveness since direct countermodules exist for all other forms of ew
its a bad idea because i think so
supportedsarcasm on who need this mod fly matar you idiots sarcasm off
i skimmed through and was gonna say should be only able to fit one but then i reread and shat my pants at how completely awesome and perfect this idea isonly thing is i think meta 5 should be 40 not 70 and i think cap protection should be 10 tops
hello everyonethis is an issue that we my corp have discovered while joining in on one of the incursions within amarr spacewhile there were too many neutrals in system  we tryed to make an overview tab so that only the dangerous pilots would appear and the npcs ofckos kill on sightspirates low security status pilotswartargetsthe problem is  being a militia corporation we have both corporate wartargets and militia wartargetsthe first  we have no problem with the latter is a bit trickier we are unable to include the militia wartargets on the overview without having the myriad of neutral pilots too we think it has something to do with that the militia wartargets have neutral standing towards usis there a way to solve this problem that we didnt know of or is it something that is just impossiblemy request is that ccp be made aware of this problem or am i posting it where it shouldnt be p
this probably should be in the test server feedback forumsince i dont do militia i would not have any firsthand experience with what you are referring to but it does sound like a problem that needs to be fixed
the stupid glitch of fw targets appearing neutral existed for a long time and as far as i know it was never fixed be especially careful whenever ure in a high sec system bordering low sec cause thats where they usually ninja gank

im intrigued how you get better range from artillery on the ferox than from rails im also intrigued on how they track better or have lower fitting costs or do better damagerangethe problem people have with the deimos is not that it doesnt work but rather that it is a 120mill cruiser that gets instantly primaried
im pretty sure rational thought doesnt really come into much consideration but its fun to see what random crap comes next personally im hoping he endorses laser hyperions
nope it fails as a blaster hull the slots are wrong the fitting is useless its slow the siggy is bloated its got a useless bonus  the list goes ondeimos  command loki  guards should  win  but they dont cause it sucks so much
pretty sure someone has already asked about this but just incase booyahstamp
i support this but i cant shake the feeling that it is somehow going to make some sneaky market scam possible
we get alerted for new email and when our skill queue empties out clone grades arent something we often think about and its easy to forget about upgrading it all together im just suggesting a little blinking popup like the email skill queue or certificate alert that notifies about your clone when its obsoletei just noticed today that my mining alt was skill languishing with an alpha clone at 7 million skillpoints thankfully she never got podded
yes strongly supported especially since being podded without an up to date clone is one of the most devastating if not the most devastating things that could possibly happen to you in eve it is clear that we should get a really tangible warning if we do not have one at least like when the skillqueue is empty character sheet flashing
i say if you have a skull by your name indicating that you are in fact a pirate then anybody should have free reign to attack you without reproach from concord
capital ships really need their own rig size the price of t2 large rigs is insane at the minute it makes no sence to have different sizes for all the sub caps then have a titan with the same size as a battleship
should have been done when they introduced rig sizesid even say capital size and supercapital size
logically i agree butwe must look at it from both sides if the rig was designed large first and it fufilled the maximum task it needed to and fit on capital size ships and bs hulls then logically why make the rig bigger if it worked they instead made them smaller to fit on smaller hulls where the ships could not spare the space for a rig of the large variation the reverse argument is that they were designed for small ships first and have been scaled up to adjust for size and effectiveness then one could argue that large rigs would not beable to effectively deliver the same reward to the capital hull the problem in this argument comes about when we consider the macharialhyperion and other such bs hulls that rival capital hulls in size furthermore titans would need their own size of rig because they dwarf all ships in size so essentially youd have small medium large capital titan but the problem being if we scale up cost of build with the same benefit t2 titan rigs would cost in the tens of billions at which point they wouldnt be usedso as much as i logically support this i do not support the second argument as it will lead to unneeded inflation in cost to fit capitals
you realise t2 rig prices will increase when you add their own rig sizet2 rigs are barely used on regular caps pretty much only on super caps also some on sub caps but that is irrelevant for this putting them on supers is not optional they will all get them increase their component requirements 5 times for capital rigs the component prices will skyrocket and t2 rigs become more expensive
you just proved that t2 rigs need tweaking thank you

lets go under the assumption that local chat is created through the sov holder npc or player keeping track of who uses the jumpgates someone comes through the gate they get added someone leaves they get removed yes all very simple we know thisthe question is why do the sov holders tell you this they own the system maybe they can make some isk off it if youre in an npc corp your pay tax up the ass that corporation uses some of that tax to pay the sov holder for local data thus explains why you can see everyone so now if you are in a player run corp well now your corp has to pay the sov holder a wee bit of tax to see local tax for player corp should be less than npc so as not to buff npc corps this system can be extended of course to low sec and npc 00 now null sec why the hell would you sov holder tell your enemy how many of you there are so only blues should have access to local if the roamersinvaders want it then they need spies or learn how to probe or use dscani just got done reading another no more local thread so i decided to throw one out myself adding further to the problemthe first thing people say is that will kill 00 and roaming will die maybe how the  do you know how do i knowedit this actually belongs in the speakers corner not assembly
nerf you buff me i should get local you shouldnt would you like to bring concord over to guard you too

before the new contact system was deployed you were able to make separate folders for your contacts to easily manage who you hatedwar target and who were your friends now you can only separate your contacts by standing and who of those many contacts show on the watch list this causes trouble for when your trying to keep the regular guys you just dont like from the wt you want to keep track of in the bad and terrible standing sections further more it keeps you from separating wts into their separate corpsi propose that we need the ability to make separate folders in the watch list section of the contacts so we can separate are war targets from regular pirates players we dont like and the occasional friend we like to know is on or not this will also allow us to separate are war targets into their individual corps for easier tracking lastly it will make cleaning out old wts from your contact list an easier task with out unintentionally removing someone you dont want tothis was something we were able to do with the old system and needs to be brought back with the newi asked if anyone in the eve help channel knew if there was a way to make folders in the new contacts system and nobody could tell me if their is a way please help 
if they want to do the web20 thing then a tags field is plentymeans very little in the way of interface so little that its kinda amazing that they left it out originally and didnt patch it in the next week
definitely needs to be changed
i propose that ship maintenance bays on capitals have an audit log of who removes ships from the baysthis may reduce theft of ships andor highlight who ismay steal ships that are not their own
better yet how bout we get a notification when someone takes a ship out dude people can be pretty sneaky with that stuff
very much supported
although i kinda agree with you balance should be done around common fits not niche fits like the 8kms dram
oh but i agree which is why i havent supported this speed is not the problem  it is the ability to do anythingeverything at once with very little need to change fitscutting a few gridcpu units off it will allow it to still pwn face but without such a laissezfaire approach to fitting it should be able to outperform afs and interceptors but not at the same time and especially not without requiring a refit
so my main is amarr and with each day edging towards the aeon part of me is saying yay but part of me is screaming no you are still a young man dont do that to yourself due mainly to how ridiculous that thing looklogically speaking that design is fail because the armor only covers the port side the other sides are all internal structuresvisually speaking that thing look just like a banana split cut in half at the center on a dishso the whole thing doesnt makes sense visually and logicallyplease just replace the 3d model with some of the deviant art submit or the recent ccp design competition they are readily available and easy enough to do i do 3ds max at my free time its easy to copy past designs if u have the frontlefttopdown views as submitted by those ppl
am i crazy for liking it i mean look
the aeon will be a nicelooking hull once they finish it
yet another the aeon is ugly imo threadmust be monday
only after they change the mutated potato to something sane and raven was still designed by two men that never met
this but you have worst than aeon minmatar ships seems theyre made of wood and concrete so ugly ho and wallente ships too the only bioships in the game when will they start by using sharks instead of walles
according to the backstory it was a private financed team and they did it very very secretly
i can only cratch my head at how the archon could be related to the aeon in any way
good pointill update the opoverheating from the start is a valid use of oh for snagging etc
they have mini carriers its called the dominix
came expecting battletoadsleft disappointedand no this is a very bad idea

i guess noobs dont need equipment and like to pay more then everyone else
im on the same page as td here
complete overhaul of the wardec systemi approvealso while youre at it give neutral logis aggro kthx
i agree that it is an exploit but several of the high sec wardec rules and mechanics are barely above exploits while others are so griefer friendly that it is embarrassingunless the whole mechanic is redone the loopholes are needed as a balancing factor the simple fact that someone can declare a war and dont fight for weeks is one of the worst mechanics
thanks for your comments so far much apreciated there is a thread running on shc right now and if you take the time to read it you will see there are ways to counter it but it is stupid the lengths you have to go to wardec pos loopholemore points of view from other csm members would be apreciated
seconded
when you think of it thats sort of the way it works in rl
well that makes it all worthwhile lmao
im curious insufficient how
1 karma
there are many more people that will be made aware of the minutes by this being in general discussion those who dont check the devblog page every few hours the general forumgoer is general more aware of a new thread in general discussion rather than in information portal which due to its nature very rarely has new threads to read and is less lurked
yeah advertising of those blogs is well non existent youd think theyd have a sticky in gd for themthumb up
people are going to karma their own posts with their 235 accounts glad to see csm is doing good work
i hope this was not just the csms idea because if it was we need some new csms
i glanced at the minutes but must have missed the part where the csm asked about a timeframe for getting bugs fixed in the game product could someone tell me what the resolution to the bugs issue was
theres nothing really interesting in the new minutes at least compared to whats been hinted at elsewhereif you read the actual minutes it was ccps ideaimplementation and the csm pointed out how comically exploitable it is
so ccp dont listen to the csms thats even worse so what was the point of the csms
ahem clears throatattention stupid people of the forumsjust because it was discussed there and those things were tossed around does not mean it will make it into the final product ccp reserves the right to put in those features discussed or not to implement them at allthe purpose of these dev blogs are to gauge player reaction to some of the proposed changes and they will adjust implementation accordingly that being said karma buttons are a bad idea cause in eve negative karma means you are doing something right
from the context it sounds like the csm wasnt aware of said feature until the work had already been completed so i think the better question is why did ccp not request feedback from the csm beforehand
yeah exactly ccp should follow everything the csm say without hesitation or question
nope not saying that at all but it is a pretty dumb idea and the flaws have been pointed out by the csm so hopefully nothing will come of it
oh boyjust what the forums need an i love me button
i do love me
is it monday yetin the meantime we can sit back and all agree that console fps  pc fps there is also an office pool going around on the time frame of when the minutes are released till we hit 100 pages of rage buy in is 100 million isk secured by mewelcome to world of darkness er i mean eve online the patch we refer to as an expansion even though it still isnt finishedalso those who still has a working gold copy of the legend of zelda represent
yep its monday and yet nothing in terms on minutes just kidding p any chance for timeframe on when today part will be released
24 days and countingzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
since this seems as good a place as any in the unofficial blogged minutes the option to increase true sec so worse rats if a system is used more is presented is the csm really in favor of thati can understand on a first glance it seems as a nice way agaisnt macros but as more often with such solutions you hurt the real people more than macros especially those alliances that are actually really using their space and you promote building large 00 wastelands doign the same for agent quality i can agree on but in 00 you hurt the small alliances since they usually use their space quite intensively since they dont have the power to grab more than a few systems and you give the large once more incentive to bulldozer every small alliance they see since unoccupied space is benificial for their members eventually it will get really nice truesec
i have a few that should make the list imo about bots in eve
when is ccp going to boost the jump ranges of the bos and allow covert cynos to be lit in high sec allowing covert cyno to be activated in empire will bring a whole new tactic to empire pvp along with the bo buff to jump range and fuel usage on bridging bombersand other recons to the field of battlei suggest that this be done by the final patch for the sansha incursionbut that is just my opinion on this topic
bumporooni
as others have said an increase in jumpportal range and reduction in fuel consumption would be greatill throw in with the t2 resists comparable to other t2 ships and stats equal to or greater than their standard bs equivalents having the jump drive and portal ability doesnt justify a weaker ship  we pay and train to have that capability
flog
aside from them needed a bit of a buff towards range and fuel i think the major reason why you dont see them used so much is because they require a tremendous amount of planning and out of game skill so many things need to go right and people need to really have their  together to use them well its much easier to throw a gang together and roam your way to a target than it is to meticulously plan out logistics that being said they still provide essential services
me hums the unnerf blackops song it has a very catchy tunestar lightstar brightfirst star i see tonighti wish i may i wish i mighthave this wish come true tonighti wish for bigger fuel bay and extended jump range at least by a little please with a cherry on top  ccp i promise to not bother you about fixing other stuffat least until tomorrow
most of this and maybe enough of a maintenance bay for people to change mods not hold any sort of shipalso who was the dev who though of the agility bonus for sin what were you thinkingimprove these ccp and things will be better
supportednot sure if its been said before but why not go along the stealth bomber root fit them out with capital weapons with some bonuses anty capital anyone
make them able to fit capital sized weapon and can shoot target battleship and up similar to the idea of stealth bomber
hmmm you either chose a stupid name on purpose didnt put anything more than 3 seconds of effort into choosing a character name that could possibly be with you for years or you bought a character with a stupid name you made a choice clearly the wrong one and now you want to reroll it eve is all about choices and living with them sorry you dont like yours but your gonna have to live with it not supporting this one
i have a horrible name
aeronwenhmm well i hate to break it to ya but in real life guess whati can change my name also since this is not real life and i actually pay money to play this thingdo you feel it would be bad to permit this for anyone involved i dont understand ccps logic at all here if my name offends youi can change it if it offends me the one payingtough i like eve because you have the right to offend whomever and sensitive role players can get all bunched over this not actually being real life and some people dont have 247 to play this
i chose my name because i wanted to play the game as quick as possible  i didnt know the tag would stick with me forever
this topic has been raised dozens of times the reason it is shot down over and over is that it can easily be misused the prime example is corp thefts if your character is involved in a large enough theft that name is mud if the name can be changed the only downside to corp theft is having to change the name of your character the bio has been deemed unacceptable as the old name is needed to be seen in chat channels by those who have been wronged by the characterthe only reasonable suggestion ive seen to counter the potential for exploiting a name change is adding some form of kos tag that can be added at a personalcorpalliance level and allows for a description of the reason it was added this tag would have to stick regardless of name change it would likely also need to be viewable by everyone in the case of sold characters having a hidden downsidea winning suggestion for name changes would be one that is fair available to those who have a legitimate reason for changing their character name and cannot be exploited
all in favour of a name changebut restrictions need to be applied some examples i can think ofonly doable once a year like remapssame cost as a character portrait swaphistory of name change is on the character sheethistory of name change is on the limited apicant change a name within 48 hours of leaving a corpeve is about consequences sure but its also about deception too and you read about this a lot in the chronicles people getting new faces and new namesif a corp was stolen from its common sense the thief would change their identity and to be honest im all for that if the corp really want revenge then they have 48 hours to work with to tag the thief with a  10 when the thief name changes its up to the corp to go through their  10s to figure out the theifs new identityi figure the other restrictions are self explanatory the cost and once a year allowance to avoid exploit plus the history of the name change so anyone can see who you whereedit forgot to add  cant leave a corp within 48 hours of a name change

cant believe this is a 2 years old topic but ill thumbs up it anywayyes pretty please
what if siege was reduced to 5 mins and if they were allowed remote reps while in siege
make super caps log off time to 30 min can only use fighter bombers and no other dronesthey have the power to insta pop any thing smaller than themselves they have the tank to log off in most engagementssuper carriers already become the ultimate god ships in eve in my opinion 15 billion is really cheap for their performance since they always appear in groups these days so theyre very hard to losejust check out most cap killmails involved supercarriers almost all of them died at around their base hp carrier spider tank triagesiege mods have no chance at all to tank themive seen so many times fc requests in cap fleetssuper caps only if you dont have one get out and save the spot lolso if you have a spare alt with carrier lvl 5 get in super carrier this god ship really worth itit has ultimate dps against all other ships it has great tank capital sized logistic platform super ewar abilityecm burst and most importantly you can have all of them at same time in one ship let ccp decide if they need a ultimate god ship in this game
not that i am in anyway a capital buff or even know alot about how capitals workbut i am siting here thinking wow that old titatin dd would be a great counter to scs just swating down all there dps but having so large a ehp that i belive it would take a insane number of titatins to insta pop one meaning that a fleet would be better off in a longer larger fight by timeing the old titatin dds to clear out as much sc dps i mean there going to run out of fighter bombers at some point rightalso what is stoping titatins from taking out sc with there curent dd just asking as i realy dont know
why again jammable why is yet again caldary ecm so privilidgd falcons are powerfull enough why dont arazu get such privilige first more skills then ecm mods then marauders then thisgive supercarriers partial ewar vulnerability only all ewar has 15th of its normal effect on them so you need like 40 points to keep a sc in place and 10 webs to keep it from moving but you should be able to do it
the problem with the oldstyle dd is that it kills not just the fighters but pretty much everything other than battleships and capitalsa level v doomsday does 3m points of raw damage properly set up supercarriers hel aside typcally have upwards of 50m ehp you need a lot of doomsdays to kill a supercarrier
input from an actual womangreatly appreciatedand yes i want to stress that doa style wobblies are not desired boobs dont need to move just from the act of breathing

yes
1 in a thread about  it just censored a bad evil t word i meant boobies ofc
actually theres a very scientific argument put forward in arthur c clarkes novel rendezvous with rama as to why this shouldnt be included in the game the effects of low or zero gravity on the female body causes a great deal of distraction for crew members with more than one serious accident being the result of a wellendowed female officer walking through the navigation deck
omg lord embra thank you a lot man now i know why they are caled hybrid they combineall this things  but im reskilling minmater rightnow to bad didnt do this from the start
you forgot to mention very hard fitting issues which is also true for blastersoh and why blaster ships have to be the slowest deimos is slower than the zealot wtf who tested this 
supported only titan looks like capital to me atm
bump
i think i would actually cry with joy if ccp did something like this damps are just a huge waste of mids in all but a few very specific situations 5 bonus per level is pitiful equivalent to just one extra damp if you have a rack of four oh wowchanging the bonus to 10 per level would mean a ship with 2 damps would effectively have 3  sounds reasonable when ccp nerfed damps they neglected to buff the gallente recon ships sound familiarthis would be great but like you say there probably needs to be some kind of drawback part of the problem with armor buffers is that you need 3xtrimark and often some slaves to achieve a similar ehp to that of a shield buffer equivalent without nerfing your dps however this makes your ship bricklikeperhaps just an agility nerf rather than top speed  allowing the boat to charge in and tackle but not be used like a nanoshield boat whilst it sounds like a great idea the balance must always be fastlow hp and slowhigh hp how about allowing some gallente ships to run their mwd for longer ala thorax allowing them to potentially catch kiters alternatively reducing heat damage from mwd ol would have a similar effect base speed could be mainly unchangedthis is a problem especially with the activetanked ships myrm brutix hype when i crosstrained to minmattar i couldnt believe it when i fitted out a hurricane i was throwing on 1600800 rt plates midclass guns 2 neuts mwd and the whole lot fitted with an extra mid to throw sebowebetc on then i compare this to poking around with similar gallente fits convincing myself that putting a reactor control ii 20 pg in the lows was perhaps intended the hype is not the end of the world because the mega and domi are respectable but the brutix and myrm both having a repper bonus is dreadful one of the most common pvp classes and there is one one choice of tank which happens to be terrible unless you lolfit 3 reppers on the myrm and use it solo anyone flying a brutix will fit a shield tank in their right mind as the potential active tank is pointless and armor buffer makes a small increase over the shield with a massive speed penaltyall i can think is that ccp are holding out to improve gallente in a clever way instead of slapping on halfbaked ideas
whilst it sounds like a great idea the balance must always be fastlow hp and slowhigh hp yet minmatar ships in general tank better than gallente ships gallente have to use slots for fitting minmatar dontthis is a problem especially with the activetanked ships myrm brutix hype when i crosstrained to minmattar i couldnt believe it when i fitted out a hurricane i was throwing on 1600800 rt plates midclass guns 2 neuts mwd and the whole lot fitted with an extra mid to throw sebowebetc on then i compare this to poking around with similar gallente fits convincing myself that putting a reactor control ii 20 pg in the lows was perhaps intended this all has to do with the ridiculously easy fitting requirements for 425mm autocannons for ships with the second highest pg and cpu minmatar and the ridiculously difficult fitting reqs of blasters for ships with the second worst pgu and cpu gallentea good comparison is the repper myrm you can only fit heavy electron blasters worst gallente blasters but you can slap on 425mm autocannons best minmatar autos no cap issues better engagement range better everythingalso light electron blasters worst have same fitting requirements as largest small autocannons best
as far as armor rigs go i think an agility penalty is the best of both worlds since it doesnt completely encroach on the mobility of shield tankers but it doesnt completely kill armor tankers ability to catch shield shipswith regards to the base speed honestly its the only solution the thorax can already run its mwd longer than most mwd fit ships because of the cap bonus it gets it still doesnt let it catch a ruppy and even if the thorax is faster on paper unless its a good 1200ms faster by the time it catches the ruppy itll be in deep structure and will just get popped anyway due to the ruppys better tracking and better tank the only other possible solution is to make the dps on blasters ridiculously high so that they could make up the damage difference in the small window of time they have the target webbed and scrammed though if you can never catch your target youre already deadits important to note that the armor rig changes and the base speed boost have to come hand in hand for them to work if you take off the armor rig penalties your ships are still the slowest in the game because a you have to fit plates to have a hope of surviving anything and b their base speed is the 2nd slowest in the game just barely in front of caldari who dont have any speed penalties and actually go faster than gallente ships in practice if you increase the base speed but dont take the speed penalty off the rigs the ships are still going much slower than their minnie and maybe even caldari counter parts while still having the absolute worst ranged weapons system in gamekiting is supposed to be a very specialized thing it is in other games and what people here have forgotten i think is that your tank while kiting is not supposed to be your health its the fact that the enemy cant hit you kiting means staying completely out of your opponents range through speed and peppering him until he dies you are not supposed to have ships with massive dps massive tank and massive speed because it completely unbalances the equation when it comes to fighting them even in the big 00 fleets this game has become about who can be the biggest nano with logi support and thats not how it should be kiting should be a solo thing or in very specialized small gangs but should have no application in bigger fights of 10 vs 10 or greaterso i guess that my point is speed needs to be based on weapon range and not some arbitrary thing based on racial hulls or whether or not youre a shield tanker if you want to kite you should have to severely gimp your fit to get enough speed to stay out of the range of blaster ships melee units if you will the whole advantage of ranged weapons is that multiple people can put lots of dps on any target at once to give them so much more speed than close range ships without forcing them to completely gimp their damage is frankly ridiculous and is the root of the death of blaster pvp
if you cant pvp in gallente you suck in my opinionwhat ship isnt op from them ishtar ishkur daredevil vexor maybe a few need a small buff and hybrids need a small buff small hybrids are totally  ownage though and buffing small hybrids people will be flying dds and ishkurs and ranises so much it will be rediculousmedium hybrids though could use a little of a buff large i have no idea never trained big guns and never will

if it gets an ao rating in the us it most certainly would cause eves downfall
i believe thats the point many players want an ao ratingwhat ever ao meansthey dont want a kidified world that is friendly and hello kitty compatable with everything being so kid friendly leave us our evewhere men arewell most often men
i support thislife dose not have a g rating why should eve
you dont understand ao is adults only this is one rating above the m rating for the esrb it is a game killer a lot like the nc17 rating is a moviekiller
ill admit to it id do it for a month or two yeah why not
bumping since i finally have time to start on the elevator proposal thingamabob
i cant support this for one quite simple reason eves own lore dictates that stations particularly those in empire are weapons free environments can you really think of a good reason why any empire faction would allow the unrestricted use of weaponry in a space station its established in numerous chronicles and both the ccp sanctioned novels that station interiors are home to more than just pod pilotsthere are businesses of all types the mega rich who want to live off planet and then the tens of thousands of staff who keep the stations running not to mention everyday folk using the station as a waypoint having combat in stations would make absolutely no sense whatsoever no matter which way you look at it the only small tiny glimmer of hope for in station combat that i can think of would be to have a pvp arena in one section of the station where prearranged fights could take place fights could be arranged in much the same way as war decs are issued in space of course the big difference being that it would require both pilots to enter the arena as far as i am concerned however if you really want pvp there is a whole universe out there for you to do it in
ugh noout of all the bad reasons the fiction ccp made up to go along with the game doesnt agree with the gameplay is probably the worst ccp can rewrite fiction whenever they choose to with absolutely no consequences for game mechanics but sacrificing game mechanics on the altar of fiction is jabberwockian
and that is exactly the problem relatively realistic how often are you shoot at when walking the street of your cityhow often someone you know is murderedwe character in the eve world are not gunho mercenaries assaulting a enemy stronghold we are very wealthy pilots that fight in space and would like to relax and show off our money when we are in stationin real life people like us will be the mafia boss going to the high class casino or the rock star going to a party there will be a very small chance of getting killed but it is a small chance and adequately depicted by the risks outside the stations combat in station would be like assaulting a terrorist den every time you want to go to a bar for a coffee look real life even in afghanistan or iraq there isnt a gun shooting with several deaths at the local market every day but that is exactly how a station will become if open combat was allowed try to keep a space station operative if you get battles in its interior every day fisticuffs barroom brawls and so on are plenty acceptable even back street muggings the problem is that even in the less law abiding zones of space most of the time you should be capable of minding your own business in station without troubles they are the mechanics we see in rl even in the dangerous zones you generally can keep up a almost normal life it is a requirement to keep up the society
i wish ccp would commit to not iterate on wis until fw is fixed low sec is boosted and other actual game play items are addressed hasnt wisdust sucked enough blood from ccp do we really feel they need to spend more time on it so instead of everything waiting 18 months lets push it back to 24 months
this thread is a little silly and this guy demonstrated this perfectly first of all we are not mercs we are men with wealth of nations and we can nuke the otherguy whosefacewedontlike with a single though we heave wealth comparable to that of megacorporations and an average corp in eve has more military might then a small nation we buy planets with billions of people and for some it is pocket change and we are immortal with hose capabilities i would not go around punching people if i need a station captured i dont go there myself i buy and fully equipped army of several thousand men on the pocket change i have left on my alt after fitting a battleship think about it like his when george bush did not not like  husein he did not send him hatemail or punch him instead usa declared war on iraq secondly ccp is nowhere near the point where it would allow us to fing they are just getting the character creator right before we can fight we need a combat system new skills for eachriflegun back story clothes station interiorsexteriors its a ton of work only comparable to making a whole new game and then there are whatever problem we have in eve like with my hybrids not blowing the other dude to pieces as well as i want them to this is very far down the road and is not even a proposal so i will not support itbut a the end of the day would i like to plant a couple nuclear charges on the other guys kronos definately
these threads show a complete lack of understanding about what kind of would capsuleers live inhighsec stations secure capsuleersonly areas would not be staffed by a few bored and underpaid tsa guards the money and resources that would go into ensuring the gods can walk around safely would be unimaginable to normal people and its laughable that players are suggesting someone would just bring a gun to shoot a rivallowsec stations being any less secure also misses the mark completely those places would likely have vastly more ruthless and efficient security than anything highsec would manage just cause they both have experience and incentive to protectand alliance 00 stations should be pretty obvious
not supportedmostly because you said first person shooter no for any sort of gunfights in stations for eve it should be a third person tactical shooterthat being said i dont support the ability to just war dec and shootout in any station if 2 corps are warring out in 00 and want to take over a station i could see something like this as being worthwhile other than that no thanks
supportedwhen you get killed outside of pod youre dead for good its the pod that takes neural imprint dying outside of it means biomassing there are too many pewpew tards in game they need to be biomassed
screw personal armor id send drones to do my bidding humanoid ones their endoskeleton covered with living tissueneither gankers nor concord will know the difference id never have to leave my warm cozy pod but seriously what makes you think they dont have terminationcircuits wired to every podpilotif you act up in a station then the local authorities scramble your brainstaking the technical possibilities of the eveuniverse into consideration that would not be too far fetched
just put weapon detectors in high sec stations if you carry a gun you get fined and they take it away low sec can have less draconian andor more random enforcement null sec is the wild west problem solved
i would support this idea if walking in station required a separate specialized clone purchase  something cheap killing of this clone would not effect the space ship part of the game in any wayin that case we can have whole new instation combat mechanics with isk loss for equipment and clone costs being camped inside a station would simply mean that you cant walk around freely but you can still stay docked no problem
this is stupid youre forgetting a very important question herewhy the hell would you be allowed to carry guns in highsecurity areas guys station environments are nothing at all like deep friggin space theyre always going to be tightly controlled and always have considerable security with the obvious exception of lowsec pirate havens i somehow doubt allianceowned 00 stations would have lax security not that pirates and mercs are even allowed to dock to begin with theyre going to be scanning down each and every capsuleer that exits their ship for weaponry not to mention capsuleers are segregated from the rest of society to begin with sure if someone wanders outside of capsuleerdesignated areas there should be danger but every single capsuleer who wants to shoot people in that area would first have to find someone selling the weapons within the station and then find the target and hope theyre not in the capsuleer zone which again would have weapon scanning at every single possible entry pointanyway im not supporting this stations are stations not deep space never should the twain meet
i seriously cannot see any point to allow ganking in stationno shipsno lootjust griefing
i believe this should be another game i think it should be completely safe zone that shall we call itdocking area when you leaving docking area then eve online client closing and loading another game that op is talking about but loading directly in the game without any titles sponsor ads and credits directly in the environment that op describes entering in to eve online back could require identification process same like in the customs and this would just simple logging back in the eve universe in this case  back into docking areaif this station fps will something like eve universe just in the format of fps and will have subscription for it i personally do not believe it is possible to make subscription for fps then by entering into eve from it could have similar identification process in the customsconclusion this is interesting idea that requires work on it and i like itsupport
eve fiction excuse plus all caps of improved logiceve fiction excuse eve fiction excuse coupled with real life analogy excuse blahand some people do not go around suicide ganking or mining or running l4 missions or hence commit to iterate this thread is pretty much to discuss how gameplay would look its doable at least for station highsec areas that the mechanic would work that way after combat was already initiated but doesnt make sense to have people getting instapopped by stationconcord all over the place thank you too for actually commenting on the mechanics rather than the fiction id point out though that even with customs agents you can get around them and still smuggle and even in highsec space you can attack people and then take the consequences a blanket ban on combat in certain areas is antithetical to the nature of eves gameplay there doesnt need to be a separate clone though clone loss is clone loss medical clones should be allowed for both and yes that keeps being camped into a station as something significant rather than meaning that you need to hop out of your pod and go drinking
youre right the developers build a game first and then build the lore around it afternow explain to me what kind of fiction you would build to explain why the hell people would be allowed to shoot each other inside stations
oh and as long as were going to have walking in stations be part of the eve client there doesnt seem to be a reason to transfer to a separate client to run ganking in stations too why not just treat it as wis with guns
its good gameplay and perfectly fits into the kind of game that eve is if you really require fiction a wizard did it

well too bad it is what it is gotta deal with it
i approve of a counter for cap ships i think titans should be able to bridge subcaps immediately or it would be near impossible to defend a cyno ship and actually expect to have an engagement everyone would have seen your fleet coming which would lead to either less pvp which is the major isk sink or less predictable fleet engagement escalations ie unable to predict where large fights will take place and thus schedule server resources for them some level of surprise attack needs to be possibleedit support
supported hotdrops should be more expensive
but in what place should pvp ever be fairit is a perfectly fair strategy just like an ambushsorry eph 90 of the time we agree dead on but on this we do not ambushing  hot drops are an expected tactic obvious trap is obviousill take then on in order of the 31 20 seconds from the grid loaded tackled cyno up jumping landing locking confirming tackle and repping the cynoprimary tackle and applying dps assuming a ship is using an mwd cause we are assuming 00 and that the tackle was a hic in even 5 seconds at 1 k per sec they will be 5 k away from the hic 10 seconds 10k now thats battleship speed bc doing 12 2k per sec will make it the same or double the distance assuming the hic is at 0 on the bss well then they have to get 30 k in lets say 10 seconds if they havent hit the gate and jumped 2 what are you talking about sir ive killed carriers and dreads with less than 20 people not to mention when dropped with superior numbers only ever on gates or stations we would just jump when they appeared knowing they have session timer3 haha no sorry 20 seconds is still enough time for an undocking maelstrom to 1 volley a recon or a frigate 4 i cant debate points that dont existi dunno i cant agree with any talk of hot drops being exploitslets follow the premise that ccp admits that meta gaming is a valid game mechanic and tactictherefore the use of it in defence is also an expected tactic therefore the defense and counter ability of hot dropping is obviously meta gaming as much as some dont like to admit it the north has been using it to fight tri for years do you mean recon cynobecause covert ops cynos are for black ops not caps also not for jump frieghtersif you wanna use black ops sure thats fine but ccp should not and probably wont limit the ability to use caps offensively with the same resultnot to mention black ops cynos are dangerous ships that can light them have low ehp the ships jumping to them have low rangefinally ccp endorses hot drops proof of point is black ops cynos piercing cyno jammers but they do not limit it to black ops onlyok im going to take each paragraph one at a time1 why should it be balanced why should a 100 man alliance beable to effectively a 5000 man alliance it doesnt make sense when an army sends more troops to a fight because they can is it fair no but its their right if you cant counter the hot drop run away 2 jump frieghters jumping to and from lowsec or through npc space is dangerous and sometimes unavoidable good try tho3 dont you mean the time it would take to push the hot drop to useless as an offensive aggressive tactic you ever tried to make a rapier last 30 seconds against bs it goes pop when they lock4 basically you would make cynos and caps as an offensive weapon useless except when your jumping to a fight that is already engaged or killing a tower5 they already have time to gtfo easily i escaped a hot drop in a fcking phoon 30 carriers vs me and 3 guys they dropped us when we engaged their bait nearly killed it while we were making rage and staying outa point rage from the carriers then warped away that was 2 bs 2 bc and a dictor so your telling me you cant get away from a hic to be continued
continuedhic  plus some other tackle before their carrier friends jump cyno cant move meaning bubble cant move meaning burn the tackle and gtfo not hard also some tips if it looks like a trap assume it is engage the target aligned or if on a gate with only 1 ship or 2 which are aligned this will force them to show their hand or wait to get a better opportunitythey only change to cyno mechanics i want to see changed is if a ship is warp scrammed or jammed or neuted one of the three it cant open a cyno fieldtho i do agree with some of your points my nc brother i fail to see why you support the change proposed in its current form instead of stating your approval of an idea that you deem appropriate as the ideas listed above remove surprise from pvp as the only surprise in pvp is login traps gate traps hot drops cloaked fleets some what a surprise not really tho cause numbers are known titan bridge hot drops and undock traps1 is an exploit 2 are useable but easily scoutable and usually do not work 2 involve the cyno mechanic that would stand to be changed and 1 isnt really a surpriseif one loses the ability to jump to a cyno immediately all the fair skinned recon ships will be relegated to logistics work and transit ops instead of one of their primary roles and dont say light the cyno off grid cause you know what that would leave omg cyno off grid warp away tell the bombers to bomb it they wont be here for 30 seconds which would leave the job to triple plated bs which might stand up to a small fleet for a short time but against a large fleet will still melt quicklyare you fracking kidding me so you have 25 bs on grid say 250 mil per bsm thats 625 bil they hot drop you with a recon worth 150mil fitted plus 10 carriers each woth 11 bil fitted no support other then that well son it is already a wager that if they dont win they lose 1115 bil double the cost for half your numbers not to mention the recon can only tackle 1 or 2 and the carriers wont lock you in time to stop you from warping offfurthermore 25 bs dps conservatively 600 each usually higher vs 1 hic for 10 seconds thats 15000 dps over the ten seconds unless this guy is fitting to tank multiple old school dds do you think that he will tank your 150k damage now assuming my fleet fit chimera lands on grid and i have a sebo loaded with a script i can lock your bs in 98 seconds wow so from the time i land to the time i can attack you is 98 seconds ok now lets add a second for reaction time of the hic landing and not cynoing immediately and a second for the caps to respond and 3 seconds for them to load and see grid and have mods primed and locking thats 15 seconds aint it well that means that your 150k damage just jumped so 225k damage guarentee you melt the hic before then so either a you engaged in a very obvious trap or b your using smaller gangs or quicker ships to the argument of them trashing rr bs gangs yes of course they do carriers and dreads are the counter to bs but an rr bs gang sound beable to tank them long enough to deagress and jump off a gate or dock for god sakesare people failing to see that caps are pvp ships aswell and the natural counter to bs cyno being their only way to attack and move it is unbalanced and unfair to make it so that their chance at pvp is gimped compare them to a gate trap bait yells red box you jump you load you lock you attack you will find the time for engage is similar stop hating on older players and cap pilots just cause we like to use our caps to fight doesnt mean we should be punished because the 100 man alliance wants my station in fade and well they cant fight us and when they roam through and we hot drop them for coming into our space that we have some how committed a wrong i still cannot support this tomfooler
basically obvious baits and traps are obvious the choice to engage is your but you choose to engage again unknown numbers art of war good book you should read it
im not suggesting that the game be balanced so a 100 player alliance can effectively fight a 5000 player alliance im only suggesting that the 5000 player alliance should have an omnipresent i win button in the form of being able to hotdrop multiple supercapitals on a bunch of folks in battleships taking pot shots at abanoned posesshow me a jump freighter pilot who would be happy with you lighting a cyno for them into a pirateinfested system the sensible ones will wait for a quiet moment you light the cyno and jump the dozen seconds or so required to lock onto the cyno is not enough time for redneuts to warp to the location leaving time for the freighter to dock or warp out after jumpingplan your engagements better so youre not trying to hold down a bs fleet with a recon dont enter system with a solo recon with the expectation of trapping 30 battleships at the very least youll want a hic on grid doing the trapping while the cyno is lit safely out of range of the targets off grid sounds like a good planthats right capitals and supercaps will not be starting the fights they will only be finishing them other people will be responsible for springing the trap and holding the targets on grid for the 30odd seconds it takes the supercaps to arriveyou got away once but there are plenty of instances on the killboards where a halfdozen supercarriers have jumped a solo battleship or a small squadron of bshacs now what if your computer was slower at loading assets than the guys arriving on grid or what if the folks arriving on grid knew what they were doing and had their dronesfighters attacking you before the carriers could get a target lockthe hotdrops ive witnessed have involved neutrals in lowsec popping a cyno warp scrambling the target supercap fleet arriving on grid in a matter of seconds and the fight being over before i could warp from the gate to the fight by the time the recon is dead the supercap fleet has already arrivedhotdropping capitals instantaneously is in my opinion hyperescalation of a combat situation if we have to plan on every single 1v1 in lowsec being instantly escalated to 1 vs supercap fleet people will get sick of flying in lowsec as more and more bored supercap pilots resort to jumping small fleets in lowsec well find even fewer people bothering to fly in lowsecthere needs to be a greater risk when deploying capital ships than being stuck in a system for a few minutes until they can jump out there should not be a need to dock up every time a neutral enters system for fear of being hotdropped by a supercarrier fleetif you spring a trap involving a couple of bses and then summon the cap fleet good for you there must be a proper trap and it must be sprung no more suddenly capitals thousands of them
how about1 a short delay between cyno light and ability jump 1020 seconds reduced from 20 to 10 by cyno skill should not affect other cyno usage too heavilyand2 a new midslot module called a cyno jammer similar to most ecm modules but with all optimal no falloff and 100 chance but a heavy cap usage making the ship susceptible to capping out  neutingsocountertocynosfit a cyno jammers and be quick and effective at using it kill the cyno ship while hes jammed or flywarp offcounterthecounterneutjam the cynojammer or wait until he caps out or have more cyno shipsmaybe something like this could be used exclusively on the underutilised eafs
you could make cyno ship invulnerable for 15 seconds to compensate if people are worried they get popped before anyone can come through
your proposal impacts the vast majority of players that use conventional cynos that do not participate in hawt dropping your basically asking for a change because you feel this tactic is not fair so yeah lets make logistics that much more of grind
are you aware of the growing tide of opinion about removing jump bridges and reducing the jump range of jumpcapable ships the idea is to make logistics an important part of maintaining null sec sovereignty no longer will running supplies in or out be as simple as walking to the shopsrequiring a delay before cyno can be jumped to will not impact logistics except in busy neutralred systems where you shouldnt be flying without a fleet anyway perish the thought that deploying assets through cyno jumps should require some preparation planning and projection of power
if you want to go that route then activation of cyno should automatically deactivate all warp scrambling and web modulesso you cant have a single ship scrambling the target and hot dropping at same time
1 why not if it is their tower why shouldnt they be able to swat the proverbial fly awayif you wanna play with the big boys bring the big boy toys and take the risks its not an i win button by any means look at test avatar loss they were y and hot dropped the gate and got counter dropped by rote and lost a titan 2 well i can name several frankly being a pvp corp in a large 00 alliance my corp owns 3 corp jfs and 5 personal jfs ive jumped mine into 100 man red systems onto hostile towers into npc stations with reds in system into systems with no towers and such gotta do what you gotta do when stuff is needed and you dont have safe towers on route you make due and no i dont use bobbeh3 well recons are ships that are meant to cyno yes hics are great but why remove recons from their actual job as per my numbers above even a hic would be ed if it had to wait 2030 seconds on grid with a small bs fleet off grid cyno will get nothing done because you lose the surprise tactic enemy sees local spike and cyno off grid at which point fc says get clear and get safe you lose your target 4why should caps be limited in their fight starting potential no other ship is limited on their fight starting potential caps of all breeds are ships just like bs bc c d and fs stop hating on caps5yes so meta game whos in your area scout their cap staging systems be prepared or just look at the kb if you see someone in a ship that isnt appropriate search eve kill and find out what he usually does meta game is part of eve had a recon uncloak on my tower in 00 the other day trying to kill me took me about 10 seconds to scare him away and i was in a covert fit legion unfortunately his webs allowed him to glide outa my range and live but he hasnt tried it since if you fight fire with fire your a less appealing target next time instantaneous maybe but theres planning and risk and waiting its just like any other pvp except you dont see anything till your tackle says tackle cyno up whats wrong with that im jumping a ship worth usually at least 5 times more into a fight where i might lose itand hot dropping 50 bs on a 12 man cruiser gang isnt hyper escalationdropping 50 cruisers on 10 frigates isnt hyper escalationlow sec is where i go for pvp and i live in 00 cause there is always smaller scale pvp there but to this date roaming with 35 bs some bcs and fast tackle i have yet to be hot dropped and killed and its been oh 3 years nowi love my caps and my super caps just as much as my bss and my bcs and cruisers i dont want to have to choose between them just cause some people cannot afford to field them aswell or because that does not interest them if i want to drop 10 dreads on a bs fleet i should have the right and the ability to do it cause thats how my friends and i want to play with our 15 dollars a month or 60 dollars for some of us why they are risking fck tons more isk than you already and being in hostile space and engaging unknown numbers make friends with people with capitals and supers wi personally has friends in the gallente militia if they get hot dropped and we are bored we will counter drop with them why dock super caps are harmless against sub capswhen was the last time you saw 1000s of caps i can say ive seen 1000s in one system twice this year if i have 100 friends in dread and we wanna screw up a bs fleet we will its our game to play aswell
bobbeh arguing for the status quo is futile unless ccp are completely brainless when it comes to game balancing they will introduce some kind of new feature or a nerf to hot drop mechanicyoud do more for your cause if you tried to push a proposal with minimum shift from the current system arguments for keeping things as is will just be ignoredcompromiseas example i have always been very much against the great nano nerf but even at the time of debate i did support some limited nerfing i recognized that the status quo was a problem just didnt agree with the radical solutions
there is no technology no matter how profound that cannot be screwed up by the marketing departmentmarketing departments should be in their own building away from everyone else their views should be heavily filtered and the lot of them kept on a short leash theyre necessary but most of their ideas should be treated as something from someone just this side of a straight jacket if not watched they go straight over to crazyunder no circumstances should they be permitted to roam freely without supervision they are dangerous and those who are not trained in handling them should not try to in extreme cases tasers are authorizedregardswindjammer

the basic concept is thisjoejane pilot has saved a variety of ship fittings that they are happy with joejane pilot docks in station 1xyz  i  podme logistics primeas things work now joejane pilot spends a fair amount of time purchasing the hull fittings rigs ammunition andor drones one item or stack of items at a time then manually assembles their new shipwith a purchase fitting option button on the fitting screen  enabled only when docked in a station or outpost with a market  joejane pilot opens the fitting screen browses to and selects the fitting du jour then clicks purchase fitting and the entire saved fitting is purchased from that stations market hull modules rigs and drones are purchased with a single click with a prompt totaling the price and requiring a yes or no click to confirm the purchase purchases would be from the cheapest fittings on the market at that station ideally this would also assemble the ship moments after the purchase fitting button is clicked the only thing that would remain to be manually purchased is the various sorts of ammunition charges rounds crystals missiles nanite repair paste etcif the entire fitting cannot be bought in that station the prompt would automatically decline the purchase

yeah whoops hit the enter button before typing anything here anyways it would be sweet if we the playerbase had a function to report botters similar to the report spammer one and to add a little icing on the cake if enough reports come in on the same individual their ships power core suffers a melt down and their capacitor leaks out and diminishes down to zero until a gm can investigate it further the suspected botter can still do anything they want with their ship so long as it doesnt require cap to use no mining no warping no ratting it can still cloak but who caresobviously abuse can come of this but the same abuse was a concern with the report spammer function and it turned out ok
im not lacking support of this because of possible abuse but rather i just think the function would be useless i can understand a report spammer button but investigating a bot is a bit more complicated im sure than looking at the logs and saying yep this person spammed
hey the report isk spammer button worked pretty well for making all the tears stop while not actually fixing anythingso why not if it hides the issue and makes everyone stop ing then sounds like a good button even if nothing ever gets done with the reports at least it gives the perception of something

my name is m3talc0re and i support this campain
its probably impossible to stop all conceivable types of bots or macros from being used in eve however its probably not necessary to stop all bots imaginable what you need to do is modify the value equation for reward of doing x with a bot and the difficulty of doing x with the bot to such a point that its no longer worthwhile for people to expend the effort of programing the bot or take the risk of using the bot then and only then will the masses change their behavior since killing rats and mining are also legitimate player activities any solution to the bot problem would have to effect players minimally and effect automated systems bots or macros severely my proposal does that to an extent although not perfect in every conceivable way and it uses already existing game mechanicsgrav sites which already exist in all areas of the game there is even a pathway for developing an ihub for increased grav sites ore prospecting array and it is poorly used if i understand it correctly in any case my main point is that there is no way to have a perfect fix for all types of bots in eve ccp and the eve community overall would be wasting time trying to develop one its not possible or even necessary to attempt that the fix will be an incremental change that makes botting less worthwhile and more difficult therefore hopefully far less people will do it
the only solution is compelling gameplaywhen gameplay is created that revolves around repetitive actions then bots will be made to do what they do best repetitive actions
forcing bot users to actually interact with the game in some capacity will reduce their impact to the level of playerrun mining operations at least they wont be able to warp to the same bookmark day in day out extracting the same high quality ore from the rich asteroid that respawns at exactly the same location on a predictable schedulerestricting the largest grav sites to those capable of keeping a squad of 10 miners busy for an hour should be enough to limit the economic impact of bots smaller sites should be down to the level of keeping one hulk busy for a quarter of an houri would definitely move ice to the same system too with small ice deposits only keeping a solo mackinaw busy for a few cyclesas for the mechanics of it i imagine small sites would be static to solar systems with larger sites being static to constellations and regions with a couple of super sites randomly spawning anywhere thus miners will need to have scouts out looking for new deposits encouraging cooperative play even for people who will spend the next four hours mining with eve minimized on their work computeri know it is a nerf to afk mining the means will exist to cope easily with that situation it just requires having friends you trust while i appreciate the low mineral prices brought around by afk mining the current environment makes it far too easy for bots no aspect of a game played for entertainment should encourage repetitive mechanical tasks
this criticism is kind of pointless no i mean is there anyway that pve can avoid becoming repetitive given a sufficiently intelligent human interacting with a machine will become repetitive at some point ask the guys who live in wormholes if it ever gets repetitive doing sites or ask the guys who scan and run null sec plexes they will tell you the sites get repetitive those are probably the two most exciting pve activities you can get involved in so yea avoiding repetitive actions is impossible for pve gameplay
i have some more defeatism for you trying to stop botters is pointless as the root of the problem is not the easily identifiable botters them that bot 237 but ccp itself ccp while not maybe loves the botter certainly firmly looks the other way as were talking thousands of russian and chinese accounts read  income that theyd otherwise miss out onas long as ccp is unwilling to enforce the rules or to really crack down on botting i fear i can only sigh and resign to the knowledge that nothing will change
this i think id rather see something that miners thought of as making their lives easierbetter than something that they would rightly view as a nerfliang
just integrate this and authors sugjestion and some better npcs on that sites and we have a winner so non static belts that you nead to scan for and that will be again gone after some time and defended with smarter npcs would solve this problems exploration system is way to go anyway please just do something about this 
first of allthat is utteraly ridiculous so a mining company of 5 hulks and an orca will spend more time scanning and warping then doing the sites thats silly you want your ships to cost 4 times more and how exactly does one crack down on botting how will you ever know what other programs are running on my computer and checking what is installed on my pc without i illegal by the way not without my permission or order anyway this is not really criticism of the op unless you care to propose someoverall i thinl this is a trong idea and need to become part of one large mining expansion move the sites get us comets make mining more entertaining and involving there where some suggestions on the forum make mining lasers change colour when you change crystals i suggest someone collects taht all into one proposal under one roof then we will talk
very simple comrade youre either1 playing 237 requiring no sleep which makes you a bot or youre2 sharing your accountboth are banishable offences see how simple that was which brings me back to my original point all ccp really needs to do is compile a quick list of people who currently dont require sleep and ban them on the spot count yourself lucky theyre apparently not willing to do so but it aint right
thisgo and petition a macro miner or botternothing will happen
i would like to be able to have more than one wallet division in my personal wallet this means that i could keep better track of my funds and for example allow me to keep a sale of say some faction loot that i got with friends in a plex separate from my own funds
people have been asking for this for as long as i have been playing the game 2 years nowwe keep supporting it ccp keeps not doing it i for one would at least like a reason why we cant have it
i can give you a reasonccp dont care about this its not important for them you want it i want itbut thats not enough
the only possible reason i can think not to have this is that it may increase server load but i have no idea by how much
god this would be so awesome have been wanting it for over a year keep raising this issue excellence no wallets left behind
yeah damn good idea
great idea should be straight forward to code too since they already have similar implementations for corpsid even deal with them adding it as a trainable skill  say personal accounting to the trade group each level gives you the ability to have one additional walet division
in real world you need to have a permit for everythingyou must have a permit for trading and your papers must be in orderyou must have a permit for transport and your papers must be in orderyou must have a permit for mining and your papers must be in orderyou must have a permit for everythingand in real world you have inspectors who check whether your permits are valid and ensure that you are doing by the bookwhy not implement a permit system and some bureaucracy in eveso make it like that for all civilian things you do in game you must have a permitill talk about this one example of miningyou are going to mine and inspectors come to belt and they warp scramble you and start communicating with you same mechanism as customs police when you are smugglingand then they ask you for a security code this code will be one time valid code that you get form space trafic control when you request one and with it you will verify your permitin game you will buy one ingame item permit in station and when you use it you get that code on the screen permit is not consumed by usage that security code will be small picture generated on server and will look like the picture code that you must enter on web pages when you type wrong password repeatedly to verify you are human so that code no bot can read only a real person can do itwhen you transmit that code to them inspectors thank you and warp to other belttime given to player to transmit the code is long but all through the time the players isare warp scrambledif miners are in fleet only one person can enter that code code is valid for all pepole in that fleet but only if they are in the same belt if part of fleet is in second belt they must enter code too when inspection comes to themif person dont transmit the code there can be sanctions like fines and for multiple offences it can be ship destructionif some person over and over dont transmit that can be a direct signal that the account is used for botting and devsgms can that see directly and take appropriate measuresthis system can be implemented in other civilian operations as wellin mission running your mission agent can do it before giving you every 5th mission or so ask you to input that codein ratting there can be the same implementation like for miningin trading inspection can ask you permit code every hour or every 100000000 isk exchanged or something like that  this would be 100 like in real world when inspection comes to your door if you had transaction bigger then some amount to see where you got that money and whyi think this is not too hard to implement in gamemechanics is real  its implemented in real worldit can free us of bots and isk sellersits not too much to ask people to enter one code every hour two or three and that is few seconds of a joband it makes the game more realisticthere is one more option in this system permits system could be the way of taxing minerscorps or sov holders could sell mining permits and in that way tax miners because mining is only occupation that can not be taxed nowpermits in game item would last for some time after that you need to buy a new one or extend itbut this is only an option
there is this rumor about ccp not taking action against botters because they are also paying account holders and ccp is only after profits this is baseless because it is the botters who actually dont pay for the game as they can easily maintain their accounts buying plexes they are increasing plex price and reducing the economic value of most items which causes paying players to leave because they cant get what they are paying for for example a 2 years old industrial character can be easily beaten by a 6 months old bot in mining i can post the calculations if there is need to prove my pointbureaucracy is implemented in real world to stop scams and criminal acts its time to stop scams not those jita scams as it is completely a different matter and criminal acts in eve too
standards and practices already patrols the spacelanes looking for violations of the penal codeyour idea is unnecessary
youre doing it wrong corp buys oreminerals at a reduced rate is the miners tax right there
i vote against itpermits are not the answer to the bot situation as it will create unnecessary load on the server and thus more lag the best solution so far is to let the players deal with the bots in their own way gank em this way botaccount holders will feel the pressure when they see their precious little bots explode
flying logi isnt exactly easy being able to jump is about the only saving gracewithout that ability youd lose so many logi that youd very quickly stop flying themi really do think nerfing the ability to jumpdock will kill off their usethe logi pilot has to get some breaks they dont get killmails and they risk more then just about anyone else in fleet
eve is long past its golden age lore wise eve use to have a much more advanced human race with a larger space presence with presumably really really big space stationswould love to see more intresting stuff in space and things intresting to explore i huge wrecked station that you could fly into it could have a long tunnel type feel with hangers off to the side maybe even some lurking piratesi have the wonderfull mental image of a frigate slowly exporing though a huge wreck and as it proceeds the next hanger contains some rouge drones its be dark and creepy and just amazing to pilot through could even be at missions or space beconeswould open an intresting mission dynamic and give some more things to explore as exploring is lacking in evenot talking about scanning but exploring diffrent placesthoughts
it sounds fun it might require some reworking of the maneuvering controls though as double clicking works well in space and can get hard to use when navigating through caves in asteroids let alone a stationi contest the idea that eve is past its golden age i argue it has yet to come into its golden age if your argument is that little has been done to spice up pve types of things in years i would have agreed prior to incursion the new incursions is definitely a big step in the right direction
ha no eve online is awesomement the tech level of the races in eve is not what it was lore wise when the eve gate was still open the tech level was generally higher acording to lore we have only recenlty redescovered warp travel and warp gates aperently the jove still hide old terran tech near the eve gate so we dont descover itthat is what i ment by eve being past the golden age i ment it lore wisewill edit to reflect that
i like it i think you mean re discover earth built stations which who knows it could be some good salvage and lootsi dont know where it would be put in though other then site seeing with maybe some ratting
yea more things like this in eve would be awesome
sounds good to me
how would you explain the very esoteric function of this button placed in an overly prominent area to the noobs and other 99 of eve players who are never effected by this issueadding a button for this tiny case is all well and good now come up with a ui for it that isnt dumb
there are no consequences for the action if you want to scam using margin trading at least make sure you have the funds to cover the purchase your specified minimum quantity of xalternately having a margin trade fall through should have some consequence  such as a sec status hit standings penalty with the corp whose station you used for your business etc
yes
i do support a change in the way the skill margin trading functionsto clarify my opinion on the best possible solution without destroying margin trading is as followswhen setting up the initial buy order the amount taken to start is as it is now or the amount to cover a single purchase at the minimum quantity required by the buy order which ever amount is largerafter someone sells to an order a check is made if enough isk is still in escrow to cover the minimum quantityif there is not enough isk then enough to cover another purchase is put into escrow from the appropriate walletif there is not enough isk in the appropriate wallet then the order is canceled
so what is to prevent nap trains from doing this constantly to all of the blue tech moons aroundmore to the point what is to stop the individuals who own the moons themselves from doing this to staggeringly boost their incomeif you are bringing this up in some way that it disrupts the actual cycles of the harvesters on the pos anchored at the moon then that sucks too every cloaker and his mother will go into systems and simply fire these probes at moons to screw with the pos cyclesim very hesitant about any idea that messes with poss with as broken as they are currently until ccp changes the way that poss work i dont want them to tinker with anything else that might affect themadditionally your idea seems flawed because there is no cap on the resources of a moon currently why would your probe throwing chunks of the moon into orbit have any affect on how much the harvesters pull inlastly go manage just 6 poss for a month and you will want to tear your eyeballs out every piece of the pos gets in your way even if you think you have set it up perfectly you end up bouncing off of your hangar arrays and spend tons of time just getting to where you want to be inside one of them in short its not a pleasure cruise to maintain poss and adding in cycle derivation to the mix would be soulcrushingheres the other caveat you can feel free and blow up whoevers pos is in your way at the moon you want person holding it brings in too many people to defend it get friends its a sad reality and a crappy answer but its the truth there is going to be no way to stop super large entities from taking the best stuff just like there is no way to stop people from blobbing a system to deathall that being said however it would be sweet to have a capital ship with a capital moon miner on it that doesnt affect the yield that a pos receives from mining the moon if the moon has a pos on it then the owning corp would get a mail if another entity began mining the moon if the moon is empty then game on i would love to gank a moonmining capitalsupercapital

lol  lovin itthinking about it and with recent things to come with the incursions itd be hilarious and somewhat mental if sansha saw the state of the gal navy and its fighting potential and decided it wanted gal space for itselfhave a flip of situation where gallente become a scattered race and the sansha end up being one of the core 4o
do it these goddamn liberal bureaucrats cannot get anything done their democracy is useless overthrow it sansha would value my efforts and isk investment into their research much better fed navy lost so many systems to caldary they are hopeless

why not npc regions
now find a way to make the mechanic portable to npc nullsec low sec and hisec then i will buy into it such an element of infrastructure will provide a clear target for roamingblack ops gangs
i am quite surprised that everyone wants it to affect npc 00 i got the exact opposite sentiment on the featuresideasoff the top of my head i am unsure of any good solution you could give them beacons also and have em respawn after a certain amount of time but i find that less than ideal if anyone finds a good solution by all means ill edit it infor now i removed the line about keeping 00 npc the same
giving this one bump
well why would a pirate faction want to help anyone else who lives in its space maybe npc 00 local should require certain standings with the npc faction
i support thisi also think that npc 00 should not be included in the mechanic if you dont want local get your own sov
great i can support this but make it based on standings completely so if your roaming lowsec and have low caldari standings the caldari systems dont show you local but high sec should remain the samethis will make npc 00 alot more interesting as most ratting bears have horrible pirate standingsmidna
honestly id prefer it if only people who are in the alliance or have positive standings would get immediate access to local everybody else would have it delayed if the owners of the tower decided so give it an optionin the same respect you could have npc 00 local based on the standings with the faction overall i support this core idea but not necessarily the implementation given
i am unsure of giving local to a selective group simply because i dont think its going to work in practice everyone will simply use spies or alts to check local the status quo continues albeit a little more inconvenientas for npc 00 and lowsec i leave it unanswered let another suggestion deal with them judge this based upon its impact on 00 sov regionson a side note personally i am a fan of delayed local based on system sec status 10  0 sec delay with an additional 3 seconds of delay per 01 decrease in sec status i would love to see this suggestion in this thread and a delayed local added together but that is for another thread
i approvewellthought out although i would put a 2 minute delay for onlining the communications tower so people a cant spam the crap out of it and b cant wildly abuse it
now this one i like reasons  it doesnt fully remove local but provides an option to have it be there or not be not the extreme remove all local permamy thoughts  npc 00 low sec and high sec are excluded from this leave this to only affect player controllable spacenow following the lore and crap to have local you must draw a local line from empire or a 00 npc space ex if you live in ngm0k there has to be a beacon anchored in each system leading back to either thukker npc space or low sec empire space to have local there now this can be done via a direct line or by way of tying into another 00 dweller say your phone line from there goes to providence to connect to empirethis could be more interesting as a small fleet could take down communications in 1 system and quite possibly knock out all local communication for the allianceanyway just some thoughts
i like thisi like this small gangs should be able to mess with comms arraysps there is already a model for comms arrays for missions which could be ported into this idea
some missions are terrible rouge drones anyone and i feel that the 4 hour timer is too long to wait
lol i just did rogue drones again today and the alloy salvage on it is yummy as for resetting timer upon successful completion of another mission fair enough but only if its one of the same level or higher
bountyhunting improvements alternate proposalupdated 01132010 completely rewrittenproposal evelopedia bountyhunting improvements alternate proposal summarythe proposed changes outlined are an attempt to bring balance back to the lowsecurity regions 01 through 04 making bountyhunting a feasible means of generating regular isk income should be a priority as currently the incentive exists most prominently for piracy there is a need to bring balance to the equation giving bountyhunters the ability to display contractkills as a decoration provides considerable incentive to pursue bountyhunting as a profession an opposing force to the notoriety of great pirates will be the great bountyhunters that hunt themthe issue of alts collecting the bounty is minimized by the blacklist and other filtering features while there may be some alts or cooperative third parties initially with a little research contract issuers may blacklistfilter suspected altscoop third partiesi believe this proposal is superior to a contract based system in that it still rewards roaming groups of bountyhunters is fair due to the reward being split evenly to all involved parties and still allows for large completion rewardspurpose of alternate bring balance to low security space o this proposal is meant to balance lowsec not just to make bountyhunting feasible as a career restrictive contracts o contracts only allow for one capsuleer to accept and complete them  disallows for fellow bountyhunters to assist you  raiding gatecamps undesirable  restricts bountyhunting to being a very lonesomeindividualized career path whereas piracy is usually conducted in groups less than desirable payment amounts o payout approximate to damage may be negligible undesirable  not worthy of time spent hunting vs reward  disallows for big rewards
so small turrets 5 and medium turrets 5  electronics 5 and engineering 5 the higher level fitting skills are there to fit t2 thats why the t2 take up more cpu and pg than the meta 4s did you have t2 medium guns when your toon was 2 months old i didnt i trained up my fitting skills to be able to use them first and before that i trained up the support skills to make my t1 guns better and by that time i was well beyond 25mil sp and yes that would be two months at an average of 1700sphrwhile i agree that the omen needs a little love i fly them all the time only cruiser i fly i dont agree with the rationale that a two month old toon should be able to use a rigless t2 cruiser fit thats the point of the op right lower sp toons fitting t2 fits on an omen the whole reason electronics 5 and engineering 5 exist is so fitting t2 guns will be easierps it takes just under 2mil sp minimum to even use an omen with t2 pulses with md pulse laser spec at lvl 1 and elec 4eng 4 this is not including any other skills for any other mods sp would definitely be better spent elsewhere first
can likely get what you need by changing the orderpriority under the backgrounds tabui makes little sense but that order controls the way filters are applied
can we improve kill mails to more reflect the entire stretch of combatoften tackles and damage happen on one side of a gate yet if the kill is on the other side none of what was doen before countsjust a minior annoyance
kill mails need to be removed that is the only acceptable change for them
for some reason i think thats true
basically finding a fair fight in highsec is near impossibleso much so that solo pvp happens less then the percentage of podders getting laidgoing to low sec will guarantee you get ganked by 20 guys and if you do end up finding someone to duel you have to trust their ehonor which usually ends up in you getting ganked by 20 guysthe only ways to do it is fight a corp mate or can flip which usually results in you getting borked by multiple bad guys or fight on sisi but hey there is no real risk of loosing assests on sisiso my proposal is setting up a contract system that is sanctioned by concord that allows said parties to temp declare war on each other time period max 30 min timmer starts once contract has been acceptedthe cost would be 5 million processing fee paid by each party and there would be a betting price set by each partyeach bet price would be negotiable between the parties and would not have to be the same amountthe fights would run under war declaration rules but only the involved parties would be allowed to shoot each other or affect each other in any way so that means any members of a gang or allies or corp mates would not be allowed to rr or shoot at either party at penalty of being shot at by concord
yes i support my idea
i believe somebody somewhere proposed to have arena or even several of them one for each big faction where people could do that betting like in the horse races could be lot of fun
courier missions should be removed they are an annoyance for players and the only purpose they serve is feeding the macros those things are all over when you kill them bot grabs another cheap industrial prestocked in station and clunks on eve would be better off without courier missions
believe it or not there are players who enjoy this alternate mission typeand just because bots are abusing the hell out of this game feature doesnt mean it should be removed the bots will simply move on to other areas of the game and we would be right back where we started not supported
 this not supported
supported times infinityif you like this kind of mission so much do it in contracts
pretty much this doing courier missions is quite convenient in some situations and a nice alternative to combat missions for people who cant or dont want to do mining you also have to keep in mind how important standings are in this game and currently missioning is the main and often only realistic way of raising them this means there needs to be as many ways as possible to do missions removing courier missions would only make an already flawed missioning system even worsenot supported
if you dont like courier missions use an agent that gives very few of them like security or intelligence when a courier mission shows up decline it its not exactly rocket science although you might have to run a few couriers when researching it not supported
my biggest complaint with courier missions is that they are very obviously used by bots wander low sec long enough and youll come across a hive of bots running a courier agenti dont think courier missions should be removed they definitely need to be revamped
interestingly enough the game does invert tracking by definition as part of the hit chance equation so not only are they capable of being inversely linked they very clearly already are i rather suspect you dont even know what inverted means maybe if i used crayondrawings to explain you could understand but i doubt it i do however find it moderately amusing that you dont seem to understand that the only purpose tracking has is existing in the hit chance equation and serves no other purpose in the game thus you somehow believe that tracking modifications are somehow magically not directly reflected in the hit chance equation you dont even seem to understand the concept of operations on equationshowever sadly youre now rapidly approaching boring i had hoped you could actually perform some math to show your erroneous point of view so that i might be amused by it but it seems even a display of very bad math is beyond you you seem only capable of misquoting my posts and filling them with your horribly undereducated arguments and syntaxtoo much ignorant drivel to continue goodbye

quite simple i am a 00 dweller and i spend about 10 minutes a week in station 1 of which im idle the rest is buying pvp stuff or waiting for scotty but i am about 1 hour a day idle at the pos some sort of short range clone jump into station is just reasonable dont make me miss out to incarna and our corp for that because i will not fly x amount of jumps just for that neither will my corp
i support this but only if there is a nullgravity environment like in our rl space station
would be neat if pods could dock at a pos the pos would have a few corridors and rooms nothing fancy no bars or anything like that just a small corporation room and captains quarters for every pilot but yes jump clones in the pos would be sufficient but how would this affect wormhole dwellers would it be op nah
stop forcing pvp on people who dont want it i stay in high sec because its suppose to be safe but because yous listen to the pvp who want everyone to pvp people like me end up cancelling their subscriptions and going to play wowit has to end should be no pvp in high sec unless previously agreed between both parties so no more can flippers no more ganking in high sec no moreand the fact that the games end game and high earners are all based in null sec shows that the game is totally in the hands of pvperhave you ever thought about the increase in actual players this game and thus increase in revenue if high sec was purely pveand if they say that is not possible to implement then they are talking bollarks its easily implemented through solid codingnot to mention as well the gms and by extention the game develops seem to endorse people who blatantly cheat by using macros for mining etc etc macro miners are easy to spot i know i have reported more than enough of them but they are still in game still mining still ignoring chat requests and warping into asteroid belts at 200km repeatedly for an hour
high sec was never supposed to be safe only safer than other areas if somebody wants you dead the police will punish them not protect you this is more of a firefly universe than a sterilized star trek universeeve is not for everybody if you dont like it wow is that way 
pvp can be removed from hi sec if all asteroid belts ice belts moon minerals planetary resources level 3 and 4 missions station labs station refining and station factories are also removed from hi sec
then there would be no more point in highicwutudidthar

bit of a necro but oh wellhow about instead of the skill creating a remap the skill lowers the time untill the next remapfor example trained to level 2 11 months till next remap lvl 4 9 months etci still agree that it just becomes the new learning skill but 12 months seems like an awfully long time to wait if you screw up a remap due to inexperience imo a remap every 8 months feels like the sweet spot to me but thats just my opinionalso would be nice if remaps stacked regardless of being used
this is a learning skill its a learning skill because you invest sp in it to gain increased sphr rates in the future weve finally got rid of these and you lot want them back come on
anything which would prevent you from remapping at least twice a year would  for obvious reasons youd think  be pointlessand a 1620 multiplier might be too high bringing any of the old learning skills to lv 5 took 2 years or so to recoup timewise so for a remap skill to make any sense youd actually have to be able to profit from it in the foreseeable future a x16x20 skill would take over 2 months to train making the recoup time way too high remember youd have to be able to profit from it within the same halfyear span or it would have been in vain as well
this really needs to be moved up in there list of fixestoo many characters are leaving the game due to this type of incident where the victim is not looked after
it would help if ccp stopped treating isk if it was real money

random conversation this morning gave me this brilliant idea basissuper capitals are designed to be the pinnacle of capital destruction and they are never mentioned without a significant amount of epeen stroking but apart from being mailgenerators they do not do much else to warrant their place in eveproposaladd a tab in show info ingame epeen best epeen of titans and scs that contains a truncated list of capital kills the ship has participated in notches on the belt as it were
i dont think it will allow for scams as theyd have to time it exactly and its only to change a single aspect of the order if anything the benefit would far outweigh any exploitable aspect to itsupporting my own topicedit i never restricted this to sell orders i only used a sell order for the example
would this really be a bad thing though lolsupported
yes and if you do this plz let us also change the order rangeedit why does op restrict this change to sell orders
evemon already does that for you

honest question youve talked about gm responses did you escalate to a senior gm that is is this a problem with broken wardec mechanics or insufficiently trained junior gms
this is absolutely an exploit though you may have to run them through at least one more cycle of war dec avoidance to get a clear case to presentthe activity was judged by ccp to be an exploit back when there was a certain alliance offering war dec cleaning as a service so the judgment is already in if you have trouble convincing gms of this follow the advice of a previous poster in this thread and escalateregardswindjammerps kudos on your persistencepps escalation is achieved through choosing the group rules and policies category game masters and isd when filing a petition contrary to some of what you may hear the petition system really does work escalation is sometimes necessary because there are inexperienced gms
i believe that all manufacturable goos are over supplied from the raw material sidethe game has changed so much over the last few years that macro mining and botting is the only real way to make iska lot of the high risk activities of playing the game are now not worth it eg reaction pos they require high investment but give low return manufacturing is the same
sour old bag says what your post issler shows exactly how well you work and play with others as well as the lasting resentment you carry the hypocrisy involved in accusing ankh of such things while displaying them yourself is nothing short of astounding ironically id respected you until this hate filled post of yours
not necessarily true in lawsuits the winner is often predetermined by who has the largest legal war chest safe to say ccps is probably bigger that having been said ndas being what they are and the csm being what it is it is likely that any of the csm could have been and still could be charged with an nda violationtechnically and that technicality could be used to successfully defend in any lawsuit brought against ccp no matter how insignificant the breach of ndaankhs silence is understandable and was predictable though disappointing under an nda someone can not only be removed from the csm but a violation of the nda can be used as basis for a lawsuit filed by ccp against the violator the suit doesnt have to have merit and can be based upon the smallest of perceived violations also someone who causes a corporation grief can easily be sued for damages based solely upon what they say about the corporation even without the nda being a part of the equationall of which points to a plausible scenario in which ankh may well have been told shed be putting herself at considerable risk by pursuing a verbal andor legal campaign against ccp with little chance of success ccp wouldnt even have to threaten her her own common sense and perhaps advise from legal counsel would be enoughwindjammer
ummm what about nohow would you know if some1 is protected or not its just not fun and adds nothing to the gamewhat if you had to pay the cops to respond to your calls a different bill for fire and ambulance think about it
for me the best part was when the csms talked about how hybrids need a fix
now then its part 1 of 3then again im expecting nothing
apparently we only have to wait until friday for the complete set
gotta collect them all
the idea of booth babes pretty girls dressed up in eve costumes handing out stuff was discouraged by the csmok i see what you did herebabes handing out stuffno wait i dont see itwtf
moved to csm discussion from eve general
ok that does itlets start resolution of no confidence in this csm
hmm is there something wrong with that csm or was it the stuff the babes were handing out
oh the horrorthe horror every time someone reads that line from csm an angel loses the wingsand a glass of beer gets wasted somwhere around the globe
players in sov space pretty much ignore belt ratting now in favour of grinding anoms in upgraded systems  which arent affected at all by trusecpersonally i think it should be the other way around continuous belt rat deaths should result in an escalated responsebut then the logical conclusion of this line of thought is that eves pve badly needs a massive overhaul and has done almost since it was introduced
it is true that it is mainly anomalies these days but it is the same for the macros so then the question is why change it when it has limitted influence anywaybut still all influence it has will be in favour of havign many empty systems over few empty systems this is something you cant argue against the question is will it ever happen
rather than iterate on the existing pve mechanics ccp decided to develop a new pve mechanic  incursions we did argue on this point at the summer summit but ccp had already set the devs priority and didnt want to change their focus
so now well have two different pve designs and unless ccp nails incursions on the first try they will both be underwhelming
inested of using the curent duble click method of manuvering your ship i think it would be fairly easy to inplemnt a simple hot key togle that would allow players to wasd contole there shipin pvp dynamics this wouldent change mutch speed of a ship would remain the same only manuaveribility would improvefrom a pve perspectave it give the player a stronger sence of controle with ones shiplikes on this why or why not
please search forums there is a sticky thread in an features and ideas section oh and you posting in the wrong section ofcthis was discussed many times ad nauseamno maneuverability will not improve perceived maneuverability will decrease even
there was a distinct lack of flogging of the equestrian varietythe people have spoken on this issue if the csm is a functional body and not just a pr tool every session that ccp set up should have went thusccp wed like to show youcsm thats great but we want to talk about the posand yes you would say it in all caps because thats the voice of the forums being channeled through you
i was very disappointed in the hate on booth babesnot cool csm
why are you quoting someone having no freaking idea of what hes talking about the one time i used an orca maintenance bay it was to drop a tengu in it and it sure isnt a mining shipfrankly i was on a few blacks ops hotdrop recently and black ops pwn maybe they could use a light increase in range but even with jump drive calibration 4 they open lots of possibilities exemple systems in range from osoggur with jdc4the fuel costfuel bay equation got the merit of limiting the size of the hotdropping gang which is imho a good thing the last thing eve needs is mroe way to ridiculously outblob peopleproposal wanting to make them sort of a carrier are plain stupid i bet a good 95 of black ops pilots are carrier pilots so if the situation call for a carrier theyll just jump in theirsthe only thing i agree about 100 is that the sin got issues and should basically be redone but by someone with a clue for a changeas for people wanting the covert ops cloak ive yet to read a single good reason black ops dont warp to targets they jump to them and jumping from covert cyno to covert cyno is a way better way to evade camps than a covert ops cloak will ever be could someone provide a realistic scenario where a covert ops cloak would make a huge difference
 a variety of ideas were put forward which would make them harder to move around the most promising of which was a cyno spooling timebasically the idea is this cyno pilot drops a cyno in the destination system and depending on the distance from the departure system it takes a certain time to either get the cyno field up to the required strength or for the capital ships jump drives to get up to speed to make the jump this time would increase with distance and the cyno would need to be defended during this period this would limit the ability of supercapital and capital fleets to hotdrop on targets with no warning from half the galaxy away it would also mean that a capital fleet would not be able to cross the entire galaxy in about 20 minutes taken from
what is your answere to the fact that some 00 are hugh sometimes u need to travel a region to get to a target region how do u want to cross that without emptying your fuel bay for half or bring 2 vloaky haulers to bridge a small gang how about the 20 lightyear regional jumps they still need to be done manualy and are often camped bo bridge fuel cost
see here is the pinchyou got a ship that can move around semi well without being seen that has okay dps where in a normal fight two bo ships decloaking of your port weapons locking without delay will shred anything before most people know what happenedjust based on that mental picture noncloakers first reaction is to nerf cloakinglong story short dont be afraid of the bo ships by buffing them fear being foolish in playing this multiplayer game alone
if you cant escape a camp on a region gate you are pretty hopeless most often people now camp one jump further to be on a smaller gate and that one is jump bridgeablethere got to some risks still associated with bo or are those calls for balance are really call for a pwnmobile
ccp pls fix them
they just have to fix that gay spin ships do when they come out of warp make it look like this
didnt see this on page 1
sarcasmi just want more and more features even if they are barely functional or usefulsarcasmi do not care about 2 expansions a year however if this is the decision of ccp then one expansion should be content and one should be nothing but fixes iteration balance and review of existing features i believe it has been outlined that you try to do some balance and fixing with every expansion however i do not think that it has been working well i think the developers would be better utilized focusing on one kind of project at a time either new stuff or making old stuff better but hey if you ever do release a expansion that leaves nothing out and is bug free and well balanced on release then sure give us 2 new expansions a year

you were born a slave sorry youll be slave foreveryou were born poor sorry youll be poor foreveryou were born stupid sorry youll be stupid foreversorry but i dont subscribe to your line of thinking people grow people change you are not what you were yesterday you will not be the same tomorrowi always try to have characters names that i can live with it means a lot to me some people dont care at all but preventing people from changing from dont care to do care in a supposedly roleplaying game is just bad formid rather have i was stupid but i got better people than i was stupid and now im sad too
the same way you are assigned titles for a corp it can say old name xxxxxxi still am in support of 1 name change in a lifetime
thx u for taking the time to explain that to mei dont know jack about caps or sov warfar but i have ran into a few low sec scs if there as strong as they do seem to be i think there going to get nerfed into the ground at some point for all the same reasons that bss did how and in what ways i have no clue
and anyway how can you distinguish between people who picked a bloodline for looks and those who picked them for stats the female achura has quite a popular look but they also had the best starter attributes in the old daysso just give everyone a free bloodline changestill waiting for any ccpcsm imput 
seeing as ccp has not bothered to deign us with any kind of reply we can read a lot into their silence however we do get a free char portrait transfergo look i speak no lies lolso create a disposable alt then transfer portraitthen you get the avatar you want pain in the ass thowe should get to choose
i would say for any release pertaining to the character creater we should be able to change ourselves again
well then it is a good thing that ships in eve dont have zero gravity and even if it were low gravity it is still gravity and a bra could make up the difference by your argument women shouldnt be allowed in space has nothing to do with whether or not boobs move or not
wont somebody please think of the children
you know that sounds like a justification for this idea right
i support boobies
oh my wordits soo crazy it might just work

i really like gallente ships i started some crosstraining to amarr ships to see how id go in one of their aesthetically nice ships such as omen i found i was already doing better pve with omen than i was a thorax a disappointment reallyi like to go for dps as well as speed when i have a blasterboat fit for one of my ships in pve and its virtually useless because by the time you get in optimal range at 305ms with mega neutron blasters you couldve already popped off 2 of them with a volley of railgunsedit support
maybe one day someone from csm become aware that gallente have some serious problems for now all we can do is spaming forums
wrong i would do it in a heartbeat i wish i could do it right now cause i want to get an alt ready for hulkageddon ivthanks for the support guys its such a simple proposal it might not take much to get this through keep thumbing it up
i only just support it in principle there are so many extra facilities they could add in for dual pay accounts it would be a shame to waste it on merely training 2 alts at the same speed still its a choice with valuestill lolcsm though forget it
really makes sense supported
its a fantastic idea but i would like to see a lower price for a dual train most of you seem to think that you only want to do it for 2 months and you would be done there is a lot of merit to haveing a second character training at all times or at least a significant amount of the time and paying pull price for half the benifit would be a wasteif you really want ccp to make more money then it would make sence to entice players to keep a dual account memebership going not burn out at 2 months it would basicly just generate an income spike then drift back to about normal in a few months time
in all stations nopossibly in low or null sec but even those stations would be npc controled and would make sense to have securityso no support here
not all null sec stations are npc controlled which is why i thought maybe this sort of thing would be ok in player controlled stations
this is why reading a proposal helps i specifically said that they would all have security
i instead dont care about the game mechanics but care about the logic of gluing your gaming environment to eve an the idea of fighting in station is a bad one it is not logical both lore wise no one will allow people to freely fight in a ambient as fragile as space station and as a depiction of a credible reality it could be acceptable only if there was a station invasion phase after a system has been conquered but only during the brief period of time after the station has changed hands but before the new owners have taken full control of it and any invasion force would try to keep it as brief as possible to minimize station damage great the only reason to do it you can find a wizard did it no it dont fit in the kind of game that eve iscorporate backstabbing in station fit in the eve game mad guy going to a killing spree in the market dont fit
i definitely do not want walking in stations to be focused on pvp but having the ability to carry and use armaments makes sense and adds to the realism using them should be strictly forbidden so you have to be careful how you use them and it wont be an every day thingi think implants should be salvageable they should make busted implant components that can be used to make a new set of implants that dont come from the lp store that way carebears cant live it up safe and happy with expensive implants that nobody else can afford to use only alert and wellmanaged players should get away with using really expensive implantsalso there should be an implant scanner module just like ship scanners and cargo scanners that way people arent gunning down random pilots hoping for implants people looking for em will know who has em and who doesnt and the base cost of the implant should determine the amount and rarity of the types of implant salvage you get or something like that
it fits in perfectly with game mechanics everything other than concord can be murdered absolutely everywhere in the game there is no such thing as safe space by design but there are consequences in certain locations rather obviously stop trolling and talking about actual game mechanics is an argument about the logic of the game refusing to address game mechanics so that you can talk about fiction is however nonsensical that pretty much ends it you dont care about game mechanics but youre pretending that having eve in eve is somehow violating eve also evidently illogical again some pretty obvious trolling i pointed out that its good gameplay and fits into the game as a whole i pointed out that for people who require fiction then a wizard did it is as good as any other if people play a game with superliminal communication and ships that can be disassembled put into a freighters cargo hold scooped out of the freighter once its destroyed and reduced to spacedebris reassembled in a pos in a wormhole and then still have thousands of crewmembers materialize on it who dont need to eat and never try to leave the ship even when its suicide ganking something in empire well its up to them if they then use the fiction to determine gameplay hopefully at least they can understand that fiction doesnt change or effect the game at all if tomorrow the jovians were 8 foot tall purple bunnies the game would be the same as if they were cannibalistic spaceelves if the caldari were hippies it would be the same game as if the amarr became atheists but a change in game mechanics instantly alters the nature and balance of the game reality is whatever doesnt go away when you stop believing in it the rules that govern the game are real within the confines of the game the fiction you use to roleplay not so much
stations should have their own security and police force that is totally separate from concord some kind of assaulting system might be interesting however a full on fps in stations would suck donkey balls
doesnt have to be a full on fps whatever that may mean precisely but just like you can fly around and do various things and someone can shoot you without the game becoming freespace ii you can walk around stations and get jumped by another player without it becoming halo
if you really think that you are heavily deluded it is not a fake quote it is a perfect sum up of your post at the top of this page
ahhh truly a brilliant factual rebuttalbut yah youre right eve is fungible with freespace iino seriously stop trolling as i didnt say it and as you made it up in order to troll obviously its not a real quote and of course as you were trolling the substance of the quote itself is a lie ive very specifically addressed the logic of game mechanics and the validity of my proposal by grounding it in game mechanics youve bizarrely said that you dont even care about game mechanics and lied about what i actually arguedin your own words you dont care about game mechanics which inform how eve works and what eve is what you do care about is fiction something that has absolutely no impact on the game and is useless for anything other than roleplaying and you claim that by wanting to discuss game mechanics in a thread about game mechanics instead of role playing that im ignoring logic arguments whatever you think thats supposed to meani get it youre trolling you can stop now
how much time finn how much time when can they start working on the actual spaceship game of eve back in may or so they said it would be 18 months just to get out what they had planned that will likely mean at least 24 months before they really get back to spaceships now you want to add a whole first person shooter combat system surely that will add at least a year so eve will be forgotten for 3 yearsi say f that if your proposal said they would spit incarna out as soon as possible and not work on it any more until they fixed fw boosted low sec in general did something with neutral reps fixed killmails fixed the ui when you send your drones to attck have them attack without having to give the command 3 times  same with docking and other problems with the game how about 2 orbit and keep at range presets how about when you hit orbit your ship doesnt come to a complete stop and then start orbitting how about your overview doesnt show someone 100k away when they are 500 m away or show them as 500m away when they are 3 systems away is that too much to ask before they start working on a new game if your proposal said they would not touch incarna anymore until this was done first then yeah im for it but ffs how long does the spaceship game have to wait
dunno i didnt set any time frame and tbh i wouldnt be interested in doing so all im asking for is a commitment to iterate not a deadline to do so id also note that its not a zero sum game past a certain point simply throwing more manpower at a problem actually begins to show diminishing returns theres nothing that says that they cant work on the space component of the game and the station component the fact that they chose to shelve major development on the space side was what was at issue not that they were working strong on it but devoting some manhours to the station side toothey can start iterating on wis the day it goes live or they can simply begin brainstorming and not get on it for another year or whatever in my mind thats not the main issue the issue is that i want a commitment that it will happen sooner or later and that wis wont be left to rot on the vine as so many expansions have
yes there is its called a payroll expense when you run a business you cant just hire everyone in the world to do everything you have to pick and choose what you want to hire people to do yes it is a zero sum game this is what ccp explained to the csm we have to hold on all the spaceship stuff until incarna is finished your proposal sends a message that we want some sort of first person shooter game to be a priority
yes there is they already have their dev team and not all of them do or can work on the core space mechanics nobody is talking about hiring everybody or what have you nobody least of all me has even suggested taking devs off other projects for all i care they can ask devs to voluntarily brainstorm ideas in their free time and stuff them into a cookie jar until theyre ready to begin iteration ill also note that your comments rely on the fallacy of equivocation yes they can indeed work on both incarna and spacecontent theyve done it for years including when they released the single most popular expansion in eves history apocrypha youre using work on both and equivocating it to mean devote the totality of their resources to both which of course is not and has never been how ccp operates the fact that ccp treated it as a zero sum game is what annoyed people yet again theyve been working on incarna for years while also working on eves core space gameplay nothing says that they can not return to that model the fact is that they chose to deviate from it cite anywhere in my op at all where i say that this should be a priority because what i actually said is that ccp should commit to iterate yet again no time frame no deadline no temporal demands at all just a demand that wis is not left to rot on the vine just like i just said just like my op said if you want to argue against the idea that iteration on wis should be a priority youll have to wait until another thread comes along and someone argues that iteration on wis should be a priority
pretty confident i read a chronicle where a pod pilot is walking around has a security team with him and gets shot at it definitely fits eve fiction only problem is wed end up with a bunch of npc security dudes swarming around each player to truly match eve fiction anyway i would much rather send a pile of these marines i have sitting in my hangar to shoot some idiot than shooting him in the face with my character as logic would suggest both individuals would die being able to assassinate other players would be good
work on this on your free time ok yeah i agree with that ccp should no longer allow work on wis during working hours if people want to do this on their free time thats fine but the thing is when you have employees you cant just add things to the list of things to do if anyone is a manager or business owner they will find this mildly amusing every time an employee says that they have too much to do just respond thats the fallacy of equivocation work on all of it at the same time let wis rot on the vine get it out so everyone who wants to play dress up and beauty shop can play that but then ignore the demands for fancier sweaters and haircuts otherwise this whole game will go pear shaped fast incarna isnt even out yet and already we see people pleading to be able to add or reduce their height by a foot wtf we have the boob jiggle crowd you think this will end after its out you will just have nerds crying even louder to have their male friends appear in game like the girl out of their dirty magazinevideo now you want ccp to commit to some sort of entire first person shooter combat system dont get me wrong i would like that too if they had infinite resources but for me i would like them to work on the spaceship game we should be able to see bookmarks in the overview the overview itself shouldnt be such a jumble in too many ways to list fw shouldnt rot on the vine we should have the cargo we want in the cargo space when we fit a ship i mean really why wouldnt the guns be grouped and full of ammo and extra ammo in the cargo just like when you saved the fit its because that would take more dev timewe should be able to choose from several custom orbits without having to right click and type in what orbits we want during combat and the ship shouldnt stop every time we click orbit i could go on and on i mean there is so much to do why push to have them start on what is essentially a whole new game this game is fantastic but much more could be done with it you say you want them to commit to doing this but you dont care when how is that a commitment someday we will is not a commitment
you do realise that these implants are 1m3 first off theres no way youd be able to fit it in your head without looking slightly off also if youd manage to shoot someone then youd probably hit these large implants damaging them beyond repair like your other ideas though
not sure if numping is alowed but here goes anyway
of course
supportedthe rper in me wants to see this
i can still voice my own opinion  but yeah if the masses want ccp to spend resourcestime on space barbie that is what they will do im just pointing out that the ccp resources arent infinite so anytime you vote for one thing that means something else is not being worked on i suppose i am the only one who wishes they would work on game mechanics instead of making our avatars pretty

bobbeh can you explain how one goes about hot dropping ships that cannot jump without using a cyno
not true eph i argue for status quo because i dont think its broken ive already said my compromise would be making it so that if you scram a ship it cant activate a cyno gen fast locking inties would stop a hic from cynoing pretty dang fast or needing a certain amount of cap to light a cyno as it is i think the mechanism is fine and fits well with the lore cyno opens its a fixed point in space the jump drive locks onto it much like typing wwwsomethingcom and that locks you onto an ip through the dns virtually instantaneous except on really slow connections the ship then folds space and appears at the destination all in fractions of seconds what is broken is peoples lack of ability to adapt to this strategy of play cynos and the way they work outside of combat is perfect and you cant change them outside of combat while changing them inside combat instead you can change the strategy to defend what i would agree to and this is even pushing my bounds is thisyou press cyno beacon loads you have 5 seconds to scram the ship and shut the cyno down before its broadcast to the capitals on the other end this would accomplish both side of the argument it would add more of a counter while not removing hot drops as a tacticquite simply as the term hot drop is now associated with caps but its basically just a quick description of a large increase of force in a very short period of time like baiting on one side of a gate then when they agress jumping through or agressing them on a station and then undocking your forces or engaging them in a system then jumping through the jump bridge or using a cyno and bridging sub caps onto a smaller subcap fleetall of which has the same nearly immediate effect as hot dropping capitals but people are only but hurt because someones slapping down a bigger epeen and they are forced to die or disengageplease dont use the argument of the signal is being transmitted over vast distances because its not with the creation of jump drives is also the creation of faster than light communication nearly instantaneous over vast distanceswhat people want is the ability to kill the inferior force before the hot drop comes and get away thats not fair nor is it justifiable so eph there is my compromiseand mara we all know your a capital ship hater and proud of it so the point in arguing cap mechanics with you is moothow is me using my titan and bridging 40 bs onto your face different than dropping 20 caps its nothow is me telling my fleet to logg off in a system while we agress next door so we cant be scouted then when they attack logging in and jumping different its not and its not an exploit log in traps are logging off in a grid and waiting for someone to come onto that grid its not people just dont like the fact that i can be roaming with 10 guys and have 20 carriers waiting to back me up if  gets hairy im sorry but dont punish me for having more friends
the difference between a cyno and a jump gate is mainly that you expect the jump gate and can scout the other side a cyno can bring ships in from anywhere only a very lucky and prescient scout will be able to find the rally point and determine that this particular group of ships will shortly be exiting the cyno field at your location
i disagree if im on the other side of a jump bridge 5 lightyears away you arent gonna beable to scout me or if im in a dead end system 2 away waiting for the call to jump and warp and enter system you prolly wont find me
excitingisnt it
that wouldnt stop anybody short of clumsy or sleepy peopleit would be just like with cloak when a new ship enters your overview you cannot possibly lock it before it activates cloak unless hes unable to activate it due to proximity it would be exact same thing with cyno  people would always be able to activate before even the fastest inties could finish lock much less activate scramblethat solution would be acceptable only if warp scrambling a cyno ship blocked everyone from using the cyno then the timing wouldnt be an issuealso i am pretty sure that most reasonable people would agree that current hot dropping mechanic is broken due to it being so easy and instant  timing is the key factor its just too damn fast if you see no problem with that in a strategytactics game then you just dont have a good feel for what strategytactics games are i guess its one of those things that you either get it or you donteven tho my opinion of ccp is very low right now i still believe they have somebody in their office whos capable of understanding game balance issues thats all it takes 1 person over there to be able to understand then well have some kind of solution and all we have to do is propose the most reasonable ideas
no not really flying around low sec on a bshac roaming gang just me and 9 friends enjoying the scenery and getting no good fights because everyone else is in gangs of three or thirty we manage to find a similarsized group camping some other fleet in a station so we engage one of the folks being camped undocks in a falcon then suddenly super caps dozens of themthe proliferation mobility and sheer firepower of super caps unbalance the gamealtering cyno mechanics will address the mobility to some degree reducing jump ranges might be necessary too ultimately ensuring at it might be possible to scout out enemy cap ship fleets adding upkeep costs will address proliferation to some degree so the presence of super caps in a battleship fight will come as a surprise rather than an inevitabilityi have been in interesting lowsec fights which were ruined by super caps that deployed from the other side of the cluster expressly to drop on that fight just because the cap pilots were boredaltering cyno mechanics to nerf hot drops will not seriously impact upon the primary purpose of super caps which is blob warfare anti cap warfare and infrastructure bashing deploying supercaps should be a strategic decision not a tactical one the battlefield might dictate the decision on when to bring the supercaps in eg when you spring you trap but the decision to bring super caps must involve a commitment to hold the field for some timeremember we are talking about a pause of about 20 seconds i am not suggesting that super caps be limited to two jumps per day perhaps that might be a more acceptable option
i disagree completely and its not because i dont grasp strategy its because some people view hot dropping as an unfair tactic or a manipulation of power to easily where as i look at it as a means of projecting force into your surrounding area the low sec population  which is much much smaller then the 00 population wants cynos changed negatively because they affect them and since the lowsec population tends to group in small numbers and living in small groups they cannot effectively counter it tough luck its always one thing or another i tackle a command ship and his buddy and bring in my 6 friends to kill it and they accuse me of blobbing i drop 3 carriers on a ratting carrier and im accused of cheap hot dropping i run away from a rr bs fleet on the gate at 0 when im in snipers and we gotta jump into them and im called a chicken for not taking a fair fight so much whiningwhy are cynos broken what ive heard so far 1 they are unfair2 they are to fast3 they are unscoutable 4 they escalate fights to easily5 they ruin small gang pvpand my responses1 eve isnt fair its a sandbox its not meant to be fair if i wanna shove sand down someones throat i will2 they are as i explained as fast as lore would dictate not to mention having a 20 second timer on engagement of a cyno would make it so that caps wouldnt beable to engage for at least 35 seconds they are combat assets not pretty lil hello kitty boats 3 its called spais ccp admitted its part of the game now adapt and use it for frack sake4 everything escalates the fight when in war has anyone ever brought a fair fight oh sht sir the enemy have half our number alright tell our guys to divide into 2 groups and pick one group to go home cant outnumber them thats unfair yea right its more like  good it will be a swift victory for us5 they do not ruin small scale pvp my corp and i run small scale roams every night in blackrise and genesis and placid and the rest of the fw areas and have not been dropped once and have had many gfsccp has not even discussed that cynos are unfair so where are you getting this from the same tactics have been used for 2 years now nothings changed we in 00 have been dealing with and adapting to hot drops for that time and now they are rare cause theirs alot of risk in doing itnow to maradude have you tried to kill a bs in a sc prolly not well i have it is slow as ballz using fbs and most sc pilots are running fighters so that leaves ogres and sentries all which have a range of 55k from the sc fail sir failreducing jump range would fck deep 00 alliances completely as there are places in eve right now that are only reachable with calibration 5 without traveling halfway around eveobviously your not a super cap pilot as you would know that current jump ranges for scs and titans are quite limiting already i bet youd be all hunky dory if caps were removed form the game completely wouldnt uunfortunately caps are here to stay sorry to disappoint youbringing caps is a decision and you hold the grid as long as they are there no longer than neededsuper caps arent for blobbing they are anti cap platforms and to support sub cap fleets and on occasion strike out and project force in your immediate territory  one cyno from your staging pointso bascially in your opinion pilots who fly super caps and caps should change they way you play because you dont like it so limit their ability to play the way they want because it affects your pvp and your too lazy to change the way you operate to avoid hot drops so just nerf them so you can play your game without changing thats very narcissistic and arrogant of you
supported but carriers and dread jumping should remain unchanged
bobbeh fairness doesnt come into question at all im all for hardcore pvp and i know that real pvp is unfair and thats the way its supposed to bethe real issues with cynos are1 too fast2 too easy3 unscoutableunpredictablethat sums it up in most basic form has nothing to do with fairness has everything to do with game balance do you want to play fps where each player has option to activate a nuclear bomb and wipe out all opposition instantly can you imagine what that would do to game serversdo you want to play chess where each player has ability to turn the pawn into a queen at any given turn lets say based on dice roll not just when the pawn reaches end of the board who cares about fairness think of what that does to the game it immediately loses vast portion of its strategy and tactics potentialin same way the ease speed and unpredictable randomness of hot drops takes away huge part of strategic and tactical planningsmall random factors in games are good they add to the game large random factors are bad they destroy the game and id say that the potential to get 100 people with motherships instantly materialize out of thin air in any given situation is a pretty damn huge random factor
give jumping via a cyno some small travel time let them travel at something like a third of a lightyear per second or base it on the cyno skill of the beacon lighter if the cyno is destroyed in transit it doesnt matter they are already jumped this does not change things very much but makes it actually possible to flee from a properly set up hot drop fleetthis also allows the game with some clever programming to eliminate loading lag since they could use that 10 second window for loading
leave a cyno alone the issue is capital ships
your right and wrong at the same time it removes strategy and tactics for people unable to field counter drops or kill hot drops but adds strategies and tactics for those able to do the previously listedalso its not like that at all nuking the field on command is more relevant to the old dd also turning a pawn into a queen wont guarantee you a win 1 too fast how so they have set up and been waiting for 2030 minutes maybe more  they also have to wait for someone to take the bait and agress then the tackle to be made and cyno to be lit then they jump and fight then wait to lose their ships or jump away doesnt sound very fast to me but hey i might be wrong if a lone hic is flying toward your fleet and you dont think its suspicious 2 easy its not like they just undock and jump they need to make sure they have fuel for the round trip everyone has the skills and its in range that theres noone waiting to counter drop and finally wait till someone takes the bait3 unscoutableunpredictable i already told you meta game it is an accepted counter if that doesnt suffice fit a t2 frig or cruiser with a ship scanner and if your about to engage scan their ships if you see a cyno you know its a possible hot drophave you seen a random gang of 100 scs cyno somewhere to kill a small roaming gang no i didnt think so make a plausible argument such as when was the last time i saw 510 supers drop a roaming gang and id say 2 weeks ago and they nearly lost all their superswhen was the last time i saw a titan hot drop a support fleet last week and he did lose his titanwhen was the last time i hot drop someone well month ago random nyx attacking an offline tower unfortunately a fw fleet ran into it first and he ran away and logged at a safe spotdo i think it sucks when you get hotdropped yea it does but do i think its a valid tactic yes i dois it a good strategy to intimidate roamers from coming into your space definitely if they know they might face a random cap fleet they might head somewhere else first success full strategy is it also a good strategy and tactic to attack larger alliances definitely cause it takes less caps to kill more sub caps check cry havoc or triumvirate both entities use hot drop tactics to attack a much bigger foe and be in and out before they could counter or fight back sorry eph something you think is broken is a known working tactic for guerrilla warfare in 00 for the last 2 years now its starting to hit lowsec more often and people dont like the change but changing it in one will also change it for the other im sure vietnam sucked for the americans and all the surprise attacks and rat holes tunnels murder holes it sucked needless to say but war is war and all is fair
in what sense korvin their proliferation or their role or their ability to counter support or their use in pvp
this is not a bad idea needs to be worked on sure but i will add it as a possible solution to the op
i wonder if that is really the case  from where i am sitting the only two major issues i see with capitals is the need to buff the dreadnought and nerf the supercarrier in order to make both fill a given nichethe problem discussed here are the mechanics around the actual cyno system  the actual ships that use them are not all that problematic apart from the mentioned issues
i dont think further arguing is going to add much to the discussion the main points of concern have been presentedwe need to know  does ccp get itif they dont no point trying to propose ideasif they do we can start picking the best ideas and get support for them
im not sure i think bobbeh et al have presented many good arguments against it while you and others have argued well for i believe the issue needs a good debate with respect given to all opposing views so that we can weight the pros and cons and overall implications in a fair and balanced way it is indeed a major aspect of nullsec pvp and indeed logistics in general that we are talking about and it needs careful scrutiny and consideration due to the wide implications any changes to it would havepersonally i abide by my original proposition  i think it needs changing i do not believe this would ruin it for either those who use it as a means of logistics nor do i think it would invalidate it as a crucial element of fleet warfare
1 is exactly the fix the game needs id say the timer should be like 30 seconds 10 is just laughablethe ing hotdrop mechanics just turns the game into a state where only isk mattersalso equipping cyno generator should result in ship getting a clearly distinguished markaura around it
problem with buffing dreads as stated in the supercarriers thread is that it would make them unbalanced with bs as it stands right now dreads of equal number do fairly well against bs fleets buffing them would distort thisand nerfing super carriers to much would give titans a massive advantage in the cap warfare field as nothing would beable to kill them if they loggedas stated the area dd was a good counter to fighter blob and therefore fb blob and blob in general but became a problem as titan number grew i agree that there is some balancing needed at the moment but what i cant say definitively is that the problem isnt caused by the advantage cap ships have due to lag specially titan dds and in moderate lag fighter bombers and fightersi state this because in low lag to no lag situations small support fleets can easily clip fighters and fighter bombers but when lag is higher this becomes harder to do and therefore carrier vessels get a benefit due to lag furthermore if severe lag where modules wont fire titans are the only ship on grid still killing with their ddssome of the problem people have with hot drops is lag the momentary spike from several ships appearing infront of you and then their fightersfighter bombers can cause a momentary slowing of not as competitive computers this can lead to hot drops being inescapable unfortunately in pc gaming there will always be drawbacks of not having goodgreat hardware or enough of it
i just dont want this to play out like the nano nerf discussions  over 100 pages of debate on the issue mostly rehashing the same arguments over and over again numerous ideas proposed no sign of life from ccpthen months later  ccp announces a radical solution that nobody called for all those 100s of pages with ideas worthless and as result the game got worse than beforeit could easily happen with cyno mechanics ccp can just announce out of the blue that they got some bright new idea that changes everything and only radicals on 1 side support itwe need better understanding of what ccp believes  what they see as problem and what they think is fine theres been enough discussion already to at least get that
thank you for that horizon some people just think im a troll but i truly believe that at least someone needs to point out the hard facts on the assembly board if not because the majority of the posters arent older players or deep 00 inhabitance or super cap pilots but because people often forget that everyone who plays the game deserves to play it the way they wantmissioners hate gankersminers hate macroers small gang roamers hate hot dropperscap pilots hate super cap pilotsand they all have a right to but that doesnt mean one has the right to nerf the other or eliminate the other from the gamepersonally im an 03 player thats dabbled in most aspects of the game except macroing lvl 5 missioning and ninja salvaging so if noone speaks up as the devils advocate against an argument i feel inclined there was a time where people believed the instalocking perma point lowsec hic should be an exploit not a tactic and it still exists to this day with a few tweaks like stacking penalties and max sig res but believe you me when i jumped through a gate yesterday and a remoted sebod stilleto locked me the minute he clicked me and i didnt even get a chance to cloak little lag was prolly a factor too i had no choice but to burn to the gate and jump back throughsucks yes valid tactic yes slowed my day down definitelyso yes when im roaming and i get hot dropped i agree it sucks but ive also been on the other side of that when its went well and when its failed horribly when it goes well its alot of fun but when it fails horribly is really sucks so as i said above there are other factors at play with the hot drop game mechanic that arent even related like lag actual newer player surprise lack of knowledge of tactics to fight and counter caps the easiest answer is always to nerf with the current mechanics artillery is op not because it actually is but because in high lag situations and lack of heavy tanked bs the alpha fleet can succeed as the alpha fleet is the natural counter to the rr fleet which is the natural counter to the sniper fleet which is the natural counter to the close range fleetand so on and so forth carrier roaming and hotdropping is just as much part of the game as cruiser roaming and baiting thing is though as capital numbers proliferate the number of hot drops will increase 2 years ago the number of capital ships outside of the big 00 alliances was much smaller than it is today this meant there was less hot drops just like there was less titans which meant less dds now proliferation of numbers can show inherent flaws in mechanics or just make undesirable mechanics more popular such as the artillery buff rejuvenating highsec ganking and the drama that ensued and since to this date ccp has refused to put artificial limits on certain ship classes as per numbers of their hulls one cannot limit the number of carriers or dreads or scs or titans in the game because the amount of minerals in the game is infinite we can expect the number of capitals to continue growing till hotdropping is pointless cause everyone will beable to counter it but unfortunately we are at that stage right now where there are enough caps to be an annoyance to roamers but not enough for hot drops to be uncommon due to riskas for the argument of it being easy it may seem to the target to be easy but for myself to say i want to put my 11 bil isk carrier on the line to gank someone in lowsec not knowing if someone in a sc gang is looking for a target and my hot drop would provide that to them one fix would be to disallow super caps in low sec period this would  alot of people off including myself but would result in cap hot drops being more common but super cap hot drops wouldnt exist as i have stated earlier i think the fix will be found in a counter to the mechanic not changing it continued
also bobbeh nobody is trying to eliminate hot drops as valid game tactic those who do are just trollingall moderate ideas merely shift the timing and placing of the hot drop with net gain of 2040 secondsas far as strategic hot dropping goes  with numerous people on both sides theyd hardly be effected at all the most significant change in tactics would occur on the small scale when smallfast gangs are being dropped by largeslow gangs and even then people would still be able to execute hot drops successfully they will just need to put a little more effort and thought into itso its wrong to defend cyno mechanics in a way that assumes we are trying to get rid of it thats not what we are arguing
because changing the mechanic is any way always will result in breaking something else or an undesired affect that we were unaware of in testing simple counters would be in the first x period of time 515 seconds a cyno can be blocked with a module like a warp scram or a focus point during that period the ship wouldnt suffer any penalties of the cyno module but would broadcast system wide a cyno beacon and if it was jammed successfully the cyno module would be shut off and not beable to reactivate for 3060 seconds the work around would be multiple cyno ships in one fleet cause you cant jam all of them problems with keeping the same mechanic but not allowing ships to jump for a certain period is that the cyno ship suffers because for that period they must tank the entire enemy gang alone or with very little support as ive stated earlier the main ship for cynos is the one with the bonus to it force recons this ships are not built to tank dps or fight 1v1 against hacs bcs bss and the like they are force multipliers through ecm and cynos this being their role any change to the mechanic will have an adverse affect on their use and abilities for positive or negative making cynoing  hot dropping too hard will remove it as a valid pvp tactic i do agree in to the statement that hot dropping in your sphere of influence is a relatively easy maneuver and the further from your comfort zone you go the harder and more dangerous it is an rl example is it is realtively easy to make and plant an ied on the side of the road in iraq and afganistan but it is a painful and hard job to find and disarm them but if your not vigil for them you will be killed and the bomberterrorist activist will have done minimal worknow i know eve isnt rl and rl isnt eve but the example applies in the way that its easy to set up an ambush that will have almost instant pay off but its very hard to avoid it and scoutprepare for itso lets think about it from a ig sense if a fleet was having problems with cynos and hot drops what kind of technology would they create or make mobile or how would they change their strategieswell first off theyd probably bring ship scanners and be vigil for certain ship classes acting funny and scan them for cynossecondly they would not engage targets if there was a decent chance it was a trap that they couldnt counter or deal withas for techtheyd probably try to make the cyno jammer tech mobile or focused to shut down or block a cyno in a local area if that was impossible theyd probably find a way to scramble it so that there was a delay in its broadcasting if that failed to come through they would probably find a way to expedite their withdraw from ambush engagements through fitting certain modulesi have to head to my graduate classes but ill continue when i return in 3 hours

going to point everyone in this thread to what will be the upcoming dev blogs friday it sounds like providing the minutes for the rest of the csm summitpart 2  economist discussing how these huge 00 fights are critical to keeping the economy from spiraling into massive deflation in fact he apparently was discussing his worries about the decreased amount of pvp and the effect it has had on the market read this as caps need to be able to fly around the galaxy so they get into fights and go boom to keep margins in the marketpart 3  devs agreeing that dominion didnt work so well and how they are worried about supercap proliferation and why it is a bad thing of course they werent privy to the dramatic increase in supercap losses of the last 2 weeks at the time of the summitso something has to change nerf cynos cause the little guys dont have them and thats not fair isnt the answer
actually part 3 says otherwiseso people can call it a nerf if they want to but something has got to give
stargates can only bring into system subcapital ships only at predefined spots and other side can be easily scoutedcynos can bring into system about anything suddenly at any spot no warping or whatever neededimho this is not a new issue and not related to amount of supercaps whatever its been always a tad bit overpoweredsuddenly capitals or titan bridge ggit would be good to have at least some kind of delay after cyno is activated so people can actually react to it even in laggy system i dont even mind if cyno ship can move after deploying it maybe it could be a probe you launch and it activates after x seconds
yes the problem with putting the counter on the cyno instead of the caps is that combat cynos will not work then titan bridges need to be able to instantly send subcaps to a cyno beacon if ccp wants null sec fights of any size to happen let alone cap fights im in favor of putting a counter on the cap jump itself but a cyno pilot should be able to instantly bridge a sub cap fleet into combatin null sec cap fights sub caps start the fight and caps jump in later so this really wouldnt change things much out here it would only limit the small super cap hot drops without support which is really the problem anyway
oh please what a cop outeccm is a counter to ecm does ecm still workwarp core stabilizer is a counter to warp disruptor does warp disruptor still worka hardener and armor rep is a counter to weapon damage do weapons still workall a cyno counter can do is provide a chance for the other side to win and chances to win are more dependent on player skill and preparedness

great idea
i will support proposals that let me sell you overpriced items faster
the fitting should add the ammo to cargo too
i would not protest if the saved fittings included the varieties of ammunition either i believe that this option would be easiest to implementafter all anything that allows players to get back into a fight pve or pvp is a good thing or to get into a fight in the first place 
seems like a good approach to me it might even cut down on server resource usage  if i undertand it right as the hit and hit quality wont be in doubt other than a range calculation no calculations about angular velocity between the two ships would be needed id imagine that calculation can get a bit recursive and from my very limited programing experience i remember recursive calculations can be pretty taxing at time of course ignoring speed would be a major changeit would add to the uniqueness of the weapon excellent frigate killers  and would make its roll specific adantage large enough to overcome their lack of flexibilty in range and damage type
and allow us to set passwords for different divisions in the wallet to keep large amounts of isk safe from my own foolish
i saw many people making proposals how to solve bots problem and in every time one of the reasons against it was bots read client memory and nothing can be donethis is first solution that i saw that cant be answered with that answer becouse bots cant read pictures and becouse of that i suport this very muchsome ppl love to answer nothing can be done or do nothing players must kill themwe all know who talks like thatyou cant do anything to bots by killing them they loose like 150m yes but they earn billions per week they just buy another hulk and continue to earn their free billionsand about load on server bots are creating unnecessary loadyou all could saw in devs blog how load decreased after ccp banned that much botsso with this you will maybe increase load by fiew  but with les bots load will decrease by like 30and one more  for this is that it can be implementad easier then any other solutionthat was my 5 cents
so to kill off bots you want to use captcha thisnidea is not new and certainly not worth implementing the proposal certainly does not prevent bots from operating and serves to inconvenience real playersdo pvpers want to have a permit for every time they fire a weaponwe already have a permit for all in game activities that is the subscription fee
captcha again wtfmachines are heaps better at solving most captcha when compared to how many attempts a human needs to get them rightthey have been scientifically proven to be complete crapeven if you run some kinda social network never resort to the dumb idea which is captchagot an awesome captcha ever heard of amazon mechanical turknever supported
im not saying its easy and maybe they could still jump but the idea that they can jump and the enemy faction on the other side of the gate cant even shoot them without going gcc is a horrible mechanic this needs to be fixed as it clearly makes neutral pilots more valuable to the war cause than pilots who actually enlist
they would need a much better as if eve doesnt already need it control interface to do something like this and have it worth whilei still support it though
supportedit reminds me of freelancer what an awesome game btwthe background nebulas made sense and space actually was fun to explore to find new jumpholes hidden stations huge wrecked ships etci remember flying through that abandoned mothership in the omicron alpha systemmemories

thats what i was picturing when i read your post opi dont know if ccp has the time or manpower to get stuff like this done but i can agree one of eves biggest faults is its lack of visual adventure lots of cool artwork but its all just pinups to look at
supportedit sounds fair and works well seems to be the only people complaining are those afraid to lose their risk free scam besides shouldnt we have a market that makes sense
i understand that some dont make much sense but the same holds true for many moon materials as welli think the benefit of fixing the pi market vastly outweighs that issuealso supporting my own proposal
you cant revert reactions advanced materials are fixed and cant be recycledall you can do is recycle the t2 components and get advanced materials for comparison this would be like recycling pos modules or whatever comes after the advanced commodities as this is the case youre fineyou even have a case thats way worse t3 subsystems those are made from subsystem components and cant be recycled so if you want something to be recyclable start there not with the pi stuffnot supported working like everything else

issue low sex is an unhabited wasteland that is used as a dangerous highway to get between point a and b with no compelling reason to stay there activities that before used to occur in lo sec such as missions and mining have all but disappeared and even pirates are starting to feed on each other out of sheer boredomproposed solution rebalance all pve content in lo sec to be doable with pvp fits and to better reflect a pvp environment this means a reasonable amount of pvp fitted buffer tanked not too isk intensive ship setups should be viable for completing lo sec missions also upgrade the payouts and spawns in them to make them more worthwhile and perhaps most important give all lo sec mobs sleeper ai which does not stick with the first thing targeted forever and targets on the base of threat health etcrationale the proposals that i have seen here to fix lo sec tend to focus on downgrading high sec and to come from self righteous pirates that think they are somehow entitled to shoot defenseless pve setups this i believe misses the main problem with the pve content that makes participation in it so unrewarding the mission balance is ill thought off making pve content both unrewarding and requiring massive isk investments in ships to complete ships which are for all purposes defenseless against a decently fit pvp setup consequently nobody not in an unprobeable t3 tends to participate in this contentmy proposal is to rebalance the missions to be in line with the territory favoring buffer tanks and standard pvp setups and making such fits bot able to complete the content and to do so in a reasonable time frame furthermore the situation where mobs stick with the first thing they target is ridiculous resulting in an automatic gang bang for whoever had the aggro when the pirates warp inthe proposal would address this since barging in in a mission would no longer be a mindless affair where the missioner is usually pre engaged pre damaged and sometimes pre scrammed but a fluid battlefield with risk for both the missioner and the attackerwhy this should be done i know of a lot of people that enjoy pvp and would enjoy participating in lo sec content such as l5 missions however at this time engaging in those activities is akin to a death wish a plump turkey flying into the wolfs den i contend that making the content reflect the area and the reasonable setups for that area as well as transforming static death traps into compelling fluid battlefields where there is a risk for the attacker as well and a possibility to defeat them would go a long way towards reinvigorating the areafurthermore it would provide a compelling and alluring experience for players which would be distinctive both from hi sec missions and null belt ratting just as it should be delivering more small gang warfare and more population across lo sec as a whole as the risk and rewards would be in harmony and the ship setups would be reasonable and balanced
the only problem with lo sec is hi sec the entire spectrum needs to be worked on
changing high security missions isnt going to affect low security missions significantly gallians is right i would never fly a plump turkey into a wolfs deni support the original proposal
because sex is too low
the problem is that people have this idea that low sec can compete with hi sec
this would be great have slots for missions a place where the mission name and acceptdecline buttons go if you decline a mission you would have to wait 4 hours until the game gives you a new mission all by itself you dont have to ask for one and the get a new mission now for a loss of standings would be removed you would be unable to get a new mission in that slot for 4 hours mission would be grayed out
what will really happen is pilots will farm more missions in their existing mission hubthe way to spread mission runners out is to limit the number of missions the agents give out at all one the well runs dry it only fills up again very slowly this will push mission runners out to agents that actually have missions to offercombine this with a listing of which mission runners consumed the most missions from each agent we might see some actual pvp arising due to competition for the good agentsthere is no reason to make life easier for mission runners
no they wont no more missions means end of subscriptions for ccp carebears wont use border agents and go to lowsec its wont happen being able to select highsec missions out of a list means carebears will go back to the better paying border agents rather than staying in a overcrowded deep highsec hub running a poorly paying agent
yeah lets fight bots and rmt by making them more simple to setup lets extend this idea and instead of making the same mission again and again just spawn the isk 5 times a day and lp 10 times a day to everyone docked in an agent station
supported
on this topic the following thread is an excellent proposal that goes well with this one
i like the basic idea of having a few different missions to choose from this would be a sort of solution for people who dont want to fight against some specific faction without forcing them to have multiple agents in the area or stop from missioning for the 4 hours im not going to comment on how many mission slots you should have available or how long the cooldown timer should be since they are a side issue from my point of view they can be tweaked to whatever seems balanced once you decide to go through with the basic ideawhat i do not like about this is that the number of slots is based on your standings it is a logical alternative but this is as good a chance to inroduce a new and meaningful charisma based skill to eve as we propably will ever get as a bonus it could also be a high rank social skill since the benefits are obvious to everyone who has ever flown missions on a regular basis using standings as the basis for the extra slots will also make the beenfit apply only to high level missions is there any reason you would want to do this surely the extra slots would be desirable on lower levels too if you use a skill for the extra slots the benefits of the system will also show up on missions of all levels and not just on higher levels support for the general idea though
i think rather then choosing a specific mission you should be able to choose either the mission for more money and small standing increase or the mission for nosmall amount of money but larger standing increase it would defo stop it being such a grind just so i can refine or use a specific rd agent for that corp

what are you talking about
if you want cap protection from nuets fit specifically for an insane cap use cap recharger batteries and rigs to make it impossible to cap you out or deal with it like i do good method is use a nos to cap him out and have projectile guns so you can still shoot
maybe that would work if i were playing station games or some other highsec carebear bs but not in 00 or even lowsec for that matterlets look at it this way folksgallente have several ships that get a bonus to active tanking lets take a myrmidon for exampleeven fit w autocannons once you put on a cap booster or two youve still got to power at minimum 2 medium armor reppers that suck even more cap because of the at least 1 nanobot accelerator i rig then youve also got your scram web abmwd and whatever else you like in your mid slots an possibly an active hardener or 2 once you stick only the ammo youd need for a short roam and fill the rest of your hold w cap boosters youll still only have enough to get you through 2 or 3 good fightsnow lets imagine you run into a gang of 4 or 5 frigates lets say jags wolves and a dramielno problem right your scramweb combo whould be enough to let your drones pull them apartwrong they each have a small neut fitted now your cap boosters cant pump the juice fast enough to keep up w the drain because of reload times and before you know it your myrm is an insurance claim and the frigs are running for bigger ships to scoop your loot including the cap booster charges still in your hold when you blew upso heres the deal if im going to spend a few million on a ship it damn well better have an auxillary generator battery backups or something to keep me from being capped out i can buy something to lower my chances of getting jammed scrammed tracking disrupted and sensor damped and there are drugs to counter target painting effects but there isnt a damn thing i can do about nosneuteve is a big game of chess for every move a counter move nosneut has no counter cap boosters are not a counter and neither are cap rechargers etc as fitting for insane cap is possibly the stupidest thing ive ever heard since theres no way of telling whether or not youre actually going to encounter cap warfare or not and wasting the slots on such a fitting is utterly moronichope ive cleared up things a little and given you an idea of the kinds of scenarios i had in mind when i proposed this i think it would be a boon to active tanked ships and make even the venerable hyperion a more atractive ship to fly in pvp
cap batteries should be immune to nosneut protecting the amount of cap the battery is worth

ill get to the point eve needs a new manual control system point and double click is awful to me and just leaves a lot of possible content in this game out automatically please note that i in no way advocating for removal of any of the automatic control systems as they are now all i want is the following2 controls one for deceleration the other for acceleration for this there would be a bar on the speedometer or whatever its called at the bottom of the screen that shows to what point youre accelerating too once the actual speed reaches this desired point the ship stops accelerating the ship can also go backwards very slowly by pressing the deceleration button furthertoggle key for wasd qe controls for the ship essentially w is up a is down and so forth q and e rotate the ship hold another button possibly shift or whatever your choice and then press q or e at the same time to strafepossible joystick controls should also be optional keep in mind that such controls would mainly benefit possible features of the game that could still be developed and give eve a much more immerse feelingthat is all
that is not evenot supported
this is quite possibly the worst reason i have ever seen for not supporting an idea a cookie for youhonestly i dont see why you wouldnt support it since it doesnt take away from any of the current options but rather just adds to them and doesnt alter gameplay at all unless you really want to use it 247 even then it wouldnt be gamebreaking at all
what is backwards is that something like heading forwards in a different directioncheck out the new keyboard shortcuts on singularity i think you will be pleasantly surprised
not a new ideause
this idea has been proposed and debated ad nauseum please thank you for your input but do search the forums before proposing a common idea you are sure to find a thread with a long debate and worked out proposal on it no need to make a new oneand no not supported for now  the reason is the server load this would cause also remember that you are commanding a starship not flying a fighter craft wasd would maybe make sense for frigates but hardly anything larger than a cruiser
this bug wasnt discovered on the test server  that why i posted ot heretheres the same issue with militia corps wardekking another militia corp  can only see them when you put militia members on overview tooi personally think its because when you uncheck the pilot has neutral standing button in the states tab militia wartargets having neutral standing disappears tooperhaps ccp could modify the overview settings so that the system is not what you dont want to see  you untic but what you want to see  you ticanybody understood that last line
yep the killmail should accuratly show what killed your ship
while i do agree that non combat players should be aloud to bet on the fighti do not agree that it should be instanced arena combat it should be on the field in regular spacefurthermore to avoid exploits threw suicide ganking the contract becomes null and viod if either ships are killed by non registered combatantshere is how you win1 whomever does more total damage this includes repped damage to the other player wins only the isk at risk this is in the situation where niether player can kill the other2 if a player leaves the field of combat 250km radius from start of fight then the other player wins the isk at risk3 which ever player is left alive after the fight gets salvage rights to the wreak and the isk at risk
its just gonna break down to who has more neutral logis anyway
exactly i wont change anything now it will just be getting jumped by 1 guy and his 19 neutral basilisksplus ca change plus cest la meme chose
perhaps you did not read that part when any non combat player tries to either rr or attack either combat player concord steps in and kills themor are you suggesting that you will have enough rr to tank concord
there are a lot of threads discussing cynojammers jumpdislocators and other ideas to prevent hotdropsi recently came to the realisation that the objective with changes to the jumpmechanics should be to make capitals vulnerable if tricked and not just to insure that you dont get ganked by bored rich kidswhat i think would work add a fuel modifier based on security of destination system ex times 5 sec x 101 to jump into a 04 system that alleviates the hotdrops into lowsec but doesnt remove it  just ups the cost and add possible logistics factor add a module hics only perhaps that works in null and lowsec when activated on a grid with a cyno either before or after lighting any jumps to said cyno consumes all fuel in bay remove ability to store fuel in corporate hangars in carriers and scs andor add a limited storage capacity for refuelling purposesresult capitals jumping to an interdicted system without spare fuel become stranded read vulnerable until fuel can be brought in  introduces the sadly lacking idea of supply lines and tender ships makes cross cluster jumping and lowsec hotdrops more of a challenge with logistics involved rather than just pressing a button a few times makes capitals proper assets that takes thought to use and not just a random ship that can be thrown around willy nillyaddendum create an armoured version of the jump freighter to act as tender ships that can follow a capital task force around with fuelammoreduced carrying capacity and maybe even some limited fitting options no high slots though dont want cloaks on them if fuel becomes an issue it couldshould be added as a product manufacturable through pi
i think a cruise battery does 17 dps before damage mitigation they are unspeakably bad the only reason that people dont really care is that no has any sp invested in pos batteries
switch agents
its a bad suggestion to decline courier missions just because you dont like themthere are already too many occasions that i have to deny missions just because they want me to kill minmatar or gallente
while raising standings for noncombat alts courier missions are quite welcome while my main is busily blasting through combat missions the alt can afk ap the courier mission very low reward but there is no risk or interaction requiredyes it is easy to bot how would you modify courier missions in order to make them less mechanical ideas that occur to me after a few seconds of superficial thought include having the agent redirect the shipment midmission require the player to carry contraband have a delivery that must be made inside a particular window of time no sooner than x no later than y or multiple items only a small number of which need to be dropped off at a number of stations along the routeimho removing courier missions altogether will hurt more players than botters
they could make it a mission type where you move goods through deadspace areas trying to avoid npcs and sensor grids which would be dynamic so it would be harder to bot them
if you want to run combat missions in a mammoth go ahead and do so pi would prefer courier missions staying like they are nowbthe macros that get blown up by suicide bankers will be losing standings for failing missions  it all adds up eventually
bots already have perfect standings from running 237 youll lose sec faster than they lose standings
yes lets behave like headless chicken and kill a completely decent type of mission just to satisfy our craving for security against what we perceive as a threat now where did i hear something like that in rl again
i always hated that center for advanced studies only had advisory agents and even more when my level 3 agent gave me 6 courier missions into lowsec in a row courier missions have some flaws that im not entirely sure how to work out but thats not a good justification for removing themnot supportedas it stands the best way to make money andor raise standings via courier missioning is to get a good storyline agent so that the quick courier missioning pace keeps the storyline missions rolling the best way to thwart macro miners then is to keep courier missions short and lowpay and make sure storyline missions are complex enough that macros cant complete them
not supported the more kind of missions the better imo i might have supported this if we had to many kinds of mission tho
i must say i a sorry to rented i was wrong on the way that would work out as a side note it would have also inc damg on smaller ships too i am suprized that did not come up as well loli think you for helping me to better understand turrent weapons
i think the reason hybrids keep slipping by unchanged is that the caldari ships do fine with missiles and the gallente ships do fine with drones that puts the pure hybrid ships mostly or completely out of businessan easy fix boost the hybrid weapon bonuses on ships that rely heavily on thema balanced fix listen to a lot of the player ideas here about fixing them and come up with a new setup that puts them right alongside other weapon types and then to balance things out make sure that the drone and missile ships that can use hybrids dont become overpowered because of it possibly remove a turret hardpoint from most drone boats and missile ships are probably fine since they dont have hybrid bonuses anyway
its called petition
it was escalated and allthough the gm and senior gm replies have been read on various forums they cant be shown on this onebasicly what this 1 corp did is similar to the wardec cleaning alliance you mentioned but you are allowed to leave an alliance that has a war and you are allowed to rejoin said alliance again later i think a fair minded gm or senior gm for that matter could have used discretion in this and deemed it an exploit but i know this isnt a unique case and having dealt with similar cases they have to show consistency even if it is becoming glaringly obvious its wrongim still waiting for more csm viewpoints on this and indeed other aspects of the wardec system im sure potential voters are as well
do a bit of research that ruling was rescinded you can find relatively recent tread 23 months ago were there were senior gm comments stating that leaving a wardecced alliance is non exploit under any circumstance included a reinforced pos
i have no experience in wardec mechanics but would this be a viable patch to current mechanics for this problemwhen a corp a leaves an alliance with an active war vs corp b corp a is automatically at war with corp b for 24 more hours the 24 hours are treated like the last day in a warweekthis may cause problems due to the limit on active wars permitted by corps but im not sure what problems that would cause
it would have to be the latter everyone knows she has none of the former
i agree services like police are pair for by taxes and fines no one should need to bribe concord to do there job in highsec not to mention it would create a tremendous isk sink there is enough oppunities for destruction in highsec as it stands and it would make it a lot harder smaller player corps expaically those just starting offhowever the idea of possible extra protect in lowsec could bring more people to lowsec for example possibly paying other npc police corportations to provide limited protection say if you have a pos in a particular system

well you have to look at it this way ccp has only so much money to spend on fanfest so the options were1 spend a lot of money on booth babes aka summer glau instant virgin detectors hundreds of players totally fail to get anywhere with them and drown their sorrows in astronomically overpriced icelandic booze2 spend the boothbabe money on subsidizing alcohol sales hundreds of players depressed by the lack of booth babes drown their sorrows in only stratospherically overpriced icelandic boozeit was a tough call but thats what were not paid for you will note that we fought hard to get you cheaper alcohol at the party at the top of the world in the hopes that more inexpensive intoxication would induce a particularly potent beergoggle effect in the icelandic maidenry

csm is aware theyre just incapable of working together and coming up with a solution that and ankhasemtapemkah was really the only person who brought up any gallenterelated issues at all funnily enough she got bootedyou wont see anything  at all  until next csm these guys have mostly been focused on getting ccp to be more responsive after the disaster that was tyrannis
being someone who checks killboards on csm people before voting i am under the impression that several fly gallente ships from time to timei would point out that gallente recons are pretty good i would put them in 23rd place of the races minmatar recons are an easy last place for those recons for carriers scarriers dreads gallente are general top picks gallente titan is fairly meh though the rest of the gallente line up is pretty nonfunctionalit wont happen with this csm because this csm has been busy kicking ccp to clean out the backlog of all the stuff csm proposed and ccp said well do that then hadnt no sense adding to the backlog unless it is something that needs immediate attention the majority of subcap gallente ships have sucked for roughly two years now so i wouldnt consider it a rush that needs to sideline other things to fix right nowthat said i support gallente attributes and bonuses being fixed across the board
you didnt read the thread did youthis thread is not about the consequences of adding nudity or futanari to the expansion it is about the choice of weather or not they should be in the expansion things like how it is implemented ratings and censorship are not part of the decision making process of this thread this thread is solely for people to support if they think incarna should follow the lore close enough that gender is optional in gallente stations

i would do it like thismain char is 100 training speed if you want a 2nd char on the same account your training speed is 12 on that char and a 3rd 13 on that char
why not throwing in a plex on the second or third character to start the skillqueue until the plex is gone wouldnt hurt anyone
this is exactly what im doing witch you agree make more income for ccp for the meanwhile but the but in the butter once i have the skills needed ill just close the other account and so somehow falsified subscriptions statisticsthis in not a valid option to determinate the good direction the game is taking to improve it and grow the number of real new subscribers or have real numbers about the positive interest the game has to attract new playersif all the guys plaing several alts with plex tomorrow decides to close 1 or 2 accounts just to prove they have more impact than you think im pretty sure there would be some panicat the end if you want to play several char at the same time you still need to have more accounts than the guy that chooses to play one or the other char in his single account
thank you for your support yahtheres a whole lot thats weird in new eden8the mach is a battleship its as big of bigger than carriers people carry around 10 cubic meters worth of implants in their skulls etccould be but i think that gameplay supersedes spatial concerns treat implants similar to mods on a ship after all theres no reason that any of the guns engines etc of a ship would be intact after it was blown into scrap
you are mixing your quotes i never cited fiction i cited rl and and a logic approach to the game no one will use a station that is extremely dangerous even the pirates of the caribbean had rules and killing wasnt rampant and if you really need an explanation why it will become halo or any other first person shooter as soon as you give access to weapons and the possibility to combat in a station outside of a full invasion of the station you suffer from a lack of comprehension on how people play even if people interested in killing for fun and murdermails would be 1100 of the eve playerbase they will make moving around in any populated station a game of room to room combat you can think that it will be fun but i dont play eve to participate in a fps
ahh the same wonderful factual refutation the argument from nuhn unhthe fact that were already allowed to gank anybody anywhere and the game hasnt turned into freespace ii shows that if were allowed to gank people in stations that wont turn into halo to say nothing of the fact that many people will still be playing the spaceship game and not space barbie feel free to respond with nuhn unh talk about a lack of logiccurrently you cant even get out of your pod and do anything at all even when you can the plan is to only let you play space barbie obviously you dont play eve to play space barbie because it does not exist obviously you dont play eve to do stuff when you get out of your pod because thats impossible so if firstthirdwhatever combat is added in stations and you totally ignore it it will be the same game for you that its always been
i completely agree with opinion that at stations firing or at least fights should be possiblenow the station too safe place also was always safe but it seems to me that would be more interesting if the player knew that it is sometimes more safe to sit in the own ship than to be at stationin the second turn the player should understand that without using possibility to leave a capsule he loses any interesting and unique useful thingsfor example to the player with the low security status or have a bounty on him it would be more dangerous at military station caldari gallente amarr or minmatar than to the player with the high security statusif the player hates amarr race it is more dangerous to it to be at the stations belonging amarr than on any othersif at the player the high security status it is more dangerous to him to be at piracy stations for example station of angel cartelit would be interesting if having come into a bar it was possible to receive the interesting missions not similar to the oldin additives it would be interesting if it was possible to spend diversions in various sites of station for example temporarily to break some of her functionsit seems to me that the station from within should be a small prototype of a starmap in which there are the safe systems dangerous and very dangerous systems and also such in which not so simply to get accessif at station it will be not interesting the player wont have a powerful stimulus to leave the capsule only to walk and play in an arcade in a barseparately it is necessary to take into consideration outposts and stations belonging to playerspresence of personal premises in which access will be interesting to owners of stations will be possible only at them andor their corporationalliance
lol you drive around in a car attached to an assembly line with industrial robots sounds like it wouldnt manage to turn the tight corners
good stuff this is the sort of brainstorming that i hope is going to be going on back at ccp
on the technical side of things i could definitely see this being possible if they used instancing in stations since a station is much smaller than the universe i dont see why this feature couldnt be implemented at the very least on a basic level the main problem being developing the combat mechanicsengine to handle it but since theyre already building incarna im assuming they have at least a basic framework given dust as well but id definitely say that the best way to avoid performance issues would be to instance the stations in some way either have each deck be its own enclosed space having to use an elevator or lift to access the next area and thus help with performance or something akin to that since i can foresee some technical issues in stations like jita where everybody and their mother is in a station another idea is perhaps limiting this sort of interaction to nontrade hubs so stations like jita you wouldnt be able to do any sort of combat but all other less populated stations you can lore wise you can say that in jita everyone gets scannedpatted down and weapons are left at the door
the lore of the game is that it is the capsule which downloads your mental information and which sends it to a clone as well as the device that ensures the death of the capsuleerganking in stations does not fit at all with thati would like to see this but it would have to be controlled stronglyidiots suicide ganking with biomassable no skill characters comes to mind as the first concern and i think id like to see incarna and wis before thinking either way
not supported docking is no combat undocking is rock and roll time
the idea consists that while you havent left a capsule and you havent gone for a walk on station you stay in absolutely safetyjust as and earlierbut at station it is safe only in safe sectorsthe capsule can transfer mind of the character to cloning station on huge distancesprobably within the station a lot of power it is not necessary for information transfer
please read the official lore that is associated already with pod pilots walking around in stations in fact jita station is where this chronicle takes place even there pilots can go places where they could be killedseems to me that ccp is definitely planning for stations to not be happyhappyunicornsandrainbows land
theyve already invested a lot of time and resources in incarna they might as well let it pay off and make it fun incarna is already beyond the spaceship game better if it has some pewpew instead of just dressing dollssupported
see this is just completely disrespectful of the games lore as well as any sort of verisimilitude anything they put into the game has to be in some way believable barring abstractions they put in for conveniences sake ie instant docking no crew management allowing people to run around highsecurity stations with arms in hand completely breaks any sort of willing suspension of disbelief it just doesnt make any sense and as long as you continue to ignore the issue it never will as it is simply illogicalperhaps in lowsecurity stations and pirate havens they may have a policy of weapon possession instation that and nullsec stations where the owner sets the policy are the only places where i can possibly imagine it being allowed if it were allowed exclusively in those situations i could support it otherwise its just putting in gameyness for the sake of it
the problem is not if the capsuleer could be killed but whether he could be cloned in the same fashion as in a capsule yes there is a framework for capsuleers walking around is there one for dying and coming back outside of a capsule
sound like words of player which is afraid of nullsecs and constantly cryingin books films cartoons other games scenarios there is no pirates crimes bad and mad peoples can be everywhere where it is possible and impossible how about real lifei think that it in general the basic part of of all films and serials i even cant imagine a film where it wouldnt be maybe only in melodramasin such cases a question usually in what pluses and minuses of criminal actions in concrete places and a casesi agree that in systems with high security status to bad guys should be is more difficult to do dirty work than in systems with low level security and their illegal actions should be punished more stronglyto get a gun  already should be aggression in hisecstationsalso at the station there should be safe zones and risk zones in which just and there can be a fight or firingbut duly a realism genre it should be present at gameat stations sansha angel guristas serpentis can be on the contrary more safe for bad guys than for the goodalso there should be a possibility to remain in a capsule in the dock on old traditionin that case we should be in perfect security at stationsafety everywhere it is unreal and uninterestingdark dangerous space and even at home bad peoples may kick your ass if there are no other good people nearby like security officers  it is a real interesting scenario
no but we should be able to poison people who fail jumped have bar room brawls occasional knifing maybe push people into airlocks and jettison them set explosives in their room regular eve stuff theres plenty of mayhem we should be able to do in stations that would fit eve but will apparently not be releasedthey should lose the sp they gained since the last time they were in the pod definitely should lose any implants they have in honestly that isnt the weirdest thing i think will happen with incarna  what happens when a character is in station and disconnects emergency warp does the character run for the nearest bathroom does the character just dematerialize
stop stop right there trying to attribute qualities to me that i have never exhibited symptoms of is a very very easy way to completely remove anything you say of any sort of credibility whatsoever i am concerned about believability i am not concerned about safety i am concerned my immersion will be broken by someone walking up to someone in the middle of a highsecurity station filled with all kinds of sensors and cameras with a weapon in hand through some nebulous incredible miracle even if that guy is shot dead as soon as the weapon is pulled my immersion has been broken the illusion is gone maybe you can understand that better and stop trying to pretend im being some kind of imaginary carebear crybabyi can support brawls because that actually makes sense explosives less so again security at every checkpoint but the other stuff makes far more sense than people walking around with guns in hand in places they clearly should not have them
1 supported more needed than just walking
it is a great idea there are some who will argue with something like eve is for spaceshipz but whatever lolif they do this it will no doubt take a while for us to get it but hey man awesome idea supported
i have told that it sounds like but hasnt told that it is truth anyway sorry for that not all of people write on english i can translate correctly psthe strange thought has jumped in a head one character in a hangar winds an 10 meters orbit around other character and avoids half of damage from its assault blastermiss hit miss hit
right i think thats just about enough derailing thankyou may i suggest you go back through all the old info on the development of eve go ask a dev or a gm ask some of the older players or even email ccp themselves and ask one question what has been your vision for eve from the beginning or i can save you all that time and effort and tell you right now from the very beginning eve was destined not only to be an internet spaceships game but a fully realised scifi universe with as many layers to it as possible ccp started to build this universe with pew pew in outer space and once their income was assured and a playerbase established the plan moved aheadwork began on the next step in creating this scifi universe its development title being walking in stations a rather bland name for what is essentially the other half of this game world now 5 years on and with a real deployment name of incarna we are almost there the universe for us is almost complete to you incarna seems to be fluff and nonsense you think it is taking time away from fixing other things that you deem more important yet what you fail to realise is that the people working on incarna were hired to do just that noone responsible for bug hunting patch deployment or any of these other areas you deem important have been retasked to work on incarna it has its own team of people and its own section of the budget and it doesnt interfere with anything else your bugs will be hunted your fixes deployed and the world will keep turning on its axis so calm down read up on how ccpwhitewolf operate realise that the masses dont tell ccp how to spend its money or its resources and for god sake cheer up
yeah a bit weird innit
i support ideaif our character shortly ceases to be a simple portrait the height choice will be necessary for him and also it is necessary to think of other parts of a body such as hands feet a neck
support this idea
maybe a 1 range but different height for different racesimhogallente  normal females shorter todays averagecaldari  taller males  females have same range theyre s bred for warminmatar  shorter males  females have same range hardy folkamarr  varied females shorter many systemsraces subjugatedor something like that without going the elvesdwarfs path
more diversity can only be good the editor already has quite limited options 
supportedi doubt theyll implement it but id love to see more ways to tell characters apart from a distance or in a crowd height would certainly help if we could modify our posture would be even betterim gonna stop dreaming now 
 whenever that is 
yes even if the 1 foot was only broken into 3 options short normal tall
wow you are really misinformed you must have somehow missed the csm minutes where basically ccp told the players representatives that just about every area of spaceships will have to wait for 18 months while they work on incarna and dust and i am not just talking about bugs  indeed i dont think anything i mentioned was a bug read the dev blog that followed that showed how few resources at ccp were dedicated to spaceships it tried to do damage control but basically gave the truth very few resources were put toward spaceships especially considering that what they counted toward eve also included dust you should do the reading read the minutes from the first meeting between ccp and csm go ahead and tell me how many times they said they were delaying things 18 months to work on this i dare you and the whole point of assembly hall is to tell ccp what the players want it appears lots of players want ccp to continue to dedicate their resources to cosmetic issues of how they look prancing around stations im sorry i dont care if i am a foot taller or shorter i like the game they made with spaceships but it could be allot better ccp agrees but they are waiting until this incarna stuff is done yes i know they have a whole science fiction world planned from the beginning it has dust for the out of space ship fighting and incarna for strutting around and playing dressup but lots of people would prefer they not abandon the spaceship part of the game any longer thats my opinion get incarna out but for god sakes 18 months likely 2years of abandoning the space ship game is long enough give the space ships at least 18 months of dev time before they turn back to the space barbie part
jack you have made your point please stop derailing this thread i posted this to find support for my idea not for people to complain about how their stuff isnt getting dealt with
i am going to support this height is one of the basic attributes of a person it has to be supported
hotdropping sucks give jumpdrives a healthy amount of spooluptime its a joke capitals are easier to deploy on a tactical level than battleshipscapitals should be a strategic element so hell yes make it come true
not supported dreads already suck ass as theyre only useful vs structures carriers should be more than heavy transports that repair said structures if the hot drop is nerfed all capital pilots should have their skill points as well as the value of the skill books reimbursed
i believe you are taking it way too far the nerf we are discussing is not an invalidation of hotdrops as a fleet tactic  it is merely a balancealso why would this balancing ruin it so much for dreadcarrier pilots as you say it has been a common fact now for some time that dreads need a buff and if you ask me carriers are fine as they are focus should be given to actually fixing dreads and leave the hotdrop mechanic as a topic of its own which we are discussing here
dear lord jesus christ how bad are you players that are getting hot droppedpossibility one hey look guys a single ship just engaged us on a gate hmm he must have some balls since its 8 on 1reason  obvious bait is super obviouspossibility two  hey look that crazy dude just lit a cyno what should we do o we should totally just stay here and see what comes throughreason  stupid player is stupidthe only time i have ever been hot dropped unexpectedly was wait i never haveon top of that any spool up timer added to either end will have one affect you cant get capitals to the battlefield in a timely mannerhey look they opened a cyno on grid cyno guy is now primary orhey look cyno is up off grid everyone fall back and run the hell awayi really dont mind the idea of an anti cyno bubble or module that has high requirement and stops cynos in an area as thats more tactical but to add spool up timers is uber ed
say what if the cyno ship has to decloak then site there with an advert that anyone in system can warp to for any length of time it best be in a deep safe that doesnt exist anymore or that cyno ship will be dead within a few seconds already ive been in fights where the cyno ship was killed before much of the fleet was able to get throughlet alone dropping on an enemy pos or fleet subcaps need to be able to bridge immediately caps should have to spool up
if a cyno is lit off grid the fastest way for anything larger than inty to get to it and open fire is about 20 seconds and thats for short warpsso if that type of delay is acceptable for regular fleet movements  warping between poss between gates why is it suddenly a noway for caps caps shouldnt be faster than subcapsas for ongrid cynos in combat situations unless you are lighting it right in the middle of a big hostile blob you can easily survive 20 seconds just your standard drake would doid say that 15 second delay between cyno and teleportation plus a cyno jammer module of limited range would be optimal way to bring balance to the whole cyno mechanic it would fit well with other elements of eve game design
supported ccp just seem to be ing up even more than normal recently
good idea
no need to decline the purchase if at least the hull can be purchased every available moduledroneammo can be fitted then the pilot can fly that ship to the next station to get the rest of the kitbut definitely supported
i like it make it happen you have your orders
its good idea anything what can make blasters better is good 
im against all these changes some of them more like killmail nerfing probing change and some of them less actually directional scan range differences i could almost support but i wouldnt tie them to sensor strenghtand when the hell you would even use the cloak breaking thing you are doing anomaly with main and keep alt with recon running the cloak breaker for your information if the cloaker is going to uncloak he will do it in the warp at you unless he is in bomber
some ideas are good some are bad some are ridiculous set local to delayed i loldi think you would get more of a response if you suggested things one by one where they could sink or swim in their own merits as an omnibus of a fix i am vehemently against it
nerf cloaking killmails and probing are you nuts no offense but not supported
i dont care if you offend me i care if you take the time to actually debate cloaking is barely nerfed in this idea probing is buffed really and killmails there is no defense for keeping them that isnt complete bull
im supporting this mostly because i find it more positive than negative actually the things that i dont find positive towards making a better game probably wouldnt make the game any worse eitherprobes do need to be reworked dscan is a clunky pos that needs to be changed into something better if local gets removed killmails put a rather pointless and annoying aspect on the game imobut nothing in that post is gamebreaking
careful people might think you are my alt or something
no
yes
please implement the openid provider on the evegatekillboards after some minimal modification will benefit tremendiously as it will be possible to post killmails and comments under you ingame character name without registering it on every killboard on the planet and a lot of killboards simply have registrating disabledevegate will benefit from that too just think how many players will start to use evegate if they will know that they will be able to login with it on most of killboards
would this provide another way for people to try and steal our accounts
the short answer is no
10
i propose that ccp be requested to invest one team of developers to the perpetual job of iterative development of past expansions contentccp has been extremely resistant to further development of past content in some ways theyve been positively dismissive of it nobody ever uses rockets but now theyve gone and done something very silly theyve proven then can create and invest a team to do this they just dont want to but now team gridlock is out there theyre doing excellent work and theyre really thinking about working on and making progress with problems created by a past expansioni propose that when team gridlock is done they or another team of developers immediately be put to work thinking about working on and making progress with problems from other past expansions this would be a perpetual development team in eve constantly making the past expansions better it would not be folded into development of new features ever theres no shortage of work for this proposed team1 fix lowsec faction warfare for heavens sake2 do a new iteration of cosmos missions with rewards that dont suck3 develop some new sleeper sites doing the same three sites is a bit dull4 continue developing and expanding pi5 retune the earlydeveloped l1l4 missions some l1l2 missions are stupidhard for a starting player im looking at you the blockade some l4 missions are stupideasy thatd be you massive attack6 develop a few more l4 missions people have all the current ones memorized7 give us the t3 frigates and weapons you promised us8 make certificates not suck9 engine trails cyno effectsthe list goes on these are things that are never going to be worked on because the current development teams are so focused on new features these new features are released then systematically ignored until three years later theyre fw and cosmos missionsso formal proposal i propose that ccp be requested to maintain at least one development team at all times whose focus will be continued iterative development or repair of past content
supporting my own proposal
yes ccp keeps stating well iterate on that later but with few exceptions it has never actually been done
i think i saw some new level 4s on the test server i didnt do them though i was too busy testing other stuffsupport
do this except for the part about t3 frigates horrible idea
yeah the suggestions on what such a team would work on are just that suggestions there are probably 25 other things i could have put down insteadthe point is that we keep asking for one or another single item on this list instead of just asking to change the dynamic of how ccp operates if theres a whole team devoted to making past features better theres no limit to the number of items theyd eventually get to
while i cant agree with every topic you posted and can think of others you didnt post i do agree with the core concept supported
i guess this would balance battleships more id love to see this happen
just give me a tengu with cruise launchers and the bonuses a t3 vargur a 15 drone using t3 domi a t3 nightmarethats all you need
on the surface your idea has merit the problem as i see it is that if you put a bow on a megathron its just a megathron with a bow it would be tough for players who unfortunately chose gallente to get behind an idea that would still see the pvp battleship of choice be anything but gallente
it does make sensesupported
this as its a simple fix however theyll catch on to it before longhow about having the roids coming from out of system barreling in would explain the resupply much better than the growing ones do nowsimilar to comets coming from the oortcloud that have been disturbed by a dark companionstaredit forgot to support
it might work buthow about tying the amount mined in a belt to the numbertoughness of the rats that spawn there the morefaster a belt is mined the more rats and tougher the rats thatll show up 2 topend hulks could generate enough rats to kill 1 of them type gig 3 and without coordinated attacks 1 of them will die 4 and even with coordinated efforts 1 of them will die if not all 4  1 after the other something like thisif you wanted to get a macro miners in highsec grab some friends and fly out and jetcan mine the area for a short time when huge waves of rats show warp out dead mining bargeexhumer by npcs this can remove the effective protections from highsec botters you run with a gang of 5 to 10 cruisers fitted with mining lasers and make a belt unsafe simply by mining it the same with ice or the like too
the root of the problem is that the most monotonic forms of gameplay are the ones that generate the highest incomes the root of the problem is that there are no policy restrictions on players logging in 24x7 30 days per plex the root of the problem is that everyone is so focussed on making isk they forget about the gamerestricting the activities of bots to those that a dedicated human player could manage for a sustained period ie no more than 8 hours of interaction per day will at least put the bots on a level playing field with the humans either limiting the hours that an account can be logged in or active or selling plex that grant hours of logged in time rather than 30 days of unfettered play would do the job the bots will keep going but at least theyll be cycling three times as much isk through the plex market into more deserving handsof course we are at an impasse since some players want to be able to afk cloak camp a suspected botting system 24x7
please read the other hundred of threads about the same idea before posting it again at least you will think about some of the problems of the suggestion and try to resolve them in your op1 scannable mining sites in alternative to fixed belts would be a good thing but making the scanning skills mandatory isnt a good ideathe new players already have a lot of skill to train making another set of them mandatory is counterproductive learning skills have been removed and now you want to make another set skillsproblem is that if you make the on board scanner sufficient to find the mining sites bots will use it and all return to the starting point2 small mining sites would bother much more corp level mining than bots bots operate on the principle of minimum wage so long as they get more than the cost of the subscription equipment and connection they are ok 3 ratters need easy to warp locations to rat or a huge increase of encounter sites again encounter sites can be found on the on board scanner and bots will not have trouble finding them4 00 roaming gangs need targets if all the targets are in locations that require probing to be found they will have problems the apparently easy solution is not so easy to apply in realitya easy solution for macro bot ratting would be to remove bounties from all the npc and substitute them with tokens that can be sold to npc tags sold to concord or enemies of the faction planetary money that can be sold in any station and so on but again probably it will not really stop the bots as apparently the drone regions are full of bots that loot and salvage the drone wrecks they mine 23 hour day it is not possible without an eula violation sure but there is people that stay logged 23 hours day without doing anything active from guys afk cloaking to orca pilots parking at a pos and giving fleet bonuses while sleeping or working so banning everyone logged for 23 hours dont work beside that i am convinced that the advanced macros are capable to log off and log in with another character on the same account or even on a different account when you are operating 23 hours day the cost isnt the subscription but the hardware the connection and the loss of money when several account are banned so the 23 hoursday test will get mostly the guy with the home made macro or the one that has brought a macro from internet and hasnt jet been burned by the keyloggers in the macro not the professional botter the problem exist yes the solutions are easy no
a limit of 8 hour day is highly questionable some day i have been logged for more than 16 hoursgenerally i wasnt at the keyboard all that time but mining or hauling stuff around while you are doing the house cores isnt a problem with a hulk rigged for cargo you can be afk for a decent time and if the asteroid pop you will lose a few or several mining cycles nothing critical same thing wile hauling around for 20 30 jumps the risk of a suicide gank is a bit higher but nothing critical similarly i have been logged and afk wile taking a shower eating speaking with a surprise guest and so on leaving eve open and forgotten for hours on a stretch generally i dock when that kind of thing happen but i will not log off for a supposed 10 minutes interruption even when it later stretch to hours so the 8 hours limit would be problematic i have been in 00 fights that have required more than that time between assembling reaching the destination point and returning and i am not a regular 00 denizen i doubt most of them will be happy of a similar limit edita total hour for weekmonth would be more manageable but still some people would complain as they will cram long hours of eve play in in some specific periods of the year holidays summer and so on
i was under the impression that the hacked client interface allows the user to know the location of everything in the solar system and warp to it without scanning it downthe best solution to bots is find a way to make the client secure scr bots where no where near as efficient as the hacked client bots
dont take this the wrong way as i dont like people who bot but its a nessesary evil there simply arent enough high sec miners to keep up with demand of low ends like trit and pyer with out them becomeing really expensive dont get me wrong everyone and thier mother would be mining toons if trit ever hit 5 or 6 isk a unit but do you have any idea what that would do to pvpcurrently a maelstrom cost about 104ish mil to make there 10m trit at about 22isk per at 6 isk per this would add almost 35m to this battle ship imaging what that would do to caps that doesnt even take into account pyer and mex which will also be greatly affectedas for ratting bots ya they should burn in the deepest darket caverns of an std infested 500 pound prostitute
fixing mining to stabilize prices is a fairly small deal compared to fixing the game to stop bots
the problem is if you fix the low end minerals then more people mine them instead of high end because its significantly safer and would have to be almost equal to some of the high end ores to make enough supply to fill a reasonable demand the end result of this is that high ends will go up as less people are mining and thus you have the same problem with ships becoming much more expensive and pvp going down since people cant afford it thus turning those people towards people who sell isk in order to get thier pvp fix its a never ending circle of stupid promoted by stupid people who try to make money off the game and im not talking about ccp as they have a right to make money off the game
supportedhowever may i add my own set of recommendations1 make hisec grav sites accessible only through mission agents in order to accept a mining mission from an agent you should be required to enter a randomized gotcha code distorted letters that computers cant understand on the screen the grav site is then randomly generated for you2 in addition to moving ores from the common belts to the needtoscan gravimetric sites place a spawn timer on the grav site say about 34 hours before it despawns with or without the ore being mined if the ore is drained from the grav site before the despawn timer the site will not regenerate on the same spot for you3 when youre done with the mission you have to wait at least 6 hours to accept a new mining mission if you want to mine in the same system if you go to another system you can accept a new mining mission immediately4 you will only be allowed to complete x number of mining missions per day5 only a limit of x number of grav sites can be generated per system so that mining missions for different players will lead different players to the same grav sites so as to promote competition among miners6 the grav site should have more ore than what the mission agents require so that the rest can be up for grabs7 grav site restrictions and quantities would change according to the systems security status8 the higher the agents mission level the more dangerous the rats get note drone rats drop no ores other rats bring little or no bounties with them you should only see bounties in pve missionsthese limits will encourage miners to take more risks entering lowsec space for more precious ores while crippling the efforts of the bots
if pvpers rat or mine why noti wrote that this would apply on civilian activities not pvp thingsor you can implement that verification is asked at next undocking after civilian activities like verification for undocking if you are worried about problems with hostile situations that my happend when you rat or mine and inspection comesand your last part is lolso if we pay taxes to our country we can do everythingwhere did you find that country i would love to steal things there without consequences and come back in real world with a lot of money oh right that is what rmters are doing and to others sorry if you dont like my suggestionit seems that any suggestion that could make living harder for botters will came across many ppl that will make fun about it and about any other suggestion on that subject it only shows how many macro users is in this gameif you dont support some suggestion you can just say that and why and dont make fun of ppl who propose itjust say anything that would help and dont just be against everything or quote nothing can be doneby this last paragraph i am talking about all proposals that would help in fighting botting and rmt problem and not just mine
no
not supported as i used to mine in high sec adn wouldnt want to deal with it i used to mines ice for my towers when ever i had free time doing homework adn stuff and would simply hit mine and come back 30min to an hour later warp to station rinse repeat i love the fact that this grinder stuff can be done afk and having a system that makes you here while hit f1 f2 adn f3 and then have to wait almost 15mins before doing anythign else is stupid
in game lineage2 at first with bots struggled in such a wayfrom monsters were beaten out not only gold resources and clothes but also invisible in the client anchors which at a picking up added at once 999 of an inventory overload then on the server worked alarm and the character couldnt movethe client didnt know such anchoritems and the player simply couldnt lift such subject and the bot for some reason picked it up with all other items but after bot have changed on ingameversion it has ceased to work what admins did in further i dont know also i remember that adjustments of responses in the bot options had a veryvery huge setperhaps to make inspection completely invisible to client machines to make its arrival quick and in random time lock directly of invisibility and putting disruptor on minerwhat normally does a bot in case on it when it is caught on disruptor logged off momentaly  there is a way i thinkbut even after that i am afraid that a bot will simply rewrite by its programmers and instead of an old method it is necessary to invent the newand about constant input of the code from a picture i am not assured in conveniently and regularities of such methodit will seems to me it to irritate only all real players and to hinder comfortably to playtry to imagine a sample00 sec miner is mining arkonor round it fly npc and in the local there was just formed a neutral pilotduring this moment the inspector flies and brakes you attempt to warpout on safespot by this window losing necessary seconds we die and making a more and more sounds of very strong language
wow l2grammarot  adding even more bureaucracy is not the answer to bots itll just cause more pain for players and bots do help the economy they keep the plex prices down and likewise makes sure there is a large supply of cheap minerals imagine what would happen without them the mineral prices would climb and for a long time people would be trying to adjust which means even more pain for the players
back in june 2010 ccp met with our player representatives and acknowledged that many things would need to be worked on in the spaceship game but because of incarna they would have to wait 18 months i appreciate the honesty even though i was not thrilled with that answer but i would ask that after incarna is finished that ccp put it down and work on the spaceship part of the game i have good reason to suspect that the spaceship game will continue to be ignored even after incarna when incarna comes out it will draw new crowds to the game and those new crowds will be here in assembly hall asking ccp to dedicate more time to walking in stations they will want more tattoos and piercings and bigger wardrobes and more hair styles more make up pets sports cars etc just look at everything barbie has and it will be requested even some things she doesnt have like jiggly jugs have been requested these folks dont exist in large numbers in game now because eve doesnt offer the dress up game they are after but incarna will draw them ineven now before incarna is even out we have people who want to make their character 6 inches tallershorter or have jiggly jugs we also have proposals for a whole combat system in incarna the clamor for these sorts of proposals will only grow once incarna is out and that crowd starts filling the forums the items brought up by csm 5 in june will continue to languish accordingly as a player who waited patiently i would propose that after incarna is out ccp please resist the temptation to put off spaceships even longer to iterate on incarna until the items in the june summit that to the current players chagrin were tabled for 18 months are actually done and before anyone says we cant make proposals about when ccp works on what etc let me say your wrong i just did and i would like ccp to work on the space ship game that everyone acknowledges deserves time i know that to get incarna out this has been delayed but i would hope they wont continue to push those issues aside after its out if you agree with me please support this proposal it doesnt take a genius to see the problems outlined in june are likely to be pushed aside even longer than 18 months not only will the space barbie crowd grow very large after incarna but many who like to play the spaceship side of the game will see they are irrelevant and leave hence i am putting this proposal up now thanks for reading
supported 1with the advent of pi i already got too much of a sims feel i was this close to seeing myself building a theme park on a planetnew character editor is fine maybe have 3d corp meetings in station along with it also fine but yes lets keep it spaceship oriented
personally im getting pretty sick and tired of the whining the walking portion is going to be as much a part of the game as the spaceship portion definitive scifi simulator can only work if they cover all areas not just one or the other not supported
i dont mind if they work on incarna after it comes out but i would prefer that they give it equal time to any other aspect of the game that needs work fw pi lowsec corp roles ad infinitum incarna will be a part of the game but ccp should keep in mind that its just that a small part of a greater wholeas for the incarna debacle that seems to be forming im gonna remain patient and see what they do with it id like them to include some things like corp stores and all but for now i take a wait and see attitude towards the new mechanics
in my head very much for a long time the idea turnsit consists here in what it would be good to make possible change of coloring of the shipsfor entering of a variety and more personality in monotonous weight of the shipsvery many of us played need for speed and very much it was pleasant to us that same porshecan look very much differently depending on we will choose what toning of glasseswhat color we will paint the car what drawing we will put on a cowl and the sideswhat color of neon illumination we will choose a bumper a cowl disks on wheelsand having picked up under the image all it we could tell precisely that here it is the serious carhere it is the car of terminator here it is the car of the loony this car of the silly blonde womenand that car of the idiotthe idea consists that after a while in game bothers same abaddon same hurricanesame sacrilage or badger we them saw in such colors one million timesyes at us is navy and faction the ships but it is insignificant a littlein game there is a modest possibility to create a corporation and alliance emblemon the basis of three layers from different drawings with possibility to choose color of everyonesimilar picture we also saw in game need for speed when painted the carbesides soon there is a new editor of the character who allows us to choose appearance under itself as we wantto choose a hair color color of eyes the size of ears a stomach skin color and meny more thingswhy in the future not to make possibility to choose appearance of the ship under itselfi dont mention idea of modifying of model of the ship since it is the very difficult realized projectbut to make possible a choice skin for ship model sees for me not by such difficultalso i understand that on servers and so there is a huge loading and also there are lags in fights more than 500 playersthere are some ideas as it could be realizedtechnicallya more interesting variant1 the set of skins should be stored on the separate server in separate storehouse2 skin it is a file of a picture or some files which can be prepared in any graphic editor3 skin it is possible to load on the server by means of the special webform on a site eveonlinecom having logged in to user account4 skin it is loaded by each client from the server directly during game just as portraits of characters but probably not at once and after the lapse of some time or at a next login5 there should be a possibility to sitch off or limit loading and displaying alternative skins for economy of the traffic and video adapter resources6 for reduction of overloading server it is necessary to enter the maximum quantity loaded skins at an oclock or a day from each account the prevention of it of the player7 for reduction of overloading server it is necessary to enter a delay on processing new loaded skins his transfer to use for one or some number of days the prevention of it of the player8 to enter the maximum quantity of the available player skins for example max 30 skins pre account9 to make possibility of removal added earlier skins10 to make restrictions in game on installation skin to the shiphere that the player should satisfy certain conditions meansto execute mission to spend certain quantity isk or loyality point to earn defined standing to the fraction it is obligatory to be the corporator to buy certain intems to reach a certain place to receive the blueprint or still something11 applied skin each player at whom display alternative skins in options is included can see

yes this is the primary problemwith this game mechanics easy to survive for the neutral logisthey just repping each others but when are they in danger just need push to docking or jumping buttonand they just docking out again and starting the repping each others maybe you can kill the aggroed pilots when the neut logi docked up but when not just 1 neut logi on field your chance to kill something will move to zerothis is a horrible mechanics
never played freelance may have to check it out
well we cannot afford coled space with current collision mecanics not when misslies and gunfire go through moons and stations and ships get stuck inside an asteroid that is 15 kilometers away if ccp improves the entire collision mecanics sure
very supporteda common sensical easy to implement low resource solution to a common bugscam sign me upalso lol at the scammers claiming this is market pvpcharon carbon must be contract pvp then
it would be trivial to create ed amount of isks out of thin air with your change what about thinking before posting limiting biomassing of characters does nothing when you can just create another account
the scam issue can be fixed in an easier way by removing the minimum amount option is it used for anything but scamming
sure it is if im order 10000 of something with a buy order across the entire region and i dont want to be assed to go out of my way to pick up 10 units at each and every station
supported for what its worth but ccp do love their isk sinks
i never specified that this was the only change to be made i was thinking of combining this with the other idea listed here of queries on specific market orders to check for sufficient walletsthese two combined means that any scammer could easily have a large chunk of his isk put into limbo if he runs this scam while the market order would disappear all together this would be an effective isk sink while still affecting rmts and others
the easiest fix is that the you must have to put enough isk in escrow to buy the lowest quantity possible of what ever you have buy orders for so if you are ordering 1 billion units of trit with a min order size of 400m you need to put enough isk into escrow to cover the price of 400m this change will pretty much only affect scammersie if you put up a buy order for 11 of somethign rediculously over priced witha minimum of 11 units to fill the order you have to put up thefull amount in escrow
faction bs dont outperform them on tank actuallyone could say marauders are prepainted and damped with their increased sig radius and nerfed scan reswith the shift in mission running going to tengus machariels nightmares and the odd rattlesnake for solo l5s noctis looting better than a marauder ever did imho marauders need more a complete redo than just a sensor strength boostpeople not having trained the skill yet are better off investing sp in a second bs race that will not only give them a better pve ship but also open more possibilities than the marauder skill ever willnot supporting they need a redo not a boost
i would have to say depends on the maurader and the faction ship take for starters the rattler has a equl or greater tank then most mauraders i would also have to say alot of teir two empire faction bs could probly match the tank with greater dps add that to the fact most faction bs have higher ehp and there just gold over muraders
this is the best proposal ive seen to fix lo secvery supported
iskhour low sec is actually better than high just unfortunately its filled with guys who think they are pirates who just gank everything they can
yes and make npc ships happy at changing targets
the problem isnt the isk perhr it is the lack of relative safety that will always mean lo sec is avoided you could eliminate all mining missions and resources from hi sec and people would quit rather than step into lo sec
this
i think the problem at this time is that there is an inability to fight back in lo sec while engaging in the pve content this is not really true of 00 which should be in theory less secure due to the ability to hold and patrol space distribute intel and whatnotlo sec is not designed to have such intel or territory control and more to be about hit and run free form small gang small operation skirmish warfarethe proposal deals with the disconnect between those design goals and the actual content there the missions and content are not designed for ships that could survive the lo sec environment reducing every encounter to a very predictable be found and die this is compounded by the current ai or lack thereoff which renders every mission into a gang bang on whoever has aggro or requires vast amount of time to complete in a safe waythis is why i think this proposal is the way to go the answer is not to make low sec safe but survivable and competitive right now the problem is that to have any chance of iskhr in lo sec you are completely helpless and flying things that will take many lucky lack of encounters to repay and that there is no possibility of even a fight every encounter ending predictably in the death of the misioneernow since this is a game played by human beings that do not particularly enjoy standing helplessly while being blown up with no possibility of retaliation instead of say birds cows or hares this land is an unhabited wastelandchange the system into one where there is a fighting chance and see the land flourish full of small gangs that would participate in the content and skirmish with one another in competitive and unpredictable waysthat is the solution for a thriving low sec and one id love to see
make all lowsec missions fw style missions designed for sb instead of a big fat bs
easy fix to all missioning to balance risk vs reward sleeper ai on all npcs this also fixes ganking mission runners in low sec and the rediculous nearly 0 risk mission running in high sec
i really like this one the rationale is sound the real problem with low sec is really the fact that youre completely helpless no matter what you do unless you sabotage your own income in such a way that you may as well go run in highsec instead making lowsec missions unique instead of carboncopies of highsec missions and making the ai not quite so terribly stupid is certainly a good way to go about fixing that
its tougherits also a t3 and gallente its like saying  eh the tengu can perma run xl booster and get 2000 omni tank it shouldnt have 700 dps except it does
in a nutshell option 2 blaster ships simply lack the ability to nail targets in a spot control the combat range and play out the dps advantageas little as it is this daysspeed issues can be addressed by giving blaster hulls a bit more base speedagility and removing the penalty form resist and active armor rigs
most ships in the game now were designed in a time before the nano nerf and drone nerf nano was nerfed gallente ships suddenly had trouble getting into blaster range drones were nerfed gallente ships had to carry light medium heavy drones pick two to be able to function in combatin light of the changes the whole design of the ships should have been reworked
no the counter to neuts is nos
err  what assuming you meet the specific conditions where a nos will workand that isnt always easy when youre an active tank and the enemy is buffer tankeditll take 25 medium nos to counter each single medium energy neutnot much of a counter youd be far better off trying to nuke the enemys cap first which is why everyone fits a neut and with almost everyone fitting a neut in a gang even the most ridiculous cap recharge setups are toast in a matter of seconds so active tanking is off the table too and here we are
actually thats most reasonable idea here im surprised anubis thought of it
tldr version only supported
umm there is a direct counter to these cap boosters did you forget about them
people on this forum dont distinguish between bad ideas and ideas they dont like which is a rampant infection in eve not even i always like the ideas i put forward i just think they will improve the game
isnt this module already available in game
that logic has already been debunked several times come up with something new or stfu
where i havent seen it debunked ive seen people say variations of but thats not what i want but i havent read an explanation of why cap boosters arent a counter to neuts seems to work for me that and remote cap
anubis xian is pretty bad at understanding game design issues thats why i was so surprised when he suggested cap battery ideai guess even a blind squirrel finds a nut once in a while
are armor repairers a counter to turrets launchers or drones
i understand the issues i just dont always go with the most obvious solution
from a problem analysis perspective there are several counters the most obvious one is to shoot the thing that is shooting you in the face in fact that would also be the primary counter to being neuted repairing the damage done is a counter to weapons fire as well increased resistances mitigate the damage done and thus improve the effectiveness of your repairsanother counter is your ships natural ability to fix damage shield recharge this is similar to that of the passive recharge of cap that is a counter to neutsi am of the opinion that the number potential counters the ease they are fit and the additional methods to mitigate risk should be proportional to the likelihood that you will be at risk as neuts are not often used to attack most ships other than super caps it really shouldnt have a wide range of methods to defend against it in fact going by that logic super cap pilots should be the ones who desire counters as their only counters are currently remote cap and their passive cap rechargesomething like ecm on the other hand should probably have more ways to defend against it
i think the current balance in cap modules is pretty fair there is no issuethere are only minor things that could be improved not serious problemssomething like a cap battery is very underused module it has potential to be a little nicer for pvp by offering extra protection nos are also underused tho not as bad as cap batteries would be nice if ccp removed the horrible nos nerf and implemented some other limitation on nos

alternatively make them a lot softer targets so that they can be dealt with as easily as they can be deployedcurrently theyre 10m shield 50 resist all so 20m effective 10m armor same and 1m structurethats as much as a small pos and far too easy to deploy at 2500m3 each a small pos tower conversely is 5000 m3 and requires fuel logistics to support and defendif these things were softer 1m1m500k the emplacing powers would have to defend them rather than just plunking them down and laughing while they go spam another system
it complaining about mechanics love itit really isnt that easy by the way it is funny though
itt i  off my alliance colleagues by saying silly thingstbqh the sbu hitpoints and ehp need to stay as they are with the number of capssupercaps that even small alliances can field they die too fast as it is they need to be able to take punishment for long enough that the attacking force has a realistic chance of defending themi do somewhat agree on your point about their size however
op is obvious it alt whine more about losing your space please
not supportedadapt or die but dont cry
proposal has been completely rewritten in an attempt to be more clear and concise on the intentions of the proposed changes and why i feel it is superior to those already proposed i would appreciate any further response on how people feel about this proposaltopic summary only includes a small amount of the proposed changes please read the full proposal that is linked in the original topic
easy fix to bounties is be able to set up contracts with corp or allainces to kill certain people simply put lets say person x blows you up in a high sec gank you could make a contract with a reputable corp y that is filled when person x is killed by a member of corp y this doesnt stop someoen from collecting thier own bounty all together but it certainly a step in the right direction
that doesnt do anything since they can just kill him when he is in a shuttle or other worthless thingany fix to bounties has to be tied to the value of the destroyed ship
i think bounty hunters should have to register with concords contract enforcement division allowing the bh to freely attack anyone with a bounty this means you cant hide your 250 mil isk bounty behind a 50 sec status in hi sec spacebut to be a registered bounty hunter you should be required to have and maintain a sec status of at least 25but bounties shouldnt be tied to the pod and large bounties shouldnt be a one kill payout but rather a ship class payout ie 1 bn for capital 100 mil for bs 50 for bc 25 for cruiser 125 for frig if you have a 30 bn isk bounty bhs will be hunting you for years eating away at it
thank you for all the support
i stopped mining for a living long ago around that time when it was no longer possible to make around 10 million  hr with high sec miningthe idea is just to give a bit love to mining without supernerfing itwhen missions which have asteroids are done the asteroids should remain and be scannable relativly easy in a t1 frig to counter effect the mass of asteroids it could be that the original belts will still exist but only in small amounts with veldspar and scordite andor only in 0910the now from missions left behind belts could be made more interesting with mixed ore based on the former mission level the belt should have a certain value not specific ore a lvl 2 mission could leave behind some omber or pyrox lvl3 will contain more concentrated stuff and lvl 4s could contain the high value high sec ore  a small amount of low sec ores like jaspet as the value of the belt is defined per mission level this gives color but does not boost the value of the fieldvalue could be adapted every once in a while with the mineral basket used on insurances if pyrox is getting to expensive it will be reduced and replaced by omber or sorats could be defined also by the former mission value a lvl 4 belt in a 05 system could be having 3 cruiser rats maybe the strongness would needed to be defined id say a hulk should be able to tank a lvl 4 belt rat spawn single handed but only if the player would work active against the rats sending drones early have at least a shield booster and even if the player acts fast or normal he would be in low shield or so positive side effect of the rats would be that at least lvl4s would not be macro mineable anymore cause you need to act or you loose against the rats for belts in 07 with lvl 2 belts a good action against macros could be that if you dont kill the 2 frigs and the 1 cruiser within 20 minutes it escalates into a further spawn of 2 frigs and 1 cruiser the belts could despawn latest after downtime or act similar to a can if untouched it despawns after 2 hrs or so this would prevent to drown mission hubs in ore the only negative impact i can think of is that ccp would have to need to send missioneers up to 5 jumps away to give a good traffic controlinterested to see what you think

take your own advice the ruling i referred to covered a repeating trend by the offending corporation warning to be issued when the activity is observed on a continuous basis and thereafter stronger sanctions first offenses were not considered to be indicative nor were situations in which the evasion was not a part of a frequent trendthis is why i advised a cycling of the corporation in question through the process at least one more time to build a case
really everyone thats a broad statement and easily disproven for instance my experience with her gives lie to your statement also how do you explain the number of votes she received to become a member of the csm and not just once it would seem there are quite a few people who disagree with your point of viewits very easy to take shots at someone when theyre not around to defend themselves even easier when you dont care what you say or have any regard for the accuracy of what you say it speaks more to your level of common sense than it says anything about ankhwindjammer
and exactly how many of those votes were made by wellinformed eve citizens i doubt it was a large number its been proven plenty of times in the past during elections that a majority of the votes placed are made by those who are not familiar with the positions their selected candidates represent its all about exposure or feelings for most voters otherwise how would palin be so popular and not knowledge of platformsmy common sense tells me that during meetings i should not use utensils as projectiles anybodys common sense should tell them not to do that thats just one example i wont list any more as there are plenty of examples on these forums of her lack of common sense

support buffing gallente ships and weapon systems
supportttt
because the armor resist hole was moved from thermal to explosive then nano ships were nerfed then drones were nerfed then webs were nerfed then projectiles were buffed basically the gallente ships and weapons systems have remained static whilst the rest of the game has evolved around them and now they are utterly obsoleteogogov
as someone who flew about 1000 dominixes over the years i dont really see a problem with gallente ships themselvesi only see problem with blasters  which is a known issuealso id argue that even now the dominix is very competitive ship and does not need any boosting megathron on other handi dont believe that gallente should take over minmatar on speed rolegallente role should be high damage at close range that can only be achieved if ccp can get over their fear of increasing offensive poweri believe the current problems with gallente are a direct result of ccp game designers damagephobia they let their personality flaws influence the game negatively
edit fixed p
really reeeeeeally  lots of good ideas in here tho i think the mass reduction is one of the best since it would let gal fit what they needed without making them slow bricks and still stop them from being top speed which i think minmitar deserve altho i think gal should be a relatively close second in speed begin that they use the shorted ranged weapons in the game slow speed  short range  profit supported but hybrids need fix as well as gal maybe fix one then tweak the other i dont care which just please fix something
sure why not
i support this themei understand that ccp it would be desirable to attract more players in game but for me in this game always there were much enough adult players and scifi genre fans and i dont want that game fell below a rating like 17 maturei am 24 almost 25 years old healthy enough person and i like theme of erotical and sexual content in games

already have an unrealistic average for boob size i dont see why we cant have this either

good find complete with talk about capsuleers serving as onstation assassins pretty sure that there was also a chronicle somewhere that talked about a guy going on a suicide mission and trusting that his ability to medclone would save him after the job was done iirc actually its that the scanner in the pod does it and im pretty sure that one ccp chronicle and definite that one piece published in eon confirms that a pod isnt required for medicalcloning but even if that wasnt the case who cares again fiction effects absolutely nothing in game and if ccp wanted to change fiction theyd just have to write an a wizard did it chronicle and then everything is fixed exactly hangars stay as they always have been but instation environments mirror outofstation environments in terms of game mechanics for the record though im against any 100 safe areas outside of the pilots hangar itself they can function like 10 space where guards will shoot anybody who unholsters a weapon or whatever that is an interesting opinion to take the fact as pointed out is that game mechanics are independent of fiction theres no reason why being disrespectful of lore would be a bad thing in any case people who like the game dont have to like the fiction not to mention the fact that people can like the game and still like the fiction even while understanding that the fiction does not inform the gameand again your claims of verisimilitude are nonsensical remember 10 square meters of implants in peoples very very swolen heads ships assembled in worm holes that have magically appearing crews that never need to eat and are suicidally brave etc ccp can decide that stations are whatever they feel like maybe weapons technology is more advanced than scanning technology or whatever it doensnt matter because gameplay determines how the game work and fiction is there as background fluff
this is important enough to justify the effort involvedsupported
ccp is trusting us with breasts but dont feel they can trust us with character heightsupported though id want something a little closer to the full range of human variability than a mere twelveinch spread first lets go metric so were understood internationally and then lets set it at about 150 to 200 centimeters just under five foot nothing to just over six foot six thats a fairly normal range with people at the top end looking short in the nba and people esp women at the low end being a little tall for a freak showi realise characters of varying heights are hard to convincingly animate and i am very glad ccp took this difficulty into account but it would be more jarring in my opinion to have a sea of sameheight characters than ones who swung their legs a touch fast or slow
great idea
awesome idea was expecting it to be in there already when i tested it out on sisi i was actually rather surprised to find it was not though i cant say i was terribly disappointed while i was playing with all the other cool features
i am 65 irl i demand my eve ego be not an inch shorter
supportedand very good call mate
ill give this one a thumbs up proportions would remain uniform across all heights with a variance as short as say 4 to 66 as with our current environmentlikewise make the base height variable by specific race taller or shorter depending on the rp background of each race
would be nice just make sure has buy order range option stationsystemregion etc
just annoying thing even though the module is not active you cannot toggle the overheat in preparation for when you decloak  either from gate cloak or a module

how could you tell overheated mwd is more likely to get me to the gate on another note though overheated mwd or point is more likely to get me to tackle range if i actually want to engage from the cloaked position

garbage  its doing rather well in fact
yes fix the broke stuff before adding new stuff please
1what happened to the last batch of t3 subsystems
i agree with the sentiment here though i do want to add some detail to the proposal it should work like this figure out what youre going to iterate on first figure out which developers are most qualified to work on those particular features and redirect them to work on them and only on them if theyre too important to the future task at hand then figure out a different item to iterate on and use developers who are free to work on the old stuffi understand that not every developer is equally qualified or familiar with old material and thus having the exact same developers doing the iterative work all the time would probably not work out too well there are clearly some developers who are specialized for certain tasks and aspects of the game and they should be put to work on the associated areas whenever possible of course i could be wrong and maybe it would be best to have a single team doing all the iterative work but i imagine they would have to do quite a bit of research into that aspect of the game before actually making any progress else they might screw some things up unintentionally whatever the case new features should not be released and then left to languish for years upon years features that are never used are really not features at all
as others have saida wholly agree with the sentiment here as it would be inclusive of many of the broken or underused featureslike faction warfare bountyhunting etc
is not that like saying if i put 8 rail guns on a rokh then its just a rokh with rail gunsthe main point of this is to give a reasion to fly a battleship over a battle cruser that is more than just a bonus or two being able to change how the ship works with a bridge will give players who choose to fly battle ships and edge over players who choose to fly bc at the cost that should they loose they take a bigger hit in the wallet
like i said in the other thread your argument is outdated  battleships are returning to popularity as alliances begin to develop fleet doctrines to fit the postdominion battlefield the fact that some fleets are too poor or too unimaginative to fit anything but drakes drakes and more drakes which will get demolished by a modern balanced fleet with a core of battleships isnt an argument for changing the bs class its an argument for leaders to engage their brains and think about how to actually put their pilots into useful hulls
actually a good way to revitalize battleships is to enable them to swap bridge control systems this does not change the slot configuration of the hull in questionso say you swap the bridge from an apoc to say a typhoon thus the typhoon gains all of the bonuses of the apoc replacing the typhoons native bonuses but its hull configuration is still that of a typhoon
noat this point computers can read those things better than real people
so what now all macros are in mission hubs with a crap load of mission givers and just mine missionsim a pro mission miner myself its mainly a good way to jetcan mine ya you get fliped from time to time but its not like it is in beltssecondly there are alot level 12 missions with massive belts in themlast but not least i am always a cat i cant help myself i have to play with things and learn stuff so i have played with alot of differnt macro mining programs just free trial stuff some of them i realy dont think would be to heavly affected by scaning or capta just sayingand eve would not be the first game to get me to quite do to the use of capta i cant stand the stuff its to much of a pain in my own ass i dont think there is a single game todate that i would be willing to put up with capta inorder to play it
this proposal has several problems but the biggest is that it will create a floor for the mineral value if the agent ask for 1 million unit of veldspater and he pay 5000000 isk the floor for veldspater become 5 iskunit if he pay 1000000 isk the floor become 1 iskunit similarly it give a floor for the return of x time units of mining if you can complete the mission in 10 minutes and get 1000000 1 hour of mining should make at least 6 millions and so on
all ccp needs to do is employ a thread sniffer in the client and maintain a rolling update of current bots in use yes meaning ccp will actually have to purchase them to prize out the base code andor heuristic behaviorwhen such a thread is detected or a particular heuristic algorithm it simply shuts down the clients active on that computer no explanation provided and sends a report to ccp concerning what macro was detected this can be provided to the player during the petition processafter x number of shutdowns the accounts are temporarily banned if repeated shutdowns and bans continue the accounts are permanently banned
as long as the bloody bots are smarter and faster then real players especially fat lazy ratters who are against removal of local and want to see cloakers and want to be safe on his own no matter what the other guys opinion is any ingame solution will just  off the legit players and bots will find a way around themin this case itll take about a day for the bot programmers to reprogram the bot to use the scanner to find the grav sites
thats assuming that the captcha letters are not confusing enough and the person reading it is illiterate i have seen plenty of captcha texts that can confuse the living daylights out of me coming from me this is saying something as i use to work at a pharmacy having to read the chickenscratch handwritting that doctors leave on the prescriptions imagine a computer having to deal with a that looks like d or a e that looks like a b or a 7 that looks like a 1 and vice versa on top of that the texts are all smooshed together like playdough with random lines and alternating colors and tones andor blobs i have even seen texts that are yellow in a white backgroundof course the major downside to this level of security is that youll have plenty of issues understanding the text if youre color blind dislexic or the player is too illiteratein refer to the other player that mentioned about a price floor for the mineral market i guess you made your point but how do you propose fixing the issue of the bots then i know ganking them is a good solution but only if people keep hosting hulkageddon more constantly and if some of the players are correct then the loss of a hulk is nothing to these bot owners if they always have billions of isk at their disposal of course we could go out on an all out ganking of all hulks for an entire year and see what happens doesnt hurt to try except under pain of concord xd
i was thinking that for the size these ships are supposed to be there are alot of space on it where guns and point defense could be placed its not like theyre gliders and need o be as aerodynamic as possibleso my plan goes like this and some extra missleturret animations when combat begins you dont have to add extra launchers or turret models just follow the same excuse that they have for why missles come out of aa portal in the middle of your ship instead of the launchers make the mini missles turrets fire alongside the real guns but miss andor get intercepted by the enemys ghost point defense so they really dont do anything except look cool also make it togglable so people can turn it off during fleet fights and suchnormally now its just all the guns firing in perfect synchronization invisible drones that can only be seen with overview on and missles that fuse into one everything is perfectly timed and there really isnt a chaotic feel when your fighting someone this is just a way to make it look more chaotic
1 for point defense lasers and battlestar galacticastyle flak on capital ships nonfunctional of course
supporting my own idea
nixxed graphics load is already pretty extreme most would simply turn it off
i support ideagraphics load is not so pretty extreme it will be simple one more really good looking thing to which for a long time nobody pays attention the disconnected with the help of checkbox disable effects in the main esc menu for better perfomance
my idea is basically applying what ccp did to fighter bombers make them ghosts just for the effect but dont have them actually do anything but apply the for some more effects for ships
if you dont group your weapons you get individual turrets and missiles firing rather than groups perhaps that will provide some of the aesthetics your looking for
eve has needed this for years i dont believe for a second that a ship as big as manhattan only has 14 or 16 guns
noit shows how dumb the idea is
this is great ideaall people against it are obviously bot users themselves
as long as the bloody bots are smarter and faster then real players especially fat lazy ratters who are against removal of local and want to see cloakers and want to be safe on his own no matter what the other guys opinion is any ingame solution will just  off the legit players and bots will find a way around them
if bots do help the economy why are they forbidden anyway low plex prices cheap minerals so lets give each player all level v skills all items and unlimited isk eve will be a fantastic game ehobvious botter is obvious
you do understand that there is really no game to walking in stations i agree it adds to immersion but thats about it they will basically slap fangs on these characters and call them vampires for wod if you want gameplay with these characters play wod i have no complaints about that that is good that is smart and i want ccp to do well i am not going to complain that a company is making good use of resources second i am not whining i am just asking that after incarna is out that they move back to the gameplay in eve we still have almost a year to go before that happens and i will wait patiently but im just looking for some point in time where they will start to work on what current players would like in eve consider this a substantial number of people who have played this game for over 15 years play it because of small scale pvp did you know ccp still does not have a game mechanism that reliably delivers small scale pvp fw plexing came very close fw plexing was a real solid attempt to make a small scale pvp mechanism it works better than just about anything out there but still it clearly needs fixing players have been clamoring for a fix to this for years wormholes was another almost there attempt but not as good as fw with respect to small scale pvp wormholes were obviously much more than just an attempt to create opportunities for small scale pvp low sec in general is a good place for small scale pvp and people have been clamoring for ccp to do something with this but instead of giving us a fix for fw or anything that will give us more small scale pvp what do they do they send tons beefed up npcs into random systems look i hope incursions are great and lots of people get enjoyment from shooting those rats and grabbing those bpcs its just that this is not something players asked for tons of players who have stuck with this game for a long time say they love it for the small scale pvp thread after thread asks ccp to facilitate this in different ways after about 2 years of requests ccp says it will take 18 months before they look at it understandably there was much wailing and gnashing of teeth from the players but now i am just saying ok uncle you wont listen to our requests for 18 months but can we at least have it be a priority then or is ccp going to forever ignore the gem in this game that keeps people playing for years
its hard to say any of the view listed are wrong in anyway however it is true that ccp is working a complete scifi simulation experience where you can do whatever it is you imagine to achieve that goal all aspects of the game need to be represented and be developed however i also agree that the current draw of the game what makes eve eve need to be preserved and receive its fair share of attention and that the spaceship part of the game should never but pushed all the way to the back burneri personally love the idea of all that we could do in stations everything mentioned that players would like to see in walking in stations however i feel that is should never be a total priority for example t3 is dying for more advancement in modules and or new ships like the frigates that were once rumored to be coming and as mentioned faction warfare which i here no end of disjointing remarks from those who participate in it
supportedand francly if walk on stations and gank in stations etc is the next step of the game i see no reason for me to continue to play the game i play it for space ships nothing elseadded what i cant accept is that i play eve for space ships and for some reason when docked ill have no other choice than play roguecraft style in station of heroes in aions system
primitive variant of using skins  adding feature to fitting or maybe repair service on stations function change painting of the shipdifferent completely ready textures of the different ships it is possible to find at various stations of empire hisecs and piracy stations in lpshopah or it is simple in a market as separate item named something like cynabal redkickass repaint script for using it in repairservicethe volume of this subject aspires to zero like in blueprint or script for tracking computerfor its application it should be in a station hangar and should be selected from a window of a repairservice in a separate field or should be interposed into separate fitting slotaddif the skin is used only by production players at construction under blueprints we get rid of one more problemlogically that caldari state gallente federation and other races have an own military uniform and is let out by the ships painted on own military standardsthe method of building of the ship with applied to the drawing a skin can urge on the big purchase of the ships by players at playersthe industrial player can tell that its ship is better because it colors it in special matte black both yellow color and its ship looks as a beethere is nobody to make comments
everything has been said in the other 50 posts regarding this topicdont worry ccp is one step ahead alreadythank god the forums give me something to do when im bored at worknt
omg i was late with ideathanx for open my eyes screenshot is awesome
does someone want to tell this person i dont have the heart to
hahahahahaha
i do demand some fluff dices to hang in front of my console in fact it can go wherever i place my donuts when i change ships
ccp have had the infrastructure to do this for a long timein fact if you take a look at any of the detailed db entries in say evehq for instance you will see that there is an entry to pick the ships colorthey dont want to do it vov
why they dont want to do itthis is a brilliance feature i think psthe inscription in the bottom of the screenshot plex credits cost is frightens meppseven if it will be possible for plex credits it would be already very good for me
taken from the features and ideas forum
like the idea indeed the riggedequiped ships transport is some niche 1  however the restrictions for the size ships should be limitated bigest size possiblebsi see a few drawbacks in the idea like high sec gank oc when you see one of those ships you are pretty sure that you are getting home with some candies
people are already using the orca to replace suicide gank ships and something like this would be their wet dream the orca is sufficient as bses have enough cargohold to hold a repackaged shuttle in their cargohold not supported
10
i supported it in the other thread and im supporting it now letting it be easily gankable would be good for riskrewardso you want to move a fleet of bss to this location eheither take a million trips or get a million people or use a couple of thesesupported
ok but im not sure you read the post no one is talking about using bses to move shuttles
ok but i think you have to actually check the box that says support the idea to give it a thumbs up
my proposal is to change physics mechanics to discourage blobbingessentially it means that the more ships are on grid the more space the physics engine will require between those shipsthe actual range will depend on the type of ship  small frigates will be able to zip through larger battleship gangs without problem but a battleship will have a significant effect with possible bowling repercussionsthis should have a few significant changesbig roaming battlecruiserbattleship gangs will find that if they all warp to a gate at the same time some will not end up inside of jump range as smaller gangs do not have this problem the obvious solution is to warp with less persons at the same time creating a train  vulnerable to being sidestabbedwhen setting up a big gatecamp or posbusting gang more thought needs to be put into which kind of ships should be positioned where instead of the current ball youd need to put closer ranged ships closest and further range ships furthest or some of your big blob cant fire this will add tactics and should leave openings for specific counters on weaker pointswarpingthe current warp mechanics needs to be altered slightly to accomodate for the physics change instead of warping first then bowling out it should precalculate a free spot this makes it possible for big gangs to end up in a big sphere around the target while a small gang will be at 0km bookmarks or other tricks should not change thisthis will not stop blobbing and i dont think anything will however it could give an extra layer to blobbing with more vulnerabilities for smaller groups to exploit
rather than spreading things out introduce ways to attack the blob as a wholemore and different bombs tracking bombs sticky bombs bs sized bombs for black ops ecttracking bombs are identical to current bomber variants they merely adjust their flight slightly in flight toward its target not enough to catch an abing frigate but increases the chance to keep it in the effect zonesticky bombs are just that they adhere to the target and can either be detonated at will or on a timer same damage as normal bombs perhaps slightly less with reduced radiusblack ops bombs would be the equivalent of say 4 normal bombs or more and have a far larger aoe reducing effect when used against a lone target 50km range with full skills this makes it possible for lone targets to get out due to high probability of tackler death but will be highly effective versus blobs making them pursue ships through warp would be ace they also need to reintroduce the titan aoe dd but make it very very prohibitive to use compared to the onetarget dd a titan dding an entire fleet would have a very high probability of not being able to escape in a timely manner anything to combat the drake mob is a good thing
i love the blackops sb idea
terrible both postersideas so bad i dont even need to bother arguing
yea you all know whyokay at a friends request i add more to punish those with escrow scams and to punish those for rmt no more can the characters just disappear especially for escrow tricksokay as it stands if you train an alt up to margin trading 5 you can enter a buy order and not actually have to place the full buy order isk amount into escrow at lvl 5 you only need to put 75 up you can therefore create a huge buy order for an items and only pay 75 of course you will have a negative balance but you can always just biomass the character and the balance is gone when you get caught with rmt ccp will take the isk away of course if you have already spent all of it or some of it you may end up with a negative balancebasically by not allowing players to biomass characters with negative isk balances you remove a weird scam caused by fail mechanics and you also punish rmt
perhaps you could elaborate a little more
this will work better with other ideas currently floating around the ah as it stands there is only one way to go into negatives  to have a dev remove isk from your wallet due to violation of the eulahowever in such respect i agree supported
currently eve devs will penalise a character for breaking rules by slaping them with a negative isk balance this way they cant do much till its paid off so most of the time the character is simple bioed  ie destroyed and another one instantly takes its place
i dont get it whats preventing the rmter or whatever to just abandon that account and start another
they may have other characters on the account
i added more to the original post
its simplelet the order be fullfilled and the buyer go into negative isk he cant set up other orders when in negativ iski dont see the margin trading as a bug but as a game design flaw as negativ isk standing is not integrated

iv seen and talk to other people who had a prolbom with a grahis glich that make yellow ship wreck and loot appear white or blue this happen to me and i misstake concord warning for one of the annoying messages or shut down messages and because i didnt think i would have that problem with a blue or white the concord kill me so i would like to make a suggestion why not make the concord warning and other warning like low sce with a red background with white letters or a thick red border so that new player like myself dont get them confuse
 lrn 2 englishalso wrong forumyou do not get concorded for looting wrecks yellow wrecks belong to someone else if you take stuff out of them then you will be flagged as hostile to whomever does own it and can be attacked by that person and their corp for up to 15 minuteswhite wrecks are yoursblue wrecks are free for allalso read the goddamn warnings before you do anything there is a reason they are there
shahflufferss a bit harsh but accurate about the concord stuff they wont shoot you for taking wreck materials thats left up to the owner of the wrecki heard from a fairly new person today something that seems a tad fishy about this style of glitchhe said someone was near a blue released wreck he figured they were looting it but a few minutes later and the ship plus wreck were still there so he flew over and looted it the wreck still showed blue and that it had something in it so he checked again and there was an item so he looted that he was flagged criminal and the other guy opened fire on him and popped his shipnow i havent had time to verify this nor do i have enough details to know if its a bug newbie fubar or what but a couple others mentioned theyd bumped into issues of this nature and got shot at by other players in such a fashion again i dont know if they got a theft warning etc and it was from new players in baby systemsso what im suspecting is there may be an exploit glitch that allows someone to effectively can flip a blue flagged wreck so it stays looking blue but is actually their propertyif this is the case with your situation that would explain getting blown up but probably by another player  not by concord
this should be petitioned if it is so
fw complex are an awesome mechanic for this type of thingunfortunately the system is broken and stops working within 3 hours after downtimefix fw plex spawning
i support this measure but it should apply to all missions which lowsec agents give out a person in highsec isnt likely to go to lowsec to run a mission and the person in lowsec can use their pvp fitted ship to go to highsec for the missionthis wont affect a majority of mission runners but itll at least allow the option of missions in lowsec i dont think the sleeper ai should automatically retarget anything as quickly to allow droneboats to still have an impact but the core idea is solidsupported
you can quite easily run missions in low sec the problem is people expect to be able to run them how they do in high sec so when that pirate comes into local scans them down warps to there mission they are there sitting at 0 on the warp in not aligned outto run missions in low sec is just like ratting in nonsov 00 or 00 owned by other people watch local its essentially free intelstay aligned not always possible mining for example but mining in low sec is stupid for other reasons than piratesuse your dscan set it to 447000000km thats roughly 3au distance use this to keep an eye out for probesi have run on an alt missions and plexes in low sec for a while now its not difficult to stay safe
i think thats exactly what this proposal is about and why i dont go to low sec to run missions if the pirate warps in and you arent warping out you are dead in a expensive mission setupvery supported this would get me in low sec i dont want the only possibility to be running or dying in a very expensive ship i want to fight back and the content to be designed so i can
supported
my question is wyi have my personal opinion on this matter but i would like to know what makes you say thiswhat who wy people come to high sec in npc corporations and would choose to stop the game rather than join lownull sec corps
because the majority of people are very weak and abhor violence  even in video games they probably cant imagine themselves killing other people in space ship all they think about is that their space ship will be killed and it gives them great fear so theyd rather quit and join wow or hello kitty online where nobody can touch their precious
because hi sec exists in the first place if eve had stayed true to itself hi sec as we know it today would not have existed at all and once you open that box closing it is impossible without massive repercussions
look no further than fw missions they are actually the perfect low sec mission model make special low sec lp that you get when doing missions in low sec these low sec lp would allow you to buy items you cant buy with the regular lp
it seems like the thing to do would be to assign a price to the security provided by concord i mean they create a huge incentive to stay in hisec because you can still make a profit in a nearly perfectly safe environment in the real world that costs money
fw missions are not anwswer not everyone cares about fw also not every region has fw at alldoing missions requires way too much effort base mechanics is same than in hi sec but 1000x more dangerous and exhausting stay aligned watch for probes look local all that crap especially for casual player its pain even someone who knows the stuff doesnt usually bother cos its just easier and more interesting to do something else like rat in 00 where you can make similar amount of money or more and actually defend yourselfi think it is just comfortable to forget whole low sec and fix fleet fight lag or jita lag instead of making low sec more interesting when people ramble about supercap hotdrops they hardly give any thought on how it works in low sec etc at least in 00 there is cyno jammersanyhow supporting the idea cos it sounds cool
unlike sov null no one actually lives in lowsec those days so less whining pretty straight forwardmake all lowsec missions fw style missions and people will do them it has nothing to do with reward amount its safety if you fail missions due to getting caught in lowsec pretty soon youll lose enough agent standing to not be able to keep going even if you want to and be forced to move to highsec no amount of reward buff will change this only increased safety
i have to agree that low sec agents have to be much more tolerant of failure and the missions themselves should be different like fw missions or some new designwould be nice if npc had sleeper ai at least when some pirates warp in to kill a mission runner the npcs in the mission would switch aggro and attack pirate ships that would even things out

ok so the proteus is a fairly sub par drone ship when it comes to other gal ships what i propose is to change the 75 hp bonus on the engineering  augmented capacitor reservoir to 1 drone per levelb4 you rage check this outwith only 100m3 max drones with both drone subs it wouldnt be able to spit out lots of heavies however it could toss out 10x medslights 10x meds is comparable dps than 5x heavies  all lvl 5 skills with 10 ship drone damage damage mod is 475 for ogre ii and 476 10x hammerhead iis  however with medium drones you would get your drones to target faster but the drones have less hp individually than the heaviesit could possibly get a 1 turret modifier on one of the subs to stop a ridiculous high end dps set with drones  blasters but tbh a t3 should allow ppl to put up a drone focused ships at expense of turrets to avoid ships nerfed like the myrm had where the turrets which were not often used for dps could be taken into account with the drones to have high end dps that was too much with drones factored in so they nerf the drones instead of turrets ruining the shipwith the 1 drones on the 25m3 drone bandwidth sub the proteus would only be able to spit out more than 5 drones if it had both of the drone subsystems fit making it a drone focused ship and different than any other drone shipalso b4 anyone complains about ccp already taking drone control numbers down i would point out that only the dual drone subsystem prot would allow more than 5 drones out and other ships like carriersguardian vexors can control more than 5 drones so its possible ccp didnt nerf fighters to 5 fighters with more dps and there are more carriers in game than there would be dual drone subsystem proteuses so i dont think the extra drone lag would be a server killeri just think that it would be cool to give the drone racegal a nice option with the t3 to make a unique drone ship if they chose to fit in specifically for drones and i think requiring both of the drone subs to be fitted to take advantage of the extra drones puts enough extra stipulation on that its a fair trade especially if one of the drone subs gets 1 turret to stop huge top end damagealso itt b4 dram pilots qq about 10x war iis with speed bonusedit no need to take off a extra turret with the drone subs a prot only has 3x guns this gives the prot the same dps as an ishtar without having one less turret
would be nicewould be nicer to remove even more turrets for more drone damage at least while hybrids are such fail
never going to happen because that would mean the proteus would be an ishtar on steroidsdislaimer i want a strategic drone boat
very poor proposal very poorly written ideanot supportinghoweverthe proteus is supposed to be an uber tech 3 gallente strat cruiserwhat the hell is the point if you cant selectively choose the best aspects of your race if you cant be a tech 3 drone boat of the omgwtfbbq kind to a point
exactly which is why everyone was disappointed with it and flies lokis and tengus instead
but the tengu is cerberus on steroids so thats no excusei happen to agree that proteus should be a better drone boat than ishtar at least cause of the price differenceso something should be done to improve it
if the proteus is one of the rarest ships abble to get in range to apply the ridiculous dps of blasters its because of its ability to pull big amounts of hp and speedtake that off and there is no point on using it aka fail railsblasters in that ship ok it has 5drones at the end hes just a better version of the ishtar the guardian vexor but i dont realy see the proteus has the t3 version of the dominix tbh and blasters are what for wallente pilotsmabe im wrong but imo is a bad idea to change the 75 hp to 1 drone
t3 can make make a on steroids version of just about every other type of cruiser in the game dude lokivagabond clone with webscheck protdeimos blaster clone with massive ehp and long range scramcheck tengufalcon clone bubble immune with more damagecheck it even has better gang link bonuses than command ships brah you can make examples for just about everything except a good drone ship which is the point im makingi also think its good because its finally a change from standard drone use with the extra meds u get heavy drone like damage but with more speed and less survivability of drones its like trading tank for speed on a ship and with the lower hp bonus they would be much easier to kill especially with smart bombs there is little uniqueness in the drone ships and they all have the same singular drone bonus is it that much to ask to have one ship that plays with drones a little differently cause ishtar and domi are far more similar to each other than to this
a pretty decent solution to the most commonly accepted and greatest exploit in eve using local as intel tool that islearn to use dscan suckers
it would need to be pretty stout otherwise a gang of bombers would take it out in less than a minuteor give it the same vulnerabilities the other sov structures have ie to attack it requires that the system be rendered vulnerable through sbu spam
it cuts both ways if its easy to disable then its easy to repif anything the beacon could get stronger based upon sov leveljust throwing an example out heresov 1 0 resistancessov 2 8 resistancessov 3 16 resistancessov 4 24 resistancessov 5 32 resistancesi am trying to kill out two birds with 1 stone here many folks complain about a lack of targets for small gangs this would fill the void disruptions in chat arent long events but they are frequent events makes for an interesting situation
i actually like this it would make 00 more varied and interesting if the beacon as fragile as youre suggesting it had better be cheap howeverit would also cause an enormous spike in jumpbridge usage throughout all alliances and would result in even less 00 pve isk generation in systems without a local channel that is already in the doldrums according to the latest csm bto mitigate this id suggest variants how about a temporary beacon that can simply be anchored in a system like a mobile warp disruptor bubble this would be very easy to destroy but would ensure people could still go about their business in relative security i understand that pirates solo pvp vaga and dramiel pilots and the like would love this crap but lets face it it would just result in even more empty 00 systemsmake the sov upgrade version much tougher but also more pricey or even add a constellation local services version available in station services for outpostsso what wed get would beidiots ratting alone in isolated systems would be more vulnerablepotential gankers would be vulnerable flying around alliance capital constellations because all of those systems would have local availablea pve oriented team would have the option to anchor a t1 and more resilient t2 variant of a communications array in order to give them warning if someone appeared in their system this would be a good counter to the current hotdrop ethos and would encourage remote miningmissioningratting as a group activityan alliance moving into an area and making it a staging point or capital would be able to upgrade an outpost to support local for the constellation constellations or even region that outpost is in this could function as an infowar early warning systemim not trying to nerf your idea any but lowsec proves that most people are fairly riskaverse and if you make any gameplay changes that increase risk people specially younger players will just go elsewhere get bored and cancel their subs eventually
why shoot the beacon using gunsmissilesdrones is just boring instead require the use of a codebreaker module to crack the 4 character alphanumeric password the owning alliance entered when the hub upgrade was installed then use an analyzer disable the communication network for that systemfor the defenders to regain control of the communications beacon they must repeat the same processto prevent this process happening too quickly or being too easy each notification of a successful code break gives the hacker one of the password characters thus the attacker needs 4 successful attempts to get the full password
i think i should be able to quickly control click my fighters and drones in the drone control window it is a major pain to have to find the fighter i need repped mid fightthis means switching over view tabs sorting through all the other fighters on grid locking then finally applying reps to keep that fighter in the fight mean while keeping up with requests for reps from fleet members not saying it cant be done hasnt been donecant continue to be donebut whysorta pointless i can control click to target fleet members for repswhy not my fightersall i am askingsorry if this is a horrid idea
i can see drone health status just fine on my drones in space overview im not sure how it works for fighters i dont fly capital ships but it might require some major effort by the coding crewsdue to my lack of advanced knowledge im ambivalent about the issue and can neither support or neglect support of this problem if it exists
i dont really see it being too hard just allowing the short cut ctrl click to work for targeting fighters and drones from the drone watch window its really is the same thing as the fleet watch window thats all i am saying
supported because remapping out of perwill is useless except when its less than a year i dont have a year of non perwill skills that i wantneed to trainwould also support the idea of letting remaps stack to at least 2 normally to allow a double remap every 2 years even though that isnt the topic
in missions that have minable asteroidspyrox veldspar the beacon has started to attack for 3084 points of damage per cycle of the strip mining lasers have attempted to attack said beacon to no avail with attack drones its invulnerable have mentioned this in detail with the petition crew and they say they are unable to make any changes to it it needs to be reviewed by the developers here on this thread or the players thread reference code re the blockade 2011010622723667380539c  this is an ongoing problem i have been lucky enough to be in a hulk when this happens but if i was in something much smaller 3084 points of damage could have easily crippled or destroyed my ship if it was a destroyer or a navitas i would imagine that that would not be a pleasant thing for other capsuleers
in some missions the asteroids are boobytrapped local normally contains some fluff about it
i read the title as bacon attacks which you have to admit would be much cooler
i think most of us would like to see more targets and less blob for sure if u are one of those people who dont then ur prolly playing the wrong mmorg last time i checked this was a pvp combat game  not a mining  indy simulator besides who gets off from work only to play more workheres a solution i think might work  add more faction drops in sigs  anomilies only within low sec and 00 mind you this might encourage more pilots to venture out into these systems providing more targets i started out this way and i would say it was great fun thrilling even as a new capsuleer carrying 100 probes in cargohold into low sec  nul to find some nice shinny stuff and yes i died a few times but i also scored some shine too was well worth it now all u get are empty systems with no hits if you do manage to find something the chances of getting something worth while is marginal  tags and ammo o where did the esculations go yes this would devalue current prices on faction mods ships but so what lets use them  afforable pvp instead of covetting in station oh thats too spendy to pvp with screw that lets use this stuffalso what if you added a chance to instantly learn skills warning role playing ahead lets say you rescue some npc big wig within some sort of deadspace and for his gratitude he taught you everything he knows about insert his profession here instant lvl 5 sweet eh ofc it would again be within low  00in summary  more faction drops more sites in systems without infrastucture the second thing thing i mentioned  well whatever  would be sweet though
youd be surprised in the very beginning eve was basically a mining simulator and today it is also an indy simulator among many other thingsas to your proposal it is yet another well intended idea which would fail to achieve what it means to do putting more shiny into low sec and 00 sites would just benefit those that already farm them anyway and ironically the upgraded 00 systems are cited as one reason for decreased pvp in the latest csm summit report because people have less of areason to go out at shoot somebody over a resource or somethingfinally even if it did increase the number of people going to low sec it would only increase the number of gank victims not the the amount true good fights
cross posting is bad mmmkay
ccp has always stated its a scifi simulator no idea where you get the pvp combat game from  id like to see more incentives to go to lowsec though

simple enough if you look at a drone when its attacking it simple flys around its target while its shot appears from what look like guns but 99 of the time flys in a direction thats not even close to where the weapons are facing that said give drones the ability to drift ie fly around there target but face it at the same time
so have you not pvpd in a while or is this a quiet troll buddy any ship with utility high slots has neuts in them these days nos are sometimes useful for frigates but thats only because neuts are so common that without nos a frigate would be without cap most of the time trying to hold down most targets
so this may be completely the wrong venue for this suggestion but i cant think of a better place to put it i dont use eve gate partially because of limited functionality but mostly because its not really easy to access when youre out and about it seems like a reasonably simple solution for a lot of people would be to alleviate this accessibility barrier make an app not just for the iphone but for whatever smartphones are considered viable to allow for access and formatting thats specifically tailored for those devices just a thought
an actual fix for this problem would be thisupon declaring war on an alliance the wardec is actually counted against all the individual corps within the alliance if a corp decides to leave alliance the wardec will carry over to the leaving corp this will encourage a kind of fight together or die alone approach to alliances encouraging alliances to to actually work together as intendedof course the leaving corp is only at war for the duration of the initial wardec  in which case the aggressor has the opportunity to reup the war dec as usual
wind i repeat cheek your info the ruling has been rescinded point the added part was about the op specific problem as i was pointing that the new ruling include his problem but not only that leaving and reentering in a alliance multiple times when war decced is no more an exploit that was clearly stated by a senior gm some months ago maybe it is a but unclear to you but under any circumstance mean exactly that under any circumstance
this is something i just found out my friend from alliance send it via petition as potential exploit but it was stated by gm as working as intended after each downtime pos shield is set to level it was before dt but no more than its max natural shield thats something thats just happens and doesnt affect gameplay at all since all people see is that pos has the same hp it had before dtbut in wh space with pulsar class 6 where bonus to shield is 100 it means that pos max hp natural max is only 50 of its current maximumso when game wakes from dt pos is at 50 hp and just a few shots from disabling all cpu based defensethis exploit is used to disable defense of pulsar based pos just after dt and than slowly and unoposed bash it to reinforcedi would like to hear csm opinion on that matter
place russians and the chinese on their own server instance allow them to rmt to each otherno longer worry about rmt in eveeverything will cost more and may get a bit crazy but like always we will adapt and eventually prices will stabilizehigh sec mining will be worth as much as mission running destroy bots by injecting code into the serverclient that makes botting impossible
of all the problems in eve botting rates so far down the ing list it makes walking in stations seem relevant

shameless bumpwe cant let the movement die
could we try to get this added to the assembly hall sticky for hot topics
my point is fix blasters fix rails then reevaluate gallente shipsdont put the cart ahead of the horse
agreed good post while things need to be looked at carefully you make good pointsmy other nail in the gallente coffin is how fiddly the drone interface is which is a total arse in a combat situation where you need to react fast id love to see a use for the hyperion too that acutally means i use its bonuses its a pretty ship or will be when the textures are fixed and a crying shame we rarely see many of them
believe it or not we agree that the gallente should have the high damage at close range role heres what i havent heard how fixing blasters without fixing the ships themselves as well will enable gallente ships to fill this role effectively you can buff tracking and dps on blasters all you want but it wont change the fact that gallente ships are able to be kited ridiculously easy because of their basic design making it impossible to actually fill this role barring pilot stupidity blind luck or unrealistic amounts of tackle sure we could keep the ships the same and give blasters a big range buff and then start playing red vs blue online where everyone has the same weapons systems and tactics with different paintfrankly i want to have a race that specializes in up close and personal combat but the ship limitations prevent me from doing it effectively and can someone please explain to me why minmatar should be the fastest and most agile race i mean a serious explanation based on game balance so the slightly higher dps of blasters is supposed to outweigh the ability of minmatar ships to outtank outrun and outrange gallente ships has anyone got an actual explanation based on some kind of logic other than minmatar are hit and run theyre supposed to be fast then why dont they get the worst tanks and shortest weapon ranges fit the design to the intent not the other way around
believe me a flat 20 damage increase for all blasters free damage mod will make megathron and other blaster boats very desirable  at least on part with anything elseeven tho the tracking sucks range sucks cap sucks grid  cpu requirements suck itll all be worth it the extra damage
if you increased dps that much it might make the boats more desirable for a bit at least but frankly it wont change the fundamental design flaw of having a melee ship that cant catch anything else to apply dps all gallente ships below battleship have to choose between tank and gank and even the battleships are so bloody slow that the extra range of large blasters barely makes up for it if you fit for tank youll never catch anything if you fit for gank youre in half armor and thats being generous by the time you reach your target and guess what hes got a better tank than you anyway and even if you fit for gank youre still slower than everything except the baitiest of armor buffer ships
gallente are in need of some serious attentionim not holding my breath tho time to train minmatar like almost everyone else
its about time gallente get fixed
thumbs up
yes please
you get what you vote for
apparently the current csm suffered a case of mass brain death when the topic came up that or ccp is drugging their koolaid
you get what the very limited pool of contenders allows minus voting blocks who vote their own guy in the end you get  no matter whatas for the topic itself this would kill 00 essentially unless logistics then is buffed into being done in 00 so the factor of logistics itself becomes moot my suggestion is change amarr outpost bonus from 30 time to 30 mineral this gives a huge boost to manufacturing in 00 as opposed to elsewhere people then do it there you then need minerals there and mining in 00 becomes further boosted stuff is then built in 00 and those markets get filled up overflow rolls into highsec to compete with the more expensive volume it would be great newbs could then go out to 00 via podexpress or shuttle or whatever be able to buy their ratting and pvp ships out there it would be glorious
it would kill faction warfare completely no one would want to slow boat a massive fleet 30 or 40 jumps to get to a fight 2 or 3 hours flying 10 seconds exploding then 2 or 3 hours to get back no way regions would get dug in and become completely insular everyone sticking to their own constellations maybe attacking their neighbors fleets would shift to only those ships with jump capability nothing but dreads and carriers titans wouldnt be used since their bridge ability would make them too valuable
it would make space big again make logistics meaningful and hot drops of thousands of ships no longer trivial what is there not to like againvery supported
the bit where faced with journeys of 30 jumps to get to hostile territory and another 30 jumps to get home again the typical 00 alliance member will say nope cant be bothered and carry on running sanctums at home instead
jump bridges are the second biggest mistake ccp every made and they fixed 1
bridges make null into a carebear land that is safer than 10 highsec think about it for a secondnot to mention the whole lameness of them working in jammed systems and allowing da blob to move around with a speed faster than any attacker could possibly hope to match  bridges are a large contributor to the blobfare good riddance about time the csm stones dropped and bared their teeth
what is bad about that exactly you mean alliances actually holding onto only the territory they can actually reasonably use and care about is a problemand why should they move 30 jumps in the first place againspace should be big getting anywhere in 00 is safer and faster than getting anywhere in high sec this needs fixed
alliances that put in the effort and put down the infrastructure gain the benefit 00 is only safer than highsec in the sense that alliances provide the security themselves and human brains are better able to work towards mutual protection than npcswhy is everyone so obsessed with making 00 life filled with as much timeconsuming and unfun bull as possible i realise that highsec nobodies whove never stepped outside motsu and jita have a limited grip on what eve is but the idea that players spending an hour warping through empty systems to fight for 3 minutes would be good for eve or that sorry guys we cant do the roaming hac op tonight because we need you to escort our freighters for 30 jumps instead is going to make people want to log in and play isnt based on anything resembling objective game concerns
ccp greyscale warns everything will go to sht
in addition to the legitimate concerns voiced above this would be a massive buff to capitals and supercapitals especially titans essentially an alliance with sufficient funds and highsp pilots could just get a titan to bridge subcapital ships on every operation of any importance meanwhile the plebeians who have one or two titans in their alliance may have to burn 30 jumps to get to where they need to goadditionally the supercarrier pilots can just give a hearty lol subcaps in local and jump out of systemrich old alliances would have the difficulty of keeping their space empires running pretty much unchanged while newer poorer alliances would be screwed out of nullsecthis would be a major step in bringing eve online closer to supercaps online and it is exceedingly odd that it was considered seriously as the minutes show that the csm discussed the supercapital hotdrop as being moreorless a win button in nullsec engagements right before discussing why jump bridges should be removed
this would be accompanied by cyno nerf and possible titan bridge nerf and jump range nerf you know also supercarrier on top of that
oh  so they have to make a choice between the safety of deep inside their empire or the convenience of being close to the front lines that sounds terriblei would welcome that
me too all of those
tens of thousands move around in highlowsec using that age old invention called stargates are null citizens too goodposh to actually move their fat asses or do you really think that having what amounts to a teleportation system is good for the gameit is apparently good enough for the people who moseyed over slow like to within your bridge networkbloat empires are an abomination systems should be used and not be wastelands just because the nearby blob says sowonder why ccp created jump freighters  ah yes to help with null logistics the fact that it is possible to move actual freighters around with very little trouble is part of the broken mechanicthe whole idea of having a spyobserver at bridge points and moving hundreds of ships ahead of an interloper is ludicrousby removing bridges the null entities will be forced to actually patrol the various pipes sucks to be an obese alliance if it comes to pass
well over in fi i proposed a system where infrastructure like jump bridges or jammers etc would only be available where sovereignty holders have made substantial longterm investments in a given area of space and where the extent of functionality of a given type of infrastructure eg range of jump bridge would exist on a scale based on the extent of the development in the system i think this would make it possible to have jump bridges in the game without having their existence in every system being a given they would be a relative luxury for the hubs in the system
sounds good to me get rid of jbs before the whole of 00 is just two big powerblocks presiding over their bot empires
ill support thisweve all known for some time that ccp has been unhappy with the way 00 and low sec space has panned out sometimes you have to remove or radically alter things to fix the problem
the csm are doing what the players want i know i welcome this change of course its not a change yet just that about 90 of the player base wouldnt mind it being on the table
the problem with this is that while the territory holder may have to put weeks or even months into working the infrastructure up to a given point the enemy can laugh their way in regardless of forces marshaled against them and blast it to flinders in a couple of daysthe balance is hopelessly skewed toward the invader and lack of any sort of limit on the number of supercaps in a given system means that they can simply steamroll their way through system after system uncontestedas for the bridge issue for those of you railing against them saying theyre too easy and whatnot have you seen what happens when a group of 5 bombers can do at a jump bridge even one bomber can create considerable havoc add in a light dictor with eyes on the other side of the bridge and you have an unescapable deathtraptheyre also insanely costly billions a month to operate
no  wannabe pirate griefers dont need another avenue to epeen all over
reminds me of a completely hypothetical chap who i just made up the guy started playing lotr online but quit due to frustration over there being so many damned elves
i honstly dont think it matters to me by the time they put something like that in i probly would not be geting off my ship anyways the only way this would bother most of us high sec people is if we had to get off of ship to go pick or turn in missions after checking it out i probly will never get off my ship again
that is exactly why wis needs real content
true but this kind of content should go into low sec stations high sec stations would get better usage out of min games blackjackpoker with isk and so on should be kind of common knowlage by now that thoughs that dont like pvp are not going to pvp even when you put good pve content next to pvp the non pvpers just dont use that content and when they get bored they quit think of all the subs ccp would have if there pveers did not quit after geting bored with level 4seven uo wised up and started spliting there pve content away from pvp i only use uo becouse it one started out as a purely pvp game and two its also a skills based game even if the skills are gained in differnt ways
i support this idea as long as whenever i take a walk in a station i can be surrounded by my army of hired npc goons that will blast your face to smithereens the second they first see a weapon in your handas long as youre cool with that i support ganking in stationsyou want an eveuniverse fps play dust im a rockstar not a grunt
all youd do is make everyone clustered in safe hisec stations and people would use disposable griefing alts to disrupt chat same as current eve i dont know why this forum community is so hell bent on making every change that might get people into the game and who will eventually try pvp or retain pvpers bored with the lack of features worthless

presumably such an option would have a notification along the lines of the purchase you are about to make will cost you xxxxxx isk do you wish to proceed if your new rifter is about to cost you a billion isk youll have the opportunity to detect this and decline the purchasethis is a good idea it was a good idea when i proposed it a while back too 
this happens anyway for people who purchase things directly from the group tab in the market instead of choosing which one to buy eve doesnt always put the lowest price in the group tabs so when this does happen ohwell

quoted for truthanyone remember freelancer most systems and areas had a very distinct feel to them
my father works with this kind of thing on a regular basis trust me there are hundreds of programs out there that can either read the captcha thing even if no human can or simply intercept the code being sent to the system to display the captchaand to make it usable to the masses such a thing would likely have the give me a different one or the audio playback for those who have trouble with captchas both of which would make it even easier for bots
do you have any idea what this means it means you and i are back to square one how to effectively battle the bots
unless it is abc that will net 30 mil or more an hour i dont want to scan it down not supported
exactly ccp problem they need to fight the bots without annoying the playerbase too much to your list of problems with the captcha you can add people with different screen resolutions from what ccp consider standardif you read the 2nd round of the minutes of the last csmccp meetings and the comments even if most of the stuff is covered by the nda it is clear that the discussion on detecting bots moved very fast to detecting rmt for ccp it is easier to detect rmt rings 1 gm doing the investigation will close teens or hundred of accounts in one swoop and will help fighting hacking attempts while researching simple botters for personal use the same gm spending the same time would close very few accounts with noticeably lesser beneficial effects from the time spent so unless a bot is too flagrant and easy to confirm ccp will prefer to spend the manpower against rmt an interesting note is that ccp keep informed on the real money  isk exchange prices used by rmt as they keep the relevant sites monitored i suspect they buy the botting programs and check them first for keyloggers and then for signature behaviour that can be detected serverside sadly it is a problem of cost against efficiency it is the same reason why in rl the police stop chasing a criminal when the cost is higher than the damage he has done a cop will chase a guy shoplifting 2 apples in a market for some hundred meters but will not start a search hose for house if he lose him if the same person is part of a organized band that robs several shops every night the search for them will be constant and use a lot of resources shoplifting do hundreds of millions of dollars in damages in a year but the single shoplifter is a small fry
so its generally left up to the players to do the hunting then sounds reasonable after all if ccp is better at catching rmt rings than individual bots then thats their job time to setup my ganking ship
ok
since well now have fully modeled 3d avatar i propose that ccp use them to replace the generic corpses floating in space after a podding it would make the corpses much nicer to collect and make good use of the new avatarsbasically if you pod someone instead of some generic corpse with your victims name it would be a fully rendered version of their avatar as the corpse
this sounds like a logistical nightmare i mean considering that the avatars are hugely expensive in terms of computational power and memory and it would require a lot of artist work to ensure that each avatar using the unique visuals created in the creator of course looks nice and properly um cooked but you know what i still like it supported
yesthis must happen or the jove will kill minmatar slave children till it does and let us use the 3d image feature to look at themmaybe even make them backwards compatible with corpses we already possess
yes in a game like eve there is no reason why what you see graphically on your screen should always be the same thing as that on the server
you have obviously never been into a 1000 pilots fight while forgetting to turn off effects
x2 clearly a botter
its just people voicing opinions bro relax and fyi no they cannot work on two major areas at the same time at least not without doubling their dev team that is and realistically theyre not gonna do the latter of course weve already seen this with dust 514 where certain eve todo projects were shelved in order to devote resources to the former so likewise any major efforts towards cool instation gift shops and all while id love to see things like that become a reality one day will inevitably come at the expense of working on the space aspect of things so asking ccp for a wee restraint in that area doesnt seem unreasonablealso incarna has the potential to be if not gamebreaking then certainly gamechanging in that doing primarily instation 3d stuff would essentially make eve a fundamentally different game from what it is now again not saying ccp will go that far of course but asking them to please not go overboard with it and to not forget the old space element of eve to me appears more than a reasonable requeststill supported
except there is this one line pretty much guarantees my opposition as you clearly lack any sort of respect for this aspect of the game they are developing  at least not enough respect to see videos on the subject released all the way back in 2008 which do in fact show that it is more than simply walking around playing dressup this entire thread is predicated on the assumption that ccp cannot possibly have different parts of the team working on different parts of the game at oncenewsflash theyve been doing that this whole freakin time since the time they started the project what was it 2007 theyve released trinity empyrean age quantum rise apocrypha dominion tyrannis and coming up on incursion they didnt stick incarna on the backburner while they did all this they had people working on the space game people working on the station parts and people working on both all these years what you really want is for them to not ignore old features and iterate on them after theyre released which has nothing at all to do with their focus or lack thereof on incarna

pretty simple yulai in modern eve would be perfectly capable of handling the number of players that would use it so i wanted to see how many people would support returning the old highway system and yulai back to their old selves
what was the highway sistem
the quickest way to get from one factions region to another was usually through concords genesis region and yulai ccp broke this because yulai would crash tq when it had 250 or more people in it

less hops sounds like a good idea

im not really sure how useful this would be for the average person who can fly a freighter you can already fit 2 unpackaged battleships in a freighter so this ship would need to be much bigger to fit 5 or more
yes i like it

1 the upper limit for volume is 1000000m3 as to not allow capitals to be moved into and through high sec2 if you want to move more than one rigged battleship use several courier contracts 981250m3 in a charon with lvl5 freighter skill if it is profitable to move that many rigged bs from one place to another you can surely churn out the 2040m per contract to get this stuff moved nonot needed
irrelevant argument repackaged ships are not allowed in the ship maintenance hangar so your limit would not be needed because it would require something like 16250000 m3 to move a typical dread by setting a limit of 25  5 million m3 in the ship bay gives you space to move bssized ships depending on how many you want the freighter to moveok courier contracts first of all i find it strange that this game mechanic exists in the first place think about it if you own a couple of battleships and you own a freighter you cannot move them by yourself i am assuming that contracts have not changed significantly since i last looked at them  you cannot contract to yourself right you cannot simply drop your rigged ships into your freighter for transport no you have to use a game mechanic to turn your ship into a courier contract and then get someone else to move your ships for you i understand that this is how you can move your property but why should you have to rely on someone else to do it for you ya i know get an alt or a corpmate to do it same argument why cant i do it myself i boughtbuilt the ships i own them why do i have to get someone else to move themi understand that a game mechanic exists to move your ships around but it isnt a logical mechanic in my mind you are forced to use another character corpmate or trust your ships to a contract not knocking the people who do this kind of thing this proposal is a way for people to be selfsufficient after a bit more consideration i think something like 3000000 m3 in the ship hangar is sufficient that would allow you to move 6 bses that is a significant improvement over the freighter  but it is only good for assembled ships again  a niche role for this ship a useful and important niche i believe
thinking about the size of the ship it would take to move that much m3 crazy idea  but maybe the ship would be more like a giant modularized scaffolding system  almost skeletallike the scaffolding holds the ship in place and would have all of the robotic armsappendages necessary to act as a maintenance bay but the actual hull of the ship would be open to space you would actually be able to see the ships hanging from the scaffolding inside the ship because the hull was removedcut away to decrease the mass and volume of the shipso the armor and structure of the ship would also have to be reduced from a typical freighter but because the interbus is associated with the jovians it would compensate for the lack of armor and structure by having overpowered shields this would protect the cargo insidenot looking to make the ship immune to attack just something comparable to a freighterjforca for ehp enough to withstand all but the most determined suicide gank in high sec low sec your on your own and you better hope those shields hold outjust a crazy idea  i am not including it in the proposal but putting it here as an adjunct to the proposal something for further discussion
its an mmothis aside afaik devs replied in the contract feedback thread on testserver forums i think it was that we would be able to get some kind of wrapping for our own stuff to be moved in our own freighters dunno if this included rigged shipsalso you didnt understand the first 2 nonsupportersone has concerns about this new vessel of yours to be able to be used as mobile boarding base for high sec gankingthe mechanic is that the outlaw guy comes into system with his pod and boards a shiney new battleship with no concordfaction any around and goes on a killing spree with all his friendsthe other one told you that you can put a shuttle into the cargobay of any battleship and make a manual trip for each one of them to be moved and fly back in the shuttle

for rmt reasons sure you dont know how margin trading works though
seems my idea has gotten some thought
it turns out direct griefing isnt the only kind of pvp market competition is pvp tooi like your idea but it needs a little modification instead of shorting out the conceptually unlimited supply from the moon your mining probe should return a tiny tiny fraction of the moon goo my massive expensive and highly vulnerable tower harvests in an hour and should not cut into my supplybut because of economics it will still cut into my profits and make your vagabonds cheaperand it creates an active fun and smallscale kind of moonmining while potentially giving my towers something to shoot atso how about it
i really do dearly wish people would shut up about things they dont understandgathering moon goo is already a tremendous pain in the ass
no i think stealing a bit of the income of the operational pos is the only way to go otherwise the larger corps will just set up a pos on their best moons like usual and then setup a butt ton of ships to eek just a little bit more off it having active moon miners steal a bit from the moon mining pos makes it so that this kind of exploit is not at all an option while taking advantage of a too spread out corp that is mining many moons becomes a possibility
if they have that kind of manpower and want to do that whats the issue those ships would need to be outside pos shields and are potentially vulnerable to being targeted and destroyed and it gives a benefit to active and not overextended corps i really dont see the downsidemost poss are managed by a single guy that does that and little else for his corporation corps do not have the time and manpower to take away from their other activities to watch these things 247 and even if they did preventing the kind of action were talking about is enormously difficult and incredibly boringmaking the game more boring is badif the idea is just to make pos profitability go away and thus make the t2c component market dry up and drive the cost of t2 through the roof this idea can do that if the idea is to actually have fun pvp my way is better
attacker flies into a mission of someone mission cant be completed any more  major problemno standing loss for turned down missions in low sec would be startthen youd need a mechanic that any additional ship that appears in a low sec mission spawns another batch of rats to engage that new threat along with the rats already on gridand the response would need to be dangerous for the additional attackerhowever this discussion is moot as ccp cantwont obviously put more cpu cycles into npc as the servers would probably dieif it were possible wed already have this sleeper ai for mission npc

truthfully i would quit and go back to eq2 the carebear tears are now the pirat tears they cryed and cryed till they could scandown low sec mission runners till they got it could not be happy with ganking at stations and gates and belts you got what you wanted now choke on it
if eve had stayed true to itself it would not be the eve of today with alot fewer customers to begin with true there would be no massive repercussions becouse eve would be mins the high sec populats that never would have stayed pass the free trial to begin with dont belive me just look at low sec after you got all the changes there that you wanted now keep your ruthless low sec and choke on it

there are new space sim mmos coming black prophecy for example use spaceforce 2 engine eves current graphics even at max settings are beyond antiquated if ccp dont update graphics it wont stand a chance at being competitive down the line to you spreadsheet ppl eve is still a game it need graphics to sell

ill add some observations based on my experience with loki and tengu  ships that i flew for several months and have over 200 kills withloki can be designed as very good sniper or very good ac close range ship 2 very different roles both turned near perfectionloki can be either shield or armor tanked effectivelyi think loki is best example of how t3 design should be approached  many good optionstengu is very good with missiles but its absolutely horrible with hybrids and its not just cause the hybrids suck right now the subsystems were designed to make it weak and tengu is shield tank only theres no option for good armor tanktengu is one of the best t3 but its good setups are limited and predictable i wish it had viable hybrid optioni also analyzed proteus and legion subsystems and i see same problem as with tengu  limited versatility proteus is subpar with drones legion is subpar with missilesthe ew subsystems for legion and tengu are too weak to be useful lokis and proteus ew subsystems are good only because they deal with augmenting tackle power which does not require sacrificing your midhigh slots in good pvp setups tengu has to sacrifice tank to get benefit legion has to sacrifice damage and the benefit is too littlet3 were meant to be extremely versatile and unpredictable but its just not so there are only a few good choices
why not give bonuses that create a t3 droneboat the correct way instead of lots of lights what happened to dronebay volume bonus and damage bonus you know like a normal droneboat as opposed to microcarrier with swarm of little drones
this i was incredibly disappointed with the proteuss lack of drone bonuses its a gallente ship for goodness sake
while it would be acceptable to have it at least perform like a proper drone boat it would be nice to have a drone boat that played a little different i kinda like the micro carrier ideaso alternatively instead of the 1 drone perhaps increase the engineering sub bandwidth to 50m3 from 25m3
piracy has always existed in low sec and always should the death of low sec is not piracy but somthing that was introduced by ccp probing initially there were enougth anti pirate characters in low sec to fight off gate camps ect and you could also mine and run missions with a modicum off safty but when probing and droping super caps on mission runners became common place the risks became greater than the rewards hence the death of low sec space and the failure of level 5 missions to attract many participents reflects this a ship set up for mission running will nearly always get killed by a ship set up for pvp the pvp ship nearly always has the option to run if things turn out badly while the pve ship does not generally have that option due to being tackledits not usual to fit tackling mods to pve ships until ccp give pve pilots a fair chance to survive and prosper in low sec it will remain a ghost sec
interesting ideas and very likable from the point of view of verisimilitudebutas you said lowsec needs pirates like cornflakes need milk the solution isnt to drive off the pirates but to attract the carebearslowsec is a totally lawless region gate and station guns are a joke making lowsec ironically usually more dangerous than nullsec especially the highseclowsec and lowsecnullsec thresholdsand yet moneymaking operations conducted in lowsec are little more profitable than ones in highsec this breaks the riskreward paradigm into tiny pieces roasts those pieces with a flamethrower and stomps on them for several minutes and then tosses them into the ocean out of a helicopterthe solutions to this are to reduce risk andor to increase reward ideally risks for pirates should rise somewhat i would like to see effective gate and station defenses along with sporadic concord responses in lowsec for example the man isnt guaranteed to show but he might and rewards for carebears and pirates alike should rise considerablyone idea would be to make the asteroids in lowsecs disused belts richer in the sense that they refine better as they remain disused another is to change the way lowsec mission sites work so that they can more reasonably be completed in a pvpcapable fit or offer substantially greater rewards from agents
this should be kicked out of the game combat probesany replacable pawn with his 1 old day alt is abble to scan down every ship size the pirates in this one can blame them selves for what they have donne with0 chance for the runner or runners what were pirates expecting that the missioner returns and says them thanks gf  also my little experience of low shown me this comming from high sec 80 chance to get blowned by a gate camp in less than 4 jumpsso wy the hell should i go in low or 00 do missions explore or whateverthe problem about 00 or low sec in my opinion its more about the players than the game it self they have what they wanted what have they done withthe mess it is right nowfrancly its time they have serious drawbacks for all theyr actions simply hope that some day they have the same problems to play than we runners have right now
i think this proposal is on wrong track pirates below 5 already have enough hard time since everyone can shoot them and they cannot enter hi sec theyre really really not why low sec isnt lucrative anyone in local is possible threat and low sec is usually more populated than 00 because there is stations everyone can dock go figure
supporting its dumb as hell how the scs have obsoleted dreads for shooting structures seeing as they dont have to sit still for 10 minutes at a time and then they go and utterly obsolete carriers for rr and offensive drone capabilityi agree with all your changes
definitely agree with this its ridiculous that the only thing worth taking to a capital fight now is a sc or titan there was a graph that showed the number of supercaps in the game over time and theyve just shot up like 200 every month or something since the changes
definitely agree
supported just look at this screenshot and thats tame by the nc or pl standardsnyxes
all of this
not supported i like the way super carriers are working right now they do not make other classes of ship obsolete if for no other reason than their cost they arent a swiss army knife theyre simply a very large drone boat drone boats are by their nature somewhat more versatile than other types of shipswindjammer
dread buff please
supporting to make eve less supercaps online
supported
scs were buffed too much i think adding bombers for them wasnt thought through if i recall right primary concern at first place was scs being paper thin instead of fixing this issue something went overboardwhatever just supporting
supported
not supported this will make it too easy to declinei could support a 30 minute shortening of the timer though making it so that you can decline one in every 67 depending on completion time missions
the idea occurred to me in how to work mt into the game as painlessly as possible the following was my ideatldr  ccp should not create items to sell for mt ccp should instead sell the ability to create and promote vanity items for mt1 player rents storefront with incarna for mt2 player creates vanity item ie clothing with mt3 player uses advertising space paid for with mt4 player sells product for iskresults the worlds first playerdriven mt market
selfsupported
what sort of designer items clothing modules ships
ships themselves would probably be out because it wouldnt be something players themselves could easily design for individual creativity but clothing hair ship paint jobs custom tatoos special effect snowball ammo things players themselves can design sell make knockoffs and whatever other tools ccp can implement to let us create our own special designer vanity stuff
why wouldnt they do both all you did was explain how ccp can get extra money out of their subscribers but you didnt explain why they shouldnt continue selling items themselves too mt from designers and mt for buying ccps fluff packs as long as i can use a plex to buy the fluff from my perspective im just using isk to buy it so from the individual player perspective your idea doesnt offer anything really new to justify scrapping ccp provided mt optionsi hate mt and i dont even like the fluff mt that doesnt influence gameplay since the devs will have to limit their free options in order to sell their own mt products im honest enough to admit that fluff mt is a good way to increase revenue though people who just want to play can ignore it and wont suffer any negatives the people who care about their looks will spend money to look good and there are many such people ccp has tied plexs to it so even people who arent willing to spend rl dollars on it will buy their products i cant see ccp abandoning that plan especially now since they have already built their entire system around it they are either going to ignore you or just do both considering how tight limits ccp has put around appearance in the new cc in order to make sure people fit to the eve universe and to ensure the high quality of the customisation options im sceptical that ccp would allow this most people couldnt design anything of high enough quality and even the rest would have to be subjected to ccp review before implementation it isnt impossible but remember how much issues just a few alliance logo images caused ccp and how long it at times took to get them ingamei have nothing against the basic idea though since it will increase the number of customization options available and brings fresh ideas to the table i just dont think it is a reason for ccp to stop producing their own sellable content
i do not support any mts at all
not supporting any kind of micro transactioni will also not vote the for any csm candidate who isnt explicitly against any sort of mt including vanity items
windjammer gets a mirror to check his cheeks finds nothing wrong and suspects hes the butt of a practical jokeccp made a very big deal when they put forth the ruling im citing they were very rigid very clear highly public and most serious unless theyve had a changing of the guard or simply got tired of enforcing their ruling rescinding it makes no sensehowever if youd care to link the information and it supports your claim ill be grateful for the information if not ill have to believe you mistaken on this issuewindjammer
this is should be exploit because in hi sec you cannot shoot pos without wardec
i must admit defeati am still pretty sure to have read a gmdev statement rescinding that ruling but after spending really too much time searching for that post i have found nothing while i have found a recent june 2010 here statement by gm grimmi citing that ruling explicitlytaken in contest with the whole thread leaving a alliance while wardecced and with a pos in reinforcement to refuel it and then rejoining the alliance is already a petitionable exploit try escalating the petition and point to gm grimmi post above from her words repeating the process is a exploit
i agree working as intended its a risk you can choose to take
i have sent off an email to ask for this to be looked at but it may well be an intended consequence
give me one reason why jita should have more concord protection than other 09 and 10

funny thing is that jita is the most dangerous system in all of new eden when you view the map statistics on how many ships have been destroyed in the last 24 hours jita lights up like a super nova

this latest from you is easy rationalization from a one dimensional person and close to the edge of text book circular logic ie theyre illinformed if they voted for ankh and well informed if they voted for your candidate because you say they areironically you just lent support to my assertion that you were wrong to say everyone knows she has none of the former referring to common sense unless youre saying all those people supported her and voted for her while thinking she had no common senseby your reasoning anyone who has suffered a fit of anger is lacking in common sense that would include a lot of people almost certainly every person in the world including all the leaders some of whom have made very public spectacles of their anger including the use of thrown objects they suffered a lapse in judgment but it cannot be reasonably argued that they were all without any common sense of course i exempt you from the above due to the shiny little halo youve got going thereas for the rest of your plenty of examples i would hazard a guess that it is sufficient for a point of view to be different from your own for you to judge it based upon a lack of common sensewindjammer
what an enlightened point of view such an unexpected and completely surprising perspective from one of the swarm and so well expressed too i would have expected you to find something one of the swarms delegates had done to be the highlight apparently you share my impression that the swarm didnt do squat save attempt to serve themselves not that i didnt have respect for bane during the first csmim so happy to see youre trying to expand your mind i usually think of you fellows as blindly parroting whatever pureed bull plop your leadership is feeding you so nice to see at least one of the little bees striking out on his own the brave imagery fair brings a tear to the eye it truly does lone little bee buzzing along thinking independentlysayhows darius doing these days well i hopevery best regardswindjammer
i never said those people who supported her didnt have common sense they were just lacking in knowledge of her platform and of her past commentsbehavior on the forums her behavior in all of those mediums show a lack of an internal switch that tells her to shut the hell up when its not in her best interestas an elected member of the csm she had certain responsibilities those included representing the best interests of her constituents ie those who elected her her inability to control her emotions was indicative of an underlying issue that has been highlighted multiple times in these forums as well as on numerous other sites such as eve tribune she never had the constitution to represent those she claimed she was representing she only wanted things her way like a spoiled child she lashed out when she didnt get what she wanted thats not how a representative of a majority should behaveediteven more so her is the fact that she was kicked off the csm we are judged by our actions and her actions show that she was not capable of representing those who voted for her unless those who voted for her expected her to get kicked off the csm she failed all those eve citizens who voted for her however she stayed true to those who spoke against her
jita is the wall street of eve get use to it or dont go there
to be fair apocrypha 15 was a great update for fw it made fw missions viable and really made everything except the core of fw occupancy plexing very goodi do think ccp understood that occupancy plexxing was supposed to be the core to fw that is why when they released the 15 patch they saidsome final wordsit is important to remember that all the above is not a fix for factional warfare it is only the first step of many to put its implementation back into the original vision that was ours during the empyrean age release in the meantime we do hope you will welcome such changes when they hit tranquility which should hopefully be sooner than you think
now if they would just use the incursion plexes for fw easier ones that are soloable you are already alot further
yep something has definitely gota be changed about the gaining occupancy as ur point 3 says today i just went around all 7 systems on the minmatar side of the border that were either occupied by amarr or contested none of them had a plex to take over inside them i did the check over systems abotu 3 hours after down time so even if minmatar could drive out every single amarrian in that system for the 21hours left of the day it would count for nothingas it is currently the only pvp is who can hold the system for the first half an hour after downtimealso just read the post about why plexs if theres another way more meaningful way to occupy systems that would be nice  also a meaning to occupy them heres an idea make it a bit like 00 is in the way that once you own it you can upgrade it by doing things in the system
the exceptionally sad thing is this half an hour is the best pvp the game eveonline has ever seenits the gold its the magic that has been stumbled apon and its ignored
well well well what have we herebut hey im sure that everyone else thinks supercarriers are completely fine and this thread is just bitter goonie nerfsploits because they cant beat them with their t1 noob rifters right guys
like everything else things have ben buffed or nurfed another option please
so you want an option to bring them into line that isnt a nerf or buff do explain how you plan to accomplish that
supercarriers need to be rebalanced but your proposed changes are largely terrible since they mostly incorporate straw men and singlescenario circumstances without looking at the broader spectrum of supercap use more to the point its engaging in a silly buffnerf cycle rather than creating more tools and allowing player innovation rather than sheer numbers and dumb luckserver performance dictate engagements i agree on the supercarrier hp nerf or at the very least making a shield equivilant to slaves and having gang stat bonuses not reset meaning 1045 of your shields disappearing every trucking jump but supercaps are a huge timeisk investment and a similar timeisk investment should be demanded to down one of these behemoths as for the whining about supercaps being able to shake tacklers too easily at least in 00 i blame this on substandard tacklers not wtfpwnmobile supercaps ive been on several supercap kills that one dictor has been sufficient to keep a supercap tackled a couple of much more practical solutions include all dreads get an extra utility highslot and create a module for it akin to hictor superpoint scripted usable only in siege this will allow regular cap fleets to have some combat capability against supercapital fleets that come looking for ganks but still force a commitment hictors and dictors can be used for primary tackle and dreads for the followthrough youll see a number of neut dreads as a result as well but this will also help the supercap destruction you so desire  bring back aoe doomsday in some form this is both a huge supercap nerf bye bye bombersfighters and a much needed change to see a bit more variety in fleets than the current rediculously logistics dominated doctrines 1 per system per hour would be a lovely lovely inclusion with it to prevent unrealistic castling for the defender but ill settle for 2030k damage if youd like a much lazier way to prevent multidoomsdays scenarios just add to every doomsday a huge energy neutralization sideeffect to all hit ships gives a much more catastrophicfailuredoomsday like element to it personally im ok with 4 titans instajibbing all the logissupportrecons from the fleet especially given that with the improvements in server performance in most scenarios you should have no problems dodging more than a single dd finally im willing to wager that at 30k damage youd need about 50 titans to drop a nidhoggur blob which with 50 titans you could adequately do in an easier fashion than said hypothetical mechanic capital class ewar ships this is just a side bit but it does offer a very triedandtrue solution to the current problem of capital rr blobs in fact make them the new motherships for the guristasangelsserpentisblood raider incursions for the  of itnotsureifserious a bit of variation in the toolkit would do wonders to help break the dilemma in capital warfare  smartbombsheavy bombers getting a few  range and damage smartbombing ships would offer a lot of infleet support counters to fighter bombers and add the lots of lulz when accidentally instajib every dictor you have also the pirates in rancer would cry for joy at these think of those wideeyed pirates in rancerin sum these are just a few more viable solutions that are not solely dedicated to rendering an entire shipclass down to complete  again
i stopped reading this after you said they needed an hp nerf and buff in consecutive sentences
supercarriers definitely needs a nerf sooner or later and the proposed changes seem pretty fair im not so sure on the titans thoughedit i think the old aoe dds can come back but in a form of a script smaller radius longer immobility and heavier capacitorfuel costedit 2 all dreads get an extra utility highslot and create a module for it akin to hictor superpoint scripted  i like this idea too although it means the return of 50100 man dread fights will be downright dangerous to supercaps in a bad situation
some ideas i have seen that i think would be good without over nerfing the supper carriers is remove the remote armorshieldenergy bonuses have the drone bay only allow fighters and fighter bombers change the 3 to drone amount to 1 have a 200 bonus to drone control units so its bonus is 3 to drones deployedthat way they are far less effective to subcapitals and if they want to use neuts smart bombs cloaks and ecm burst they sacrifice damage
this actually isnt a bad plan they would still retain their role completely while their utility would be stripped but their dps would eclipse a titan thats the only small flaw i see how would we make titans semi relevant without making them overpoweredthis would allow a revenantsansha mothership for example to do over 20 thousand dps alone might need to tone fb damage down a bit if you did this to stop ms from becoming the only thing required in a cap fight
they would also need to cut dreadnought siege cycle time in half to make them an option againas far as titans go i dont like how they can one shot anything with their dd every five minutes when it is noncapital i will go on a limb and say double or even triple the damage of their dd and double the cycle time of it yes this cuts down on the amount of capitals it can lay waste to by half but that also includes subcapitals this would give dread and carriers more of a chance to last longer but will still be one shouted by a titan this change also would make titans kill other super capitals faster that is if it is triple the damageits a tough question but thought i would kick that idea out there what do you think
also another nerf to super caps is to change their base capacitor recharge time to zero or something that forces them to have someone pump cap to them to get it full no more 30 super carriers lolhotdropping someone and then warping of to cloak up till they have cap to jump outor better yet when a noncovert ops cloaking device is fitted or turned on you can not recharge your capacitor vovor am i going off the deep end now
consider this information cited youre welcome back to thread anytime youre ready to move past the tinfoil nonsense
im kinda shocked you dont see the obvious flaw with this plan it just means titans replace sc as the i win in every situation instead of just certain situation atm titan dd atm is ridiculously overpowered irregardless of rof there is no balance to a 1 shot kill weapon when you start making the 1 shot kill weapon literally volley through anything just to fix one other op ship then its even worse basically your plan means that 20 titans can insta volley 3 sc rather than 1 instantly in a fight it also means that titan proliferation will just explode so instead of alliances fielding 60 ms what do you do when an alliance fields 60 titans its already coming to that point its already looking ugly rof is not going to help that especially with a massive dmg boostive always said titan dd should be a 2ndary effect that does massive effects to things like capacitor heat and ewar with very minimal area dmg to date this idea still holds up so well compared to anything else ive ever seen in terms of balance theres literally no way to mass spam and abuse it while it still is a natural counter to ms titans should not be 1 shot dd killers of any sort
i thought we were promised walking in station was going to be opt in yeah right i want to keep my existing portrait buttmunches
the people saying af already have a fourth bonus are just really really really rediculously dumb and the fact that they only have three bonusses is so rediculous its just like what the fukkfour bonusses please tracking damage whatever hand it the fukk overoh and supported
i support the woman shouldnt be as a wooden log
no boobs left behind
how about fixing  that has an impact on gameplay rather than an impact of peoples fapping to gameplay
thats it im sold
bump
take a look at the last csm summit  they are talking about gallente railsblasters
maxcpt link please where is this
the problem is the conclusion about the discussion about hybrids and by extension gallente shipsi dont see much hope
to put eve in more general termslets give sir knight frenchie mcgallius a huuuuge sword of 8 and 200kg concrete boots he can run around in his underpants to balance his huge swordlets give this captain archer mcmatar a crossbow of 7 hm hes very slightly weaker than the knight so well balance it by giving him magical lightweight depleted uranium armour sprinkled with fairy dustyou dont give the melee guy slow speed
sorry guys but gallente dont need to be buffedhybrids damps  like that could use a buffdamps are just a ty form of ecm though so i have no idea what theyre trying to do with it anyway gallente should get a different ewar thingyou buff hybrids into that shotgun style thing people were talking about and gallente becomes fotm
supported nerf
those people saying make it cost more are just total absolute turdsmake the dramial slower it shouldnt be faster than the fastest interceptor the claw and get rid of the drone bay am i missing something or shouldnt the daredevil be the one with the drone bay since its gallente and the dram is minmatar i know theyre mixed races but heyalso buff the cruor enough pg to fit a 400 plate would be nice succubus dramiel gets the same shield tank despite what people say the worm is good as is but could use some extra pgcpu to be able to fit a nos after the rest of the ship is fit well
just curious what goes on in that little mind of yours to get to such conclusionim also curious to know whether that same logic of yours applies to supercarriers  which are very expensive and extremely overpowered when compared on 11 basis against all other ships in eveand what if your opinion on existence of high end faction modules in pvp clearly all such modules are overpowered and unfair
such bomber traps are cool the first couple times they happen if they became in any way common enough to dissuade people from using jbs to transport their blobs around effortlessly however people would just watch local and not jump into a system with multiple known bomber pilotsor just jump small pieces of the blob through at a timeim not sure theres any cost big enough to justify being able to instantly transport blobs everywhere apparently as costly as it is it isnt nearly enough of a deterrent because alliances still slap them everywhere so their members can zoom around when and wherever they want
90 of the player base run missions and mine veld in highsec for the entire time they spend playing and have no idea what a jump bridge even is just fyi
jesus christ what kind of idiots were attending this meeting
hey you should run for csm you dont have a ing clue what you are talking aboutjump bridges exist in less than ten percent of 00 systems and they require strategic index level 3 and  tonne of isk they can be shut down as easily as shooting a tower into reinforcedif you operated around jbs in 00 youd know thisapologies you are far from the only person in this thread talking out of their rear end you based your argument on incorrect guesswork rather than vague assumptions that change is good and this made your post easier to respond to
hey try to think things through before you post blobs can go wherever the hell they want because they are blobs blobs dont need jbsin fact many fleets avoid using jump bridges while blobbed up because it is such a pain in the ass to refuel the damn things if gates are too much of a pain in the backside blobs use titans  which have the distinct advantage of not being limited to systems youve already been in control of for over a monththe people who benefit from jump bridges are your common alliance member trying to make 00 liveable developing the markets and doing his personal logistics around the alliances home region or occasionally a small gang trying to outrun another small gang looking for good fightsbut my all means kill jbs watch 00 markets shrivel and die because you just made it an alliance blob level activity to get ships into and out of 00 nice job hero
jump bridges would be nicer if you could camp them easier
90 of the player base doesnt leave hisec 90 of the players are completely unaffected by this change and are woefully misinformed of its consequences
one possibility in the context of making the infrastructure more centralized is to also make it more resilient ie operational until sovereignty changes maybe a possibility would be to have cyno fieldsbridges and jammers operate in opposition to one another for example lets say that both the strength of a cyno field and jamming effect can be set by players such that the person making the field and the alliance jamming the space are in an arms race to create the strongest and most expensive effectand yet the complaint is that they are too effective maybe 10 is too many
actually our postdominion jump bridge network is much less extensive than the one we had predominion admittedly our circumstances are somewhat different in deklein than they were in delve but the associated sov costs have deterred us from going too crazy with bridges everywhere like we did when the only expense was the fuel for the poss that the jump bridges were set up at
perhaps but being able to go to every single system via jb isnt really the issue its more about the ability to traverse huge distances quicklyhow long does it take you to get from one end of your space to the other without jumpbridgeshow long does it take with jump bridges
most of the bridges ive seen only allow you to skip 1 or 2 systems or jump from a short deadend pipe to the main routes
couldnt said it better myselfdear csm members who the hell do you think you are to agree to such a radical change in gameplay with many bad consequences particularly for basic alliance members without even consulting the community you represent in a respectable manner assembly hall is just a place where the community can suggest something but on the other hand you somehow think you have the power to skip the procedure and just agree with something this dumbif you want a solution against mobile blobs be creative or leave things as they are until you find a solution that doesnt include ruining the game for a grunt
if they remove jump bridges then they should remove titan bridges as well because both follow under the same logic hell why not remove jump freighters and make all logistics be done by industrialsfreightersyou might as well because by only doing jump bridges you are only halfassing it imo it should be removing them or coming up with a real plan that will improve things you think small alliances have no chance now imagine their chances now that they cant have any real logistics at all to speak of
honestly whats the difference between one cyno alt and two cyno alts besides more money for ccpits amazing that you idiots dont see that this will benefit the people with the isk for ting supercapitals more than any group of plucky individuals looking to establish a modest space fiefdom in 00heres a thought rebalance moon goo so that tech isnt godtier when the price for maintaining jump bridges was increased the nc jumpbridge map didnt change much however atlas had to cut theirs back because they cant depend on a giant isk printing machine sitting pretty in their backyard seeing as how the nc jumpbridge map is the only one with lines connecting ing everywhere targeting a change there would be logical
or shift to moon interaction moon goo as a passive income has been monopolized by alliances individual players have no control over the price and quantities put on the market now make some healthy competition by introducing partial or total moon interaction that way even your spies can be useful for something and the access is not limited to political entities but expanded to individual playerspower to the people
hm wasnt it always a compliant that the csm would be voted into their chairs by the big power blocs of zerozeroand yet here we are with this onevotedjbnerfonthehorizon kewl as most will know by now im in favour of space that feels big and takes some time to traverseim also no fan of the jumpgates themself as they cause artificial bottlenecks that makes going around lownull so freaking dangerous which in turn causes the jumpbridges and jumpdrives to be so opno one would use jds and jbs if jgs wouldnt be the bottleneck they are
its funny to see power block members protest the removal of jump bridges because it would hurt small alliances
i happen to believe that jump bridges are really bad for pvp in general but in particular for small roaming gangsi remember the days when eve had no jump bridges and things were much more alive than they are now now there are faces in local but no ships anywhere hardly any travel sudden blob formations and blob teleportations its bad for strategy bad for the game
please sit down and learn something about jumpdrives and jumpbridgesits funny to see hisec mission runners give their opinion as to why jump bridges should be removedi hear that warp at zero was bad for roaming gangs too maybe we should roll that back as wellseriously if you cant figure out how to camp a welltraveled jumpbridge route you are pretty bad at this gamealso if youre complaining about blob teleportations then you should probably go ahead and whine about titan bridges as well
but almost all of the csm are power block leadership
which is really odd as i would assume that they would have immediately recognized how this would simply make richer larger blocs more powerfuoh wait
wrong i was one of the people suggesting to ccp to implement warp to 0 option i dont think its bad for pvp at alli have examined the mechanics on how jump bridge camping can be done and i just dont like it its not very user friendly unlike gate camping which is open to any casual player who wants to pvp when theres a choice between gate pvp and jump bridge pvp stargate is a clear winneri already argue against titan bridges by proposing changes to cyno mechanics and possible addition of mobile cyno jammer
im outlaw
thats probably the worst idea ever from ccp its even worse than our sweet structuregrindingsovmechanics and csm has proven theyre completely useless and even harmful none of the issues that really needs to be fixed are going to be fixeddrakes being the outoftheline best choise bc theyre okgallentes being crap it works as designed dramiels making all other frigates useless it can waitinstead they agree to add more boring stuff to nullsec life good job csm
what would actually happenpeople build 425mm railguns 247 at the new stations for 70 of the usual costhaul them to refinery outpost in neighbouring systemprofitnet result  even less mining  hauling than at present
jump bridges have there uses perhaps a limit of one jump bridge per constellation would provide a balance
i belive that upon executing this change ccp will learn a new meaning for unholy rage also i hope that information about the timetable for this change will be given in advance so i can sell all my stuff on ebay and be done with itif i wanted to fly around stargates all day id stay in highsec having to waste 34 hours just to go and sell my stuff every week is not something i want to pay for and i belive it is a feeling most of 00 citizens sharei couldnt agree more
if you took your head out of your ass and looked at csm proposals these are all things that csm is working to fix blame ccp not csm
when someone came up with this idea a couple of weeks ago i did understood the reason why it should be removed but then i also thought that an outright removal would be too radicalso i thought that same thing  logisticswise nowadays it isnt that hard to supply stuffs fromto empire since you have jfs and back then when i was more embroiled on nullsec invasions actually took some preparationnowadays its more of a head to bridge bypass everything kind of move
not ccp suggestion even if ccp greyscale was fast enough in accepting it
its time to put effort back into 00 logistics and power projection if you are too lazy for the logistics part than i suggest you go back to high sec if you are too lazy to travel 30 jumps to find a fight then i suggest you not blue everything within 30 jumps that or go to low secpeople lived in all reaches of 00 long before jump bridges that was also before jump frieghters blockade runners with covert ops cloaks black ops with covert bridge which blockade runners could take and worm holes that can connect high sec to 00 systemsthere is simply far too many 00 residents that cant pop jitas tit out of their mouth far too many that feel that they should be able to zip across the map with little to no effort simple to blob out some small entity who just set up a small pos 50 jumps awaybut please keep the tears flowing that are bases of a possibility that jump bridges might be removed and because of that your entire hope of survival in 00 is crushed they taste delicious
please explain how changing jump bridges could possibly make powerblocs more powerful relative to small independent spaceholding alliances when at current there arent any small independent spaceholding alliances
in other words if you have a life and dont want to pay rl money for hours of click gate  click warp to 0  click jump  repeat 30 times to get anywhere  then gtfo we hardcore basement pvpers are so much better than thou
i dont think you understand how broken technetium iswe own something like a tenth of the technetium moons in the game and were saying this  is way broken make us less rich our enemies cant afford nice ships for us to shoot moon mining itself is sorta a good mechanic as it is it gives alliances a resource that is easy to nationalize a rare thing in a game hinged on individual effort but technetium was obviously imbalanced when the changes were announced we have a five billion isk daily surplus muahahahahah muahahahahaha muhahahahahahhahaha
dont blue as many people and you wont have to travel 30 jumps to get a fight is this concept really that difficult
it is also how everyone outside 00 does it but yeah most importantly it means you shouldnt be in center of enormous nap
dont blue everything within 30 jumps then
removing jumpbridges was discussed as a hypothetical situation and considering some of the biggest problems currently in 00 are force projection being able to move a large fleet quickly over big distances negates any strategical decisions on where to commit your fleet and trivialises distance in eve protection through jumpbridges jumpbridges and deathstar poses make travel over possibly large 00 distances essentially risk freeit is only natural to discuss the mechanics that facilitate these problems  this includes jump bridgeshowever youre going too far if you think ccp is currently planning to remove jump bridges and dont worry both the csm and ccp are well aware that old school freighter escorts arent really possible anymore any changes to 00 infrastructure mechanics for which there are currently no concrete plans will not happen without consideration for the problems they could createi think this quote from greyscale sums it up the best everyone here who is complaining that they dont want to fly 30 jumps to get to pvp and therefore need jumpbridges are looking at it the wrong way the problem isnt that you need jump bridges the problem is that you cant find pvp closer to home instead of having large naped coalitions controlling vast amounts of space in part due to force projection and jump networks why not work towards a 00 with many different factions where the people you pvp against are right next door and you can safely ignore people who live on the other side of the galaxy where you have more small scale fights that dont immediately get hotdropped by a few bored supercarrier pilots its not going to happen overnight and with the current mechanics never but would it not make for a more entertaining 00 in order to explore possible solutions we need to be able to discuss radical changes on a hypothetical level and that was exactly what we were doing
if csm is here anyway one question worth asking imo i see alot of words about stuff that is wrong in 00 and everyone knows about scs force projection sov mechanics etc but is there actually a roadmap or something similar to fixing it or is it something they put somewhere on the backlog that one day has to be fixed in the far future
people can bubble the gap between bridges they just dontif thats their concern then fixing bridges alone wont do the trick because you can relay titans to the same effect i think the problem here is that it alliance is whining to the devs again that were punching them in the face every day in fountain and flying home to sleep in deklein
there is as far as we are aware no concrete roadmap for fixing it that said ccp dont seem to plan anything more than 6 months 1 expansion cycle in advance and there seemed to be a lot of willingness  almost eagerness  to iterate on the 00 gameplay again so i cant tell you when it will be done but i got the impression that 00 gameplay is has a reasonably high priority on the backlog
i stand by my position and further assert that you are oblivious
i fully agree  and so did the rest of the csm at the summit and the developers again we were not discussing the removal of jump bridges and this was only hypothetical as an isolated thing it was part of a bigger force projection discussion we were having where we also talked about jump drive spool up and indeed we did talk about titan bridgesnobody at the csm or ccp are advocating the isolated complete removal of jump bridges what the minutes show is that ccp is willing to consider significant changes to game mechanics  with the aim of making 00 a much more interesting and less static placethe csm that was present in the december summit and was quite interested in considering these radical changes did not include any it alliance players it did include however a goonswarm pilot
hello my name is batolemaeus and i approve of a removal of jumpbridgesif capitals are nerfed at the same time otherwise itd be just idiotic
i am aware of the council composition i am also aware that this company has been caught with its own employees holding positions of power within one alliance altering the ing database for the benefit of that alliance spawning special events after giving forewarning to that alliance and then scrambling sov mechanics when that alliance got evicted from space it had held for two yearsit would not be inconsistent for them to remove jbs just because theyre annoyed over the eye of terror mkiito be clear im not bitter im really more amused im just highly skeptical of ccps motives
if you think that it alliance still controls your game even with ccps draconic internal affairs department then i dont think any logic of mine can change your mind 
finally ccp is admitting their faults i wish they grew a pair and said the game didnt need all the supercapitals too while carriers are to be restricted in some wayget rid of all this  and let us have fun
now as for legitimate ideas as to bridges there are a bunch of possibilities ccp could dothey could limit bridges as they are to inregion links only this would have the effect of slowing down travel a bit by forcing people to gate between regionsthey could limit bridges to one bridge per system perhaps with a range boost this would encourage alliances to place bridges such that they get the most mileage out of each one it would almost certainly encourage the construction of new stations as the geographic value of space is reassessed they could make the operation cost of bridges increase faster then linearly with the length of the bridge chain another interesting mechanic one which would target the very long chains in the norththey could adjust the cost based on how many bridges an alliance has online same effect as the previous idea but probably easier to implement
there are three things that are facts1 the removal of jump bridges will not be the only adjustment ccp will make to balance the current situation in 002 ccp wont make any changes unless they can present it as an expansion instead of a patch to start the healing now it will be at least six months3 there will be players who cant or wont adapt to the change and will move back to high sec
all of your ideas do either nothing or very little to change the situation removing them completely is not only the easiest but also the best way to help fix the problems
balancing a thing on cost alone simply doesnt work it is only a delaying tactic at best and even then favors the people who have money to spend disproportionately if some situation is unwanted it simply needs to be prevented from happening since the issue is making force projection more difficult and time consuming it has to be done in a way that you cant simply buy your way around it im not saying wealth shouldnt matter or enable you to buy some advantage im sure more money will still enable you to use alternative solutions to alleviate the issues you face but easy fast and long range projection of your entire military might has to come to an end with the upcoming changes one way or the other
as long as npc nullsec exists its possible to project power pretty much anywhere with relative impunityconsiderwhen solodrakbansolodrakbanso flattened atlas alliances house of cards we didnt have jump bridges
wow i didnt realize solodrakeban did it all by themselves it is nice to see one alliance take on another alliance without calling for backup from 20 other alliances on their blue listi tip my hat to you good sir now to deal with all those false reports of who was involved and to find that atlas camera guy who apparently faked the live feed showing dozens of alliances vs just atlas i wonder how he did it
way to miss the point entirelyentire 00 alliances can move pvp ships and pilots across the universe for remote deployments using npc lowsec for example the solodrakbansolodrakbanso deployment against atlas the test deployment against catch etc we had a majority of our pilots in catch within a weekend and thanks to jump clones we were able to maintain a presence in deklein
removal of jumpbridges is fine nerfing of jumpportals on titans is also a good ideathis game is meant to be brutal dark and dangerous if you would rather play something with less risk you can always try another gamethe positives that will come of nerfing instant travel are as follows1 breaking of insentives to form enourmous bluelists2 limiting ability of enourmous gangs of slower ships to be faster than smaller faster ships long needed buff to roaming3 encouragement of increasing value to certain regions closer regions to empire being more desirable  more conflicts between alliances4 much more meaningful logistics particularly in maintenance of large regions of space  encouraging alliances to limit themselves to what they need rather than whatever they feel like taking at the jump of a bridge and the tap of the batphone which in turn will encourage more entites to move into 00 space and provide more contentpeople who are opposed to this are generaly people who benefit a great deal from having such a ridiculous mechanic or people who cant remember the old days before jumpbridges when it was actually a challenge and fun to be part of an alliance
is that not whole chest beating example not an argument that speaks for the removal of bridges in their current formsounds to me like they are not actually required but are rather a luxury or convenience if you willbut once we have established that is all they are then the decision becomes even easier as they along with tit bridges are directly responsible for the prevalence of blobwarfare bloated nap lists bloated null entities  essentially everything that breaks null the bad far outweigh the good ie good  conveniencethis whole thing is just an offshoot of last years discussions about eve space being too small and too cramped  well no  sherlock what do you expect when we have both static and mobile teleportation systems available
white tree 4 csm and were the hek is the upvote keywho would want to travel 30 jumps for a fight sov will probly never flip again if you guys want sov to flip more make it a bit easier to attack removing jb wont do that sov mechanics need to change
what do people think of placing a cap on the amount of mass worth of ships that can travel through a jb during any one day or a reactivation delay based on the type  mass of ships that have recently jumped through that might cause the owners to use them a bit less indiscriminately also opens up some new griefing tactics oh look i jumped my freighter through and now the networks choked for a few hoursbetter yet tweak them so that theyre relatively easy to incapacitate and more difficult to defend
it does not logically follow that because jump bridges make it easy for alliances to cover vast distances in the span of minutes that they have a causal relationship with large coalitions there were massive bluelists during the ascn and lv wars and both of those preceded revelations ii
what i love most about this issue is how ccp always wanders why carebears dont want to move from highsec to null create special bonuses for living there system upgrades spawning lucrative pve sites and then makes it a logistical nightmare to get therebeing a carebear and parttime industrialist myself i dont give a damn about fights  in fact i enjoy that the closest blob of enemies is far away i care about being able to sell my product with a profit rather than having one or two stations ten jumps away with a limited market available because my alliance will tear itself apart and instead of a few thousands potential customers ill have threefour hundred at best given im even able to get to them at all without being blown upnow my problem is that eve is becoming less of a game and more of a job you have to do aspecially in 00 you need isk to fuel the pos replace ships pay the sov bill etc and the moneymaking activities are becoming more and more a boring chore pi is a clickfest missionsanomalies are always the same boring stuff a damn script can do it and they do production  you click and it does itself for a week and dont even get me started on mining and theres more  pos management is horrible corporation management is even worse no words can describe my horror when i saw the member roles tab and now on top of this all they want to make me waste even more time when i want to sell somethingmaby i sound like crying or something but thats because my favorite game is turning into a job i have to do for a few hours to get to the fun part
if the argument is jump bridges promote large bloclevel coalitions spanning several regions so were considering removing them then we can deploy halfway across the map without the damn jump bridges is an argument which would reduce the removal of jump bridges from a blocbreaking change to a simple annoyance with no real purpose or goal
thank you dierdra for taking some time to write an answer to this thread i know that it was a hypothetical discussion but if the community havent reacted the way it did that hypothetical suggestion would have become something moreif you have plans to change 00 warfare you can not forget that entities such are alliances and coalitions are not the only layer of existence in nullsec you cant just forget that individual players live in that space too individual players make those alliances and coalitions they are not a minority of some weird guys that like to do stuff in their own way they are the basic fibre that makes a nullsec alliance exist many players in 00 like to be selfsufficient we take care of our own supplies and dont always like the alliance production monopoly in our local space because it makes some items very expensivethe only way to bring more pvp in 00 is to make stuff cheaper than it is now thats why i sometimes make or buy stuff in empire in bulk and sell it in my local region with marginal profit  just as much to cover jf fuel costs and extra 23 for the effort the price of those items are at jita level or just a couple  higher  much like any empire nontradehub prices if you nerf the logistical network so that you cant relatively easily transport supplies from empire youll only make prices jump to the level that i dont want to pvp any more relatively low local prices of items in nullsec are like that only because of developed logistics network nerf that and youll have yourself an inflation in 00 that many simple alliance members can not keep up with since pvp is the biggest reason why i moved in nullsec in the first place guess what i will be forced to do to be able to support my play style and no no matter what some economist from ccp might think deep inside his capitalistic mind i will not pay real money to buy plexes so i can afford to pvp at overinflated nullsec prices gameplay wise i will not sit in hulk and mine to be able to make stuff locally  if i could make the stuff locally in the first place because of very limited amount of public manufacturing slots and the absolute inability to anchor my own production pos in alliance held space if i wanted to mine lowend ore i would have stayed in highsec if i wanted to mine highend ore i would have moved to wormhole space my point is i dont want to mine at all make a survey and see if this is the general case for the majority of nullsec residents utopian type of nullsec space where stuff is produced locally does not exist and it never will its because of the mentality of nullsec based players not because of logistical networks
the inability to move subcaps quickly across regions would serve to make capships just that much more impossible to stop it would end up being titan chains instead of jumpbridge chains the big coalitions suddenly still have the same force projection and the small guys have absolutely no chance of stopping anything moreover it would just mean 50 csaa go up before changes and get those titans buildingmoreover if you also nerfed cynos to make caps and titan bridges projection more difficult the requirement to nap everyone doesnt change at all it only means you sometimes cant be there to help your friends nap  nonaggression pact remember nap  actually helping them fightnaping everyone so you dont have anyone to fight nearby is so you can pve safely if your ignorant idiotic pipedream of 00 of having enemies everywhere were to happen it would obliterate anyone from pveing
no it means that we have to rethink the problem of easy force projectionbridges are a part of this problem i think nobody is seriously believing that removing jbs will solve all problemshowever once again a discussion is needed about the ease of travel and force projection the reliance of 00 from empire and the lack of features for self sustainable 00 economies sov warfare and how it should be about occupation rather than renting from concord and countless other topics that are impacting eve as a wholegonna disagree with you therei too sell lots of stuff in tribute i got my spreadsheets too and my spreadsheets tell me that it is a lot cheaper to import than to produce locally by a factor of 510 its especially daring with ships which would force me to mine veldspar in 00 mine veldspart2 goods would force me to import no matter what since the goo just doesnt grow herewhat is needed as i wrote above is a complete rethink part of this is the problem that production in 00 is just bad i can supply more ships by scouting a charon full of stuff if we ignore jfrorqualscompressionalloysbridges through 00 with better iskh than if i tried to mine and produce itif there was a way to acquire bulky minerals in 00 itself at a competitive level id do it and i dont think im alone there
ok and how about separating industrial jb network from combat one only industrials would be able to use it maybe even allow one exit point of it into lowsec maybe being the key word at the first look it makes supply easier stuff cheaper game becomes more versatile defending industrial jb network and convoys and you can experiment with combat jb network to balance power projection without hurting local economy and you get another isk sink fuel for industrial jb networkjust a hypothetical discussion not an actual suggestionedityes id do it too if i had the mineral supply but the question is where would you do it in a limited amount of manufacturing slots in stations that will be queued up as soon as the change hits tq or in a pos that you cant anchor or maintain yourself because of the alliance policy of no personal poses understandable for security reasons
that is not an isk sink the money just goes to the ice mining macrospersonally i wouldnt mind radical cutbacks to the ease of transportation both within 00 itself and on the routes leading into and out of 00 as long as accompanying changes also enable local production at a level at least competitive to a freighter convoy full of ships and t2 mods from empirethat would mean measures to lock down a system properly ways to refine at pos more easily being able to acquire minerals at competitive rates and make them into stuff and being able to produce the necessary moon goo without having to rely on goo produced on the other side of the galaxy
alliance controlled gateguns
heres the problem with that direction eve sells itself on the idea of grand intergalactic warfare on a massive scale goonswarm vs bob got eve articles not just on pc gamer or massivelycom but into the new york times and on the bbc it was something unique  tens of thousands of pilots engaged in massive conflict across an entire virtual universe one thousand players on a battlefield coalitions of players tearing down everything that stood before them in a yearslong war not just for top dog status on one out of 50 servers or some pro pvp team accolade but of the entire gamelocalised brushfire wars between smaller groups can be fun  hell for the actual participants they might even be more fun than grinding the servers down with laggy megablobs but they wouldnt be epic they wouldnt grab the imagination of nongamers and burned out wow veterans who look at eve today and talk about how impressive it is to read about the latest events they wouldnt have that spark to them that says this is unlike anything else happening in online gaming without that grand scale to hook peoples interest eve doesnt stand out from the crowd anywhere near as much nobody from an international news organisation is going to come looking for an interview with the leader of an alliance of 100 people who just took their neighbours system in a 30 vs 40 running battle even if unironic good fights were had
you have a point therehmm we have a specialized ore transporter rorqual and compressed ore but the supply of ore is somewhat smaller than the supply of minerals one reason being reprocessing another profit and lastly volume of materials how about a specialized mineral compression ship or a change to rorqual by introducing mineral compression blueprints that could solve the supply part or just a mineral transport ship that can transport more minerals with a skill level but can only carry minerals in its cargo bayfor the manufacturing slots problem personal slots installed in stations that you can dock in player owned nullsec through an upgrade module that you need to buybuild yourself and install in the station much like sov upgrade modules would solve the problem
fully supported ccp dont make the mistake of thinking that the lemmings screaming in this thread are indicative of the overall playerbases opinion
i dont understand why ccp wants to take away my jump bridgesif i have spent hours setting up a chain i should be impossible to catch while traveling around zero security space if people want to kill me they should be forced to spend hours shooting a tower i can rock up to and defend at any time or given they reinforce my jumpbridge i can just pull it down  kill it and reanchor another one somewhere else in the system also i find it completely unfair that ccp would even consider making it harder for my enourmous gangs to outrun and outmanuver smaller faster gangsi should get what i want when i want it because i canits time to deal with itgetonmylevel
thats all nice but the realistic situation is that a powerblock of thousands of pilots smash a few hunderd players if they try to do something in abandoned space simply because the powerblock can do it
put a cloaky dictor on a jb bubble it and kill anything that comes through with reconsbombers impossible you sayfine separate industrial from combat jb network keep the pvp part while actually having an ability to buy something that youll be fighting inno i should get what i want in a decent amount of time because i dont live in eve and actually have a life when i log in i want to have fun not to haul stufftroll
the problem is that procuring tritanium and pyerite and mexa and iso is horribly inefficient in 00 you need them in such high volumes that youd have to mine veldspar or import the minerals both are bad options without resorting to mineral compression via 425mm rails or whichever method you prefer have you ever seen a rorqual parked next to a highsec system and being supplied with veldspar from highsec to compress and ship the stuff to 00me neitherto actually tackle the problem of inefficient 00 local production there would need to be a competitive method of acquiring minerals there superdense veld mineral harvesting arrays you name itthis is obviously only tangentially related to jbs as these are mostly used for force projection cutting them back will make it harder to move people as long as capitals are also touchedhowever all these things are interconnected if you cut down on travel opportunities it would be a good time to rethink the state of the 00 economy especially since nerfing bridges devalues deep 00 even more into poor mans 00 with all the inconveniences of 00 without the benefits of easy access to empire wasnt the original concept of 00 that the farther away from empire and the greater the logistical effort the greater the rewards this has been inversed and its a bad thing imo
define funsupporting convoys or ambushing them doesnt fit that does iti guess fun is really only blobbing the  out of people trying to make it in 00 without napping everyone within 60 jumps fools trying to have fun without your permission
a parallel industrial jb network will eliminate material supply problem for 00 including deep one while at the same time keeping the deep part in terms of combat fleet movement combined with personal manufacturing slots in player owned stations via personal upgrade modules industry could come back to nullsec and we have separated combat fleets from supply convoys sounds like a winwin scenario to me
i agree i kinda laughing at people saying logistics going to be a nightmare honestly jump freighter titian bridges crap alliance were doing ok before jbs i taken a break from 00 for 2 and half years and come back and i like it but i am surprised how so freaking easy to get around the role of jump freighter etc will give them a more meaning role to take part in you have to work for it big deal this what eve been like since day one i just like how people saying 00 going to die if you remove jb what a load of bs
interesting point but you missed the part where everybody else is prevented from being able to join in on the fun unless they can somehow get into your or another alliance or get nap with one of them
adding mineral compression to a rorqual is not a good idea the first thing you might consider is the loss of refining value youll find on ore in pos and player structures simply put training your refining skills is a waste of time because your max yield is still only 75 if you happen to have a station nearby its likely youll be running with a 30 base yield instead of theoften found in empireyield of 995 with good skills less 45 for standing loss if you dont have itthe idea seems rather silly coming from a member of morsus mihi as you dont even need jbs with a direct route to highsec what is it for you about 3 jumps in fact you have a station that will offer you full efficiency not more than 2 jumps from your sovereign space so what wouldnt hurt you is fine seems to be the carrying factor in this debate
this quote is ludicrousfirst off sovereign nullsec is not zero security space its alliance territory and therefore secured at cost the reason its called nullsec is due to the fact that concord does not maintain a presence there you want true 00 go into npc nullsec where you can safeboat around without fear of alliance blobs mostly
i think you just made most of that up dont feel entitled to anything in your alliance territory like gamebreaking mega jumpbridge networks because we pay for it claimed nullsec is still 00 just like every other type of nullsec
i fully support the suggested changes
the whole point is that no one would like to mine veldspar in nullsec and mineral compression would be mainly done in lowsec the largest part of lowend minerals comes from empire so the lowend minerals would be transported from empire to 00 not the other way around alternatively a specialized mineral transport ship could be introducednothing is there specially for me or my alliance which im just a simple member of the discussion is about moving production to local nullsec space while at the same time looking for a solution against huge mobile blobs separating supply routes from combat fleet routes looks like a reasonable solution on the other hand introducing personal manufacturing slots will boost local production and combined with a specialized exclusively industrial jb network and easy supply of large quantities of lowend minerals from empire the industry and market in deep nullsec could come to life thats one of the key points of csm meeting minutes anyway besides a guy in perid basis or feythabolis will benefit from this tooin one word id like to have reasonable priced ships to defend my home space and id like my enemies to have reasonable priced ships so when i go there to attack them they will undock and fight nerfing supply routes from empire will not make it happen
i dont have any of the advantages from jbs that 00 aliances have just to clarify my alliance and corporations operates almost entirely out of wormhole space this means that we cannot claim sovereignity and dont have access to any benefits resulting from it we do have the ability to set up planetary interaction and pos however our logistics are limited to random wormhole spawns and we do not have the ability to run moon harvesters personally id like to see the latter change though i dont think that is going to happen if i want to run a moon harvesting pos i have to do the same as everyone else either join a nullsec alliance or risk having the whole operation destroyed in 36 hours or less that will occur in npc nullsec just as easily as it would in unclaimed nullsec near alliance territory
lonetrek is not really highsec its some bizzaro distorted highsec where half of the people have to observe arcane concord rules and the other half just have to replace their ships a lot
hmmm sounds interesting i like the idea would certainly make small corp raids into 00 possible instead of haveing 1000 people jumping in from all arround the second a neutral comes close
remove the jbs roaming into hostile space and having a blob be both ahead of you behind you and still having the potential to cover all other avenues is just sillywho really cares about hostiles if you can just jb to another constellation and keep ratting therethey discourage organization by allowing the bears to instantly be wherever their fc is no matter where they happen to be in their space sounds great in an mmoim sure ccp didnt see jbs turning out this way much like how f the features theyve implemented in null low and high sec have caused eve to be basically deadkeeping eve on life support through a bunch of polished content isnt going to work out in the long term theyre going to eventually end up with a broken game that is nowhere near what it originally was meant to beif eve keeps going in the same direction it is all of 00 will be essentially controlled by the russians and the nc with entrances being constantly bubbled and permacampedmaking 00 a harder place to live discouraging rediculously massive and widespread coalitions is the only logical solution might as well send the russians to their own server all theyre really interested in is rmt anywayim sure the chinese could use some rmt pals
this might surprise you but were actually not a hivemind nor are we all interested in boosting our own spacejust for the record i can do the necessary logistic to build a supercapital all by myself by jumping compressed minerals directly from jita 44 to our csaa systems in one jump at nearly no cost with nigh zero riskjf ftwthat doesnt mean i wouldnt support nerfing the heck out of it if the loss of laughably easy logistics benefits the game at a whole and if i actually get to produce locally because ccp boosts localized production id be a very happy bear for it is much less effortsame for jumpbridges its a display of how broken the game is when i can basically run from one end of the galaxy to the other with nigh zero risk have you seen our network its ridiculous laughably insane we have as many jumpbridge connections in core tribute as we have gates
maybe it would be a good time to redesign mining system and introduce tritanium ore that is worth mining there is no reason why profit should depend on what you mine it should be where you mine and how much you minealso refining should be best in 00 even the bestest npc friends can only do so many favors
so far nobody has explained in this thread how taking away jump bridges is going to have the effect of destabilizing the nc or generally discouraging blocs from forming the redswarm federation controlled most of the south for half a year before jump bridges were introduced bob and the gbc likewise controlled the west long before bridges existed mind you this was in the time of real doomsdays when we were losing fleets a lot faster then we do today anyone who believes that taking away bridges will magically cause all the alliance blocs to suddenly turn on each other has checked out from realitylogistics worked fine without bridges when we could lose a hundred battleships in a couple seconds well manage fine without them now
about the quote on how static 00 is how much has changed in a year many alliances failcascaded and died in a fire and much sov changed hands many times over and over at the moment we have a losing space and regaining it again with much success how is that not good for 00 i mean the influence map paints a much different picture then is being spoken of in the minutes seriously though a lot has changed in 00 and it has been amazing this last year i dont understand how making jbs less relevant adds more dynamic to an already awesome year
it is a witch hunt that is for sure on the part of ccp and some of the csm
jumpbridges needs to go or they need a massive redesignthe way they work now is just plain ed everyone in a big nap fest can use them and the world would not go under if they went away eitherperfect example would be ascn when they where arround you can say what you want about ascn but they did have a very well stocked local market there wasnt much you needed to go to jita to get and that was before jumpfreighters jumpbridges etcyes we had massive freighterruns with 30 freighters with 100 man protection fleets scouts in all directions etc and yes we did get logon trapped etc sometimes it was a pita but its a price to pay when you wanna live in the back ass of nowherejust having a look at this map should explain a great dealnc jump bridge map
so your asking the causal player myself who only gets like 2 hrs a night 3 times a week to spend that time doing logistics rather then enjoying good fights how does that make me want to pay 15 dollars a month if all i do is fly around hoping that i can get into a fight with jbs i can get to enemy territory quick and and have good fights over and over and have fun for my 15 i have a job and go to school i dont need another waste of my already precious time
im not asking you to do logistics and you wouldnt need to either if much of the stuff was made locally wich is perfectly doablethats the problem big blobs are able to project its power over to large areas making it very hard for smaller alliances to get any grip without being blue to a much bigger force or become a renter a 500man fleet can do their stuff in geminate and 30min later be in cloud ring its quicker to move around empire then go straight thruwith a change there would be no need to nap every brother and sister in the vicinity and you could actually fight your neighbour and not all their friendscousinsbrothers etc
ability to disrupt your enemy logistics operations adds very important and exciting strategic gameplay for any war gameover the years however ccp minimized the risk involved with logistic operations carrier bays jump freighters jump bridges titan bridges anonymous alt corps in high sec empire  all these things remove danger from logisticssure that makes eve more civilized and more of an industrial tycoon simulator but it diminishes the war strategies i want a great war simulator not industry simulator
unless your neighbor naps everyone you didnt and then kills youyou seem to be under the delusion that the absence of bridges changes politics it doesnt a single region or ten for some alliances distance simply doesnt matter theyll go where the fights are to be found and theyll nap whoever they like or whoever they need to in order to win depending on their attitude towards naping in generalthere are many ways to field multiple armies around the map and jump bridges are only one of them every login has three character slots and it only takes a month to train a t2 shield drake pilot thats instantly three potential locations for you to have characters waiting for a fight to occur
true but drakes are just another fotm and theoretically yes you could have 3 drake pilots in 3 different locations but that will be 3 tyaverage skilled drake pilots in 3 monthsspecially when people can move through jumpbridges its very easy its a low obstaclebut without bridges the fleet that just travelled 3060 jumps for a massive defensivegank operation would either need to travel 3060 jumps back or clonejump back but be stuck for 24 hours or just pod jump yourself but then you would also be far away from the inital operating area if killed
or log out and log into a character in that theater rolling a drake alt is just an example of how a completely shobun newbee can have three blob capable characters in three months for most of us bitter old vets thats not a necessary step we can already deploy in multiple theaters because weve got the characters to do it and weve got the money to podjump and the offices around the galaxy to land close by but thats giving your argument too much consideration weve proven a foreign legion deployment is possible and practical in the prebridges era and weve done it in the bridges era without using bridges your whining about the feasibility of it is why we hold space and you dont
tzeer i think your missing the obvious point in that i have no intention of fighting people that i have fought alongside my allies are my allies your vision for eve is not what a sandbox should be i dont understand your logic in that this is like doing me a favor or something there are plenty of targets in my neighborhood i mean this whole discussion has just boiled down to jbs are making the larger entities to powerful blah blah blah half the time for fleets larger we are using gates and stuff i mean do you really think a smaller alliances are going to be able to displace anyone in the north or anywhere and hold that territory without jbs i dont think so pl has had some success in being a pain in the ass but newer alliances to 00 are going to get smashed and bottom line even if this does happen it wont change anything on the sov map for any of the big coalitions this is just a hindrance on the causal gamer and will make it hard to impossible to commit time to this for finding actual good fights
this suggestion is what i like to call window dressing problem solving i see it all the time irl from industrial safety departments a problem is identified that everybody would like to see fixed but the true solutions are too complex or difficult to implement so policy makers focus on things that they can change quickly and easily to make it seem like theyre doing somethingso the problems here are that blob warfare is too prevalent and small alliances have no way of getting a start in 00 the identified subproblem is that it is too easy to project power across long distances and so jump bridges and seemingly capital jump drives are oggled suspiciouslyjump bridges and jump drives certainly contribute but they are not the root causes blob warfare occurs because stacking dps kills things faster and allows you to win that is all it is not limited to 00 by any means my life in high sec saw war decs against alliances larger then us where we were simply incapable of fielding a force to oppose them the difference being once the war dec was over we were able to undock and use the space as we had beforeif you were to eliminate jump based logistics it would encourage bloc level alliances to enforce control over pipes to high sec in effect encouraging even larger blocks of space to be controlled and blobbed in addition because everybody would need to use all the gates in the region small gangs would be less likely to slip in unnoticed so it would encourage alliances to develop defence outposts at their perimeters so the guards could keep eyes on the boarders and the inner systems could continue with life as usual secure in the knowledge that nobody could hop right over the outer defensesthe problem of the little guys not being able to get a start in 00 is based in one thing isk in order to obtain 00 sov space you need to be able to fight off an opponent who has likely been established in 00 for some amount of time for the duration of that time they were able to mine their moons generating more income then you ever could during life in empire so you likely have one or two cap ships and no ship reimbursement program while they have been able to build up the means to beat you back and thats not even considering the costs of sov structures sov system rentals etc etc if by ingenuity luck diplomacy or sheer force of will you do manage to claim a system or two there wont be any r64 or tech moons there so youre going to be scraping a living off corp taxes from rats and what minerals you can harvest until a cap fleet wanders by and decides to kill your structures for fun ive been on both sides of that equationthe presence or absense of jumping via bridges titans or capital jump drives will not change either of these issues to fix blobbing the basic mechanics of fleet damage need to be inspected to enable small alliances to compete for sov requires that the manner by which isk is earned needs to be inspected these changes are not going to be a quick lets remove one transport mechanic from the game type fix these are based on systemic issues and will need systemic solutionsthat was a wall of text yuck
or you could read the map upside down and make a good first impression with your neighbors
a good wall of text if i might addone interesting point you mentioned is separating border from core systems itll most likely happen border area will be blobbed even more and core systems will become even safer than they are now thats just wrong
people who wont want to be involved in firing will manage taken away for their wellbeing and calmness beautiful compartments it can there will be trailing gardens inhabited compartments shops and office premises or still something like thatpeople to which would like some adrenaline troubles and which arent afraid of it after all it is only a game can with more freedom receive it in any dark both rather dirty corridors and station compartments where criminals addicts drug dealers and slave traders hide probably even characters at which all is simple not tritely smoothly and they dont have money to depart from stationpeople which very long time live in 00 regions begin to walk easy on dangerous stations of angel cartel in region curse for example about permanent death without possibility of cloning  that is a bad idealets tell in a capsule there is a huge transmitter and the small transmitter is built in a head implant of the capsuleerhuge for thousand light years and small for the nearest receiver in limits of pair hundreds metersat station of such receivers  thousandsit is possible to imagine that in game time too isnt necessary stay on a one placelets tell this transmitter in a head implant  not so for a long time has been invented by one artful doctoror an alternative variant  not murder only causing of very strong mutilations and loss of consciousness from traumas or blood lossarrival to  in a medlab and it is possible for moneynevertheless this far future with very strong medicine i think for those who has made violence in safe bays it is possible to invent prison in which the security guard will lead out youin it it will be necessary to stay the certain cooldown timer or to break to itself a neck to appear in a medical bay and quickly to run away from station
why because you only want to grief others without any real risk to yourselflets introduce permanent death for all in station combat lets put the suicide back into suicide gank
right because thats exactly what happens when you undock and have the option to purchase dozens of npc ships to defend you and whats that thats not how the game works at all combat is entirely between its participants unless you catch someone ratting every aspect of eve is built from the ground up to support pvp by leaving your hangar you accept the risk that what assets youre using may be destroyed including your clone itselfwhod a thunk itmeanwhile the angst in this thread is amusing what make sure that new content in a pvp game has pvp in it the devil you say and naturally angst over risk free suicide ganging as if what this thread really needs is some trolling that people play pvp games and rage against pvp in those games is odd
ya so what man its all uncharted water here were leaving are ships for the first time and in a place that is normaly safe in anypart of space a station hell i have 1000s of npc milta whats to say im not going to get to use them but i realy dont think theres going to be pvp on stations at least for a year or morewhy becouse thats what dust 514 is for as right now it is only a consle gameing and that probly means contracts
apsidia people who want to explore and talk to others like to do just that letting them get killed and lose implants over it is just going to prevent that especially when there is zero reward to it lowsec and null at least give financial reasons to risk your safety chatting and wis doesntthe game is bigger than pvp or at least should be this can make the game a richer more social experience trying to replicate the reasons why that is lacking in current eve isnt going to help
as long as there are inviteonly areas im all for itregarding scooping out your grey matter like pumpkin innards intact implants include tools and supplies used for implanting so most you can get out of body should be some kind of cybersalvage tho blood raiders would have interest here basic gear should be available from npcs and players advanced gear and upgrades should be from players onlyalso dont forget new stats well need strength constitution and agility
id also like to see magic
you probably mean more magic as there is already quite a lot in eve 
ok universe of eve is like an orange from eight segmentseach of these segments  the different sides of gamewe now consider only one segment number nine which never was in game and it are going to addso different that them it is very difficult to compare all segments of this big orange with each otherone segment gives us space exploreations other segment gives pve the third  missions the fourth  pvp the fifth  trade and isks the sixth  manufacture and extraction of ore and minerals the seventh  unites us in corporation the eighth  gives to us for what to struggle in this game  territorial claiming tasty killmailsdifferent players like different segments and sets of segmentsthe ninth segment gives us the small world in each station and all of us want that it corresponded to our waitings and preferencesin this subject we also consider idea properly we chew it and if someone doesnt agree  we do not swear with each other and we produce idea how to make so that it was pleasant to all of uswhile at us only two results of arguing1  players who want calmness at stations should have safe places at station2  players who love genre scifi should have the full sensation that game corresponds to it and on it at stations should be possible to conduct not lawful activity3  fans pvp and a nayward as a whole simply demand it4  without risk in game it is not interesting  the fact5  in game there should be a place where it is possible to have a rest and be simply afk6  game shouldnt be the native land of pink ponies which fart by rainbowsmy idea consists in the following1  we are included into station and we see this2 this  completely safe place as well as was earlier3  having pushed the button to quit a capsule we get on station4  at station we have card of floors and bays where we see that one of them red one of them green and blue and others yellowblue  absolutely safe baysin green it is possible to kill but it will entail very serious consequences up to loss of a great sum of money  to stay the big timer behind a prison grid the most smaller punishment here  a security officers which thrusts a bullet in a head to the offenderin yellow locations of murder are possible but security officers here too reactsin the red can live and do everything that criminals will wantsome corridors between zones and bays can be red blue or yellowif needtobe  safethen stay in blue or greenelse dont cry and do what you wantif needtoreceive  somecriminalinteractions or itemsthen go to yellow or red and dont cryelse do what you wantif the station is in hisec red and yellow zones in it a minimum but should be presentif the station is in 05 system and more low all colors on a card equallyif the station belongs to piracy fraction dark blue bays there arent present generally and the small part is colored in green color only all remaining  yellow and red all of us want that it was more interesting and more convenient to playconvenience  speed simplicity and ease interest  complexity and difficultyquestion only in how us to achieve balance convenience and interest for all
very nice ideas  not sure how practical for eve but i like the idea of splattering an amarrians brains against the wall  small suggestion here in a policed station the police will open fire on you the second you take out a weapon unless perhaps you buy expensive weapons such as camo and a high tech rifle then you have time to pick a target and fire then seconds after the police kill you that way you lose the expensive weaponry so not everyone is going to just jump clone and kill mindlessly and will actually need a reason to killalso maybe an insurance on implants that way when they get blastedburntshreddedexploded the player gets something back out of itanother thing standing could mean something pirate factions or any factions or corporations they would draw weapons and protect the person under attack in low security stations  or assist in splattering there implants
there should be definetly height asjustment it should be dependant on racebloodlinegender though within some limits to prevent everyone being midgets even if those are cute
and another small bump to the front

i supportwe have terrible monotony in space exploringpsby the way it is possible to return to idea with ships logsi have found these logs and they roll till now at me in a hangar but and hasnt had time to try to use them somehow then i long didnt play and when have returned this idea have already refused
i understand all this about supply and demand i think that the two types of botting toons have opposing effects macro ratting causes inflation of prices macro mining causes deflation of prices its hard to say what exactly the balance would work out to be if both were decreased at the same time in any case if it turns out that 90 of all minerals are mined from bots we would expect mineral prices to rise a bit and increase player mining activities increasing supply to some extent also ccp has the ability to dial up or down the supplydemand of minerals throughout the game easily they have in the past rebalanced the materials for t2 production and it is not unreasonable to think they could rebalance the amount of trit and all the others required for a battleship bp if the market needed that so in effect the claim that the eve economy needs botters to provide the minerals is a false claim eve needs botters like it needs increased lag
i agree that ccp is more focused on rmt for a variety of reasons they are effectively collecting through plex from the small fry botter  these numerous small fry guys probably vastly outnumber the rmt guys and are probably producing a more serious effect on the game in aggregate than the rmt guys are doing but with substantially lower benefit to catching them and more work thus ccp stopping those people is not reasonably achieved by using a system that requires gm intervention they are probably better off making changes to the game interface or gameplay system that makes botting for the small guy more difficult andor less profitable i think that my proposal does both of those things without creating undue annoyance for the players like capta
post 25i still think that making the probe skills mandatory for mining will damage a lot of new players on the other hand if it was possible to find the mining sites with the use of the on board scanner would be easy for the bots to adapt the there is the pvp problem if all miners and ratters move to locations that can be found only with probes finding targets become more difficult any suggestion on how it will be possible to overcome those problemsor you think they will be an acceptable cost
well you can always have them rendered at their lowest level and applying a generic crispyfrozen mask to the model isnt that intensive or difficult
i support this and further more when incarna proper comes out or later itteration on it it would be cool to be able to have these corpses mounted on the walls or in display cases in and around your suite of rooms then you could have your enemys sign their ignominiouse surrender surrounded by their own stuffed and mounted clones
agreed there are so many uses for these new models its a shame just to have them as avatars even for now
best use of the new character creator so far
trying to make the corpses more pretty so that the necrophiliacs can violate them more
well someone has to sit around my dinner table bonus if they arent breathing all over the food or talking
toggle option in the menu to show avatar or corpse is absolutely requiredbut i like
support this would make pod killing much more fun for sure
ok i just did a test to see what it was like smuggling drugs and illegal goods to see how the mechanics worked from customslose standingsyou get fined by customsthen you get asked to hand over the drugyes you lose the drugs no you run or diei have no problem with customs trying to kill you if you run or having to hand the drugs over but its being fined before choosing if you are going to run or not my idea is to change it to thislose standings this should happen either way since you are smugglingcustoms ask for the drugschose yes fined and lose drugschose no keep isk keep drugs and have to run or get killedalso if choosing no make the standing loss larger that way the player could quickly become kill on sight in certain high security space for repeatedly running past customswhat are peoples thoughts on this
im not trying to be negative about incarna it is good for the game and i think it will add to my own game play experience i will freely admit i thought it was odd that we only had a small picture of our character when i started eve but its easy to see how ccp could get carried away with it and continue to put other game play issues on hold people who think ccp can work on everything at the same time should read the csm minutes from june of 2010 and the dev blog that followed that ccp is clearly doing an awesome job with incarna but it is taking up huge resources and that is really why they said for example fw will have to wait about 18 months before we will see more substantial work on itthis proposal is really just intended to be statement from the players asking ccp to keep their word about when they would get back to spaceships if you are fine with them not getting back to spaceships after the 18 months and you want them to continue to dedicate huge amounts of resources to incarna then dont vote for this proposal
supported 3wod dust incarnia they all make perfect sense on a marketing department spreadsheetin reality they are draining eve of the innovative creative minds it needs to continue
nope sorry they have to focus on world of darkness after incarna
of course i hope they wont forget about the spaceship game that they developed for about 7 yearsdevelopers are free to do what they want if youre not pleased by the product then find another one
not supported i hope they continue to work on incanra after releaseeve has had just as constant space ship changes and additions over the years as it always had when i started playing they only had 20 people in the whole office and they rolled out capital ships now they got 50 people working on just spaceships and 50 people working on just incarna in fact im in support of a smaller group since back in day it felt like more got done less stepping on toes but either way 50 people making changes is more than 20 even if only 50 of current devs working on eve are working on the space part
supportedplease let icarna wither and die in its stillborn bugged to crap form just like every other recent feature outside of the apocrypha patch
where are you getting these numbers the dev blog i read said 70 people on incarna and 22 on in space
as it stands it is not possible for a player who is a member of a corporation to own and operate their own pos without the use of an alt corp now while this may not be a problem for some people those of us in 00 space cannot move alt corps down without massive diplomatic difficulties i would like to be able to operate my own pos without having to circumnavigate the current pos game mechanics
i dont know how true it is but ive read several times that ccp has no idea how their own pos or in game billboard code works anymore and are terrified of touching it
if this is true i then wish to tell ccp to htfu and begin working on it in house or release the source code to the playerbase and allow us to break our machines finding wherehow the code is
while i have a couple of reservations about potentially making high security smaller it certainly would make some things a bit more convenient that and i like concord so seeing yulai become a busy hub appeals to me aestheticallysupported
this is probably the most popular idea ive had since sovereignty 20lol
today the number of people in a system would indeed not be a deterrent to reinstantiating the highways and thusly yulai to its former statushowever there are good reasons for not reopening the highways its one of the things that would make eve smaller which is something people are complaining about as it is furthermore distances and the associated time to traverse them are a key factor for eves economy creating trade opportunities and in general giving more meaning to the concept of regions and the differences among themfinally with the highways reopened yulai would become the new jita but worse
thats debatable even when yulai was the central hub there were vibrant local markets not everyone wants to travel to town to buy milk but big purchases like faction ships are all invariably going to be in one centralized location
think jump bridges except controlled by concord

ohh pleasse  no id bury a hatchet in my monitor if i ever saw that on my screen
bring back ddor not
i dont think negative isk is yet possible but your idea combined could be combined with this fullfill the market order even if the wallet does not provide enough let the char go into negative isk plus you cant set up other orders when you are in negative isk and all running orders will be cancelled if you where caught not providing enough isk for orders
this
frikking alts getting in the way ce btw
just understand that that makes you by far my inferior in experiencethere is a huge middle ground between briefly ran a pos once or twice and run 100 pos just so you knowpeople who do serious pos industry ie run the three or more pos necessary to make something like fernite carbide are a pretty major part of the market and a sizable number of usersand in reality the moneys in processing not extracting and there are plenty of open moonsif you want to get in the tower game you can put 500 million of your hardearned isk out in space where any passing jackass can shoot it up just like the rest of us you dont want to because its a tedious risky pain in the asssetting up a decent industry tower with minimal defenses is a process that will occupy a pilots minimal attention for an entire evening boring him to tears with timers and tediumto fuel that single moonmining pos requires a trip by a jumpfreighter or two or more trips from a light industrial ship generally across lowsechighsec thresholds or in and out of a nearby station similar effort is required to remove the productsyou can accept that youre going to get podded and lose the fuelgoo every once in a while or you can stick with jumpships requiring at least two accounts and cutting into profitability with fuel costs and blockade runners require 78 trips to fuel a tower or 4 to empty a siloand sure for one smallish tower thats not a big dealnow try running three larges or fiveat present there are no power blocks significant enough to manipulate the supply there are plenty of open moons and the agreement in prices between suppliers are due to market forces not market manipulation moon goo can be got for little more and often much less than it actually costs to extractt2 prices are guaranteed to rise if you make it possible to sabotage tower operations without ever engaging the tower people dont run towers because theyre easy or because theyre fun they run them because theyre profitable simply that nothing moretower profitability already rests on a razors edge if it goes down again a fair number of tower operators will simply pack it in your independent operators wont begin to make up the loss in supply put simply you are wrongthe moon miners dont want to pvp if they wanted to pvp theyd be flying the vagabonds not making them so they will pack up and leave and your vagabonds will cost more ideas like this one are why lowsec is empty in the first place please dont keep trying to drive away the folks that are still there
you realise that the nc now controls a massive proportion of the technetium in eve right and that they can and do manipulate a good portion of the supply to make profithowever i am not here to argue politics because that is boring and repetative i am here to deliver a concept that will add what i believe to be a new dynamic to eve it will give smaller groups the ability to mess with much larger opponents and could make them some money in the processexample there are i believe 3 promethium moons in an aridia system called nalnifan when i was a newb i dreamt of getting some of that goo but myself  5 good friends couldnt muster up the dreadsisk to even attempt to take the towers from the then bob alliance the tower massive defences just sat there without any serious management sucking in the isk for them with the method i propose our small groups could try and get a slice of the isk or disrupt the supplyremember each time a moon is illegally harvested by somebody the corp who owns the tower does get a mail and can send out ships to try and catch the attackers if there is a deathstar then all that would really be required for your effort might be 1 interceptor to point the cloakies as they attempt to scoop the moon fragments because then the pos defences could lock them and finish them offi just believe that it would add a new interesting dynamic
fair enough thanks for the inputkind regardsce
if moons deplete in value or get capped then theres less to fight over really pointless
tldr skip ahead to the predicted affects sectionin the current method systems with security status from 5 to 10 are all high sec and concord always destroys the ship of criminals in 4 to 1 stargates and stations have guns but everything else is freeforall with loss of personal security status being the only deterrent to pvpi propose that the security change be more gradual each decimal point down should feel a step more dangerous perhaps something like thishigh security space10 concord protection remains the same as it currently is criminals are dealt with swiftly and completely09 concord protection is significantly delayed like it currently is in 0708 concord protection is substantially delayed like it currently is in 0507 concord should be slow to appear players should be thinking about their own defense at this point and not relying on concord to always do it for them06 concord should be escapable not easily of course but it should be possible a ship with enough warp stabilizers or one that is fast enough just might get away i also think asteroid pirate npcs should sometimes fly destroyers out here05 concord ships should be similar to real ships with even less warp scrambling so that it is not too difficult to get away players out here should be getting a taste of what lowsec is like it would be neat if asteroid pirate npcs could on rare occasions fly cruisers herelow security space04 concord ships should patrol the asteroid belts of course these ships would be destructible just like pirate ships but carebears would be a lot more willing to mine out there if they felt protected concord should employ a mix of battleships and warp scrambling frigates to make it difficult for a lone wolf to pick on the miners03 concord should have light patrols in the asteroid belts02 concord should have scout frigates to patrol asteroid belts these ships could alert more powerful concord ships to show up in the event of criminal activity01 concord should be like it currently is in lowsec at the stargates and stations only the main protection out here is that attackers lose security statuspredicted major effects of this change1 carebears will reveal their true colors the truly pathetic ones will retreat to topsecurity systems to mine veldsparscordite and run level 2 missions a lot of them would either have to give up access to omber and kernite as well as level 4 missions or instead learn to deal with and mitigate the risks involved with reaping these rewards the daring carebears the ones with teeth will venture out into lowsec to take advantage of the even greater rewards with the enhanced concord protection it will be worthwhile for a shrewd player2 valuable high sec ores will no longer be a nobrainer for miners the greater reward will come with greater risk isogen will go up in value making omber once again worth mining also the upper lowsec ores will no longer be getting ignored as the safer regions of lowsec dont contain the topvalue ores3 the system security status number will mean something as opposed to merely a division between high and lowsec4 destroyer rats in 0506 will be fun for prepared miners cause extra trouble for and help toughen up newer miners and just make space a little bit more interesting overall
most of the changes would ruin and cause more people to afk out of game sit in a freighter and move stuff for 8hrs a day before you go and do something like removing them it is not easy stop nerfing stuff and instead buff dreads the game has changed around jb and pos why not catch them up to the times over the years u nerf nerf nerf or you have changed something that didnt need change and messed stuff up even more stop ruining this game and start bringing back the fun that this game used to be
theyre actually buffing the crap out of everything lol
you really should link a source
im sure csm will make this proposal its number 1 priority
do i sense some panic your style of writing somehow signalises that cant you rephrase the whole op and separate your points and bring some evidence quotes examples of what you think is wrongalso why would the csm bring up a dont listen to us when they talk with ccp  which is the very point of this subforum you moronhey look ill even support you for the fun of it reading this kind of stuff in the minutes would give me a chuckle
i saw your thumbs up tres and thought you went crazyread your post though just to be sure and was luckily relieved
csm should be disbanded
if only there were some kind of freighter that could jump then the op wont have to worry about the removal of jbs new ship type maybe
i agree they should make specialized freighters with jump drives
the csm is great they are a powerful froce for good and i agree with them 100 whats wrong with keeping an open mind they would never support just removing jb without changes that make that necessary and they are even giving ccp  about incarnaop is just loony
somebody is a dumb pirate get rid of freighters what some folks dont remember when there were no freighters just take them away from the folks that dont want them strip them of the skills letem see how it was growem sbalz
god you players these days so spoiledback in bob we had to do it the hard way and we managed so will you
dont realy see the interest to have them ccp has enough peronnel reading this forum to see whats going wrongfranckly dont see how they represent me any way
so i was discussing eve with my 00 pals last nightthe topic of discussion moved on to risk free hisec isk generation with all parties agreeing that with the availability of limitless level 4 missions the generation of isk high sec is nowhere near challenging enough some guy had the opinion that hisec isk generation should not necessarily be harder but should at least be more of a challenge that scaled with the size of the operation the complete removal of level 4 missions was suggested and seemed to be widely accepted by a bunch of guys who live in 00 and know nothing about hisec isk generation whether or not this will actually happen though is anyones guess the general consensus was that the hisec isk generation should consist of more strategic and tactical planning than simply oh ill run motsu on thursday
why walmatar what a marvellous suggestion
there is one issue level3s can make as much if not more in some cases than level4s in the right shipthe whole mission system needs a rethink like when they made factional warfare missions the idea was 11012 jumps away2the mission site spawns in local on the overview for all players when you enter3faster than normal missions but in low sec in enemy space high chance of pvpbut then the 4th stepmake them pay less than normal highsec missions what the hellanswer given at the time was the missions autobalancer payout thing would fix all rolls eyes
part 4 is bogus you can easily get more than 100m an hour doing lvl4 fw missions per character present i wont say thats impossible with high sec lvl4s but its exceedingly difficult that said i agree that the mission system needs a look all other resources in eve have competition why not missions a simple solution is making it so any given agent can only give out a limited number of missions every 15 minutes i dont support outright removing them however
there was this storyline for gallente which took you to lowsec and killed your standing with caldari or amarr this removed the last reason to mission in gallente space for a while i suggested then these could be introduced throughout the races in level 4 only
as someone who ran level 4 missions all day long for months i can tell you that it is impossible to get the numbers you are talking about using two toons i was able to get maybe 30m an hour if i was lucky and got mostly sansha or blood missions you receive no special loot for l4 high sec missions and with ninja salvagers out the wazoo in high sec you dont make much salvaging either i used to run l4s in a navy apoc all day long and used an alt to salvage in a cormorant if i was lucky i would get an intact armor plate and make a little extra but not much at the end of the week i would take my orca to amarr and sell a weeks worth of loot made me 400500 mil i make that in an hour in wormholes the loot from level 4s is miniscule and you can barely pay for accounts with italso level 4s are hardly risk free while you have to be a complete noob to mess up a spawn in level 4s it is possible for a ninja salvager to scan you out warp to you and aggro another group before warping out the new group aggros you then the whole room now you have a dead ship because the frigs still have you warp disrupted and you cant kill them fast enough never happened to me personally but i have seen it happen to a few friends of mine the risk is significantly less than anything else you do to make money but it is there
the fact that you were using a navy apoc says a lot really its a good newbie mission boat due to its large capacitor and generous fittings but its damage output is  poor for a pve bs i assure you 30m an hour is a very low number but 100m is on the extreme high end
missions are just too easy and too boring ccp should put some of their ai improvements in them already less enemies but tougher enemies and like upcoming incursions they should use specialized ships and not just punching bags with plenty of hit points
100m was possible at one time but not anymore theres been a lot of mission nerf over time whomever claiming 100mhr nowdays are not counting travel time cherry picking missions and not factoring in realistic lp value and tag costs it basically maxes out at 80mhr null sanctums on the other hand easily gives 100mhr in a 1500dps carrier while running zero risk since in some of the backwater alliances you can go on for weeks without seeing a single hostile youre more likely to get suicide ganked in highsec than even seeing a nonblue while in space in those systems this coupled with being a faucet of pure isk from big bounties not relying on selling lp and playing market for portion of total incomefw missions also get 100mhr for almost zero risk fw lp is far more valuable than regular lp and missions can be easily chained it only requires a cloaked sb thus very little chance of getting popped in lowsec mission site is visible but no one ever bothers to invade them knowing that the sb which would have burned away from gate would warp out the moment anyone appears youre more likely to get suicid ganked at some highsec mission hubs than get your sb killed in lowsec running fw missions if it does its 10 mil loss youll make that much from fw missions in a matter of minutesparadoxically sanctums and fw missions run the lowest risks while giving highest rewards sanctums especially needs a nerf badly
im ok for the remove of lvl4 no problem if they remove combat probes from the game in the same timeseems fair enough for me
ccp already nerfed lvl4s profits by like 40 they did this by nerfing the item drops this is terrible because if items stayed the same and they dropped isk profits the same amount there would be a much better effect on economyyour hatred for missions though is highly misplaced nerfing lvl 4s would just make everyone start running lvl 3s then the change in income would make isk deflate very very badly miners and everyone suddenly make even less isk
the problem with sanctums is that u need a carrier to make that 100m an hour and a carrier costs over a billion isk a bomber to do fw missions costs 30mill tops
i agree with highsec as riskfree as it is level 4 missions should not be available in it i cant make that much mining kernite in a hulkalternatively the lower end of high sec could be made more dangerous thus making level 4 missions somewhat risky if you like this idea please go make a post in my thread about making system security status more gradual 
no new ideas here at alljust a bunch of nerf hisec while maintaining the already high income of nullsec
i dont think its reasonable that low sec missions are balanced for battleships supported

and why is this not recieveing any attention cause people dont use gal ships when other races do better for the majority of roleseveryone in a tengu pve at least just wtff oo
heres a thought why this isnt getting any attention your proposals are for the most part terrible pg on the hyp could use a very small boost but theres absolutely nothing that says that you have to fit a ship a specific way because of its bonuses i submit towards this arty abaddons artyapocs suicide ganking shield brutixs passive sleipnirsif you want to be innovative throw in some web drones with your shield tanked hyp your comparisons to the mael are laughable at best yeah mael is great for pvpif you faction the  out of it to make it fitgo ahead and show a 3 damage mod mwd xl booster cap booster point and full gun fit that you dont need a fitting mod for now consider the fact that a 2 damage mod hyp does more than a 3 damage mod mael now consider the fact that the hyp is already faster than the maelstrom these ships arent supposed to be easy to fit per se specifically because they can become solopwnmobiles very quickly if you let them get too out of line with a nonofficer fit hyp you can get a 4k dps tank with 1400 dps and no remote rep involved
after seeing the adrestia and testing it on sisi one can see what a real blastercruiser should look and work likethe bonuses alone show that at least someone at ccp has a clue what to do to make blasters workspecial ability 25 bonus to max velocity and 50 bonus to medium hybrid turret falloff and tracking speed gallente cruiser skill bonus 20 bonus to medium hybrid turret damage per level and 20 bonus to warp disruptor and warp scrambler range per levelwondering why that 25 bonus max vel and not add it to basestats but nvmin combination with extra pgcpu to ease up fittings and the extra basecap to make it work with an mwd without needing that horrible 5 increase to microwarpdrive capacitor bonus per level is just lovelytoo bad this is just an atreward on the other hand even the serpentis faction blaster ships work halfway decent enough as they tackle the problem in essentially the same way extra speed  web bonus to counter the targets speed  tracking bonus
whats wrong in your opinion is that those fits are not a lol fit for fun just for testing the sad thing about what you are saying is that is the only way to make gallente ships work a little bit bettermy question is whats the pointget rid of specific racial bonus on every ship then and fit autos on apoc or lasers in to hyperions or hybrids on vargurs whatever2 cruise lounchers on my mega have better dps than 6blasters its ridiculous but its fun if only i could fit 6 more i would finish all my missile skils
and heres why your post isnt getting attention its terriblethe shield brutixmyrmhyp arent awful because they perform in a mediocre fashion they are terrible because they ignore the hulls biggest per level bonus its like telling someone to ignore the drone bay on a dominix and fit neutron blasters to make up for it its stupidthe hyperion simply is not used at all in the kind of arena it is supposed to rule because in order to live long enough to be effective it has to fit a buffer tank that buffer tank adds so much mass to the ship that it cannot maneouver or accelerate to get to its target if you want a ship to perform a hyperions role youd be using megathron which is still arguably gimped in spite of its tracking bonus because of the inability of blasters to track targets at their preferred optimal also your figures are bull  post eft fit or gtfothere is a great deal that says you should fit a ship for its bonuses beacuse those bonuses are what make it more effective if ships are commonly being fit contrary to those bonuses it is either for a solid tactical reason or its because the bonus sucks so bad that whoever designed it that way must have been highalso web drones are equivalent of heavy drones in dronebay and bandwidth usage throw a couple of them on the hyp and you get oh wait you get a fraction of the effectiveneess of a stasis web module and lose most of your applicable protection against anything smaller than a bs what a bargain
i think maybe people are fitting projectile weapons or lasers to their gallente ships and finding that coupled with the drone bonuses they do fine now giving those ships bonuses to good turrets would simply make them overpoweredi gave up trying to fit a thorax to do anything well with blasters which never could hit the target anyway and finally just threw on some autocannons it may have less dps not much less according to eft but at least i have a full rack of weapons and i can score hits on targets plus the tiny cargohold feels roomier with the smaller projectile ammo oh and this thing is now almost on par with a stabber when you count the hefty drones it carries and you dont count how the capacitor drains in about 5 secondsjust use autocannons i say or fly minmatar and use autocannons either way dont use blasters
i dont think theres anyone out there who doesnt like seeing large ships explode in game the problem is everyone has a ton of these big ships and theyre often only used in large groupslarge groups of supercarriers and titans can destroy heavy interdictors and interdictors with relative ease via doomsdays smartbombs energy neutralizers and drones before a fleet can manage to kill any therefore ill bring up an idea that i believe has been hashed around before give supercarriers a superpoint i propose replacing remote ecm burst or not but ecm burst is really just a tool to get on a bunch of killmails these days with a kind of superpoint if you want to kill a bunch of supercaps you should have to risk a bunch of supercaps you could even put a superpoint strength of two or three on a titan and require two or three supercarriers to hold a titan downto be clear here interdictor bubbles and heavy interdictor points will still tackle a supercap if youre dumb with your supercap you should still die to a subcap fleet people are going to use massive fleets of supercaps because they exist nerfing them into oblivion isnt going to solve anything as people will just get more of them to counter the nerf the only way to honestly reduce the number of supercaps in game is to make them explode and if you want them to explode you have to make them worth risking this option should of course be implemented in conjunction with other fixes and changes its not a standalone cure all
supporting my own post
if you really want to kill more supercaps all you have to do is make sure that the ships never disappear from space even with logged off characters
how about let dreads have the superpoints
they dont have the ehp to survive long enough to be relevant compared to a super i would love my revelation to be relevant but it needs some serious rethinking to actually happen
no nerf supercarrier dps to the point where battleships and cruisers are effective as a counter to lock them downfailing that invent a capitalsupercapital counter to them something that can tank well enough but has little in the way of offensive capability past fleet interdictionthe last thing eve needs is more supercaps its laughable as it is trying to creep around a freighter without getting hotdropped
i like the idea to make the supercaps stay in game at all times theyre practically floating bases therefore players should be forced to defend them as such
all t3 cruisers have generally limited drone capabilities proteus seems perfectly in line with that policyalso being able to field more than 5 drones is very powerful ability and it cannot even be compared with fielding 5 slow ogres i personally think even ishtar with 5 heavy drones and large drone bay is a bit op in certain situtations granted it is limited with range for exampleno
except for the fact that one factions gimmick is drones so they have a ship that cant field drones because that class of ship is not supposed to field drones so that class of ship therefore sucks for that faction like approximately 70 of the rest of that factions lineup see where im going here
the whole they cant enter high sec deal fails compleatly for one reasion alts every pirate and his grear grand mother has one and they get all the supplies they need through them
so they can get their gimped pve ships easily destroyed brilliant im taking my officer fitted golem into losec right away
well by now its just a fact when low sec missions have mission protection they come to life when mission protection was taken away they died outyou want to realy fix low sec just add in some old school mission site protection its a realy simple game we use to play realy and you get more people to play this game this way tooif you can get pass the gatestation camp and make it to your mission you get to do the mission if not you have to try again or pay to passjust take note that the primary low sec mission ships are unprobable think that happend just by accidet or somethingnope it was no accidet low sec is only profitable with some kind of mission protection be it ccp provided or in a over costly t3 hull when it was ccp provided and you did not have to though over a bil isk to try at low sec there were alot more people trying its realy just that simple its not rocket scienceout side of that i just say let the pirats keep what they cryed so hard and so long for and choke on it
dumbdumbyes get rid of gate guns and such have every criminal action in lowsec have a sleeper ai concord spawn show up after say 30 seconds this allows for frigs to then pvp in lowsec more freely in addition if i alphad something 30seconds later when the concord spawn finally shows up i can just jump through gate and evadein addition this change makes 1 bigger difference stuff not at stations or gates suddenly have a little security right now if i were to be mining in lowsec there is literally nothing protecting me its literally like 00 except there are far more hostiles in lowsec looking to kill you then in 00 so why mine in lowsec same for practically every other reason to be in lowsec furthermore ratting in lowsec is more or less the same difficulty as crap 00 so why rat there my idea is to have essentially newbie officer spawns in 0102 systems these new officers drop medium sized things so like officer medium neutralizers and officer medium weapons suddenly ratting in lowsec is awesome
heres an idea stop shooting them  duh might just get ya a few folks sparky
i think that the best course of action would be to completly change the pve environment in lowsec in empire or 00 you have the luxury to sit on a mission or anomaly for an hour in an expensive pve ship because odds of being suddenly killed are slim either due to concord or intel channels  local this is not true in lowsec since as it was already stated everyone can turn against you and its laughably easy to scan you downso how about a new set of missions for low security space imagine you talk to an agent and he says you know ive heard that there is this gurista staging area in old man star and they have this device that does stuff by accident i happen to have a buy order for it and could provide you with a bookmark whaddya say and once youre in the mission site all you need to do is blow a stationwarehousewhatever while under npc fire without having to kill all rats in three rooms retrieve the device and bring it back also the item would be sold in the market rather than handed over in a mission so if someone blows you up and loots it they can sell it themselvesin other words  make lowsec missionsanomalies a quick inandout with the difficulty being getting past player pirates this would also include the need for pirates do make calculations  this dude is coming in from highsec  maby hes on a mission and ill profit better if i dont kill him now but wait till he comes back with the fat lootmaby make it so the site will spawn by itself and nearby agents might give its location to multiple players at once so when you get there you might find two other dudes trying to get itedit about the empires not caring about capsuleers capsuleers are absurdly rich people when seen from outside look at the pi for example  building a hightech factory or a field of extractors costs peanuts while for a noncapsuleer that would be a fortune you can build an entire production chain on multiple planets with extractors factories etc and then scrap it without a second thought because its so cheap for us we own starships the size of small cities and im pretty sure even a small corporations wallet could compete with the economy of an out of the way planet and the biggest alliances could probably outbid an empire if they wanted we probably pay a lot of money for docking refueling etc at stations  its just that were so rich we dont even notice them so theyre not included in the game also remember that our ships have crews who will leave even more money not to mention the fees for usage of station services and broker fees for market transactions and contractsall in all i guess we leave quite a lot of money in stations and its int their owners best interest to welcome us as often as possible and since the station owners are probably pretty rich people although not godlyrich as we are they would have quite a lot to say in their respective governments
this is the most reasonable idea in this thread and already somewhat manageable with anomaliesif ccp ever fixes the respawn mechanics i run them quite often in a standard nano pest wo active tank actually with faction spawns in them from time to time they would be quite niceto the op the protection you have in low sec is the tank and dps you bring with you also the ability to use common sense local scanner show info and the deeper understanding at what point a person in your system is a risk or notthis works for everyone that lives in low sec and that consider further penaltys for pirates as a pointless approach to protect people that cant or simple being unwilling to play the game exactly the way the environment around them requires it this doesnt mean only flying in frigs unprobable t3s or fitting cov ops claoks on anything but players to realize that they are in a pvp environment and her play style and fitting should reflect this
i like your ideas but i think the biggest problem is that atm people cant really fight back in lo sec and do anything else even remotely profiteable have you seen
i think it would be neat if lowsec were sort of like a subhigh sec in which there is significant security all around that can protect players who dont wish to pvp but the security wouldnt be complete and pirates could get away with killing without losing their shipcould have noninvincible concord patrols around the belts to attract players to mine in them 3 and 4 sec systems could have a very active concord presence while 2 and 1 would not see so much of them that way carebears who are tired of boring old highsec would venture out into 4 at first and the more daring ones would go deeper to 3 and beyond that way the security status numbers would actually feel like they mean somethingon a somewhat related note i think it would be interesting if concord response was reduced in lower security systems in a 5 or 6 system it should take a while for concord to arrive when you get attacked and they should take a few moments to finish the guy off maybe it would even be possible to escape perhaps the higher the security status the more scramble they use and the longer its range that would make it somewhat unsafe to get those midsec ores plagioclase omber pyroxeres and kernite the snivelling wusses who want complete safety should be confined to veldspar and scordite
where will i buy my stuffjust fukking pull it out of my ass
so i pionted out these facts in another post but got deleted when i first started playing eve 5 years ago motherships were awesome very hard to kill but did not have much killing power other than the 20 or so fighters  with certain patches buffs and the like the mothership became nothing more than pos mod like a standard carrier so many cried whined moaned and b that ccp came up with the supercarrier very nice very cool  now it seems the crying moaning whinning and b has gone on  if you nerf the supercarrier formaly known as mothership that would lend it to being killed more easily  unless your alliance can field blobtastic numbers like most of the representatives posting that nerf is needed  so if you are in a smaller alliance get ready to log those toons off and let them expire til the rebuff them as we all do growem sbalz
no the state of inflation in this game is such that 15 bil is not actually that much money to a lot of people any more you cant balance things by cost
i dont think your listed changes would have any impact at all that said i still support a general nerf to scs they have too much tank aeonwyvern too much dps more than death star pos or gank dread and too much versatility
ouch
support 
lol 010 for trolling
im not sure if i would want to quickly jump in the nerf supercarrier bandwagon but i will admit there are some real issues with them when you consider dread usethe first issue i would be looking at addressing to reduce proliferation is the logistics involved in their constructionat the moment current practice is to buy your minerals in empire move them to a close manufacturer plant and build certain modualsammo to compress all that material into a convenient jump freighter sizeive always felt that your ability to recycle items in order to receive substantial minerals was always a huge kick in the guts to the mining profession but now coupled with the 100 in  100 out refining efficiency its a hugh disincentive to using your 00 miners to get the minerals for sc productioni would like to see all recycling outputs cut to 50 to bring an end to compression game play to ease the logistics of sc production this i feel should a slow sc production and b start increasing their cost againthe next issue is to buff dreads again to actually make them a useful tool again in warfarei would first and foremost like to see their siege timers cut to 5 minutes other buffs i would consider are possible increases to dps or possibly making them immune to standard warp disruption ie hiddics to hold themanother possible boost and anti blob nerf if to give them some kind of clusterbomb ammo with aoe damagefinally instead of nerfing fighter bombers  fighters i would rather see assault frigs or destroyers be given a bonus to their ability to kill those drones say a damage bonuses andor drone specific web strength boostimagine the pain caused by a squad of af each able to slow and kill a fighter bomber every 3060 seconds
thanks but i wasnt trolling what prize did they give you for lack of content
i think that supercarriers should be capable of being fit to do a lot of big jobs really well but anything aside from their primary function should be a bit short of their price tag that way theyre not the most costeffective way to do all those things instead their advantage is either to be flexible or just to offer a lot of brute force when thats what you wanti dont know if thats how it is but thats how i think it should be
i like this it sounds interesting maybe both options you can shoot it or hack it  the more durablelarger modules have longer passwords also the beacon shouldnt be destructable really just make it reinforce like a pos module if you shoot it and ppl can repair it later to make it operational however i think most of you are missing one big point  why do hostiles get to use my sov upgrades if i go to the trouble of putting up local beacons why does a hostile get the benefit of my info upgrade local should be for blues  let them see the wh version of it if they want local they have to drop one of the anchorable modules in each system to get it in every system they want it in fairs fair  all the gankers and solo pvpers in these type of threads all complain that 00 is too safe and want no local at all this is a good compromise  the sov holder a has to pay for local and b can have local disabled via player mechanics that arent too arduous or difficult
please delete i was trying to post in an existing thread
supported or at least i would support it for the session timer in case of faction missions there is a reason why people dont play them if they decline it makes no sense to offer them again and againcause of the likely cherry picking not to take courier missions etc i would also say doing a mission should reduce your timer by 1 or 2 hrs not completely so you need to do some missions 30 minutes is like nothing has change too less of an improvement

any logic behind this
well given that theyre completely unrelated pairs of module types  yeah
i dont have a problem with that but normal and covert cynos still share the same icon together with command processors
please increase the lokis sensor strength by 1 ladar if you want to have a cloakingnullifiedcombat scannerskirmish boosting loki that is unprobable you are short by 1 ladar with the signature radius being 95 and ladar strength 94 this is ridiculous and needs to be fixed this is costing the player 700 mil in jackal implants the cover 1 ladarccp fix it
im not sure this is enough as the loki is in need of serious help anything would be a move in a positive direction however and i certainly hope it gets some attention got my vote
not supported because weak sensors are a minmatar racial feature you can have all that without any implants on the loki with a plain t2 fit if it bothers you that it is probable while in warp buy a lowgrade jackal set which is around 100mill or heat one of the eccms for a cycleloki is fine as it is
95 sig and 94 sensor is unprobabletarget size  sigsensor target size must be less than 108bad proposal
im sure any of you have set up a pos assembly arrays or moon harvesting arrays have felt the frustration of locating your structures in process management even things as simple as onlining the right corporate hangar can be a little irritating at firstfor the corporate hangars and similar structures when there is a multitude the task is actually simplified by mousing over the hangar in space youll see it highlighted in your pos structure management window fine thats simple enough really and we can even name assembly arrays and research laboratories i certainly cant argue with that or complain realy as its all fairly nice and tidy in the endi was however experimenting with moon harvesting today on sisi and felt the tearing of my brains molecular structure i had gone to the trouble to anchor multiple moon harvesters coupling arrays and even a simple reactor to my great disdain i shortly discovered i couldnt identify one from anotherlooking back i realized it may have been simpler to anchor them one at a time and set them up for their individual processes as i went this would have been only a temporary solution however as i would likely want to change those further down the road i soon discovered the only reliable means to identify them this was right clicking the harvester in the processes window and selecting approach alltogether a very tedious and unpleasant approach for something that should be made much simplertherefor i am suggesting to make it simpler with a two character tag function available for all structures save the pos implementing this will not only save time and frustration with moon harvesting and similar arrays but will allow for much simpler pos management in other areas as well perhaps some of you actually enjoy this though i think thats unlikely in any caseps feel free to destroy the rather hazardous looking pos in taisy any time after 24 hours has elapsed since this topic was posted after i manage with the first 24 hour cycle i think im done with expending useless effort on a nonprofit pos that would be 0400 utc eve time on the 03 of january for clarification and the pos is located at taisy viii  moon 1 kyonoke pit just to make sure you get it right only one planet in taisy named kyonoke pit so even if i got the number viii wrong youll know which one it is at least i know the limitations or lack thereof of the setup now i do have one thing that bothers me about it however the coupling arrays do not seem to have a maximum range nor do the moon harvesters or anything else with that setup polymer reactors have to be right next to each other these i could link without even knowing which they were and im quite sure i had well over 10km between some of those linked before i discovered i could approach them maybe thats the current resolution on the subjectid really like to see this changed tagging visible in the process menu of course alphanumeric as well so either numbers or letters may be entered in any order ie  cd hf n1 etcthanksct
propose bigger block list for contracts right now its only 80 does anyone honestly think there are only 80 scammers in eve once its filled youll have to scroll through all those scams every time checking contracts in some categories they make up majority of the contracts upunlike standings contract block list is only seen by you personally and can be stored client side if need be no real reason to limit it to 80
2 years ago motherships were only really used to kill jump freighters yes im lame now they are everywhere dreads however are ignored and neglected while fleets are flooded with supercarriers which are op and annoying as hellthe problem with dreads is in siege they are a sitting duck for 10 mins vulnerable and do less damage against structures minus a pos than a supercarrier and when they are out of siege they do ty damagei can understand why alliances would want to have supercarriers over dreads and imo dreads are only really useful in whs nowsurely when ccp was designing supercarriers they didnt want them to be versatile and fill the role of dreads tooi propose a supercap nerf and a dread buff i have thought of ways to make the dread more appealing but honestly i feel these ideas would make them op for example allowing them to receive remote reps while in siege although it could create interesting situations in 00 it would make them op in whsi was wondering how the csm felt about dreads and them becoming the new black sheeps in eve
i think the real difference for dreads everyone and their mother can deploy one whereas motherships you might drop 1020 of them in a big drop that 100000200000 dps from the motherships arent to bat an eye at but when you could bring 250 dreads thats like 15 million dps furthermore if you lose a mothership it hurts you lose a bunch of dreads who cares because they are insured at the end of the day using motherships are more risky add on top of that if you were to have 250dreadsmoms go up against 250 battleshipshacs those caps are all dead so people generally bring battleships instead this is why dreads just arent around anymore its better to have your dread pilots in battleships while its absurd to suggest putting your mothership pilots into battleshipsso the cap battle is decided solely on who wins the subcap battle so you want to bring the biggest subcap fleetthis is why dreads have disappeared and motherships dominate the fieldwant to bring dreads back create a new supercap perhaps tier 3 dread who sucks at shooting stuff that dreads typically shoot but absolutely  the  out of subcaps lets the subcaps fight off field as sending your subcap blob in to kill the supercapdread would be lolbadidea you then have to do your battles separate i imagine a supercap dread that had like 3 remote smartbombs whose range is large enough to hit fighterbombers and slightly better dmg then your officer smartbombs kind of like the remote ecm burst such a thing would be crap against pos modules because itd kill your blue dronesfighterbombers it would be crap against other caps because of the amount of ehp except when that blob warps in and is all balled up locked and remote smartbombed to oblivion problem i could happening though what stops you from bringing those ships the subcap fleet how about you have to siege and then you cant lock anything for 30 seconds lets the subcap fleet run moreover you can make it so warpdisrupt bubbles wrecks everything get killed by these and the dictors themselves wouldnt last long in addition the ability to spread out enough to negate the smartbomb abilitytldr cap battles are decided by the subcaps and not the caps themselves so having dread pilots in battleships is superior
true you didnt say thatand i didnt say that you did reread my post 660 of this thread what you did insinuate was that ankh lacked common sense because she threw a spoon and that anyone doing such a thing was clearly lacking in common sense i term this a lapse in judgment and losing ones temper rather than an absence of common sense by extension your reasoning places anyone who has lost their temper into the category of people who lack common sense i really shouldnt have to recap this to correct you it wasnt more than a couple posts backmost people would not say they elect someone to shut the hell up when the going gets rough and it would be in the politicians best interest to back off constituencies elect a politician based upon the politicians stance once in office the politician is expected to advocate for the positions planks that the people elected them to advocate for what the constituency does not expect or want is for the politician to shut the hell upi see a lot from you that runs to everyone knows numerous sites and highlighted multiple times you sound like someone who has jumped on a bandwagon without actually seeing any proof i saw considerably more proof of immaturity from a couple other members of the csm than i did from ankh heck i see it in the us congress every freaking day this is not to say that ankh wasnt an effective csm representative any more than it says the others arent good representativeslets investigate this alleged spoon throwing incident how do you know it took place where did it take place in a break room between meetings at lunch during a meeting with ccp or just the csm did she throw it at someone or simply throw it down on the table in disgust what was the spoon made of metal plastic when this incident was first reported on the forums i looked for information on it and found little since i didnt care to spend too much time looking around for information on it perhaps i missed something at the time it seemed like a bs rumor wouldnt it be funny if it were just a rumor that more and more people started believing until it became one of those things that everyone knowsthe only people who know why ankh was kicked off the csm are ankh and select members of the ccp staff the other members of the csm dont know i venture to say that most of the ccp staff do not know interesting fact even if they did know they couldnt tell what they know without violating ndas unless release was granted by someone at ccp with the authority to do soccp has said they will not comment ankh has said she contests ccps allegation as to breach of the nda csm members have said they dont know ive pointed out as have a few others that technically there are a number of csm members who could be accurately accused of breach of the nda yet in spite of all this complete lack of information outside of ankh and ccp you out of all the people in the world profess have sufficient information on the matter to render a judgment you know that she violated the nda if i wasnt so busy being underwhelmed i might find time to be impressedyou say we are judged by our actions ankh did not kick herself off the csm ccp did that you assume ccp was just in their action you assume that ankh did something to violate the nda that others who have not been kicked from the csm did not do it seems you assume a great deal and know very littlewindjammer
game play mechanics as stated prevent what you are proposing because it will be too easy it used to be back in the day that you could just type in coordinates for where you wanted to go and warp there but this was removed for good reasonhowever your idea of stopping mid warp intrigues me although i wouldnt want this to be easily done to stop it becoming a fail safe oh  i shouldnt of warped to that gate button however doing it with consequences could be awesome especialy if we bring in role play aspectsconsidering how warp drives were explained earlier with the computer locking onto a target and warping you there creating a bubble around your ship ect how about you have the option of emergency collapsing that bubble however you will suffer reprocussions to this actionwarp bubble gone friction and mass starts taring your ship apart your shields will be zerod due to the massive impact with real spacearmor loose a set amount of hit points depending on ur size and mass ie shield bc loose all its armor hit points due to size armor bc has a lot more armor but more mass too so loose all standard armor and 5075 of additional buffer tank done this cuz in pvp shield ships will regain shields quick where as armor wont so given escape time and time to catch both will be at 25 tank or something and of course the massive impact from entering real space without warp bubble will massively impact upon the ships structure maybe a 50 hit to hull damage and maybe damage some modsand what i would totaly love is if you emergency exit warp and a plannet is in the way you impact and get destroyedthis may seem like very harsh and stupid repercussions but it will give an interesting dynamic an emergency stop to stop you hitting gate camps or if you do a stupid mistake where you might loose your ship however it will also make you significantly weakened and an easier target so you havnt escaped so easily does this sound like a balanced ideaplease visit your user settings to reenable images
what happens when you mix all the greatest social communites into one pagejust think about for a second youtube twitter myspace and facebook all into one big bowl there is only one answer for thatkamnexat
this is the stupidest thing ive read in 2011 not your writeup but what is being said and suggestedpeople who think like this really shouldnt be taken seriously particularly the idiotic suggestions around jump bridgeshow about people concentrate on there being an actual reason to hold 00 before you make it even more unliveable
the only reason the csm supports this is because most of them are from sov holding alliances and the removal of jbs will solidify their hold on null sec an potential enemy infiltrating thier alliance and getting their jb passwords is the greatest threat to their sov just imagine a 2000 man fleet suddenly appearing in the deepest part of you sov and shutting down your industry overnight then other fleets appearing all over your empire setting up sbus all over the place
btw everyone knows everyone elses jb password it is impossible to keep that  secret pos guns are the only thing protecting the jb networkspeople who dont know  about 00 really need to stop offering us their considered wisdom because that is what leads to stupid proposals like removing jump bridges
lol to the spy commentbut seriously it could be an interesting suggestion thoug it scares me and i know that my home will go to  if this happens and im not sure what will happen to me and my corp i could loose a lot however it will make stuf smaller and possibly more fun and actually allow smaller alliances to hold space less of this giant monstrous coalition stuf rather small groups of ppl pvpin and having funalso by removing the massive coalition factor it could remove the ease of building titans and motherships and make them a real feat again rather than just another day at the office this i know little about tbh just seeing that from the outside

short answer nolong answer nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
noalso no to incarna its internet spaceships not another walk around as a hot chick and constantly jump game
definitely supportedchange font from builtin to any on the system and selecting size would be optimaleye candy is all good and well but id rather play on a black screen with text if it is what it takes to make the game more readable
i dont require your invitation or welcome to post in a thread i havent been posting here because it isnt necessary to post against something that seems to be doa as is so much as id like to continue to poke holes in your statements ive resisted as an exercise in avoiding wasting time besides its way too easy and i find things that are too easy to be boringmoreover you failed to cite your confirmation of a beyond a shadow of a doubt upcoming nerf what it amuses you to call tinfoil nonsense was designed to show just how overblown your claims can be and it achieved that goal you had and have no conclusive information there was no confirmation of your assertion before and even now none exists super carrier nerfs remain a question in all probability the best you might have had was mention from a member of the csm regarding what they intended to ask ccp aboutscats link didnt work at least for me linking a pdf may be a problem though his quote from the minutes was accurate selective but accurate in the same spirit i offer the following quote taken from the section of the minutes titled post dominion 00 in which discussion of the super carriers was carried out in more detail than scats quoteboth the quotes from scat and myself come from the recently released minutes of the december ccpcsm summit specifically the last third of the three parts those minutes have been released in i invite readers to read the quotes in their full context to reach their own conclusions far better than relying upon out of context quotes which only appear to support the highly inaccurate and strongly biased opinions of the op and his minionswindjammer
i am sorry that the devs stating its a something of great concern to them doesnt translate into the same thing it does for people who have followed the csm and dev conversations for half a decade as for needing permission it sure looks like you did  nice wall of text to shout down a straw man though
not supporting thisleave the supercarriers and titans as they are at the moment or take the supercarriers out of the game completely and change titan dd back to aof weapon
as a super cap pilot i have read this thread and come to the conclusion thatslots should stay the sameehp should stay the same selfdestruct is the real problem imoewar immunity should remaini very much like the idea of the bonus to drone controls  3 drones instead of 1 and changing the super carrier skill to 1 drone per level instead of  3make peeps choose between dps or survivabilitychoose to fill your highs with dcus or choose protection ie ecm burst neuts  smarties
sighyoure admitting to being a straw man now actually admitting it so this whole thread was just a troll geez i knew you were full of it i just didnt think youd admit it stillpretty good troll well doneregardswindjammer
nope just admitting that your entire posting history in this thread has been arguing a straw man not the content not the suggestions involved just one thing you twisted to mean what you wanted for 3 pages  but hey keep on loving the bumps
and my idea that you cant recharge cap while your cloakedalso by doubling the cycle time of the dd means normal capitals and sub capitals will survive twice as long as they do now the increased damage does not change if a subsuper capital will die faster they already die from one hit what it does mean is super caps will die faster less super caps is a win for everyone but we are starting to get away from the topic of you thread
i like the idea of proto and improved cloaks gaining a 100 cap regen bonus would go a long way to nerfing the behaviour you just stated and other unintended things like afk cloaking granted it would have a far lesser effect on subcapitals it would be crippling to supercaps a good thing imhoas for the damage increase it would give entities with titans the abily to alpha a supercap with 7 or 8 titans numerous alliances can field 2040 of them this would end in people simply not flying supercarriers and instead flying only titans not because supercarriers are worthless but because it would be all about whoever could get the most dds off as fast as possible and nearly nothing else
wont that eventually happen anyway with current titans ed although scs are easy to get in and are cheaper ultimately best way to kill people is to alpha them and titans are ultimate alpha vehicles currently so as numbers get big enough only titans work well and thus any alliance with sense will only use titans for 00 wars they can kill everything instantly including tackle if there are enough titans on grid
i see your point so if the cycle timer was doubled and the damage was doubled would that be an improvement a bitin my opinion titans should not even be able to lock subcapitals at all support should take care of tacklers and key ships like logistics and command ships reading from battle reports it seems titans dd more sub caps than actual capitals
yes dds are used to kill logistics ships and carriers first to break fleets support after that they shoot expensive stuff like t3 and tackle there is no defense besides warping off and giving up the field to enemy
theres no change in rofdamage the dd currently does that will fix it any time you have a 1 shot kill weapon in any game its broke its broke no matter how you try to affect it with rof and counters bc the simple answer will always be just bring more the titan dd is the only thing broke about titans atm sc are broke for a variety of reasons
gah maybe doomsdays need to be changed where when they shoot all they do is burn out all the modules of the ship they shot
hi you sound like another convert welcome
i just moved to 00 am nowhere close to flying a capital in any form and have never been on the recieving end of a sc blobhaving read a lot of interesting discussion in this and other threads a lot of trolling as well the more i think about it i think marlona is along the right track and that through some mechanic which i dont propose to dictate to ccp all super capitals should be rendered unable to effect subcapitals in any form not with damage ewar or logisitics subcaps should be able to do their thing to super capitals all day long with 0 fear from the super capital itself supercapitals are now balanced solely around there effect on capitals structures and other super capitals support fleets would be mandatory nothing changes to carrier and dread capabilities against subcaps and sc pve would die this would make people mad i think it would also put the game in a state where cap balance could be achieved by ccp eventually
not supportedif you guys turn this game into some big chat 2nd life horscrapim leavingstay with spaceships and person to person combatif you want wobbily motions  go have a 2nd life in 2nd life and eve can be ur 3rd lifelet ccp fix and work on things that really matter
so about those camel toes oh well time to get navigatord didnt like these forums anyway
nobody ever said anything about making eve another second life incarna is coming whether you like it or notmight as well have the best possible out of incarna it is illogical to think that simply adding movement for breasts would make the game like second life it is simplyas stated numerous times beforefor the sake of realism and game quality i also seriously doubt that this feature would take away resources from fixing the game the devs working on incarna are not working on game fixes and those devs arent going to be doing anything else but incarna until it releases and possibly for some time after that i am sure
not supportedwhy if were going for realism any selfrespecting girls would be wearing bras thus negating the special physics needed im sure that super serious podpilot alphafemales that kill millions of commoners without the slightest thought would be a little above the average jiggly women on earth in reality the only reason anyone would ever think this is a wanted much less needed addition to incarna is purely for sex appeal if you want to see unrealistic silicone boobs in stations go watch some scifi themed prn or get your woman to dress up like it or play one of those strange japanese games not here not in eve
what kind of bras are the women you know wearing steel steel bras dont sound all that funor comfortablei just went and checkedmy wifes boobs still move when she walks even when she has her bra on imagine thatcloth cannot negate the movement of breasts to keep them completely stationary
bra pft we are taking nanoage here cybernetics are everywhere you could have boobs of any size and shape as long as you are willing to drag a power source along
whats that power source doing strapped to your backwhat this little thangit just keeps my 46 double h boobs from moving while i walkno thanks if that is what the future is like i would rather go back to the stone age but again for the sake of not blowing things out of proportionyesthere is a joke there tooi propose that the boobs not be made any bigger than what they are in the current character creator
went on vacationbut hawaii inspired me to want cooler missile graphics more after watching a parrot drop a bomb on a guy next to me in slow motion i wont go into details on the launch but i must say the explosion graphic was epicbump
bump and thumbs up deffinately agree

i hope nobody is under the delusion that simply removing all jb is a magic bulletits a part of a greater problem that would have to be tackled at the same time and goes down to the very basis of 00 income force projection the ehp grind the sov system in short the entire 00 complex including its relations to highsec and lowsecid be very happy if ccp showed an interest in redesigning 00 from the ground up with some player input it has become very stale and the utter failure of dominion just further cemented bad design choices and this is where i disagreethe problem of the current and past sov system is one of ehp grind which forces and encourages high numbers and high dps to lessen the grind an individual has to doa sov system based not on ehp grind but on actual occupation and usage of a system would definitely make it possible for smaller alliances to use some spacenow history lessonguess where i pulled that from yes its sad how this devblog sounds like its written to change the current sov system
hmm perhaps whith a black ops boost and some sort of limiteddelayed 00 local this could see a ressurection of black ops hot drops i mean if most of the defence will be in choke systems and the main home systems ripe with carebears this could lead to some interesting developments well atleast for small time pirates who base out of faction 00 spacei dont think removing all jb is the solution but perhaps making it so you cant deploy a jb in a constilation that has upgraded systems the ones that get 2 sanctums and havens running all the time could be an interesting solution
yay more afk cloakers to gank people before a defence fleet can reacti severely dislike all the instant cyno drops all over the place its already bad enough with rapid deployment all over the place with titans fly around in a small roaming gang get dropped by bridge were trying to reduce this problem here not further augment ita proper bo boost would resolve around their ewar capabilities and combat usefulness probably even giving them carrieralike abilities for longer deployment out in deep space instead of just even more bridging crap they suck as combat ships for their survivability and cost increasing their bridging ability doesnt change that by the way if were going the way of encouraging local production in 00 there must be a way to either keep a resource acquisition operation highly mobile or able to properly lock down and secure systems otherwise the opportunity cost will be too high again and importing will still be the standard modus operandi covert operations as a form of area denial are fine as long as there are countermeasures against the disproportional time investment required to secure industrial operations
the entire situation of 00 warfare needs to be looked at to quote a september 2009 devblog the sentences referencing the evils of the old sovereignty system are equally applicable to its current replacement there is a lot of damage that has been done by releasing the system and not iterating upon it iteration is pretty much a dirty word in this community anymore and is not an acceptable routeif we and ccp are going to fix whats wrong with eve those fixes needs to be delivered in a whole and playable state from the getgo under her current task masters i dont think many eve features will get the go ahead for further iteration once theyre running on tranquilityit is indeed worth pointing out that jump bridges are a big part of an existing problem with 00s game design in my view they need to be removed as they are a major enabler of the worst wrong in 00 the ease of force projection removing all those bridges is a good potential portion of an overarching solution to the games ailments but its definitely no silver bullet
if i wanted to hold space i would join an alliance or be in one i see your points but moving by yourself with pod jumping or having multiple characters is a big difference from moving in a big coordinated fleetblob and although your example with 3 chars within 3 months is perfectly within reach of most people it would be interesting to see how many of thoose in a 200 drake fleet actually had 2 backup drake pilots waiting in another spot for some actioni dont think a smaller entity can displace another small entity up north as long as the coalition is there to back it up on the other side i dont think any entity would have a problem to hold sov without jumpbridges but i think they would have problems controlling large amounts of space if they dont actually use itwhat a removal of jumpbridges or redesign of jumpbridges could do is increase the reaction time of reinforcement or coordinated move of bigger fleetsexample you have fleet a in cloud ring shooting stuff you are just about to wrap up and reports come inn that someone is shooting youryour alliance stuff in geminate with bridges its not a big deal to move your fleet over there to reeinforce the defence or completely outblob the opponent without bridges you would either have to jump the old way or use titans and cynochains to get there or podjumplog on another char that is closerand i have been up north fighting nc and know that peeps dont jump through normal gates unless they absolutely have to to be fair that goes with every allianceccp could alter the jumpbridge mechanics put a cap on how many could jump in amount of time like mass vs time they could make the bridges hold less fuel so you would need to refuel more often make it so any cap ship with a jumpdrive itself could not use the jump bridge etcthere is a lot of ways to tweak it personally i would either see the bridges burned to the ground or moved away from the cover of poss and a complete denial of service for any cap ship
i think the point is that if you have less time for good fight you and others will have to make choices between that and maintaining your industry with the requirements of additional logistics for nullsec alliances forces will be redirected to managing and maintaining routes to highsec forces will be required to pull back from the front lines less their sovereignity be brought down by shortages elsewhere and sovereignity takeover attempts and defense will be slowed down by additional logistical requirementslowsec pirate corps will again have the means to increase income by trapping and destroying nullsec vessels transporting valuable materials to highsec markets they will then be able to increase their operations and become a greater problem for nullsec alliances
well that ultimately boils down to running a coordinated campaign mittens has recently written a wall of text on the topic of choices if you give people a clear goal to work towards train for a maelstrom or in my example train three characters for drakes and move one of them to x and one of them to y theyll do it
one of the things that always atracted me to 00 big alliances was the fact that home defence would always tell me when a incomming gang was comming and all i had to do was either dock up or fly to a safe pos switch ships and join the gang i personally think that a there needs in tandum a afk cloaker nerf whith a bo boost to thier combat ability and a 00 local delay would be the best thing for 00 as it stands one podder can make way too much isk in a day doing sanctums me i can pull in over 300 million in a day and over a billion if i scan out some 810 or 1010 complexes making farming more dangerous is a good thingthe thing to is if you take away force projection via jb or titans you limit the home field defence boost basically forces like the nc which your a member of usually win a long term warfight because they are able to reinforce thier troops at a greater capacity then invading forces this is usually because of jb but if you removed jbs from core systems because they are fully upgraded then re supplying your forces would be much more difficultfuthermore there are already too many positive reasons to live in 00 and high sec but not nearly enough to live in low sec if you boosted 00 ability to get low end mins then you would never see a resurection of low sec
gee thanks for reminding me that the hilarious ease of force projection to hold vast tracts of space and defend it easily is one of the reasons why the nc can repel serious threats all over the place i would have never thought that making that harder would make this hardercould it be that this is the entire point of why i want force projection to be harder
one thing people really annoy me about the debate over jblogistic going to be a nightmare no it wont you have titian and jump freighters i use too move freighter around in 00 with a large team of scouts to be honest it was scary with billion in the hold but it was work and so what it was part of the game now what worrys me here is i starting to hear and see this more i pay 15 a month i shouldnt work for it bull crap you do everything in eve requires effort as a corpteam now jb seems to making so easy i see we heading to the wow effect easy  more fun yer lack of risk thats for sure also you want to join a big fight well get in a fleet and have titian bridge you there if you really need to help your friends i been away from 00 for 2 year come back and it really is easy to live in 00 little too easy that i go on roams and you hardly catch someone now  boring look at the nc map it proves that 00 is easy hell you have ihubs to upgrade for mining and ratting you can drop station everywhere and refine build and sell else where answer too that escort or jump freighter
yes so make it so any core system constliations cant deploy a jb ones that are fully upgraded 5 systems  that way if there is a cyno jammer you cant bring in more caps and you have to bring in conventional forces via star gates unless the jammer is down right now being able to bring in more ships while the jammer is up is a clear advantage that should be taken away i mean one of the problems for me back in the frege days a time before jbs was that i would have to fly large amounts stargate to 1 get to my home system 2 find any fightshaving a jb network that can get me to lets say 56 jumps from where i am going is still a better option then having to fly 30 plus jumps
i dont know of any jbs that go into npc 00 low sec or high sec there is no easy mode ask the logistical pilots in said big alliances they already give up so much to satisfy my need to fight as well as others what this is going to essential do is make life and this game a terrible burden on their rls and that is not what a game should do i know people that stay in fleets for like 6 hrs clearing towers or removing threats from our places of operation and yet this game needs to be more time consuming really
i havent read all the replies but most people have focused on jump bridges but a careful and thoughtful reading of the linked document shows that the range of nerfs could be substantial as in all of the followingjump freightersfreighterstitan bridgesjump bridgesto quote ccp greyscalein other words it is possible that all of the 4 items above could be gone from the game now that is the most extreme outcome but from reading the document it has a nonzero probabilityor not while rapid deployment might be an issue having a large group of allies you can call up might be even more valuable sure it will take them longer to get there but when they do theyll be there for a very long timethe dynamic in this game is to induce lag in contesting 00 we all complain about it but in the end we all do things to ensure that there will be lag if ccp tinkers around so that we can get 500 people in a system and fight lag free we move in with 750 or 1000 move the limit up to 1000 and soon we have well over 1000 its an arms race if you willno amount of fcking around on the edges of the way 00 life works will change this dynamic people living deeper in 00 will have a stronger incentive to blue those between their space and empire to help secure their supply lines being able to call up a blob even if it arrives later than currently will still be desirablemaybe even more soserious question have any of the dipshts who work on this game and part their fat aes on the csm ever spent any time at all looking at game theory do you even know what a nash equilibrium is blobbinglag appears to be a very strong one so much so that any attempt to get away from it might be futile
or in simple terms csm can go to ing hella cyno spool up ok a get it but a frekin 30 second spool up means your cyno ship better be a in carrier itself unless you want it dead cyno on the field means people are gunna want to run or fight nothing was more awesom than dropping scs onto the heads of invadersb titan bridging has to remain specific to titans otherwise you might as well make them 10 isk a titandredrorqual it can fit a clone vat bay mindlinks xl guns and the new dd basically you say a supercap is a i win button bull a titan is an i win button and even now they are getting swamped and taken downc scs shouldnt be nerfed they are dying just fine you nerf them and were gunna see ing 2000 man battles of drakemale blobs or a crash in the market for minerals i want my 20bil isk back if your gunna think about touching my wyvernd bot miners get rid of them simple ccp throws them to the side and says well deal with it well you better deal with it soon i used to be able to actually mine ice and make a killing now we got bot miners in mackinraws that undock in blobs of 2030 with an orcalinks in a safe spot and they just sit there and  up the markettldrcsm pull your head out of your ass and get to know your playerswho the  even let 7 year olds on the csmbring back ccp claw
wow youre dumb
thank youmy little way of venting rage di personally believe it all can be linked to bot miners
whats the point of fighting to win territory if you cant fortify it and build resources available to only those that control it jump bridges are player built stargates private owned and maintainedi hear the reasons that some people dont like them but i dont hear anything prosper to replace them with alternativewarfare isnt just about a squirmish that lasts a few hours its about about amassing industrial might logistics politics of geography and many other things that have been reflected pretty well in the gamehow you fly a ship or the experience of a fight is only one part of the game and it doesnt make much sense to me to try to improve it at the expense of other types of pvp that take months to develop and might be more like pvp in sid meyers civilization
i guess you havent been playing eve long enough let me explain i use to do logistic in 00 as well and all i had was escorts in a normal freighter we plan a day to move it like a fleet op i dont see a real reason why this is a nightmare on logistics when you have 1 titian to bridge to low sec 2 jump freighter to jump to low sec you still can jump passed the gate camps so i really dont understand how it can be a nightmare i mean if a corporation is unable to deal with logistic in 00 then you should not live in 00 if you nor smart enough to plan ahead jbs are a easy ride and titans can be used for fleets their no real argument because people just love the fact their is low risk traveling in 00 i hate large fleets but i love roams and too be honest roaming sucks balls because of jbs unless the region is a war zone like fountain i hear people say we need to get to a fight quick again titans i mean if the alliance going to send a fleet to help an ally use a freaking titian we have plenty going around in eve
im going to say something very true but something most of you will refuse to believethese changes dont scare you because they will limit your play time or limit your pvp instances these changes scare you because you will lose engagements morethese proposed changes will actually encourage instances of pvp far more than are encouraged atm both attackers and defenders of convoys will benefit from the pvp instances provided by these changes the loudest voices against this come from itnc and from my experiance these are alliances which believe in not scouting their logistics chains and not engaging without completely overwhelming odds changing logistics back to the days were as was intended people would have to work in groups to move things would encourage players to actually play this game and that scares a lot of you because you arnt used to playing and in turn losing you are so used to either being completely safe in your journeys or being able to call a 1k man gang from 60 jumps away to join you in massacring a 100man gang in a matter of minsits time that people realised that logistics are a part of this game they arnt a boring part either besides how would you know most of you didnt live through the old days
highsec carebearthat makes it so that there will be more engagements screw logistics as stated if you cant handle logistics gtfo of null its the capital nerfs that are going to effect people we will see more stratigic capital positioning people wont leroy it in if it takes 10 seconds to cyno out usually if u see someone appear on your overview you can cyno out if it takes 10 seconds your gunna be pointed before you can get to warpi think ill hang around this thread and watch it
if the goal is to try to chip away at mega nap etc instead of eliminating jump bridge id start first with the standings functionthis is a game and of course you tweak the rules and dynamics to create game play not everything needs to make exact senseif you only allowed a corporation to set two other corporations above neutral and maybe only two red youd cause all sorts of chaos for larger groups change jump bridges to only work for people actually blue to the owning corporationrestrict corp membership to 250 members restrict alliances to three corpsyou wouldnt restrict players from making agreements yet youd deny them the in game tools making it so easyit would leed to huge numbers of friendly fire episodes noses bent out of shape when a corp didnt get on smothers limited friend list etcyou could still help each other in battle sorting by corp name etc but the bigger the blob and the grater you out numbered the others the more times youd hit yourownlimitting jumpbridge use to the limited number of blues a corp had eliminates pilots access to as vast sweepsjust a start there of a better way of reducing the negative aspects greatly while keeping the interesting aspects of the politics and logistics wrapped up in them
since my post wasnt a troll and you made a good point then perhaps the opposite nerf highsec slots by the 30 lowsec by 15 and leave 00 the way it is leaving pos the same as ever this would make highsec pos manufacturing competitive and perhaps there will be big wars waged over highsec moons
if force projection is the issue that needs solving but in doing so we hit basic logistics gotta have that toilet paper in time then a solution like that proposed by the mm guy sorry cant remember and too lazy is near perfectrestrict bridge networks to industrial ships haulers transports ore freighterswe can go even further and add a mineral compression module for poss or outposts plus allow transports and even jfs to haul compressed materialsmilitary projection is already being handled quite handily by titans although the range with which they can do it is questionablelimiting range ex swap bridge range with bo or adding some sort of delay to the cyno mechanics could both help alleviate the force projection partit would negatively impact ratters that habitually rat a bazillion jumps from their base of operation but not a lot of sympathy for creatures of luxury like that from me
or you could light up multiple cynos objective division  blob divison
this topic and csm repport over 8 pages of blah blah about jump bridges i read them all and this question comes up in mi mind right nowis the removal of jump bridges changing anything about risk vs reward making carebears or new players and old 00 digs come in to lownull  cant see how after all these postsis there any comment from ccp crowd that makes us think that changes will be made in this or that direction and talking about nerfsboosts blah blah blah noi cant see how how these sumits are an answer to all players expectations i see them more like one way to keep people busy in the forum with speculations while they are doing the opositedid you read something from them sayin well our position about this issue or opinion is blah blah blah no you cant just dipplomatic words to make more noise with forum threads
anyone who thinks hopes ccp will remove jump bridges and do nothing else to balance other issues that deal with power blocks logistics and sov is a foolwhat needs to happen now is some creative thinking by the player base csm and ultimately ccpsome issues that players have about it is minerals we all would love to be able to be self sufficient deep into 00 but the obvious facts are some regions are laced with limitless money opportunities while others are absolute utter  those crap regions have options though they can be upgraded in a variety of ways military upgrades so you can run sanctums 237 is not your only optionthe industrial upgrade provides a way for you to get the minerals you need to survive out there there is also wormhole upgrades to open up ways to possibly get quickly to empire or other parts of the university to get your pvp rocks off some upgrade to do miniprofessions but i have no clue what they are talking about reallynow before you go raging about how you can make a lot more money running sanctums instead of mining consider the fact that those minerals will be a lot more valuable if they dont have to compete with jita prices way out in the far reaches of 00 now if the tables or minerals available is not up to what it needs to be then ccp can make adjustments the bottom line is you dont have to suck jitas tit to get the minerals you need to surviveof course all this fun mining will draw attention and brace yourselves you might actually need some protection doing it dont let some lone afk  ass cloaker get the best of you and shut down your whole mining operation maybe this means a boost for durability for mining ships more things to consider also dont forget it may result is some bad guys coming to shut the operation down and viola you got pvp on your hands and you didnt have to fly those pesky 30 jumps everyone was complaining about to get those good fightsstatic moon goo needs to be done away with too how is up for debate as well of course i expect every entity that is currently lapping up the moon goo to rage completely at this idea after all they fought long and hard to get it its not like it was just tossed on their lap in their already fortified power block right anyways in order to pull off removing static moon goo it most likely would required a pos overhaul im sure no one would miss the current nightmare we have todayother things would deal with super caps and capitals in general lowering their jump range cyno spool up timers remove titan jump bridge as well all of these things need to be consideredlets not forget about how sov works i believe alliances should be allowed to have those great friends if they want but where is the balance in that i believe it should not be possible to get a system sov level to level 5 unless all adjacent systems are under your alliances sov blue or not alliance borders should be vulnerable and players should patrol and such to keep it secure no more afk secure stuff again my opinion of one of the things that can be doneall in all there is a dozen thing that can be adjusted to make 00 a lot more exciting than the mess it is right now so now is the time to start thinking of reasonable changes that would help
dear ccp and csmthe law of unintended consequences states that if you remove jumpbridgesthen people will just use titan bridges and if you remove titan bridges titans become mere overpriced dreadnaughtsbut of course perhaps you want things to be that waytldr forcing people to change their behavior through game mechanics hasnt really worked well in the past and wont work now people are drawn to the easiest solution to a problemthough i admit a reduction in jumpbridge range would be an interesting ideaas an aside to dear greyscale i have lived in and out of 00 the last couple years and i have yet to see a dime of moongoo money why because all moons worth having are currently under the hand of large alliances leadership groups regular players never see any money from moons because everyone knows where to find the good stuff and the group with more firepower almost inevitably ends up controlling the moon
which is why removing the static part of static moon goo needs to happen along with other things like removing jump bridges and stop with the bull over priced dreadnought line even if they removed the jump bridge ability from titans or changed it so it was forced jumped at the end of its bridge to the destination it is still very powerful
titans are not overpriced they are in every single way better than dreads not just a straight upgrade but an incredibly superior one limiting their bridging ability wont nerf them in any meaningful capacity
do it you had the balls to nuke learning skills finally after 3 years nuke the jump bridges all of them after all we have jump freighters for a reason and i am not sure about titans
this without jump bridges 00 would become even more carebear land no one would travel anywhere so null space would be even safer just because of the fact that it is huge and mostly emptyyou like those shiny faction modules and ships im sorry im not going to run gates to bring them back to jita to sell them you want that dread guristas module you come out to null sec to get iti play this game to have fun not to jump gates all day thats not fun
you are either really stupid or wait nvm
say whatever you want removing jump bridges will only make the space i fly safer which sucks for me because i play eve for pvp not ratting some small alliance isnt going to be able to move in near the current alliances with or without bridges theyd still get stomped on  if for no other reason than there wasnt much else to shoot
when i first heard that the csm was discussing this i thought it was a horrible idea and that they are idiots for even bringing it up now that i have thought it over for a few days i think it might not necessarily be a bad thing so long as the correct provisions are set in place i have never really understood jump bridges anyway they are basically player made stargates but dont look or act like a stargatejust function as one they dont really make much sense once i got to thinking about it logistically they are a necessity at the moment they provide a safer and shorter means of transport for those in deep nullsec to get to empire in a reasonable amount of time i cant imagine having to go back to the old methodbut if something else is put in place to make the transition easier then so be itan ideathe sansha have the ability to create artificial wormholes and travel great distances with themwhy cant we steal that tech and retrofit it to be used by the pod pilots i dont believe something as powerful as this should be allowed to be used on any shipbut perhaps by a station module or maybe a special kind of gate that has to be anchored around a planet like a station
cynos
my understanding was that the sansha wormholes cover a much greater distance and stay open almost indefinately until they are destroyed an extremely expensive and destroyable wormhole generator would be cool i know jbs can be destroyed but they are tied to a pos typically and are easily defended not to mention too easy to install in a system a station that can make a wormhole capable of jumping 10 systems would be extremely expensive to buildtake a long time to build and be destroyed easier they wouldnt be in every system like the current jb systemthere would be maybe 3 per region and just like the current jb system can only go to a specific point on the other end this would require two of these to be built to make the connection and both would have to be protected to keep enemies from blowing em up make another limitation of only allowing 1 within a 5 system range of each other that way you cant have them all over the freaking place
could actually be a very interesting thing to explorereplacing current bridges with bidirectional wormholes could not only alleviate all the issues that a jb removal might cause but introduce some new griefing aspectstwo types would be required  one short lived but mass restricted worm for the impromptu logistics run enough for a few freighters or mass equivalent gang or so one longer lived mass unlimited worm for mass movements but chaining them everywhere could potentially open up the heartland to enemies bidirectional remember  both types are tethered to cyno field at end pointif the generation of them is to be tied to a structure id suggest using outposts as it limits availability and encourages erecting stations if only to ease access to the assend of ones turf
remove jb really csm you all suck if you unanimously agreed on that
i am old enough to remember 00 before jump bridges and i can assure you that it was very lively there was lots of traffic  more than there is now even tho there was less people per system there was a lot of small scale activityif anything 00 has become more carebear now that it has ever beenjump bridges super safe logistics  these things are there to make carebearing easy that was the whole purpose behind the original idea  make 00 saferemoving jump bridges would be a move toward hardcore pvp away from carebearism  by definition of course i can understand that there are a lot of 00 residents who got fat slow and lazy and would cry if they had to return to tougher life well sometimes a little exercise is good for you youll be glad for it in the long run
yes finally fully support the removal of jump bridge networks pos cyno beacons in an upgraded systems can stay
you sir nailed it right on the money people got lazy
removing jump bridges will prevent smaller corps from holding territoryit therefore benefits larger corpsalliances with more mature infrastructurelogistical capabilitiesperhaps a limitation of the capability of jump bridges would solve any problems they create rather than just removing them
removing jump bridges would actually just exacerbate the stagnant state of much of sovereign 00heres my take on what would actually happen if ccp removed jump bridges1 the sovereign nulsec economies would go up these economies depend on both imported minerals but also tech 2 blueprint copies for those of us without bpos or the datacores required to invent t2 blueprints those datacores only being seeded through research agents in npc space2 the price of minerals in sovereign nulsec would skyrocket increased difficulty importing highcompression goods would vastly restrict the mineral supply unless a major redistribution of resource potential was undertaken as well3 the price of ships ammunition and fittings in sovereign nulsec would skyrocket expect to see prices 50100 higher than nonhub empire as standard on most items thanks to 2 despite this price increase the profiteffort ratio of production in sovereign nulsec would likely decrease discouraging more people from entering the marketplace4 smallscale pvp would be reduced due to increased costs pilots will have to spend more time earning isk than looking for fights timefun ratio takes a beating here pilots in their home regions would also no longer be able to use jump bridges to reach an advantageous point skipping part of a pipe to get ahead of a gang making it much easier for fights to be avoided simply have ships that align faster5 largescale pvp would shrivel between the increased ship costs and the logistical difficulty of shifting large numbers of pilots only brushfires on the borders of alliance space would be fought not largescale invasions no more having two massive fleets crash into each other disengage and then wheel about to clash in another part of a region an hour later fewer blockbuster regiondefining battles6 power blocks will become more entrenched not less the increased cost of conflict will only encourage alliances to be on good behaviour with their immediate neighbours to protect their now even more important iskmaking apparatus furthermore and more relevant is that the current sovereignty mechanics require massive fleets hindering the mobility of said fleets would make it near impossible to flip sovereignty in a system unless your enemy alliance didnt log in for a week or two 7 many of the people who reside in sovereign nulsec will lose their passion for the game for these people the joy of the game isnt in the awful game mechanics or the subpar performance of the client or grinding away enough missions to get a shiny implant from an lp store for these people the fun of the game is conflict on a massive scale the ability to craft a narrative through player actions and to see that narrative play out through hundreds or thousands of actors having a shrewd political decision switch the side of hundreds of pilots or having a titanbridge welp leave an entire fleet hideously out of position for tens of thousands of eve players that is the game massive conflict without the ability to project power on a grandiose scale you end up with a handful of small petty wars with no grand goals no grand scale and most importantly with no grand storyfinally eve is already a very time consuming game the current state of nulsec logistics while not perfect allows the people who enjoy logistics to do what they love while also allowing the people who dont want to throw away their spare time dragging items around in a computer world to get on with their part of the gameit seems from reading this thread that most of the people supporting the potential removal of jump bridges have little if any experience doing largescale nulsec logistics
lazy this is a video game it is supposed to be fun not mindnumbing work which is what jumping 2030 jumps really is i prefer to be paid to do mindnumbing work and would rather not have to pay to do it
its funny that the nc complain about this i mean their jumpbridge network is only 9 regions small
hey look a thread with a bunch of people that dont know what theyre talking aboutstart shooting blues
id support crippling bridges so only a fixed amount of traffic can use them over a given period of time this opens up all sorts of possibilitieslimit mass throughput per hourlimit jumps per hourrestrict to particular classes of shipadd spinupcooldown timesrandom failures with increasing frequency and severity relative to the number of jumps in the last hourincluding misdirection to neighbouring solar systemsconstellationsregionsor even wormholes if youre really unluckymake them much easier to incapacitate so small gangs can disable themmake them cheaper and allow parallel routes if the owners really want to build a lot of infrastructure targetsthe only factor in balancing their use at present is a fuel cost and balancing things by cost alone has never worked out very well
ive been in a number of different alliances most have been at odds with the nc i am definitely not a spokesperson for the nc honestly i think the nc is rather bloated however if you want to fix that enemies have to be able to strike deep inside the nc you arent going to convince the nc to turn on each other by getting rid of their ability to project force the nc has way too many carebears pvp is only done to protect the space the nc has the nc would absolutely love no bridges as they would see an enemy fleet coming for the hour or more it took for it to actually get somewhere dont forget spies everywhere and be sitting there waiting for them much like they already do the bridges are the only way to create an element of surprise in that once the attacking fleet is formed it can relatively quickly move to attack anywhere
in theory the change removed jump bridges nerf to all the jump capable ships maybe even a nerf to freighters should encourage 00 alliance not only to break up but to create an industrial wing in 00 so that they could build all the needed stuff therethe dream is to see real players mining in 00 to support the industrial activities of the alliance instead of bringing compressed minerals from high sec players building in 00 the stuff they need and so on naturally some small detail is missing for example how people will produce meta items that arent dropped by the local rats how people should go around building t2 in 00 bring the datacores from empire space buy the available t2 bpo buy in jita the t2 components you cant manifacture locally because you dont control the right moons and how they should go around selling the moon goo products they have in excess a possible counter move by large nap trains would be to select some 00 station as common trading hubs where they will exchange the different productsin that scenario the group of blue alliances will become even more tightly knitted together instead of fracturing as they will have an interest in keeping the multi alliance trading hubs operative and well protected at the center of the blue territory
that doesnt already happen to a certain extenti can name 2 nc hubs off the top of my head i was at one yesterday picking up a couple skillbooks that prior to being in the nc i wouldve never expected to be able to buy in null sec
this statement is so ing stupid6000 people rapidly descending upon a small alliance of 100 who just setup shop 4 regions away and stamping them out of existence is what is keeping small corpsalliance from holding territory not because they couldnt setup a jump bridgelets see this from a small entities perspectiveoption 1 if left along long enough to gain the sov level we can put up a jump bridge to ease our logistics at the same time because of jump bridges a power block of possible 22k can decent upon our medium tower and blow it into atoms in a matter of a couple minutes whenever the mood strikes themoption 2 without a jump bridge our logistics will be much more difficult we will have to rely on jump freighters blockade runners with covert ops cloak black ops covert jump bridge to get the blockade runners around gate camps possible shortcuts thru wormhole space upgrading a system with the mining upgrade so we can get all the ore we need to build ships reprocess the modules from rattingplexinganomolies to get minerals we cant mine etc but with jump bridges gone we dont have to worry about a large power block getting here in 5 minutes just to vaporize our pos and operation for the lulz because we are more than 10 minutes away for their entire coalition to form up and take the gates here any immediate threats will be of a much much smaller force something we could possibly handle instead of 1000 vs 100 of usnow what in the  option do you think they would rather have which one would give them a better chance in 00 without being part of a power block and yes if your a renter your part of the power block your just paying for friendsand again there is a lot of other things that can be adjusted to improve mining pos work moon goo etc now is the time to discuss those instead of just being super focused on this one item if we dont then 6 months will go by and because nothing else was hammered out ccp just might do the easy right click and delete without doing anything you all so fearits time for everyone to wake up smell the cake and get back in shape and stop being lazy you dont want to be bored to tears doing the boring  you would need to do without jump bridges well what aspects about said boring  could be changed to make it a lot more interestingno im not about to mine ing ice or whatever rock is fotm no matter how exciting it is with it dripping  in 3d with endless cake being feed to me i would rather be blowing up someones ship but in if something can be done to make it more lively then im all for putting whatever effort it takes to get it there for my fellow eve pilotso forget about the jump bridges pretend they will be gone no matter what what ideas no matter how small would you suggest to keep the game fun instead of sucks balls gosuggestions below this line8d
i have been out of 00 for a long time but i am not too surprisedfor me it is a sign of good empire building for most pvpers probably it is a sign of things becoming soft and who will mine the minerals for your shipsin your nice dream universe have you ever thought about the little problem that you will have to spend time protecting the miners after the ease of transportation from empire has been removedor you think you will be only the guy that will have the fun to kill the miners never the one that will have hours of guard duty defending them
removing jump bridges will favour corps with more mature logistical capability
most of the minerals come from high sec empire half from botters half from countless level 34 mission runners who refine their lootmost 00 alliances just buy minerals in empire and bridge them to their little outposts why bother mining in 00
never used one i support them going away
i have no problem defending miners if invaders come then it will be pvp time what i wanted to begin withor i could just pay more for my stuff because i cant be bothered to do guard duty it all really comes down to supply and demand if i have the mentality of not wanting to spend time going the grocery store to buy my own food prep the food and cook it in order to actually eat well then i will be paying more to eat out and order delivery i get more time on my hands but at a cost right now using the current situation in 00 eating out and ordering delivery is vastly cheaper than going to the grocery store to do it all yourselfthat is completely backwards and unbalanced dont you thinkremoving jump bridges will favour corps with more mature logistical capabilitywhy you shrink my line bro also so you have any suggestions to put under the flaccid line
skynetreality is no matter how much ccp tries the menial grind work will be dominated by bots its just going to happen as long as it happens there will always be materials in 44 to build me a new ship
they dont exist why would they when you can bridge stuff around people have all but forgotten the old ways the way of freighter escort opsthe blob entities will have an easier time insofar as they can roll really heavy when escorting but casualties will be high for both old and young
fine ill go first change the pos refiner so it is possible to get 100 yield just like when refining ice at the pos introduce something like chemistryalchemyweird science  so that it is possible to combine certain ores and some chemical reaction would yield some other ore not native to your area but with a heavy lossie  i did a reaction that combined 10 different high end ores and produced 1 other high end ore increase mining barge survivability with more ehp so they can last a while for defenders to engage the attackers introduce the ability to hack pos silos to nibble a bit from what is inside possible from a covert ops ship with the hacker module or something amount nibbled is dependent on average traffic in system per day the more traffic the less nibbled if it is an afk tech moon that no one bothers to come in system except to empty it every couple weeks and the traffic is all but nonexistent then the amount nibbled would be lucrative any total amount nibbled throughout the day should be no more than 10 of what it mined hacker can only hack a specific silo once per day subject to it failing based on skills if hack fails then you are decloaked and it is probably time to gtfo
am i being trolledeve is a boring as hell game to play because of travel and logistics taking out jump bridges or limiting capital ship ranges would just make it worsedont shoot yourself in the foot ccpwhile we are at it why dont we take a vote on removing freighters and jump freighters from the game that should go even further in making the game unplayableedit where the hell is the downvote button

issue with combat in stations you cant get to your clone when you get podded in a pod some jove system sends needle and toxin into your brain before you actually die yes the pod kills you not the enemy  p and takes a snapshot of the neural activity  this explains the re spawn mechanic of eve if you die out of that safe little pod guess what you dont get downloaded into a new body you die meaning you must make a new character maybe inherit the last guys stuff but you have to retrain all those many many skillsso if you want allow some guy with a gun to splatter your brains and have you loose months to years worth of skill training then support this topic but i prefer not to have such a thing maybe hand to hand combat so i can knock the bastard out and steal his isk card p or the key to his ship
yet agaaaaaain fiction does not determine mechanics and especially not good mechanics tomorrow ccp could decide that the actual brain scanner is the size of a penny or just say a wizard did it and we can med clone to day nothing of the fact that some official fiction already says you can cone even outside of a pod
no thanks theres a time to play and a time to dock up and go to sleep no particular desire to wake up log on only to be immediately suicide ganked in stationthats the problem with you socalled pirates isnt it its not the carebears who want it easy but you otherwise you wouldnt be incessantly whining about wanting more easy prey man up already and go shoot someone in lowsec oh wait you might lose there
one shard and its based in iceland 200 ping barely able to keep up with mmo style combat oop look at the time must dashyou could make 8 in combination with 4 obv instanced and matched only against people with a decent ping and ill support that contingent on there being no mmo rubbish about trained skills improving weapon accuracy  rof  magazine size  hit points make it about player skill also strap in for the myg0t invasion dont make it a crappy kotorswol knock off if i want to play a futuristic isometric thing with one click combat ill play fallout 9 is really distracting from what the devs should be doing so im not supportive use eve as a testbed for your wid engine sure go nuts distract from making actual spaceships online content not so muchif you can somehow make a single shard per station fps thingy with notgodawful lag and killable npcs including the station police forces id be on board until then no
read please apsidia last post a bit other idea there is described how it to youif to follow the idea described by apsidia to you threatens nothing and you can easy sleep if you will not fall asleep with pushed button w on the keypboard and you will not reach the airlock big shreder or something threatyif you stay in dock in a pod  threatens is zero too
i didnt read the entire topic but heres how i would see it note that it is securityheavy as there is no real need to exit your ship and if ganking is too easy no one willcaptainss quarters safe even if you can invite someone there any weapons would be greyed out as your scanners would notice anything dangerous and be left outsidemain deck the deck that connects to hangar this deck is the safest one and holds the station facilities and the most expensive stores to rent the security here depends on the security level of the system but in general unholstering any weapons will result in quick as in 1 sec enough for a single shot webifying fines confiscation of all weapons carried and ss loss firing a weapon here gives a massive ss loss in addition to the previous and concordstyle retaliation also pilots with 5 or lower status will not be able to enter this area in this area you should be able to gank someone in a group if you are really determined but it should be penalizing enough to make ganking a random passerby not worth the trouble no shooting at war targetshigh security decks same as above but the reaction time for law enforcement will be little lower 35 seconds enough for a few rounds of ammo ganking in this area should still require a small group of coordinated people to pull it off successfully and in general make it not worth the hassle to shoot random peoplelow security decks the security is more sparse in here and will respond in around 810 seconds meaning a gank could be done with just a couple of people walking with an unconcealed weapon isnt a crime anymore the penalties for ganking will still apply they could be lessened a bit though because of corruption and such as the station management wouldnt want explosive decompression and a hefty repair bill for some badly placed shot the reason for keeping the concord here is so that these decks will not become a wasteland like low sec is now shooting war targets could be considered legal here after all any damage done to the station could be billed from your corporationlawless decks the decks so far from anything that has any value or with extrareinforced walls in the case of lownullsec that they are not regularily guarded no rules but an occasional security patrol will pass trough every now and then they will respond to nearby weapons fire and can be killed though firing at the security will spawn several patrols looking for the offenders and responding to weapons fire usually they will also guard the elevator shafts to prevent the aggressors from easily escapingas for the general station configuration all stations in empire has a main and at least one low security deck even in 10 to let the low security people get out of their pods in general the higher security systems should have more high security decks than lowsec systems the actual number of decks will be left to ccp depending the deck size and traffic experienced by that station the decks will have a clear indication of what security status it has either as big bold letters next to the elevator colour coding or in the gui like when in spaceon equipment players should have defensive equipment to prevent the surprise youre dead situation shields armour jovesansha body regeneration or whatever stronger variants could be left usable only in low security decks if deemed too difficult to penetrate in high security walking around in a heavy battle armour could be considered as a plan to cause havoc after all customizing these to counter specific weapons would add more variety than just seeing who has the biggest pool of numberslikewise the weapons should have more than just 1 type of projectiles blasters and lasers also include rare and illegally modified variants limiting the higher security to conceable weapons only while letting people carry rifles in low security could add variety to areas
mhm nanodisassembler grenade  on permadeath note it shouldnt happen jump clones allow for nonlethal transfers which means every time pilots leave pod they get a save point
bar maybe the very serious and huge security guard takes away the weapon here again fight by fists and feet is possible only add for lawless decksillegal weapon and other criminal items can be trade here by npc or playersexclusive missions for pirateplayers ss 5 and lower can be found here

make it only gate cloak and cov ops cloak and i will gladly support
you are no actually doing anything you are telling the module to behave in a certain way after you uncloak makes all the sense in the world
i will support this so long as the overheat penalty is increased by 500 while cloaked it should fry your module in seconds
and null still bugs me i want proper longerrange ammo blaster tracking is really obvious blasters have half the range of autocanons and same tracking obviously if you half the range you need to double the tracking so they can track same targets not rocket science its like giving same tracking to arties and autocanons
so half the job is done the other half would be proposing to ccp that this team be made perpetual
just some thought regarding current large scale battle in 00not so interesting for base pilots you follow fc order you play until you become primary target then you rush for another shipbattles are often won by the side aligning the larger fleetlarge fleets tend to limit ship types to ease leadership which lower tactical effect of different ships only drakes and scimitar for instancelarge fleets create huge lagafter discussing with many players everyone just love looking at alliance tournament because of small engagement 1 pilot using his ship perfectly can change the outcome of the fight and because of diversity what types of ship will they align and how they interact together to form a wellbalanced groupi propose to completely redesign the fleet concept in order togive more responsibility for each pilotgive more importance to the fleet composition preparation of the battletry to stop very large fleet size which is the main cause of lag when fightingthis is mainly done by reducing the number of ships in a fleethere are my propositions to achieve thisreplace the pilot fleet limit by a fleet command limitfleet command limit is influenced by fc leadership skillseach ship type receive a fleet command weightsum of all ship fleet command weight within a fleet cannot exceed the flee command limitfleet command weight is bigger for bigger ship idea is to have fleet with no more than 15 bs sized ships for instance taking the volume or mass of a ship to get its fleet command weight might be a first settings to investigatewhen create a fleet the fleet commander has the option prepare his fleet composition by asking for specific ships 3 drakes a vulture 2 scimitar or asking for specific ship role 3 interceptors 1 titanwhen a pilot join a fleet either the fleet has no composition either the pilot fly one of the ships part of the composition which reserves the dedicated slot for himof course this will not stop alliance to formup 10 fleets and play together but this will make the coordination of these fleets more difficult you cannot warp or anchor the same guy which will naturally force alliance leader to adapt and create new way of fightingthis will certainly force alliance to spread their forces and try to build balanced fleet groups with complementary shipsthis will also force fleet leader to think differently do i prefer 1 drake or 2 cerberus  a frigate sized ship of course you can create a full dps fleet with no support but its role and engagement will then need to be carefully plannedi know its a little strange proposition in the neverending i want to have larger fleet request but i think this might really add more strategy on fleet leader hands give more responsibilities to pilots within the fleet and more over limit the number of ships fighting on the same place thus reducing lag issue i dont know if this kind of proposition has ever been made let me know what you think about thisregardsjean leborgne
i just seemed a shame to leave something so cool get so little use
only if when incarna finally gets here we can mount the heads of the corpses weve collected on the walls of our private quarters

supported would be better if they didnt release incarna at all though imo 
i admire your patiance and understand your stance towards the subjectpersonally i too would like to see them constantly tweak the spaceship part of evebaring in mind that incarna is actually an expansion planned pretty much since the start of eve where oveur said at the first fanfest that the issue with walking in stations would be what to do with it how to incoprorate it into the grand design of eve i am looking forward to see eve expandi just hope that these expansions mean that eve grows as a whole and not that its a shift in focus
that would indeed limit the usefulness of this proposal if we could transport our own ships it might not be necessary for this ship however you are never going to be able to move more than 2 bs at once that is a good start but i still think there is an interesting role for this ship to move only rigged shipsthe first nonsupporter both of these comments came from one poster in the 2 sentences he gave in reply to this proposal one sentence for each reasongotta admit i still dont get it i havent seen this exploit and i dont really understand what you are saying sorry for being thick on this i take it they use an orca as a mobile base by moving a bs into position in high sec with an alt and then flying in the pirate in a shuttle to board up and start shooting is that itwell simple fix  do not allow securitystatuschallengedpilots to use a ship maintenance array in high sec or it risks immediate concord action on the neutral alt pilots ship for harboringaiding and abetting a fugitive but that would be a fix for more than just this ship proposal  it sounds like it might be needed now for orcas too what other one they were the same guy in the same post separated only by a periodah i get it now  but i really could care less about that idea what exactly would be the benefit of me transshipping a shuttle in a bs cargohold when i can buy one in nearly any empire station only to fly back again so i can rinserepeat ad nauseum till i manage to move all my ships or cancel my sub in frustration what i wanted to propose was a roleniche ship to make the mindnumbingly boring metagaming logistics of transporting ships that i own from place a to place b a little bit easier i am perfectly aware that i can fly back in a shuttle  he1l i could do it in my pod if i wanted to that is what i am trying to avoid so that i can actually engage in gaming instead of metagaming sorry piloting from a to b in high sec is not playing the game imoapologies for the tone but i didnt appreciate you making it sound like there were a legion of ppl who strongly disagree with the proposal saying the first 2 nonsupporters when the two points were from the same post is just a way to make it sound like this proposal has been thoroughly panned by everyone who read it people might disagree with it  that is what a proposal thread is for discussion just dont twist what has been said here please

when you create a mailing list you can set a welcome mail in the settings id like to have the same thing in the corp mail and while were at it in custom chat channels you can set a motd but not in corp so id like it there too and why not in the alliance channel as well
corp mailing list
so i should create a mailing list that for all intents and purposes is a copy of the corp mail that already exists just to get a welcome message and how am i supposed to get new members to join that mailing list without a welcome mail telling them to do that
you have a point but i fit a wcs so i got away anyway
haha ok i give you that one gf
thats what i am saying for a long time
bump
it is currently considered an exploit to survive engagement with concordperhaps you should ask ccp to have jove protect lowsec instead
ok first of all eve wouldnt be a game anymore if this happened it would just be b with splashes of java script and moving vechicles eve would stop working because carebears would become extinct id like to see how long you last in highsec without carebears id just laugh from my grav sites in wormhole while you pay 05 bil for a core probe launcherthat being saidhaving concord patrols in lowsec should definately exsist if rats get into highsec concord should get into lowsec except concord is friendly to people with the correct security status in lowsec concord would be like regular rats in lowsec nurfed from highsec ones but have an inverted security status gainloss from rats you gain sec status for killing rats lose for killing concord makes sense and its simple0510 concord exsists as they are now delays and 9999999 dps and all04 concord would be like 06 rats03 concord would be like 07 rats00 concord would be like 10 rats  easiest concord to kill low sec loss and bad loot04  01 shouldnt just be an ftp situation if i owned abbandoned gold mines asspecailly if they where planet size i would still have them scouted out and patroled regularlyalso move this to features and ideasjess
i dont understand why you think my proposed change would break eve to such a great extent perhaps you can elaborate on how that would happenfurthermore if concord rats in 4 are as weak as npc rats in 6 then they wont serve any purpose being there and nobody will be any safer due to their presence
because the safety your proposal affords highsec for anything below 08 is inadequate to keep industrialists and traders at their intended roles remember those are not mission runners their characters have zero combat sp and their freighters have zero combat abilities they are not combat characters that can refit their boats for pvepvp they are noncombat characters that depend on either player run or npc security it will break up highsec into islands of 0810 and break the economy in the process industrialists are mandatory to eve economy yerrrpriates are optional your rat level npc concord is worthless even navy level npc can easily be tanked and killed as anyone in fw knows lowsec right now will still be lowsec and highsec below 08 will be lowsecthe most effective security consists of sov null defence fleets in some of the more backwater systems in a large alliance you will not see a nonfriendly for weeks on end it is the safest space in all of eve the second is regular concord think of them as nrds security who also happen to be very stupid thus allowing suicide gankers to freely run scanners at gates and shopping for targets responding only after the gank it makes highsec safer than lowsec and more dangerous than sov null your ratlevel concord is no security it will just expand lowsec
not supported this would ruin my current profession in eve so i cannot support it some ransom attempts take several minutes to complete and having concord show up would make me pull the trigger more than needed
youre kidding right
oh come on if youre going to troll the least you could do is put some effort and creativity into it and be a lot less obviouswindjammer
so i was discussing eve with my 10 pals last nightthe topic of discussion moved on to risk free corporationalliance 00 systems isk generation it is absolutely risk free there are not even ninjasalvagers my proposals are remove anomaly sites from 00  make npcs on the belts the same as in 0510 23 frigs per beltit was sarcasm if serious if you and your pals think that missioning in highsec is more profitable  do 4 lvl missions in highsec i do i have jump clones in lowsec for pvp fun and in highsec for money earningit is simple problem is solved
i see a differnet problemmissions should only give bountys in my opinionloot  should never be droppedthe items loot drops should be built by manufacturers in eveothewise a missioner gets so much loot  salvage  lp  isk  it kills the mining toon a mining toon does not get any lp  isk  cuase a 4k pirate is worth 0  wow 2 salvages from a pirate
yes macro miners could certainly use the buff and there definitely wont be more macro miners popping up to fill the gap and make mineral prices even lower like when loot got nerfed last time in tyrannis
hello i keep it short as we all know this has been a milk cow for much of the big alliances for years nothing against that if you fight for it you should haveon small change have all the moons of the same rarity have all the minerals that could be switched on or off maybe with different abbundance this would prevent monoplies or violent swings in prices and the moons still would be valuable
remove them and put them in lowsec it will bring life to low
i know a couple of guys who play on a fx5200 which doesnt support shader model 3they may unsubscribe lol
ok
shader model 30 was released in 2004 are you telling me that there are people that cannot afford to buy a 7 year old card that would still be an upgrade to them to play this game it would be like 10 if you could even find one hell ill give you one for free not to mention i am not even sure a 7 year old pc can run the current graphics engineif it can it must be laggy as all hell and looks like  must be even worse on a laptopabsolutely not supportedif you cant afford to upgrade your rig with even the cheapest of video cards then go play ultima onlinestop holding everybody else back
did you even read his post you cant swap gfx cards on most laptops you people are hopelessand yeah it sucks but cant do much about that
priceless
but you knew that when you bought the laptop thats the nature of the beast when gaming on laptops
armor based capitals have advantage of the slave implant shield based crystals do not work with capital modules either1 make slaves work only on sub capital class of vessels or2 make the crystals work on capitals active tanks or 3 introduce shield slave hp boosting equivalent thank you for attention feel free to discuss the alternatives
and ccp please introduce armor crystal hp boosting equivalent
im actually for this idea  but only if it has penalty to shield recharge rate in a way that total hpsec remains constantand there should be implant set for active armor repairmaybe change the current halo and talisman sets do fill those roles as they are now they are most useless sets ever
i still say this is the single most balanced and appropriate change to titan dd i think more and more people every day are understanding just how bad its getting as titans proliferatecsm vuks old post also links my old post and discussion thread from 2 years agolinkage again why does this idea work it ushers in the age of more t3 devices where heat is a defensive advantage and not just a way to do more tankgank over t2 its a role for tech 3 rather than a better tech is better conceptit also removes the 1 shot kill effect that so many people hate ultimate weapons are bad in every game ever made they destroy balancethe 4 different effects of the titan dd are simpleheat has 20 chance of affecting any mod this means that you can mass spam dd bc you run the risk of affecting friendly titanssc which would destroy their defensive boosting abilitiesdamage has the ability to clear all normal drones and crappy skilled fighters good for lag good for drone swarming gayness frigates may or may not die depending on fitdamage type dictors can usually live it also clears light dictor bubbleswarp stasis affects every ship on grid meaning if you lead a fight off with a dd then your fleet has a chance to rush in and trap the enemy fleet while theyre crippledneuting is all about the inability to mass spam dd again while also acting as a 2ndary fleet crippling device theres literally no way to mass spam more than a few dd if each titan gets neuted titans rarely have 90 or above capacitor to start with especially after hot dropping into fights but again youre already limited bc of the heat affects so really youre never going to see multiple dd abuse againkeep titans gun bonuses titan gun bonuses are very appropriately balanced atm it was a good boost after they finally nerfed tracking

why would this make any difference to super fights or anything in fact you would still have the case of numbers  tactics when it comes to supercaps this would even make it worse dds are probably the smallest priority to change right now when it comes to supers being overpowered
got to ask yourself how ed would it be when somone spams 5 of those things on the same grid im guessing very
it would make titans into a pseudo tackler i kinda like the idea scarriers messing with people  jump a titan in dd one scarrier now it cant jumpwarp  drop fleet on it  battle escalates it would mean more super caps die thats probably a good thing as scarriers rarely rarely rarely die
i would say the fc dumb enough to do it would have at least 2 crippled titans stuck on grid with hardly any tank or guns to fight back guess that 50mil ehp buffer wasnt worth it to him bc now his titans have about 20 mil ehphis own friendly super carriers would also probably not have any fb or tank of their own either not to mention what if the fc does this and the support fleet dodges most of them then hes crippled titans for nothing and is uber ed
the warp scram effect means that once the first one tags a support fleet they get the full combo however many that isa drop of 23 titans basically nails everything on the grid itd reduce tactics to whos got the most titan drops  can cynobridge in somemore stuff lastmy basic problem is if you catch a fleet with a couple of them its pack up an go home time this is not the way of maximum funomfgzoor boomsticks on uber units always lead to cheesetastic balance titans would be better off in a force multiplier role but that might take some thought
so do you even read the post and think for 2 seconds or do you just post the moment you get a bad thoughtit ushers in the age of t3 devices with a purpose for the heat bonuses this means they can implement tech 3 guns and devices that have higher heat resistance meaning they can take a titan dd and live which also means they can nanite repair it also means they can make t3 guns low damage but high heat damage or tracking high heat buffer means they can overheat for longer if they desire so its a role wo replacing tech 2 one of the biggest delemmas for tech 3 gear has always been whats the role wo replacing tech 2 this adds to the concept of a heat role for tech 3multiple dd affect titans meaning titans are also crippled and ripe for being hotdropped by a cap fleet and dropping instantly if they try to stackyou do also realize there is a 20 second spool up time for dd theyre not that hard to dodge with support fleets
i understand where your coming from but an aoe effect of the nature youve described is a real pain to balance it might be ok if alliances only had access to a couple of titans each but theyve got them by the buttloadhow much damage would a single dd do the aoe means you could hit anything from a couple of frigs to 200 caps you just cant balance for that atleast with the present dd naff though it is theres a cap to how much it can doanything thats immobile is even more useless  you could chain dd a dread blob a couple of times then walk over itagain it reduces the higher level game to timing dds and dropst3 and heat means rebalancing the whole combat system thats a big task and considering how much is broken at the moment ccps time would be better spent fixing that
let me try to explain you slowlycoupled with drones what a joke every ship carries drones if you dont have them train for them drones are not specific to gallentenor they have 1drone plevel bonus on their ship so this is not an acceptable argumenti dont know how your skils list is but there is some problem about this particular comment i have less problems but still have to hit stuff with med blasters than large ones but even hitting the stuff isnt enough the dps is ridiculous compared with autos or even pulses in the same ship they have mutch better dps projectiontracking even my rails do larger dmg when by miracle i hit the stuff closedont even loose your time training for large ones if you are not crosstrained enough to use a vindicator youll need a 1b ship without fit and gimp it to hell to make it work like a t1 blaster hull should workmyrmidons shield tank with autos work betterthorax with autos work betterbrutix shield tank with autos work bettermega with artys works bettermega with autos works betterthen you have this guristas ships gila or rattle  400m3 of drones drones bonusangel ships you should thank ccp that they gave gallente bonus to those ships they are not op because of this serpentis ships better ehp pullspeed extra dps bonus web bonusvindicator is the t1 l3 version of what should be the gallente bs or the gallente hybrids bonus just a few days crosstraining to have it but 100 more expensive than kronos
due i get it you dont like my post but take care to come up with proper arguments so according to you if a ship has a bonus to armor tank i should be shield tanking it wtf if a ship has a bonus towards something it cannot adequately use either the ship need adjustment or the bonus this much seemed obvious to me if a ship has bonus to large hybrids and armor repairers it should be able to fit both of them ffs facepalmsdude first of all this thread is not only about pvp it is pve too second yea it is better than hyperion in both areas you would like to dispute that can you not even be bothered o go check battleclinic before trolling my post i loled hard
t1 l3 hyperion the ultra tech blaster platform of wallente if you think it works fine its your opinion but not mineso imo let give you some more for lols the hype would be mutch better with the vindicator bonus you think it wouldnt keep smiling smile is good for your health
i do agreeit is actually sad
good day my fellow capsuleers with this proposal i hope to solve a long time problem i havenUFFFDt read a lot of the issue so if i copy somebody idea and you feel that i havent quote you i am sorry i just didnt read what you said means i am original but could be repetitivebountys system its broken i just checked today if was solved but no so heres comes my proposal of how to solve it in a effective waywhat we know of reals bountys that many of them are just posted in the sheriff office just like an ad and others are real contracts contracts my friends thats how the most effective bountys come to be resolvedso the first point should be making bounty hunting a contractbut that gives other problems that i think gonna solvefirst moving bountys to contracts would be nonanonymous so to be more effective bountys should be optionally anonymous the database would still know who posted the contract but not the bounty huntersecond there should be a option and a way to actually pass kill rights it should be simple as passing a object more specifically like the bookmarks so the player that was killed and with megarage just pay and pass his kill right to actually somebody be able to kill without concord freaking you upthird a search option to find more bountys contracts of the same guy so you could actually get more cash for the same jobfourth a bounty hunter rating system like amazon thirdparty stores with their satisfaction rating so before you give the bounty hunter the job you can see if they got experience doing it and knowing which previous jobs they have done like when a contract finish that you can see the detailsso finally a example of how it should be1 bh its bored need money open contracts or bountys and see what its around2 client posted a bh contract marking the option anonymous set 400 million and a abbadon as rewards he also put inside the contract the kill right of the bastard that needs a lesson in comments he also post a extra if you kill him inside his navy issue ship3 bh finds the contract find it good and hit bid or any other word just follow the example wait to see what happens4 client check the bounty and 5 bounty hunters seems interested he check every bounty hunter reputation or rating and decides to give bh the job5 bh receives confirmation that he got the job and receive the kill right he go to the bountys again for more bountys for the bastard and happy finds that they got a least a couple of millions and are in auto accept option auto accept or whatever they decide to name would be like a option to avoid bidding so the client and the bounty hunter have not to wait a bid and its confirmation like a exchange contract6 bh finds the bastard sadly not in his navy issue ship and shot him client finds the confirmation that the contract have been finished and check if bh posted the kill mail after seeing the things he opens in the finished contract and move a slider in the good rating7 bh finds that the client of the contract put in the contract satisfaction a good rating instead of the excellent rating he decides to get drunk and curses the guy who give him the job at least it doesnt affect him negatively in his ratingnow i hope you like this proposal and hit the support checkbox now i wonder if i should have waited to the new forums to come before posting incursion 110 lol and cheers
i support myself
bottom line is that eve is setup in such a way that makes it very difficult to kill specific person in 1 on 1first 1 on 1 is difficult to achievesecond when a target person becomes aware that he is hunted he can easily avoid combat especially in empire no bubbles its very difficult to force people into combat just gotta wait for them to make a mistake which can take dayswhos want to spend days trying to chase 1 person especially if that person chooses to play it safethats why the bounty system will always fail while the kill right is granted to 1 personthe only way to hurt somebody with bounty on their head is to allow everyone to attack that person everywhere until the bounty is removed of course if we went that way wed have to raise minimum bounty limit to something significant like 10 mil and to give 24 hour count down till open aggression can begin
very interesting idea might need a few tweaks because of the problem of the hunted trying to get his own bounty contract and pod himself with an altotherwise i support it all
kill rights are just useful for high sec where 1 to 1 its possible and using the contract system you will have to be checking constantly when they chasing you and if that person decides to play it safe well you are  up as when you make a wardec and see that the whole other corp its docked as rabbits in their holes and giving them the 24 hour count down its gonna be just worse and allowing everyone be able to attack that person in high sec its just gonna be the biggest  could happen in the gamethe game cant be perfect for everyone because it would be like playing chess with just one row
thank you the problem of being hunted by an alt should be avoided if you see with the bid or whatever word may describe it better where you can select to who give him the contract to start the bounty hunting it isnt perfect but its better that just auto kill yourself to get the bounty
the ops idea is completely unworkable the intentions are good but the game just doesnt work that way it cant work as intended
something like
hey daitengu i have already proposed this it was shouted down with cries of silly goonies learn to pvp and if you cant fight supercaps stay out of 00 no real arguments but shouted down nonetheless
i would say boost battleships and dreadnaughts dpssurvival to the same point cruisersbattlecruisers are dangerous to bss wy nerf when you can boost
not really your proposal was good this one isntright now imagine the ideal gang to take over sov load of supers  some dictorshictors since they are the only ones that can do something that you cannot achieve by throwing more supers on it pinning down hostile supersafter this change load of supers  one cyno ship you are only makign supers even stronger granted some dictors to pin down more enemies while your supers would quickly dispose of everything would be handy
not supportedthere is already another thread about super carrier nerf you should post your idea there or better yet post it in features and idea forum like ed should have done with his to begin with
as you all know a t2 ship will generally perform better than a t1 ship for instance whereas the incursus only gets one drone the ishkur improving on the gallentes drone fetish brings to the table two flights of light dronesas you all know the minmatar fetish is speed so naturally improving on the speed the rifter has the wolf oh wait the jaguar takes this speed to a new oh waityes thats right neither the wolf nor the jaguar can match the rifters speed without a speed mod in the low slots or a gistum afterburner i suppose this is because of the added armorhull mass of these ships but and this is particularly true of the jaguar being that minmatar generally are renowned for their speed wouldnt it make sense for them to be as fast as their t1 counterpart if not fasteri propose you make the two minmatar assault frigates the jaguar and the wolf have speed that is on par with the rifter otherwise i am just going to say screw it and faction fit my rifter since the wolf brings no web to the table and the jaguar only has got a better tank and a little more dps
the firetail is the rifteroncrack you are looking for
yeah but jaguar i suppose i will have to fit out a firetail why oh why cant the jag be fast as the rifter it bugs me too much
everyone already knows assault frigates suck making a small fast ship less fast and less small so far as signature radius is concerned so it can have higher resists is well dumb really dumb and ccp said they were going to fix them in dominion by giving them a boost to afterburner effectiveness that didnt happen instead we got fighter bombers
yeah but that afterburner boost was a stupid idea you need to have versatility in which type of assault ship does what not just make them into tankier interceptors built for close range idc about the other af they can be a little bit slower or a little bit bigger because speed isnt the caldari or the amarr or the gallentes thing  it is the minmatar specialty and i feel its wrong to beat the crap out of minnies specialty on the af speed is the only thing keeping them alive if they were slow as a harpy theyd die in seconds to any other af and yet theyre not fast enough in a lot of cases i find that the rifter is
mabe this could be considered true but the fact is that every single ship no matter the faction or size is abble to deploy drones and the same number wtf is the single specificity of gallente to be the worst on everything they are supposed to be strongerlets take same average sp pilotabilityexperience lets take a look at the rolesyou have 3 subcap ships that work properly with drones vexor ishtar and dominix  checkall the other types of ship have the same bonus than other factions but work worst checki hate frigs i hate them all so frigs  drones point blanck bigger dmg with artys in gall ships than with rails even loosing ship bonus  checkblasters the bigest fail of all factions weapons outperformed by any other  checkif you want to stay rp an give some rp bonusthen it would be 1drone per level but i would like something that makes blasters realy melt your ugly face and cry moma if you let me get close to your ass has they were intended to work because blasters too are in the gallentes rpmake it possible with some sub so that this boat becomes some minicarrier im ok with that but not make it the drone carrier and no other choice possible by nerfing other subs type in the name of the fake drone people take the drone bay away from all other kind ships under caps and then yes gallente will be the drone people
this is a very interesting proposal and definatly a possible rout to go down
problem one for the proteus is that it only has 100 bandwidth that the proteus cant field a full team of sentries but the gila and ishtar can is somewhat confusing
faction navy spawns arent the way forwardm neither is turning low sec into a watered down version of high sec the problem is that a character with decent probing skills can lock down a mission runner in under 30secs making it too easy to catch mission runners i personally have no sympathy with people who say ratting is difficult cause there ratting ship isnt fit to combat pvp ships its really easy to stay safe and rat mission running in low is also fairly easy to stay safe as long as you do the usual tricks align out dont sit on the warp in keep an eye on localdirectional scanner but due to the probing system you will eventually lose shipsmost problems are caused by either that or a general group of the population that jump into low sec in pve fitted ships rather than just refitting there ships when they reach there missioning system or people who start running missions and expect that they can go afk like they do in high sec and earn easy isk
it may have been deleted by the grammar policeit may have been deleted because you have no proposal in your op or any coherent thoughts  but thats another matterit may have been delted since despite your attempts to tell others to grow a pair you are posting on a troll alt with no combat history
edit i screwed up i got some emails confused the actual reality is that i dont have an answer to this question yetthus the following is incorrect my badmy spies inside ccp report that this is working as intendedmany bothans died getting you this information hope it was worth it
the individual mechanics at play are each simple enough but the novel interaction of downtime processes shield bonuses and pos incapacitation rules set out here is not something that i suspect would have occurred to most people even those familiar with all 3 components and quite possibly not even to seasoned game designers at ccpif this is an intended consequence then i recommend that the op and his friends adapt by using zerocpu turretbased defences when colonising pulsar systems
to csm guysif you bring up some sort of hybrid fixit would have been enough for usif you brought up how bo need a boostit would have been enough for usif you talked about a low sec boostit would have been enough for usif you demanded af get a 4th bonusif would have been ehough for usbut when you complain about hot chicks handing out free stuff at fanfestit was too much for usthank you
lol jason first you complain about scs then propose introducing more overpowered supercapsi support the motion of a moderate sc nerf combined with a moderate dread buff give the latter better nonsiege dps comparable to a carrier with fighters and better sieged tracking

ohhh yes please by all means lets read this excerpts from that threadpost 2 from someone who is noted as antiankh post 12 referring to ankh post 19 from the person the spoon was thrown at from what i can tell it was done so to interrupt a side conversation that was disruptive to the main conversation of the meeting post 22 from a csm present at the event and who expressed disappointment that sokratesz an antiankh person chose to publish an nonevent which would predictably be seized upon and blown out of proportiontheres more merely reading the first page or perhaps even the first two pages of that thread is enough to educate you on the event or as mynxee phrased it noneventperhaps now you can see how this sort of thing becomes distorted and blown out of proportion to what actually happened a friendly clap on the back can become an assault a nudge to a someone sitting beside you can become an elbow jab to the midsectionthis nonevent is a far cry from what you and others came to believe itwindjammer

do you know what the funny thing about this thread is most of the issues mf and others raised got brought up in the csm minutes and ccp have in fact said it is ridiculous and have said it is blobbingas for me ccp have said supercaps are op in longer terms and supercarriers are gimping dreadsfurthermore jump bridges and logistics were also criticised by ccp and lack of combatwhile i am against alt posting and ed trolling i got to hand it to mini assuming he is mf for his comments now ccp will focus on the issuesguess this is what he means by the problem being solved hehebahh i was going to congratulate him in game but it looks like he deleted his char

cosmetic onlyif some of the cosmetic stuff is still available to everyone
nobe warned you will never see another dime from me if you do this i will cancel all my accounts the same daygo ahead and mess up a perfectly good gamei think you would loose most of your core players if you did thisall these votes for cosmetic microtransactions only are just opening the door for ccp to implement microtransaction into all aspects of the game at a later time vote no who in the hell would want to see pink ships flying around or a noob killing off vet players just because they put 200 into a ship you all know thats how it will end up the game will be based on who has the most rl money whats next buying skill points week old toons with 100m skill points again i say vote no
yes id like to see more to0 fast skilled up pilots cause they bought a fkton of neural remaps flying expensive ships bought with plex without the heads to use em in the end they can jsut buy a lot of plex and buy a toon so it makes no differencetbh that  would make for more  to shoot at and a happy ccp that makes more rl isks which would make for a better game as we all know happy employees work harder 
cosmetic onlyi can agree with micro isk  transactions for lets say changing or adding to your character however i would propose that large content updates lets say a large new set of character cloths or accessories should be available for free when its released then after lets say a week youll have to pay some isks to change your avatari really dont know what else could be done at this point other then avatar customization but i would be against only being able to use features like stationwalking or planetary interaction if you paid for it monthly extra fee or somethingill need to see some concrete plans before completely dismissing or agreeing with micro transactions its a tough topic
titans now are useless unless you have 10 of them with significant sc  cap  conventional support yes i know they arent supposed to be soloships but unless you are a large powerblock the 50 billion isk is just a fancy jumpbridge you dont currently dare bring just one to a fleet regardless of support fleet size and large supercap fleets battling it out seems to be a nonissue that only the largest of alliances  coalitions has to worry about smaller to more midsized alliances will rarely use their ship currentlytitans were meant to be feared shps while they can oneshot anything sub supercapital every 10 minutes and becoming pretty vulnerable during that time    so what im sure the ddd bs  hic pilot is ed but awwwtitans now are instead frequent victims of supercarrier blobs i dont mind if a titan gets tackled by a sizable fleet and slowly dies but the fact that a handful of scs can relatively quickly kill a titan when a few titans cannot quickly kill a sc is a problemso    my proposal1  nerf scs they are way too powerful against all capital ships and pos structures i joined a friend and the two of us completely incapped all mods on a properly fit ds in about 10 minutes and was never in any jeopardy cut their hp and the damage the fbs do yaays idea about only 1x additional per level makes some sense and edfromhumanresources ideas on other nerfs also makes sensealso how about a sc skill titans require capital ships v why not supercarriers2  return aoe damage but in the form of a script make it a singleshot ship when you have that script in but increase it to 5m damage so it finally does some meaningful damage to a sc  it will still instapop anything sub supercap now anyway and a aoe weapon when that script is in with 200300k damage just like it used to have this revision will make it necessary to actually use strategy when attacking one rather then just blobbing it and hovering on some post button in yet another deadtitan caod thread like all other mods you cannot change scrips until the module has cycled so it does give the hostile fleet some idea of what to consider titans are supposed to be feared not just juicy and hunted targets bring that fear back they will still die when used improperly  in smaller fleets but they will once again be what they were meant to be the feared ship of eveand yes i do fly a sc on one of my alts

this doesnt fix the fact that supercaps are more powerful in low sec than in 00  primarily due to the lack of counters available in low secliang
you raised a key premise supporting your particular nerf your premise was we know a supercarrier nerf is incoming thats been confirmed beyond a shadow of a doubt  i suspected this assertion was a liei politely refrained from calling you a liar an
super caps are super for a reason the idea that a small gang should be able to nuet and drop a super cap to me is ridiculous if you take a step back and look at the material cost vs performance its not really that great dropping it further only and reducing its ability to take on smaller targets defeats the concept to which this ship was born
i think the idea is not for small gang to kill a supercap but for supercap to be unable to neut and drop entire small gangsupercaps and small roaming gangs should simply not be able to do anything to each otheralso the concept on which the ship was built on was anticap that role shouldnt be nerfed
why would moving the drone bonus from the hull to the modules boost sc dps
i believe he is talking about the sansha mothership it can fit 6x drone control units dds fire every 5 minutes so take a super carriers dps and add that up over 5 minutes im too lazy to do the math but correct me if i am miss informing here

i support this too i have four accounts and im generally satisfied with two of the mains from each account i have a khanid and a vherokior alt whom i was quite unsatisfied with regarding the potential facial mixesill freely admit to being shallow and likewise ill admit that in a game like this your face is likely by far one of the least important aspects of the game but if im going to take the time to create a character i want that character to at least be as close to my ideal for that character as possible and the current models for the khanid and vherokior are very unsuitable
supported
first off due to several people becoming confused i will state this right off with large font and boldthis proposal has absolutely nothing to do with covert ops cloaks it only deals with normal cloaksnow that that is out of the way my proposalwhen using any noncovert ops cloaking device your capacitor recharge time is 100 that does not mean you lose cap it just means it stops recharging no matter what cap recharge modules you have fit if you cloak and you had 54 cap after 5 minutes or 5 days of being cloaked it will stay at 54 the entire timethis will be a slight inconvenience for non capital ships but this is a big nerf towards super capitals who like to warp off to safe spot to cloak up till they gain enough cap to jump out thus forcing them to either stay probable till their capacitor is enough to jump or have other ships use remote cap transfers on it either way it makes them more exposededit black ops battleships should not be affected by the capacitor recharge penalty while cloaked they dont another nerf
suported
i see no downside
sorry if you cant tacklekill that capital when he shows up at the giant gankmesign known as a cyno then you obviously do not want that kill hard enough
maybe you should take a look at this proposal then
oh heck yaalso for cov ops means they player has to be there or eventually he will decloakthis should be put in staying invisible forever without cost is silly
cloak draws no cap so this will not decloak anyonesupported btw
supported
it will only hurt cowardly andor stupidly brave supercaps so can only support
absolutely not supported would completely take away the abilty for supers to jump into high risk situations such as ninking on a jb or ganking dreads on a pos nonsense like this would just encourage more blob mentality for supers and if you think thats a good thing come up north and watch the nc pos bash for hours on end wtf yoshida yes please lets punish stupidly brave pilots confirming that bravery has no place in eve so lets all jump in a blob
reckless is overused meaning is the same my dear
love the idea id just like to stress the importance of noncovert cloaks killing capacitor regen poor covert ops ships have very little capacitor and warping around depletes it quicklythank you for the excellent proposal
couldnt they just wait out agression log off and then come back with full cap later
covops cloak should have a cap reduction bonus built in dependent on the cloaking skilleven at cloaking v a perfect covops should still cap out after approximately three hours this will give people easily enough time to accomplish whatever it is they want to do whilst cloaked it would give them a possibility of getting probed down whilst recharging for the minute or so it takes for their cap to regen whilst uncloaked and it would eliminate afk cloaking because its an unimaginative and ty way to lock down systemsit would also give specialist characters a reason to train cloaking v
not supported
i dont like the whole idea of using cloaks of capital ships theres something wrong with the idea of titan or supercarrier being able to go invisible without sacrificing anything significantwhy not disable standard cloak for caps give them another module with higher fitting requirements and cap recharge penalty
you dont get cap regen while offline
because that involves creating a new module which would mean testing and adding stuff to market and a whole lot more so why do that when this simple change does that already if you like the idea of the change then please give a thumbs up
youre an idiot this is not an afk cloaker threadlearn to readop supported
because your solution is meant to target specific ship class which is about 001 of eve and the other 9999 are stuck with unintended consequencesunless you can justify with the rest of eve population needs this cap penalty itd be more reasonable to single out your target ship class and make solution just for them
two thingsa lot of people get around not appearing at the cyno when jumping in their super capital by timing the opening of the cyno with a self destruct of the ship players wait till just a few seconds before their throw away cyno ship is about to self destruct light the cyno and hit the jump with their super capital so before the super loads the system the cyno ship has exploded and they appear in some random safe spot in system totally 100 safe and they can simply cloak up immediatelysuper capital owners have been using this tactic to sneak into systems run level 5 missions among other things all to avoid possibly being caughti say that if you light a cyno any self destruct timer you have going is immediately cancelled
why not make it more interesting if the cyno ship gets destroyed during jump simply throw the jumping ship into a random system within their jump range
i support this but what the poster above me stated would be much more fun
i support this idea more
ill support both ideas and add to it that the jumping ship should take damage
oh hell yeah
i support both
can get behind that
its no random spot in system from what i have seen and tested its always the same spotso get some cloaky dictors there and bubble the sucker the next time he does itedit supported though as this could be called an exploit imo
i like both proposals the random system is great it would allow to defend against hot dropping maybe add 30 second heat up time for the cyno as well
this does sound badthe whole cyno system should be redesigned teleportation should not be instant
ahem  if it isnt instant it hardly counts as teleportation now does it that aside there are plenty of other delays already built into the system  waiting for cap recharge getting cynos into place etc  why add another one at this point
i like this but what it does is still put the ship that jumped into a safe setting perhaps with any upcoming cyno changes ccp does they can do something like this i am just asking for a hopefully simple coding change to have the cyno cancel the self destruct
there are other threads discussing problem with current cyno mechanics the fact that it takes ships only 35 seconds to appear after cyno is lit with no prior warning and no way to scout the incoming forces introduces large random factor into combat large random factors are bad for strategy and tacticsso the changes are needed to make pvp better and the ops problem is related to the larger problem of cynos
im not sure what you would hope to practically accomplish with this im not inherently opposed to the idea but unless you are already prepared to catch the super at the cyno anyway and the super pilot doesnt know this and goes in this is a fairly moot point if you want to know where a super is logged at run a locater agent on the pilot
this is just another lame proposal to take sand out of the sandbox sounds like some poor little extri mk xxiii or xxiv missed out on a super cap kill go cry somewhere else
i will afflict you but the reality is thateven in a bras the boobs moves and jumps up at run and fast walking a littlethe more the size of boobs the is more difficult to constrain their driving to a brassieredo not move while walking or runing  only steel wooden plastic cardboard or stone boobs
i really wonder how all of you type these responses with only one hand on the keyboard
bouncy boobiesas for destroying the company there is no way bouncy boobs have been a feature of many games including neverwinter nights and even the sims
bumpbtw i think i have a solution to the balster and gallente problem i start training minmater
youll get back for your bucks faster training other thing than wait something from ccp about this issue 2009 people already sayin and nothing donne since so im glad ive not spent a second training advanced skils of that  that are blastersthey just dont know how to fix it and not ready to change this since they are incapable to find where the problem comes from easyer to say train something else just a few months subscription thrown by the window because of someones incompetence in this matterthis issue exists now for years if they cant see it just stop recruiting blind devs
you know whats bad when you are about to get to optimal and some ships suddenly blocks your way and bumps you 15km off target then you have to basically start all over again just peachyrailguns are just plain bad an absolute waste
gallente ships dont need to be the fastest they just need to be fast enough so that a gallente ship fitting two or three overdrive injectors can eventually catch a minmatar ship fitting two nanofibers of equivalent size yeah the stabber and vaga wont be caught they have bonuses to speed but an three overdrive injector fitted myrm should be able to catch a two nanofiber fitted hurricane as it is right now no amount of additional speed fitting mods will allow a myrm or brutix to catch a hurricane or cyclone with two nanofibersnext the fiting requirements of either gallente weapons need to be decreased or the pgcpu of gallente ships need to be increased so that some fitting slots can be freed up
how are you going to bridge without bridges you cant remove bridges and then argue that people can just bridge their stuff in
jump freighters will be unaffected and then there are titan bridgesi was once roaming delve and seen how bob titan was bridging 8 freighters dunno what they were haulinganyway itd be silly to argue that logistics would remain easy no the main idea behind removing jump bridges is to make logistics harder  more dangerous so alliance people only develop and maintain systems they really care about so people actually use star gates in 00 and risk pvp you may worry about your alliance becoming more vulnerable but dont forget that your enemies will have exact same problems
i agree frankly im half way to suggesting that ccp produce an ingame bot creation program and use it as a legal way for players to bot ie the same general idea behind isk selling and plexes ccp gets extra cash and players can buy isk that way ccp can add restrictions to bots like limiting how many rigs a botted ship can use
never mind bridging where do you think youre going to get those highend minerals without someone doing a little mining in 00 i realize some of you may do all your shopping in jita 44 but someone has to do the mining in 00 it doesnt get there otherwise morphite megacyte zydrine does all this stuff just come from refined modules or maybe its entirely supplied by wormholebased corporations these days you do realize the only thing you can get in high sec is the cheap stuff in great quantity everything else has to come from 00 or lowsec and lowsec isnt that profitable practical or even capable of supplying half of iti had someone reply with similar logic to one of my earlier posts and though i thought about it i didnt say anything at the time the truth is you just dont find arkonor bistot crokite or the like anywhere else save those good grav spawns in wormholes trust me those are generally quite rare so its coming out of nullsec without question what wormholers supply in jita 44 and other local markets isnt nearly enough to cover the half of itback to bridgingdont get rid of it just change it modify it nerf it its too powerful as it is thats been well and truly established ccp thinks so csmfor whatever reasonthinks so and many of the player base here thinks so this belief is evidently so strong that many of us believe they should get rid of it entirely i dont jump bridging adds an interesting element to the game as do many similar means of travel currently in place with the removal of these devices effects and abilities eve takes a step backward and ceases its forward momentum they are a valid and fully defineable technology they just perhaps work a little better than they shouldanalyze the situation and effect the jump bridges have on the game and work out a reasonable solution to make them less effectivewhat you all should be doing is deciding what you would like to see changed about jump bridging not arguing debating and sidetracking around the issue while trying to convince others why they should go or stay limiting systems with highly developed infrastructures from there use as previously mentioned is not what should be happening theres an error in logic there rather those systems as developed as they are should be the ones able to construct and use jump bridges these are going to be core systems correct what place more effective and effectively capable to place a jump bridge in while allowing you to move from core systems to the edges of your empire this is how it should be what is there to say that you should be able to jump beyond your borders and if you have smaller infrastructures out beyond even them claiming space outside of your own effective territory in no mans land why should you be able to jump to them they are colonies of a sort seperated and far from protected borders
basically there are 2 important goals that need to be achieved to make eve a better war game1 make logistics operations vulnerable to raids as it is now its too safe almost impossible to disrupt any alliance logistics short of mega blob camping 237ability to hit enemy logistics would add new dimension to strategic and tactical aspects of eve warfare2 subcapital ships should be more vulnerable to raids in 00 that is done by forcing more people to use stargate travel instead of highly protected jump bridges stargates have always been the main catalyst of casual pvp both camping and roaming relies heavily on stargate dynamicsboth of these goals promote pvp on smaller scale while slightly discouraging mega blob pvp and lazy carebearism i believe these goals are worth pursuing even if it means that certain percentage of eve players will leave 00most will stay and adapt just like they did during first years of eve
honestly im more worried about not getting any pvp without flying a gazillion jumps to find it i also do not want to have to babysit minershaulers for the majority of the time im on
nobody has to mine highmins the drone regions made mining unprofitable just import the stuff theyre not bulky and can be brought in with a few blockade runners easilyacquiring the bulky minerals is the bottleneck nobody is going to mine veld in 00 because it is not competitive compared to just shipping built ships and mods from empirethere was plenty of pvp without bridge networks much more gate traffic leads to more roamings leads to more home defence gangs a bigger eve will in the long run return to more smaller alliances holding space this however will take a long time to developall in all there needs to be a complete rethink of 00 from an industrial and empire building standpoint to support autonomous self sustained operations
why not take my initial idea a little further by adding in the requirement of jump bridge relays these relays would be required to be placed at gates along the jump bridge route and would require fueling while being susceptiblee to attack they would be designed in a similar fashion to small pos and require isotopes as their primary fuel source with the addition of jump assisting fuel requirements they could of course only be placed in the alliances sovereign territory and along a preexisting stargate route a simple means to make a voyage along a known route faster while limiting their use to sovereign space within alliance controlled territoryfurther they would be limited to infrastructure level 2 or higher systems due to anchoring limitations and consume fuel with every use they might even be made more capable in a small fashion by allowing jumps to be made short of the final destination for example a series of jump relays exists in 10 systems leading out of the central core of alliance controlled territory a pilot intends to travel along this route but only intends on making the jump to five systems out there is a small pos there which he maintains and uses for moon harvesting arrays and he needs to check the cycles while making a trip out to highsec engaging his jump drive he sets it for the desired system along route and makes the jump from the jump bridge at the controlling pos some thrity seconds later he is in system and on his way from the gate there to his pos the arrival location would of course be at the jump relay in the system he set as his destinationfuel used in relaying the jump bridge would be based on mass of vessels using the bridge and would of course be limited in overall mass to an amount determined by its upgrade level available use of jump bridges would also have to be based on corporation roles similar to starbase configuration and fueling roles used for pos all corporations within an alliance would have the ability to designate this role a jump relay station would be able to hold an amount of fuel for relaying equivalent to 3x maximum mass of the highest upgrade of jump bridge available this would prevent more than three maximum mass jump bridges along a given route and only then providing all jump relays had the required fuel to do so any shortage of fuel would either drop ships along the route or cause the collapse of the jump bridge once any individual jump relay exceeded its fuel requirementsjump relays to add some flavour would also flash with each jump initiated at every point along the route with a pulsating frequency indicating the mass of the jump a single small ship through would cause no more than a single faint pulse while a dozen ships of bc size or smaller would expand to a series of brighter pulses intermixed with fainter ones essentially this would allow others to see when a jump bridge is in use and passing through the system they are in while the destination system wouldadditionallyhave a single strobing light indicating it as the final point along the jump routeobviously its likely to be easier to collapse a jump bridge than drop ships on route i would also think a timer between jumps would be a definite moderator in that it would prevent blob jumping the greater the mass of the last ship the longer the timer between it and the next jump doing this would allow for reduced server lag resulting from use of jump bridges and increase the requirement for fleet planning its good on both sides and stops the blob at least initially
how many of you fanboi supporters have actually run 00 logistics take yourself out into 00 and run logistics for an alliance for a couple months then i will listen to your opinions otherwise you have literally no idea what you are talking about and renotsmarted
jump bridges should really only go from system to system instead of leapfrogging them that way you keep the number of jumps while giving another entrance for an alliance so they can avoid using the stargates
no to removing jump bridges plenty of people have detailed why jbs should not be removed thats good enough for me so thumbs down from me
this might just be the most horrible idea ccp and the csm have come up with as a group you want to deploy to the front just stage a moving op that takes a week or so and an entire coalition can have its caps subcaps and supercaps moved to a lowsecnpc nullsec staging system within short range of their targets get one of your posssov structures attacked just rally a fleet for the timer yah it may take half an hour for some folks to make the trip down zomg the coalitions are now shatteredccp provided an environment where people could choose to cooperate or fight as they saw fit and many have chosen to form regional cooperation pacts so that they can be fairly safe at home and can go roadtrip if they want to attack people somewhere else so in response to people using game mechanics functioning as intended to do things 100 allowed within a sandbox politicalmilitary environment the response seems to be no you are sandboxing wrong jump bridges arent a problem force projection isnt even really a problem either human nature and the fact that people will cooperate to achieve mutual goals seems to be the problem if ccp wants a game where power blocs wont form and imbalance things they need to set up sharded servers with instanced objectives and fixedman raids but short of wowing eve will remain eve there were coalitions and blobs before jbs and supercaps there will be coalitions and blobs after too
who let this guy inwhy does everyone want to make things harder from what i can make of it certain people dont like groups of players getting places fast i say so what just because your enemy can catch up to you by using jbs isnt a reason why you should remove them plus you got to think of the times it takes to get people in fleets and form up to attack you and im sure if you were the ones about to attack the enemy you wouldnt hesitate to use a jb yourselfplus jbs are not risk free lots of people get killed on those things jumping through and not knowing exactly whats in the next system is totally risky sure there are intel channels where you could probably find out what the system is like but that doesnt mean that all the intel is correct or not ive had to jump blindly into a system using a jb myself on more than one occasion so jbs are not riskfree they can be just like stargates and people really have no problem camping them as well as regular stargates
facepalm read greyscale comments and the csm minutes it is not only jb will be nerfed it they go this route every jump capable ships will be nerfed included the titan bridges and maybe even the freighters npc products across regions old story it was nerfed years ago so you are silly
the concept that the csm would actually go along with removing jbs is disturbing to say the least i would not be surprised to see and would encourage a no confidence proposal relatively soon
id like to keep jump bridgesif theyre removed it will increase small scale ganking fleet in 00 and reduce large scale fleet fightsthen question is whats the point still staying in 00 and have pew pew fun just stay in high sec do war dec or faction warfare which you already have if youre telling me 00 is where make ppl rich so youll fight hard for it ill tell you thats half true and half bs most moon income goes directly into alliance leaders wallet i can make more in high sec than in 00 by myself i would say only people like this idea are the ones never really pvped in 00 or some rich alliance leaders want more small pvp fun without giving up their moon income
qft00 without jbs is very much like highsec without concord that is highsec without concord that is much more spread out with many fewer stations  poss to hide in when things look badmake that highsec without concord that is much more spread out with many fewer stations  poss to hide in when things look bad with npc rats that rarely do attempt to warpscram the solo freighter yes  a really bad idea but it happensvery bad ideaplease leave the discussion of jbs to those that use them and we will leave the discussions about faction warfare  level 4 missions to those that live in highsecthank you
i think getting rid of jump bridges is a great step in the direction this game should go tactical and strategical right now there is no risk with logistics this should change alliances have a lot of room they dont use this should changebalancing the bridges via cost did not work as they are everywhere now and there is no reasonable way to keep them super highways that take you all the way from one end of the game to the other in minutes with no risk and or effort should be goneif the argument to keep them is logistics then make it so that only advances freighters can jump but this is no argument for every ship in the game being able to do itat this time 00 is easier more comfortable safer and more profitable than high sec this should change i do not think it was the intent of ccp that every system would be part of a bridge network linking everywhere with everywherei find it hilarious to see that the people defending bridges mention the non existing small alliances which dont exist because moving a thousand ships is trivial this should not be so moving your ships should be a commitment and open avenues for attack attrition and blockades should be possible there should be tactics and strategy involved in 00at the end of the day if you want to blue everyone so be it but it shouldnt be ccps interest to coddle the existing 00 power blocks or to ensure their existence fleet warfare existed before bridges and will exist afterseriously what happened to htfu 00 is by far the softest area in eve at the moment what happened with eve shouldnt be easy and gbtwowbridges must go
people who havent played eve before jump bridges were introduces cannot be taken seriously on their predictions of what would happenwe already know exactly what would happen most of the devs will remember it personally it was no doomsday scenario the game was growing quickly 00 was populated there was plenty of traffic we know for a fact that eve will do just finewhat it comes do is thissome people want eve to be more carebear friendly  even in 00others want eve to be more hardcore pvp  especially in 00it just so happens that i like hardcore pvp and i can understand the carebear perspective i dont mind it so much if you openly say that is what you want i just cant stand the hypocrites who push carebear ideals while arguing that not doing so is bad for pvp
players that use what was workingnot working when there was an average of 20000 players on line as a meter of paragon for what will work with an average of 50000 players on line cannot be taken seriously on their predictions of what would happenit cur both way ephe eve has changed the capability to compress stuff has been nerfed the request for minerals have been increased mineral heavy rats drops have been removed barrign drones drones regions have been added and so on and so on at infinitum you are like a guy saying in 1950 we were capable of living with a car every 8 persons so we can do it even today not without changing so much things that we will be living in a future of 1950 not of 2011 past in the days it was possible to get compression rates of over 2501 and was possible to put 3 dreadnought guns on a frigate and move it to 00 you call jb an easy way to do logistic how much stuff was possible to move with one of those frigates how much with a carrier full of thoseyou simply recall a time when you were younger and the game was simpler as a golden age that never existed
no there was no golden age it was fun same 00 with escort ops i dont get how lazy people got you got carriers you got jump freighters titan bridges undetectable covert ops black ops transport and t3 choices and you still whinei would keep cyno beacons so you dont have to have alts everywhere but what more do you need
yes because there are so many jump bridges littered throughout low sec
i believe the goal of a game designer is to make more players happy when playing the gameno doubt the hard core pvp elites will get more fun if it is removed while someone elseregular players not that hard core will lose some fun because life is becoming harderthe question is which side has more playersif someone really love doing smaller scale pvp and hate blobs therere already plenty of opportunity in game why are you still staying or care about staying in 00personally i love blob fights eve is the only game can get 2000 players staying at same place and shooting at each other so why trying so hard to take big fleet fights awayits better to make 1000 players feel happy after shooting down one titan than 30 elite supercap pilots insta pop three titans
good thing i pointed out that your hangar will remain as safe as its always been eh eh really dodged a bullet there ahh with bonus i hate pirates rant this isnt about easy targets or targets of any kind this is about adding content to a massive expansion thats currently only slated for space barbie and perhaps fable style bar minigames
best idea bout incarna i heard so far and please make it so that u can gang up and jet the carebears from the nearest airlock
bump still waiting for ccp to respondapologisealso thanks to all those who have supported this issue
dont like to have more accounts s
or you could simple have the option to que the over heat so that when you do uncloak it starts up for you
supported
surealthough the entire overheating interface is terrible and has been the subject of numerous csm proposals to fix itnot as important as space barbie though maybe in a couple years if youre still playing theyll think about it
agreedits a damn toggle switch how difficult to give it a flick while youre cloakedalso introduce highmidlow slot thermal capacitors that do nothing but soak up excess heat so you can sacrifice a slot to overheat somewhat longer 20 base t1 45 t2 with meta variants
i could see such a concept working and i would in fact be temped to support it if there was also a new mechanic to allow more control of warping on gridone of the primary functions of the fleet structure is it provides the fleet commanders movement and positioning control there is always within the fleet structure a few pilots dedicated to providing the positioning points for the combat ships this is by far the greatest tactical work of the fleet commander is just positioningthe issue in game at the moment is that the only methods to move a fleet coherently is to use another fleet member to warp toyour proposition while interesting would simply multiply pilots needed for this basic taskwhat would be required before adopting a point system to enforce multiple fleets which could be coupled with gang bonuses grid specific is a basic navigation mechanism to allow free warp in spaceimho the 3 basic navigation functions needed would be1 coordinate input and display2 homeworld navigation control for warp and creation of bm both in macro and solar system view3 broadcast and viewable in space bookmarks fc only broadcast to fleeti might look at elaborating this idea in a separate post
simply not allowing a fleet to exceed the leadership skills of the boss would do wonders as well
if something is more difficult its more challenging if its more challenging its more interesting to make it workso basically you achieved nothing because established large alliances will eventually successfully deploy huge fleets and due to increased difficulty of making a huge fleet smaller entities will be even more defenceless against blobsall kinds of other misc stuff pops up by drastically limiting the fleet size sov warfare capital warfare supercapital warfare ccp losing a marketing strategy epic fleet battles not seen in any other mmobesides an option is already given  wormhole space limited by the amount of ships that can come through before the entry wormhole collapses not to mention that living in a wormhole space is much more profitable and challenging than living in nullsechowever im not for keeping the blobs in the current form so ill be neutral on this suggestion
as a new player i have found the limited keybinds available in eve to be quite restrictive and frustrating the fact that most keys are unable to be used as keybinds for ship actions such as releasing drones aligning turning on and off modules etc prohibits more fluid game playi propose that all keys are opened to be bound at the players discretion without the use of alt shift crtl etc being needed chat windows will only respond to text input when the player clicks on the text input part of the window and will cease to respond when the player clicks on some other part of the ui or in space alternatively chat windows could be activated by pressing some key ie enter and deactivated in the same wayfor those of you who are happy with the current keybind system i would definitely encourage you to support this proposal all the same your keybinds can remain exactly how you like them while allowing greater flexibility for those who dont
read the patch notes your a little bit latepretty sure this was in the last releaseby the way this made me laugh really hard
ccp plz let me hump people in incarna hump the nearest chick
a button would b nice too mayb another button to flash ur boobies
boobbbsssss
great idea  i want my own sex shop
would be funny
oh yeee lets party inda pleasure hub
support but only in 00 and low sec stations
totally supported especially when the player is colorblind or has some weakness in seeing colors yes i do its a real buggerbut that also meets for other ui interface items
supportthe problem arises at usage of 15 x1r5g5b5 and 16bit r5g6b5 color depth andor 16bit depth bufferall moving boxes which are below an ecliptic plane  become too dark and being above  remain white16bit depth we use for minimize lags on low clientmachinespsin 32bit colors all is looking good
honestly we should all be filing bug reports about thisthis is a serious problem every time im trying to scan something i need to move all my camera down then my probes up above the grid just to see what im clicking on then move them around then back down its pretty silly
everyone yay for gankin in stations and use sommet similar to the dust engine plz ccp d
after incarna is outbe careful with what you ask for incarna may only be released in 2 years time
the old highway system made eve too smallits same problem as we have with jump bridges now even without the empire highway system it takes me just 1 hour to travel from deep end of venal in deep end of delve if it took me just half an hour to travel from one end of the map to another itd be pretty ridiculouspeople in eve are getting too damn lazy already in 00 most people wont bother chasing hostiles if they are 10 jumps away they say 10 jumps is too far these people need to be griefed mercilessly until they quit or adaptno superhighways no jump bridges nerf cynos
more systemsmore low secmore null secmove empires apart and put low sec in between no high sec connections between empires
im for a return to yulai frankly the calls to move empires even further apart sound more like i want ccp to funnel easy target right into my crosshairs because im too lazy to work for my kills yulai back then was no worse then jita is now and this way everyone is more or less equidistant from the major market hub rather then having to pend twenty jumps getting there
that
i like his idea this will make fleet looks better like in all the trailers we need the fleet fly in some kind of formation rather than a big balli would suggest this space limit only work on ships in same fleet otherwise its fun to watch jita 44 undockmake the space wide enough that only allow 2 battleship squads warp to stargate within jump range at same timei know ccp tried to make squadwind concept to work this is a good solution to solve the problem
nothing ccp does now in the future and by example in the past will ever ever counteract the basic human nature to blob force wins and numbers are force even when they are not visible 5 of you 10 of them you leave even if theyre only in shuttles 55au awayccp never intended titans to blob or supercarriers but they did they introduced the dd to combat blobs but it became a blob weapon in its own rightif they take one action to limit blobs people will just find another way to blob if they are prevented from blobbing theyll just quit
this is inspired by real world submarines and the systems used to hunt them i believe i have found a way to not only keep the much loved cloaked hostiles ie afk cloakers but at the same make them partially vulnerable dependent on actionscloaked ships are undetectable much like submarines until they themselves emit a signal if a cloaked ship uses scanner or communicates with drones they can be probed as normal still invisible though for 20 secondsnew item bomb tactical antimatter chargeshares launch characteristics with regular bombs small antimatter detonation creates a wide area shock wave meant do destabilize cloaking fieldsexplosion radius 50km 10ship level debatable up to 100km maybedamage negligible 1 point enough to decloak no moreresult afk cloakers can still exist but if they are there to gather intel by scanningprobing they must keep moving in case a hunting party is dispatched after themwarping between safes fitting lowslot ie passive eccm and generally never standing still or not pinging  should be sufficient to avoid being caught so the lazycareless take a hit leaving everyone else to their devices
so an afk cloaker is unaffected except when he clicks directional scanner but why would he do that if hes afk the idea behind afk cloaking is to intimidate people out of using a system or having them comfortable with seeing you there and going about their business until you are ready to pounce there is no way to tell when a good afk cloaker gets back to his comp so you would have to be probing for signals constantly to try and find one or just ignore him as it is now this is no solutionyou are also forgetting the impact this would have on supercaps and other such ships i do not want to sit in a safe blind in my aeon and be unable to directional to find out if dictors or probes are on scan let alone being unable to start to align off because my engines will attract the probes im hiding fromi also see this changing gate camping mechanics considerably in 00 where bubbles give people a chance to catch competent cloakies within skilled roams an alt bomber with a decloaking bomb could sit 15km off gates wait for a cloaked ship to jump in and bomb if your guys cant decloak it immediately thats not necessarily a bad change because it requires planning and skill but it would take the power away from the cloaked blockade runner in the first place which is also a change that we may not necessarily want to make
actual afk cloakers will be unaffected as i already stated it only changes things when using cloaking to gather intel with impunity  it is not meant as a solution to afkers could quite frankly care less about them if you are isolated in a supercap and under cloak you must have messed up pretty badly natural selection dictates that an error of that magnitude be punished clarification only pinging either with scanner or contacting probes will allow for probing movement is unaffected which is why mentioned that an intel gatherer should keep moving as long as he is scanning to minimize riskthe timing needed to do what you suggest in regards to gate camps is out of this world consider bomb travel time plus that a mwdcloak runner doesnt have to wait for 30s but can move at any time he pleases and the chances of detonating in the split second after cloak engages but before warp initiates becomes astronomical  theoretically possible but highly unlikely
honestly i feel that youre trapped in a couple incorrect preconceived notionsthe first is that supers operating isolated are somehow doing it wrong i would instead point you to the many killboards my alts included where solo or small gangs or supers can take out enemy high value targets on mid point pos and cyno generators indeed the new cyno on pos nerf makes it much easier to do this after ganking a hostile cap retreating to a safespot to cloak and cap up is standard procedure not the oh crap i messed up goggogogo solutionthe second is the idea that cloakies get away instantly when bubbles are factored in assuming they dont gate crash and are caught in a bubble or subsequent bubbles dropped by smart dictor pilots in standard double bubble fits there is ample time after they decloak and the hunt begins to launch a bomb and decloak the gate grid in lowsec it would be impossible in nullsec it is far more game changing
the fact that supercaps scs in particular can actually function without any sort of support is part of the broken aspect of them that is one the hottest topics at presenti am not going to let broken ships and mechanics stand in the way of solving issues that are not even directly related to them  if it was up to me supers would not even be able to use cloaks a camp that is that well organized and manned should be hard as hell or even impossible to evade the fact that it is currently relatively easy is just a sad part of life with no easy fix ccp did try with the mwdcycleendoncloak but it wasnt enough just tightened the needed timing a bit
this is not a direct nerf to supercaps but eve is a complex game and you cant argue that one small change may not affect others if you desire to nerf supercaps you may as well just come out and admit that phowever to restate my earlier point in a bit clearer tldr way i dont think this change would solve anything that you are trying to fix and as an aside i disagree vehemently with your attitude towards super caps but ill let that slide so as not to derail the topic any further 3
also making an undetectable gate came impossible avoid in my opinion would be generating a broken mechanic not eliminating one if what you suggest should come to be then the gate should broad cast the current state of events of its sister gate to any traveler coming to it which i am sure you would be most disagreeable with
i propose that ccp at earliest possible convenience gives us a fixed ammount of opportunities within a given time period say 3 times within the first month of creating the first new portrait to redo our character portraitsfollowing the general discussion threads people have reported problems with and being dissatisified with their new looks i know it is a cosmetic issue and i am aware that it could mean some server strain but please ccp it would give ease of mind to many many playersthanks in advanceedit i wrote this from the perspective of us older players who had portraits prior to incursion but the same grace period should of course be given for new players as welledit2 this is not a whine thread and it is not an attack on ccp or the new character creator the proposal is simply aimed to allow players a grace period to redo their portraits as a part of the game as it is you have to petition a gm in order to get a redo making this a part of the game will take a lot of pressure of the gms and allow them to focus on more important tasks while at the same time saving players angst over portraits that did not turn out to their satisfaction
agreed
supporting my own proposal naturally
well i support this too better still i want my old face back
i support this fully as wella lot of players myself included will be bound to make trial and error mistakes and i believe we deserve a second opportunity to correct any errors weve made during the character creation process
absolutelyit way way too easy to make a halfwit with your first try but its as easy to do the same the second time if you cant continue where you leftive been doing almost a hundred different characters during the beta and more than a few times the next day i go over the screenshots i see a lot of room for improvement its like asking da vinci to paint mona lisa in one hour
agreed my character looked fine initially from the view in the portrait creator but certain details became more pronounced in the smaller version and now im not happy with the final product
suggest reading around before you jump on the bandwagon
saw it long after having to file a petition only puts more strain on the gms though hence the proposal to make it a part of the game
because ccp are totally able to make a patch that allows this take the server down and release it at peak
add this and give us tatoos
it should not require any drastic change to the server side at all at least nothing that requires more than a simple even optional patch and regular dt deployment
it shouldnt be that hard to implement this during downtime takes a lot of strain of customer support if they did this
signedccp should add a feature to the editor that once you defined the main look and shape of your character you can reload it  eg every 30 days  and change the posing eventually clothes hair style based on your original hair and other features to change your fashion style or secondary stuff not affecting the main anatomy  plus capture a new portrait this would give ccp the freedom to add more assets to the editor over the time and we are able to use it the new editor took so much time to create so why waste it for one time only and not using it again with limitations for incarna it just makes sense anywayactually i see a major problem that all the new chars look great and real but thats not enough compared to the old toons they look too much like ordinary human beeings than eve aliencheck this and you know what i mean
it has been suggested plenty of times in the last monthswe need the possibility to redo our portrait and the possibility to save a work in progress
i was initially under impression that each of the four snapshots will be randomly used at each logon the way the final stage of the character creator is set up is a little ambiguous and lacks clear instructions as someone has already mentioned putting this process through the petition system will put alot more strain on the gms
agreed it is was ridiculously unclear whether we would be allowed to have a redo

bah how about making ccp redo their char creator instead straight away not like this one is the shining pinnacle of current technology
supported the fact theres a time lag to have the system catch up would be fair enough of a trade offi dont see why they cant allow you to edit your profile atwill
even though my avatar is perfect for me i will agree like i said in other threadsccp should have clearly indicated that the 4 photos were to compare not to switch around ingame plus should add a are u sure warning box before hitting the save button this will solve alot of problem and reduce avatar related petitions i know they are gonna be very busy with the petition system this week xd
holy bump

altho to me all this arty stuff seems like a waste of time i agree that it would make the game better
uhm i think you got it all wrong corp mails are not in a corp mailing list but rather have corp tag attached to it different implementation technology besides you can use bulletins for a welcome message edit a solution would be to be able to edit default welcome mail a character gets when he joins a corp so yeah its possible and supported
yeah all i want is some automatic editable message for all new corp members either a welcome mail or why not in the answer to the application corp bulletins are nice and all but its not like they jump out and try to be noticed no they are hidden deep within the corp interface that normal members never ever use in fact what i want to have in the welcome message is an instruction for how to actually find the bulletins when i think of it it sounds more like a problem with the bulletins than anything else
supported if you mean to add a motd to the corpalliance channel by ceo and a default corp mail sent out when you first join a corp
yes thats exactly what im meaning
mining is an extremely dull and unchallenging profession and because it requires sitting still in one spot for long periods its also uniquely boring and dangerous consequently as a profession it has been almost completely overrun with bots lots of people want lots of minerals but they sure as hell dont want to stare at rocks for hours while they mine them its an open secret that the mineral economy of eve is pretty much dependent on bot product particularly the lowend mineralson the other hand quite a few players do genuinely like being involved in the resource gatheringitem production side of eve so i really dont want to see those people disenfranchised by giving in to locustswarms of bots on the one hand or by cutting the gordian knot and returning to reprocessing npc items on the other so how to reconcile making human players competitive with bots whilst maintaining a player economy whilst keeping resource gathering as a gameplay optionwell the core idea of my proposal is this its a pretty drastic change to what we have now but read the whole thing before you flip out because some of the implications will need a little thinking abouti propose that we get rid of mining barges yeah thats right no more retrievers no more hulks no more mackinaws burn them all that means no more strip miners either we are however keeping the orca and the rorqualto replace them we introduce a deployable anchorable mining module or rather a range of them with varying characteristics  see below the damm can mine asteroids out to a certain range up to say 15 or 18km and every few minutes it sends out a hauling drone to deposit the ore at either a station a corp hangar at a pos or in the ore bay of an orca or rorqual the hauler drones autopilot to the destination at back which means they warp at 15km then slowboat ini propose a range of damms roughly equivalent to the current mining barge range starting with the lowest tier or tech 1 which has a fairly shot range and low yield and simply mines the nearest asteroid until it is depleted then the next and so on until all the rocks in range are gone after which it simply stops at the highest level the damm can use mining crystals and can be set to mine ore types in order of preference and of course the best damms produce the most yield and have the best range meaning that they will produce more ore and need moving less oftendamms will be freely attackable even in hisec theyre pretty tough about as tough as a gsc so it will take considerable and concerted effort to destroy one on being attacked a damm alerts its owner so you can go do something about it the hauler drones will also be attackable and theyll be rather easier to destroy luckily theyre simple flimsy things and a damm can just make another one if its drone gets destroyed but of course any ore it was carrying will be lost so this means that damms can be either destroyed or have their flow of ore interdicted a neglected damm in a busy area is not likely to produce much ore for its ownerattacking a damm or a hauler drone naturally means that you are aggrod to the owners corp so if flipper ocan starts to interfere with your property you can go and do something about iteach miner can anchor a maximum of 5 damms 1 tech 1 damm can be anchored for every level of mining barge skill and 1 tech 2 damm can be anchored for every level of exhumers the miner can anchor his 5 damms anywhere he likesthe astrogeology skill will continue to give a yield bonus to dammsdamms must be anchored at least 5000m apart but other than that there is no restriction on how many can be placed in a beltdamms cannot be anchored in 10 systemswere keeping the standard mining modules so new players can still mine in ospreys and such and gas mining stays unchangedcomments  suggestions please
ive deliberately left specific yield numbers and other specifications vague  thats something for the balance team to considerthe important thing is that the worst parts of mining shooting stationary rocks and hauling rocks are now automated and the best gameplay parts finding the ore choosing the best spots etc are left in
on the first day every single belt would be completely jammed of mining structuresdo remember there are people with trillions of isks out there these people could entirely monopolize mineral market and drive everyone else out of business unless there is a limit to how many damm can operated by each characterand if the only way to get rid of these things in highsec is war declaration i can see small mining corp driven out of business by alliances because they simply wouldnt be able to afford the wardecsi think automating mining barges might work better give mining barges an automine option which causes the barge will continue to operate after the player logs off the best way to kill bot is to provide better builtin options
dammseriouslyyou call that a trollpathetic
p sure you missed that part where i said max 5 per characternope i said freely attackablethe whole point is to stop mining being so boring and focus on actual gameplay instead a mechanic which encourages people to log off doesnt meet that criteria nor does it sound very safe for the miner stuck in space im going to go ahead and say thats a really bad idea
supported if early 21st century people can make botlike programs to mine for them then why cant superfarintothefuture people make automining spaceships
the main point that i belive he was trying to make is that every bot user and his great great grandpa would have 15 of these mining platforms  3 chars per account deployed to cover a whole system  multipal accounts and come 23 hours after downtime there wouldnt be a spec of space rock left the unfortunat problem with implementing a deploy and profit idea is that it sanctions bot users by giving them a legal way to drop tritanium prices to 05 isk a unit at the moment they must at least fly a ship and hauler in system so you can at least shoot there ships know think about entering a belt to mine only to find 150 platforms set up and having to destroy each and ever one of them
im liking the idea but i need to think it over before supportingin regards to making highsec damms freely attackable vs alliances crowding out small mining corporations isnt it already possible for large alliances to crowd out small mining corporations in the current paradigm a large mining fleet working on a belt will get a larger share of the ore from that belt than a small mining fleet working the same belt each active account can currently only operate one mining barge or exhumer at a time while logged in and in the proposed system each active account can only operate a certain number of damms at a time aroundtheclock what difference would exist such that highsec damms must be attackable without a wardec to prevent large alliances from crowding out small mining corporations any more than is already currently possible on tranquility mchief117 posted while i was typing i think he answered my question but i really need to get some sleep before it will make sense
sure remove mining and change it to another passive income even better mining in specialized mining ships is so last century we should mine in logistics cap stable oneiros ftwwhile were at it botting is the new fotm if everyone is doing it why not boost the profession oh and dont forget to give some love to can flippers and suicide gankers the poor souls dont have enough fun alreadyin one word fantastic idea
i am totaly diging this idealbut it needs a bit more polish1 they only work when your loged in this stops none active alts from droping this things all over the place2 the damm will warp away after player logs out or even disconet from game just like a shipthe ideal of what you got is great but we do need to limit it to when your loged in as well as to stop this things from cluttering up all the belts toohell i think it would be awsome to drop this things into mission belts when the mission has a good one hahaso lets make them hauler drones able to use gates as well for mission mining and though systems were there are no stations you will have to set the place were the hualer drone is to deposit its goods
true be told i have can fliped to get back on my feet before lolz this would make it so much easyer if your doing it for the isk or ore and not just to grief some newbie as for the suicide gankers this is a great change for them as they can now keep concord out of it this things are attacable even in high sec no war dec needed
this sounds like a bad idea to begin with as an mining player myself i practically enjoy staring down the rocks like chuck norris stares down the books until he gets the information he needs i even enjoy mining the lesser rocks like veldspar for hours on end its like a weird fetish of sorts for manufacturing purposesto simply eliminate mining barges and exhumers will cause the following problems1 unlike the learning skills which were murdered during the last expansion mining barges and exhumers are the mainstay of the new eden economy along with haulers they are so intertwined into our economy that removing them just to combat the malicious bots is not only an epic fail waiting to happen but simply pointless bots will simply start using ships like the rokh vexor etc to mine as a supplement and with the existence of cargohold rigs and modules a vexor can have a decent cargohold to hold the ore for its class i guess well have to get rid of those too huh2 the price of minerals might climb a little too high for our liking given the lack of mining barges and exhumers capable of bring in the needed ores for production while players have to make due using their pvp ship as a mining ship and dont forget that the cargohold on these ships are not up to par with that of the barges or exhumers dont get me wrong i like to see tritanium being worth more isk but not to the point where only the wealthiest players can afford them3 even if each player is limited to only 5 damms as you so nicely named them funny though dont forget that each system could have between two to as many of dozens of corps competing for like what 12 belts and each corp has like what dozens if not over a hundred players those belts will dry up fast by the end of the morning and those who log in after will have nothing leftbut dont misunderstand me just yet i like the idea of a damm but just not as a main mining tool as a replacement for the barges and exhumers just like pi the damms can serve as a supplement and lets also not forget that there are players like me who enjoy looking at rocks flying ships that are specifically designed for this sort of job i tried mining in pvp ships before from cruisers to even battlecruisers and its no fun at all when your biggest limit is the size of your cargohold lets also not forget that not all players have access to an orca while the rorquals are still not authorized to enter highsec space which provides the biggest mining boosts and spacemy recommendationsat the very least keep the limit of damms to just 1 per player and have the players haul the ores themselves the same way they haul pi commodities from the customs office also the damm should only be a suppliment to barges and exhumers not a replacement and lets make it more interesting make the damms require frequent maintenance like replacing mining crystals along with daily calibrations as the various rocks disappear in the belt also limit the number of damms per belt to say 710 per belt in addition to observing concord regulations regarding anchoring units in belts this way the damms wont become another nuisance like the cans and wont over load the local node with excess units
uhm you obviously missed a bit of sarcasm in my post oh well nvm
i support this we have autofactories autoresearch labs and autopi why not automated mining
started off wellthen proposed a system that doesnt address the good starti dont even think attacking your damms would bother a bot scoop wait till threat gone redeploy bots that ignore your actions get boring real quickit would however bother a human to varying degrees which is the very best thing about your ideayour system doesnt advocate the removal of the orca either the single most visible abomination in the entire game of all the vessels in eve the orca is the least eve and all efforts should be made to remove them from the game not bargespersonally i like the muchbutnotenough touted idea of actual destructive strip miningchange the barges to be battlecruiser swift firing mining charges to break apart asteroids and then have to tractor andor manouver to scoop up the debris type of affairthe result being a much lower yield from each asteroid as much of the roid is lost as dust perhaps even a huge percentage like 80 but you take minerals into your hold faster than normal miningso you gain quicker and deny your competitors in the roids resource by destroyingsomething like that anyway passive bad active good
what if you dont want to mine everything in the beltsay you are mining for kernite but dont want any veldspari see this as being more work than its worth
then you skill up for the fancy t2 damms and set kernite to highest priority and veldspar to lowest then you only get veld if everything else has gone even if veld wasnt your priority its better than nothingthe idea is that people who want to afk mine will get the least value from their damms people who interact closely with them will get the mostthe point of the proposal is not to give miners a passive income but to put them on a level of equality with the botters by automating the hours of repetitive action that mining currently involves and focusing the miners on actually making decisions which is where they should have the advantage over the botsincidentally for the guy who was concerned that bots would automatically scoop their damms when they were attacked i dont think that its a problem its more of an opportunity when the bot turns up in a hauler to collect his large and bulky damms then thats the ideal time to gank him destroy his hauler and therefore some or all of his damms too remember that anchored objects take a little while to unanchor too
how is that different to warping to a belt to find 30 macrohulks stripping it bare
i appreciate that but there arent enough of your fellow fetishists to sustain the eve economy and you must admit that for most people mining is unbelievably boringbesides you can still sit in the belt and watch your damms shoot rocks if you want to not sure how that is so very different to watching a hulk doing the same apart from the rsi is tendon pain an essential part of your uh how to put this satisfactionthe best belts are already pounced on immediately after dt at least with damms the late tz guy can anchor his and get an equal bite of the cherry when the belts respawn my idea is actually kinder to the offtz guys than the current situationbots dont need sleep
one thing about mining is that it actually is quite labourintensive when youre the orca pilot and youre supporting half a dozen or more ships and if youre a piloting an exhumer with good mining skills and a boost from a fleet orca youre still reasonably busy as the strip miner cycle gets down to around 200 seconds i find myself checking planets and doing some trading so its not downtimealso mining gives you a chance to chat over strategies with corpmates and chat is a part of the game no
dragging an ore icon every 33 minutes doesnt strike me as reasonably busy but thats subjective i supposeyou can still chat away whilst optimising and repositioning your damms can you not my proposal still gives plenty of scope for the miner to be actively and closely involved he just doesnt have to do the mindless parts indeed the miner who just logs in anchors 5 damms and logs off isnt going to get much ore at all unless he does so in an unused systemsoh man did i totally forget to mention that my proposal would open up losec for mining i didnt shoulda forgetted that my proposal will open up losec for mining and since mining will be happening there that means there will be scope for losec industry as well
dude your idea is horriblebutif we get dams to be anhored in lowsec and nullsec only and deposit drone at a central box that can be destroyed by a cruiserbc sized ship or dang and has a gun or smth and drops some t2 salvage some sort of loot and all the ore it has collected through the day that would be fun and yes it would be free miningbut it would beslow miningand it wouldbe something destructable
so you think that players should be able to compete with mining macros everywhere except where mining macros actually operate
like i said i would only support it if the limit is 1 damm unit per player 710 such units per belt use it only as a supplemental income like pi make it observe concord littering regulations and make it require constant maintenance swapping wornout crystals that suffer damage faster and recalibrating the units every day while forcing the player to haul the extracted ores from the unit to the station as you would with pi and customs officesoh yeah almost forgot in a addition to the maintenance requirements you should be forced to retarget the unit once the rock being mined is depletedthe point of my recommendations is to make the player more active if they dont have my certain fetish of staring blindly at rocks all dayother than that not supported as giving such a unit too much power over mining barges and exhumers is a bad idea as i already explained and besides your vision of these units would just make it too easy for the bots to exploit and the players who have mined their entire lives would feel like an automobile worker being replaced by a robot that can not only do their job but can also deliver the owner a cup of coffee as well
the whole point of the proposal is to free the miner from finicky tedious mindless clicking should industrialists have to restart their queue after every unit of whatever theyre making is finishedwith my proposal the miner keeps all his advantages and counters all his disadvantages versus the mining bots your modifications would negate the whole point of the proposal i know it seems like a massive change from the way we do it now but the way we do it now is basically designed to give bots an advantage over humans since the ability to endure hour after hour of tedious repetition is promoted over the need to respond flexibly and make intelligent decisions thats exactly what needs reversingchange the mining game from who can put up with the most mindless boredom to who can be the smartest  thats my manifestoi want to reclaim mining for humans i want to reclaim losec for mining i want to reclaim 00 for mining heck i have 2 characters with exhumers 4 tyvm and id like to be able to leverage that investment  thats my interest in this declared right now the only exciting thing you can do in a hulk is get ganked
dammageddon just doesnt have the same ring to it id suggest keeping the mining barges but giving them a different spin to the autominers look at what happened with pi  its mostly automated but hardly profitable at this point i dont have a good response on how to make mining more interesting but this would at least deal with the botting problem  if there was a less rewarding yet legal way to bot this would be it
losing hulkageddon is the worst sideeffect of this proposal but never mind there are always mission runners
how is it im the only one here seeing this is just one big fat troll and everyone is getting suckered into iti mean come on damms
honi qui mal y pense
anybody else have any thoughts or input to this topic id hate it to slide inexorably to the 90 day forum limit and not have had a decent discussionmoar ideasmore criticism and analysisce
the issuethe distribution of lowsechighsec systems in its current state is a product of years of expansions and rezoning of security status this has resulted in a number of lowsec regions and pockets even individual systems that are isolated and trapped in the middle of highsec constellationsexamples include abha  derelik region derelik will be used an example throughout the rest of the proposalabstractccp should recognize the need to modernize the distribution of general empire security status not true sec just lowsec v highsec flags in order to create a unified lowsec that will allow travel from one end to the other without going through nullsec or highsec sec status should not be a remnant of past expansions or rp considerations it should be a result of careful planning to provide the best game play for eve subscribers the changes should be as minimalistic as possible to expand rather than revamp existing game playproposalall lowsec pockets should be able to be traveled to via other lowsec ex i can fly from lowsec in caldari space all the way down to minmatar space albiet slowly because of the increase in number of jumps required to skirt highsec therefore a minimum number of lowsec bordering highsec systems must be rezoned as 4 lowsec in order to allow travel andor a minimum number of lowsec gates  systems must be added to connect lowsec regions with otherspracticalitiesplenty of warning must be given of the patch that would introduce these changes giving any active players the opportunity to move their assets out of highsec systems that will become 4 sec if so desired although returning players may find that their former highsec system is now lowsec the reality is that game play must be improved for those paying to play the game now not those who may return at a much later date agents in 5 stations becoming 4 should be correctly scaled to give lowsec missions or be moved into highsec nearby i feel 4 sec status is the most appropriate for all these systems as it requires the least amount of rebalancing ex no moon minerals and should impact balance and game play the least if systems are added simply add them as bland 5 generated systems with random characteristics and no stationsagents that would require balancing gates are preferred to new systemsthe system sec change would not require every lowsec to connect to every other lowsec directly routes would connect pockets and regions without disturbing highsec connectivity examples would be envisioning the galaxy as connecting concentric circlesfaction warfareinner empire lowsec  highsec  edge of empire lowsec  nullsec with unpractical isolated lowsecs in highsec left as they are or raised to 5 status examples include in domain region mai neziel ruchyreasoning and caveatsthis is not a nerfbuff to highsec or lowsec in any way it is simply an attempt to rezone empire into more logical partitionsit would allow interregional lowsec roaming independent of nullsec travel lowsec pvp and corps should not be contained to small pockets unless they choose to the option should always be to roam outwards as far as desired exactly the same as nullsec corps have the option to reach other nullsec without traveling through highsec a logical expansion of this idea supported by ccps desire in the latest csm minutes to slow down easy logistics is to remove all highsec  nullsec connections either adding a lowsec system in between or lowering the highsec system to lowsec such as torrinos ditalexample rezoning in practiceopen the derelik image at the start of the post shedoo ihal uhtafal would become 4 lowsec a new gate would connect bairshir with akhard etc simple and straightforward
not supported modifying sec status of current systems  bad idea lowsec pockets add texture to the map even adding new jump routes on most of them would make those pockets significantly less interesting lowsec pockets  local flavour bland  badthe issue of limited lowseconly travel options does indeed make the game a little bit less interesting counterproposaladd a handful of new connecting systems to allow for a full lowsec circumnavigation of eve but not remove the lowsec pocket culture
were on the same page lowsec roams needs to be able to happen deep highsec pockets that arent remotely close to lowsec would be impractical to change and can remain as they are as mentioned however i should be able to roam from lowsec derelik to amarr fw space to find more fights without having to fly through highsec even if it takes me more jumps totalwhat pocket culture highsec gate hugging and rancer camping
so i was discussing eve with my 10 pals last nightthe topic of discussion moved on to high 00 isk generation with all parties agreeing that with the availability of limitless plex rats anoms the generation of isk 00 sec is nowhere near challenging enough some guy had the opinion that 00 isk generation should not necessarily be harder but should at least be more of a challenge that scaled with the size of the operation the complete removal of plex rats anoms officers was suggested and seemed to be widely accepted by a bunch of guys who live in 10 and know nothing about 00 isk generation whether or not this will actually happen though is anyones guess the general consensus was that the 00 isk generation should consist of more strategic and tactical planning than simply oh ill run officer on thursday
yes they should be forced deep into 00 where a computer can rat all day with impunity therefore a person can rat all day with impunity and make more isk than a level 4 rattersort your priorities outmake them run l3 and medium unstable energy neutralizer drops from 12m to 1m but the heavy version goes from 1m to 12mand not another change will be noticed
what a terrible op
and how will you create meta 14 items then
then i do not know stop working the lowest payed profession in the game and do something more useful gee liek train remote trade skills and trade while staring at the asteroids if you are mining as afk income then be quiet if it is afk income it should be low
basic ideasplit each of the four empires would be divided by low sec border zone with some small coridors of variable sec systems between the 2 friendly factions gallene and minmatar and caldari and amarr i will come back to the variable rules later now before you all panic let me explain the empire republics are big enough for each to support its own hub they are not as big as jita but they are big enough and they would grow while jita would shrink a bit the markets would not just die if the borders were entirely of low sec not null sec lets say 34 jumps deep it would stop the interregional freighter afk flights but still would allow it inside the region that would create market opportunities for stuff that is exclusive in one region and needs to be imported in the other be it through escort or covert transport this would lead to higher profit margins for the fewer brave you could also use jump freighters to limit the riskshell even a escort oriented corporation could form and police the corridors pirates would be happy as they have more targets now and the pirate hunters now have more targets as well skirmishes ensue fw have now a whole new playground fighting on the frontiers remember those strange variable sec system i have mentioned between friendly factions faction warfare folks were complaining how the plexes and system possession is of no point now it would have and big one if both the gallente and minmatar could hold majority of the plexes in their possession for lets say from down time to down time then for next cycle the sec status changes to 05 with only concord not faction navies present the other militia players can atack the fw targets fight can ensue like in low sec against enemy militia without enemy npc intervention when the enemy milita holds more plexes in the zone the sec drops to 04 in the variable low sec system so you are motivated to both attack and defend at same time industrial corps and alliances that want to have the corridor open would be motivated to pay the militia in some form to have that route openthis would be a great thing just have to think about it as an opportunity if you are mission runner now you would need to be careful crossing region to other agent or buy another ship and perhaps specialize in second one to use in the other empire increasing the demand for ships and fittingspos towers that are not of the native origin would have to have their isotopes imported increasing the prices and creating opportunities for trade it should create sort of a trading outposts on the borders not hubs for the ammo ships and equipment close to the front lines on both sides in stations for people to form up and reship after combat with plenty of trade opportunity there if done correctly and have multiple routs and not a gank alley would be fun it would cause pvp both in fw and with pirates and others just to clarify only the friendly factions could have the variable sec connetions amarr to minmatar and caldari to gallente you would have to go through low sec all the timewhat do you think please no total care bear whining i am a care bear and i think this would be good for trade for markets and eve in general and it gives something useful to do for the fw folks
not supportedwhyits a terrible idealow sec content needs rebalanced low secs solution is not to make it unavoidable people dont go because they dont want to go
can someone take more then 2 minutes including typing in reply and actually read the post thanksyou did not even read the post
i assure you i didnot liking your terrible idea does not equal not reading the post
1 and always use the dammed search function it has already proposed plenty of times 2 most the reason why it is a bad idea are already in the above mentioned thread so i will not repeat them there3 lets say it is implemented what should be done with caldari and amarr stations in gallente and minmatar space and with the gallenteminmatar in caldariamarr space 4 what should be done with pod pilot of the wrong nationality all amarr should be expelled from galmin space and pushed in calamarr space
this should have been done years agoccp did attempt something like that when they removed yulai superhighways and added some low sec between gallentecaldari and minmataramarr they just didnt go far enough and the end result was useless  as far as separating empires goeseve would feel larger and be much more exciting if there were high sec regions separated by several jumps worth of 00aside from massive pvp boost it would open opportunities for greatly enhancing trade both player and npc marketim guessing ccp wanted to do something like that from the start but in the beginning there werent enough players so ccp felt it safer to concentrate everyone in 1 safe area now the game has grown large enough to handle a split of empires besides people need new stuff this is one of those things that would make eve fresh again
not supported i absolutely loathe that certain areas of lowsec are isolated even individual systems trapped by highsecit allows for absolutely horrible and imo skilless pvp read gankers to sit in these systems on a highsec gate and if god forbid someone comes to pvp them they just jump to highsec and thumb their noses at them if anything lowsec needs to be interconnection to allow global roaming not isolated into regions and pockets
i maybe was not clear enough the low sec areas would be continuous not isolated pockets with connection to the periphery low and null sec system basically you could cross from one side empire to another in those areas the gay pirate case you described is a problem on every low to hich crossing and that can not be done away with
i do not know where did you get that idea you could be of any race and live in any place you want just like now provided you have not shoot on sight standings what is the problem again with the station where are you getting this from
i would like to propose sansha gate camps be placed in high sec incursions to gank the afk freighters and other afk autopiloting folks not just in lownull sec
almost forgot to support own topic p
we all know about teh recons and their main ewar buffscaldari  ecm jammer strength both recons have itminmatar webbing range both recons have itgallente disruptor and scram range both recons have itand the famous curse for its neuting range bonus problem is  the pilgrim doesnt have the bonus in fact  the only difference between the two ships are that the pilgrim can cloack and the other has neut range is that normal the problem with the current system is that all teh other recons can just decloack at in some cases extreme ranges and effectivly apply their ewar the pilgrim still has to be within 12k to neut thus making it dangerous for teh pilgrim alone to ambush someone in a fleet fight for example  since all the others will be way out of pointing range once they decloakmy proposal is that the pilgrim be granted a similar if not slightly reduced range to neuts as the curse
well heres the thing the other recons have 2 ew bonuses on both combat and force variants the combat variant trades the cloaking bonus for a 2nd damage bonus all have at least 1 the pilgrimcurse is the exception the curse trades the cloaking bonus for a neut range bonus rather than a second damage bonus i dont think anyone is complaining about this but it does result in a large disparity in the flying style the two ships use i rather like the two as is the pilgrim being a brawler relying on the cloak to get in close while the curse does the kiting nano otry however if a bonus change was in order it would make sense for the neut range bonus to be on both with only the strength bonus applying to the curse that however would be a very hard nerf to the pilgrim imhoedit first post with new avatar i dont recognize my own face i also miss my mohawk damn you ccp for removing it
the pilgrimcurse is the exception the curse trades the cloaking bonus for a neut range bonus rather than a second damage bonushmm  then why not put in a more significant dmg bonus on teh curse like instead of 10 per lvl  like 12 per lvlbecause  right now  its doing only as much dmg as a t1 arbitratoralso you mentioned that the pilgrim is a brawler i kinda agree with that  but it doesnt tell me why all the other races can just do as much dmg ewar included from 50k and not need to get closer  while the pilgrim must crawl litterally to its targetimho  the pilgrims brawler status makes it inappropriate in a fleet exept if your willing to stay at 50k and just td tracking disrupt that means only using half of its intended ewar
good luck with that there used to be a major threadnaught about the pilgrim et al back in the days ccp aint gonna do squat about it they didnt even deign to reply to that back then just live with it being the redheaded orphan of recons you can still use it as a throwaway cyno recon haha
not supported the two ships fly differently you kite with the curse you creep up into range while cloaked with the pilgrimthe pilgrim does not need the range bonus
could you post that thread plzi cant find it
if you maintain abundance differences then you will have solved nothing people will just harvest whatever gives the most iskmoons should be more evenly distributed across the regions so that you cant have one faction that can corner a market like we see with technitiumeither that or their values should be closer to each other to avoid obvious bottlenecks  monopoliesalternately the content of the individual moons could be randomized on a 36 month cycle thus requiring new probing and reconfiguration of pos plus opening for fights over new moonsifwhen ccp realises that capitals especially supers should be restricted in lowsec then making certain moon types exclusive to the area could be a huge boon for the pewpi should be able to produce all materials at varying efficiencies so that bottlenecks in supply can be minimizedalas there is no easy fix
hmm having people be able to put a colony on a moon with their pi would be interesting then you might actually have people fight over stuff in dusti agree that the moons need a looksie into though either have some other products also restricted to other regions or unrestrict the regions of technetium
why not just expand the availability of moon harvesting entirely allow fluctuations and changes on a downtime cycle so all moons have the ability to produce all possible resources introduce a system where moon harvesters will cycle out for sudden lack of resources and when a short survey is done it proves that a new yield of another mineral has been discovered undefined quantities is the key you may well no how much you may collect per hour from the surface but it may be more difficult to determine how long you might be able to do so introduce some of the elements of planetary interaction to moon harvesting not on the level of npc labourers and engineers on the surface but in technological advances that allow you to produce better results from your harvesting deeper ability to understand what lies beneath the surface and determine how long mineral veins may play out based on your surveys allow for depletion of mineral resources while maintaining that they still yet exist there make it skill based make it available in wormholes and even highsec but limit quantities based on npc populations this is part of the logic i believe behind resource limitations in planetary interaction it has been mined it is being used and the playerbase is just further limiting available resourceslow security space will have less than null and highsec might not even be worth doing 10 systems should be virtually depleted of all available assets perhaps the same for 0809 concord limits capsuleer access to allow for resources to play out longer for the various npc factions that require them for their own needssure make it available in dust 514 but make it something the playerbase there does of their own accord something to create their own means of income outside of what may be available to them from war contracts a way for them to interact and develop there own sustainable infrastructure pirating marauding territorial wars even faction missions and empire building why shouldnt dust 514 have the availability of player owned command centers with the ability to build and maintain ground vehicles weapons and all they need to wage war a bit beyond the initial release of course but something to look forward to the endless drudgery of fighting over eves player owned planetary infrastructures or that as the most profitable means of developing an income between other things so moons become the sole providence of dust 514 mercenary companies disturbed only by the occaisional orbital harvesting array though such things would only occur well away from where lunar colonies would be affected so the other side of the moon is a capsuleer induced gaping hole so what i always thought dust 514 should use the same skillbased system as eve though perhaps with an entirely different set of skills why not alter moons they dont benefit hardly anybody outside of specific alliance held territories theres no reason to believe that those territories shouldnt have great moons but that doesnt mean other areas cant have moons that produce the same thing in lesser quantities
fyp
all the good moons in low are owned by massive sov holding alliancessurely you dont expect this to change just because there are more of them
which is why i advocate further restrictions on capitals in lowsec if moons there are to be buffed take away their big toys and lowsec citizens generally curbstomp equal size null gangs talk to the hand  benefit of intimate knowledge of the ships and not relying on bubbles hotdrops bridges and what not to get aheadsubcap brawls  best brawls
give moons finite quantities of goo and when its tapped out another moon elsewhere in an entirely different region low and null in equal measure suddenly has a new vein discoveredof course the existing goo on that moon may still be mined away in complete blissful ignorance it would require probing the moon again to discover if any new resource veins have been discovered
get all those drones dropping moo goo instead of minerals would fix mining as well as keeping moon min supply available as mostly renters killing drones and selling the stuff
hmm the last couple of times my alliance reclaimed moons in lowsec last summer after that big war we did it in battleships not sure what restriction on capital use in lowsec would changethe only thing that would fix is the income of botters in drone regions
no it will bring the exact same blobs and mass sec hits to lowsec as well as fights on nodes that generally arent prepared to handle themsmaller entities wont magically get tech moons because its in lowsec go look at the tech moon in bosborger heimatar its been changing hands between the russians pl nc for as long as i can remember they arent exactly lowsec entities preal issue is absolutely asinine and corrupt decision to bump technetium up as the t2 bottleneck and thusly most valuable mineral in the game and oh hey look its only in the north even the ideas that advocate moon depletion wouldnt solve this issue having all tech moons respawn in the north doesnt remove the norths monopoly of the market at the time of this writing tech is up to 75k a unit in jita an eve high which gives it roughly 53bil profit every 30d with only mining not even reacting the next highest is neodynium at 18bil a month mining with the rest falling off quickly after that with hundreds of text moons controlled by the northern bloc for alliance income macros for personal income etc its no wonder isk is irrelevant in eve and supercap creep is the problem that it is end rant
why was this overlookedalso a hotkey to give focus to the most recently open window and to open advanced settings or make show advanced default an option would be very welcome
next expansion is going to have ai that will eat dronescpp thinks hybrids are fine because blasters do lots of damage could dowith the pages of player comments asking for something to be donewell it would be nice to see a dev say something even acknowledging there is a problem instead of the usualblasters are the highest damage blah blahthat they usually respond withedit please forward your support here
can we acknowledge that small hybrids are totally fine instead of the usually blah blah hybrids suck bullmedium and large may be bad or whatever but small hybrids are total pwn just compare an arty jag to a rail harpy i dont want them to fix hybrids and next thing i know i have to avoid daredevils and ishkurs like the plague
most frigates already avoid them like the plague tbh
they dont hate gallente they just give some more love to minmatar and amarrnot being a constructive suggestion i wont support it since there is nothing specific to be supported anyway
yes this was more of a rage posti have summed it up in a more proper post in a betteer sectionplease excuse my qq at the top and support this page
thats more like it
ccp have delited all of my posts and the topic i made about gallente needing rebalancing
nope i think i just cant see my own posts anymore hrmm maube when servers are actualy up it will be better again p
well if kinda wish they had deleted themreading is the first step right
they dont hate gallente the devs in general simply dont pvp there was this devs what do u do in eve topic on the other day and most devs run missions or do fw we all know blasters dont get used in pve and fw has less trouble of balsters since taranis and daredevils are fast enough to get in range and scram people of the devs that do pvp maybe only 10 flies gallente so not enoguh supportthey come up with nice graphs about how turrets and blaster are balanced will but on the battlefield we all know they simply dont work gallante ships are just desighned bad or nerfed too much their roles are worng and sometimes they have 3 different weapon systems a good exapmle is the lachesis drones turrest and missile launchers the only reson why people fly them is because drake blobs are populair atm all ships above t2 size of gallante above frigats are broken well maybe the ishtar is good for plexes but that isnt pvp snt it
actually i would contest the factconsider that the overwhelming body of fictional work also written by ccp devs loves to beat up on gallenteans to the point where several of the rptypes started picking up on itconsider the game balance issues that have been beaten to death in this subforum and others its not just their weapons systems is over half of the factions ships all three of their weapons blasterssuck drones are less effective than they ought to be railguns are plain terribad their defensive systems active armor tanking sucks their ewar wtbeoslololol their mission agents experimental missions that screwed every llente mission runner upid love  love  to know who at ccp was handling or representing gallente in dev teams and then suddenly quit if you compare the t1 gallente lineup with the t2 lineup it would appear someone completely lost the plot it was like all of a sudden somebody threw in the towel then almost everything past that point was crap
hybrids are weak unsuitable for gallente design and have huge fitting requirements
bulls eye
i realise this is going to be a minority thread but hopefully it might get somewherefirst off ccp  devs do a great job in keeping the osx client going as much as possible what they really dont do is keep us informed of the problems and when there is no actual update this leads to a lot of very annoyed players cos they just downloaded 5gb to find out that it still doesnt work add in the fact that were asked to test on sisi in the middle of a ton of posts about how sisi doesnt actually have a mac patch it just seems like someone isnt linking the mac and ccp communities togetheris it possible to get someone to act as said link and actually update the instructions for sisi the patch status for tq and sisi fix all the references to running the exe files etcwe dont mind not having stuff so much if were told we cant have it cos of x or even that something went utterly horribly wrong and its gonna be a week or so but on the other hand i really do feel that this situation could have been avoided if the mac sisi client was kept inline with the windows client i realise that this is in many ways a tall order but if youre going to do synchronised releases please have synchronised test server releases so that things can actually be tested by players on the client that will be released as close as possible
youve already been corrected on the rest which i edited out let me fill you inturrets are acceptable in situations where range and speed are controlled otherwise their damage is penalized into nothing there are target painters and webifiers if you want to increase your damage with missiles against small sig or fast moving targets this is called playing the game a volley of missiles has huge alphal2play pretty much
i would like to see the ability to set bounties on players that are only available to your corp or possibly alliance i think it would be cool if a ceo could set up 1 special wallet division for bounties and put bounties on specific people that only pay corp members who kill them a menu that allows even more options would be very cool in my opinion for example a menu that lets you set bounties for each class of ship and category of player such as by standing to your corp neutral red war target etcso a ceo could for example set a bounty for 20k isk for a red cruiser 50k isk for any bs with a negative standing to the corp or 50k isk for any podif there was no money in the wallet division then the bounties dont pay and the same rules for npc bounties as to who gets them could apply and they could pay in ticks every so often like npc bounties it seems that almost all the info need to do this exists in the current npc bounty mechanics and the kill mail generation very respectfully ayyya
i do not see sense in support of this ideasimply in games it is necessary to play on a game pcnotebook with any sm3040 integrated video card like ati mobility radeon hd2400 or nvidia geforce 9700m gt at leaston the markets there is very much a wide choice of such notebooks now and even at the low pricenow it is possible to find a notebook even with a ati radeon hd5470 512mb video card for only 450 euros 
i will not rest until eve has made obsolete 100 of the playerbases computersenforce shader model 400 now when im zoomed out to 200km i want to know that the single pixel i can see has been calculated no fewer than 100 million times
i would love to see the proof on this one and dont tell me 2 of your corpies quit coz thats not a lot of key players please proof what ceos of major alliances and service corps quit because of thisow and ofc not supported update to recent hardware and quality
supported
halo useless youre saying that 25 reduction in signature is useless in what world are you living in
its not as useful as snake setim sure it may be a personal preference for some but the fact remains that speed is more important than sigbut hey i am not serious about removing those implant sets i was just suggesting a way to make them more valuable whenever i loot some talisman or halo implants its always very disappointing to see the jita prices
modules and items that increase armor amount numerous hg slave set  53 more armormodules and items that increase speed numerous hg snake set  37 speed boost down from 53 originallymodules and items that increase active shield boost amount a few rigs  boost amps hg crystal set  53 shield boost bonusmodules and items that affect nosneut amount none ship bonuses only hg talisman set increases cycle time 37 talisman unique but nerfed compared to slavecrystalmodules and items that lower signature none interceptor ship bonus only hg halo set  37 lower sig radius massively gimped compared to all other setsslaves my alt has a set and crystals boost already existing modules and ship bonuses considerably far and far beyond the bonuses granted by sets that have no or very very few ship bonuses rigs or modulesyes some implant sets need to be massively buffed talisman halo whereas slaves and crystals need to be brought in line with snake due to a host of other affecting modules rigs and ship bonuses
first off let me just state whats probly already knowen about me i dont fly capsbut the good news for this one is i dont need tooi was here for the fall of the battle ship well basicly the same thing has to happen to super carriers too for all the same reasonsi think the easyest thing to do this would be limiting the super carrier to fighter and fighter bomber drones only on any drones pass the first 5 thats right only the first 5 drones can be something other then fighter and fighter bombers then balance the bomber drones so they only work right on caps and possthats my ideal if someone alse gots better ones though them up hereflame away
supporting my own idealand remeaber bigger is not meant to be better or one ship kills all
take away their ability to field twenty of the damn things at a pop bring them down to the same five all of us subcapital pilots are limited tosupercarriers definitely need a rather drastic correction 1 of them should be a significant force on the battlefield but twenty should simply not be possibleor take away their ability to use drones smaller than fighters or whatever some method by which subcapitals in the vicinity of one are not instantly vaporized by a single salvo of fighterbombers or a dreadnought under the onslaught of 20 of the damn things
there is already a thread on the front page of this forum dealing with a nerf to super carriers we dont need another one p
as with the previous linked threadid have to give a thumbs up to reducing drastically the range a supercarrier can jump and a titan a shorter distance still the bigger the ship the shorter its jump rangemake it dependent on total mass allowing an empty jump freighter to go scary distances while a fully laden one maybe half as far dreads should have their range extended carriers only slightly less so while supercarriers and titans should have very very reduced spheres of immediate force projectionmake titans well titanic make them a force to be reckoned with within their limited sphere of rapid deployment but not something that can be launched half way across the map at a whimto compensate the pilots trapped in them make them anchorable and once thus anchored become a pos for all intents and purposes with a shield anchorable mods that it can launch drones that act as pos guns ect but maintaining that way would be expensive yet not leave it vulnerable to any shmoe who can pilot one sneaking by the shield pw that way a titan pilot can have some sense of security in locking his titan down in space while they fly smaller shipsor just allow the fool things to dock somehow
sorry not taking dd rebalancing advice from the nc guy most responsible for pl titan kills just seems a bit selfserving especially when your coalition has approximately 50 titans now your suggestions dont really nerf them when you can bridge in one after another and use the ideas you propose but is an outright nerf for those alliances that have 10 no offence to you personally yaay but this seems like letting the fox design the henhouseyour ideas might effect certain friendly offensive  defensive titan mods but does nothing to prevent them from jumping out and at this point those with mod damage due to your heatproposal have already done their part anyway thus you can clear the field quickly with a number of your modified dds and sufficient support fleets and still not harm friendly titans meaningfully that is the heat damage you talk about does nothing against a mod that isnt there the jumpout option again this idea works well in a coalition with so many pilots and titans to draw upon but does nothing for smaller to midsized alliances that have to make due with smaller number of support  titansinstead bring back the old dd effect in a mannerboost the singleeffect dd to something meaningful like 5m damage would hurt scs more and please nerf sc hp and fb damage via a script and allow for an aoe 250km range 200300k damage aoe with a second script and reduce the dd cycle time  immobility penalty to 5 minutesthis method would prevent the mindless blobbing of titans as is currently the case titans are supposed to be badass right now people blob a titan while simultaneously getting ready to post on caod about another titan killmake hostile fcs think about how they want to attack the titan rather then just sending everything in as is currently the casemindless blobbing may be nice for the larger alliances  coalitions but it prevents the smaller to midsized alliances from using these ships as anything more then expensive jbsas you and i posted in another thread about sc nerfing titans should be feared let the larger alliances  coalitions have slug fests with a number of supercaps titans and scs on the field but allow for smaller to midsized alliances have useful titans againpeople are supposed to fear a titan  not hunt and blobkill them with relative impunity or do i need to point out the nearly 20 tian kills in the last month alonewith the relative weakness of titans to scs titans are immobile after the dd  scs can attack at will and jump out once capped up and the proliferation of scs titans need a boost badly scs a nerf even more badly and that doubly quick
actually the titan should not be the endallbeall uber iwin button nor should supercap blobs but heyit should be returned to the role it was originally intended for a bastion around which fleets can rally the mere presence of one should not be a hey look big fat target all alone or run away there are ten of them but rather a floating obelisk that is like a command ship on super steroidshaving one present on the grid should give massive buffs to all sub capitals working in its area 50100km radius for example shield and armor resistances capacitor regeneration sensor strength and scan res ect it should not buff their damage because when stacked with bonuses to all other system it would turn subcaps into dreads that move fast but it should give them radically improved capabilitiesthe bridge should be improved as far as the number of ships a single titan can bridge but not their raw mass no caps freighers ect as a matter of fuel consumed to bridge all ships using the bridge should require a massrelated spoolup prior to bridging howeverthat is what a titan should be not a spam blobbed station killer with little other useful roles
biomass  titans currently do not give any damage bonuses to the fleet they give defensive bonusesbut you bring up a good point caldari titans give a bonus to shield amount thats all nice and neat if you have some preptime ahead of an engagement so you have a chance to passively or actively rep your shields but means nothing if you hotdrop  react to an incomming fleet when the bonus is applied you show red on your shields with a greater unrealized shield amount and not an instant increase like you do with armor as exampleunlike other titan bonuses cap regen  armor ammount  sig radius the caldari bonus is pretty meaningless atm as it takes something time or repping to realize the bonus from the titan and this gap happens with every session change bridging et cetera for the fleet ship and also titan itselfgiven many aliances interest in drake fleets atm this is a meaninful and much needed changeand while i agree with you that titans should not be some sort of iwin button for smaller to midsized alliances the presence of a titan could help secure sov by preventing hostile fleets from blobbing through a gate even with the dd delay slower ships typically the higher dps dealing ships cannot simply warp off and avoid the dd bubble the gate and bring in the titan for larger alliances  coalitions there is the strengthinnumbers for offensive and defensive ops but for the smaller to midszed alliances the possession of a titan was something of an equalizer that has been lost since the loss of the aoe ddif ccps intent was to allow for more easy sov changes visavis other game mechanics changes fail all the removal of the aoe dd has done is to remove one of the few defences a small or growing alliance had against the blob of the more established alliance  coalition
hah want to counter the supercarriermothership blobsimplecut the isk sink cost for a cyno jammer by 75move them inside the pos bubbleif an alliance wants the turf theyll have to pos bash in subcapsccp introduced sov upgrades so systems can support more people but then came up with the idea of 00 systems changing hands willy nilly at the drop of a super blob doesnt make much sense either waysovs difficult as sin and expensive to establish and can be wiped out as easily as kicking over a tower of cards especially with the current rolling blobs of supercarriers 41 alone on a titan kill the other day plus 10 or more titans sov structures like tcus ihubs and stations simply dont stand a chance
agreed to a point sov has gotten rediculously easy to challengeexcept you dont need to posbash the whole pos with a subcap fleet you just have to incap the cynojammer then let the flood come inyou could cut the jumprange and  or increase the fuel consumption costs of jumping  bridging supercaps significantly and thereby make supercaps more defensive in nature
now that i would agree withmake jump range mass dependent the lower the mass of the ship jumping the further it can jump thus an empty jump freighter can go a scary long way but fully laden its jump range is halved or worsedreads would be able to go very far carriers almost as far supercarriers should have a shorter range still and titans not very far at all
while we all love eve fitting tool i was wondering while fitting up a ship why ccp hasnt integrated a diagnostics bay or something to the effect like automotive diagnostics to check the cars performance would it be possible to have a separate bay to be able to test the ships active modules maybe a firing bay as well to test dps and volley this would seem to fit perfectly with the enhancements to stations that are being proposed there could even be an animation of the ship being escorted into the diagnostics bay the main difference between this and eft though is that the pilot would have to be able to equip the modules as well as have them on hand while eft allows the pilot to use any module and ship eft could then be more geared towards skill planning and the new diagnostics bay would be to get a quick read out of active modules and dpswhat do you all think
i hope ccp looks into this after they are done with the update although i dont regret spending all these years training for gallente ships because im not a meta gamer i do something for fun and not to to gain advantage over others but also dont want to be penalized for simply preffering gallente ship and faction design
it was gracious of you to admit and a service to the community for you to put in the link to gm grimmis june 2010 postingthis would not be the first time ive seen junior gms say one thing and seniorlead gms another so i suspect you actually did see something that at least had the appearance of rescinding the ruling in questionbest regardswindjammer
my favorite part about this thread is the dualpropped noctis
hahahahahahaha get out forever
wow man well put
although i hate your shiptoasting in caod this is pretty much my exact thoughts on the cap situation and i agree 100 my suggestion would be to allow dreads to interrupt their siege cycles however  this would take an additional cycle of stront this would give dreads a bit more versatility than siege up and do as much damage as you can before you die but would introduce a bit of stront management into the mix maybe to increase the management side of it ccp could reduce the amount of stront that a dread can carry  making it more strategicthoughts
so wind lets keep trackyour argument is that ccp could have just decided to claim an nda breach existed where none did and totally made it up but they have more lawyers so ank couldnt have won on the facts and gotten them to eat her legal fees too and it was probably totally invalid except youd also like to claim that there are a number of csm members who could be accurately accused of breach of the nda even though you dont even know whats in the nda but ank wasnt one of those who could accurately be accused and people are unfairly trying to demonize her for merely losing her temper not that instead of acting like a normal person who loses their temper and fumes a bit or maybe says something rude she responded like a toddler throwing a temper tantrum and hurled cutlery at someone which you deny or at least refuse to learn anything about while suggesting that its a conspiracy and bit of rumor mongering against ank and now youre dishonestly claiming that it was distorted and blown out of proportion reminds me of a certain antipirate rabidly ankbooster who actually claimed that the facts about anks spoon chucking didnt exist and the story itself was a lie since ank only threw a spoon at someone but it hit the table instead of that person not that your metal or plastic punk trolling wasnt funnyand naturally the char youre posting with has been in an npc corp for the last 3 years solid with apparently no actual pve or pvp experience so post with your main unless you burned it during the whole ank campaign in the first place
exactlywind go the  away ank is gone thank everything and she no longer needs a bunch of sycophantic followers who cant prove a thing about her innocence according to ccp she breached the nda that is all that we all need know she is an unstable at best player whom used the pve community to get elected pvp is what this game is built around tldr ank and  you
reading finn accuse someone else of acting like a toddler is amusing no one knows what happened between ank and ccp was an nda broken or was there a difference of interpretation on what terms did ccp and ank finally part will one or the other eventually pursue legal remediesone day we may have more information to answer this question currently we do not as a private legal matter that is as it should be windjammer does have the right of it however when noting the usual suspects sought to demonize ank it is the reason i and others entered this argument in the first place whether or not one agrees with or likes ank the personal attacks on her were and are over the top finns posts exemplify this windjammer has done a nice job of assembling several quotes from the record my personal favourite however is by mynxee csm chair hardly a supporter or confidant of ank she called the antics around spoongate a witch hunt pandering to rabid trolls under the guise of sharing information this was part of her selfdescribed rage post which she subsequently modified what interests me more than this stale conversation about anks past is what will happen in the future ank may have a defamation case against the usual suspects they often state that harm done her reputation in game will diminish her employability as a game designer and they continue to smear her by her real name long after she is gone from eve claims that ank is mentally ill are a case in point all this says far more about finn and friends maturity and integrity than it does about ank it may also end up landing them in hot water the fact that they are hiding behind internet characters does not absolve them of responsibility it will be interesting to see if anything more comes of this cheers delilah
ah we have another obvious ank troll and if your trolling is as predictable and obvious as always we know who the alts main is too speaking of how you troll pretty much without exception when defending a disgraced insane person like ank you are actually now reduced to talking about me in the third person and playing a game of lalalala i cant hear you while you troll and allege that other people are acting like toddlers a lietroll you used in the first place because you continually troll for ank an you cant decide to lie and claim that the factsarent true or to simply play dumb and pretend that adults throw silverware at eachother when they are annoyedno your alt does not have the right of anything as i pointed out all of itsyour arguments are dishonest andor trolling just like you troll and claim that my posts which are 100 factual are over the top just like you and other trolls for ank claimed and evidently still claim that reality and facts themselves are out to get ank and demonize her yes reality has a well known antilunatic bias sad but trueand yes someone unable to tell the difference between fantasy and reality who thinks that people who play pirates in a game are really sociopaths in real life yep that person is mentally ill speaking of the intersection of dishonesty trolling and a completely unhinged view of reality i eagerly await the lawsuit you keep gleefully threatening silly trolloh and speaking of how you lie and troll constantly gotten any kills within the las two years to back up your claim if how very much you love to pvp no
does your corp and alliance know youre posting this idiocy with their name for all to see surely theyd be embarrassed by it reread my post youve either misread or are intentionally misconstruing what i actually saidreread the quotes in post 667 from members of the csm that were there during the nonevent theyre clear on what happened and the atmosphere of the situation theyre not my conclusions or observations perhaps youd like to tell those members of the csm that you think theyre being dishonest yes the windjammer character is around 3 years old my mains are a lot older you might wish to use an alt to post with yourself that way you wouldnt have to risk having your corp come here and disavow knowledge of your activity its one thing to have a position its quite another to display your ignorance prejudice and inability to reason while showing your corp colors and thus reducing the corp you belong to in the eyes of the worldwindjammer
thank you for your unbiased balanced and well thought out words youre obviously well in touch with your inner child and tough guy wannabe youve even learned how to use the f word good for you
yah similar writing style similar trolling style similar patterns of blatant dishonesty if youre not daliah youre a clonenow of course youre lying about the content of your argument but youd have to since you were trolling if you admitted that im right youd have to admit you were trolling so instead you plug your fingers in your ears and try a good ol argument from nunh unhhtell you what troll name one single bit of your arument as i just described it that you claim is in the least bit inaccurate and ill quote exactly where you said it at which point you might admit you are trolling or use the typical ank commando gambit of claiming that reality itself is out to get youspeaking of how reality is cruelly persecuting ank and her minions the csm members who correctly described anks cutleryflinging temper tantrum were being accurate and ive never said otherwise troll you hoever are dishonestly describing the events to spin them as much as humanly possible because you just like all the other alt trolls for ank truly sad considering that she is not only a disgraced crazy person but a disgraced crazy person who no longer has anything to do with eve have reality itself as your enemy just like you want to describe an adult hurling silverware during a business meeting as a non eventthe facts show that ank was a child with poor impulse control given to temper tantrums and throwing things well erm everybody gets frustrated sometimes the facts show that ank was mentally ill and did not understand the division between reality and fiction reality is a smear thats out to get ank ayieeeee even the fact that the ank bots are obviously mostly alt trolls well that is to say hrmmmm lowell u r posting wit ur main lowellpost with your main troll and try being honest
there is no need for me to indicate an element of my argument all those bits of my argument have already been written in this thread all a reader has to do is read them compare them with what youve said and see for themselves how silly you are did you imagine you were so clever as to be able to change what i said your absurdity is apparent to even a child how is it that you dont see thatplease call me troll one more time im sure youll finally manage to irritate meagain the csm members themselves who were there describe the nonevent mynxees phrasing in excerpt 22 in post 667 of this thread describe it in detail describe the feelings surrounding the situation and the atmosphere at the time i did not spin anything its not my description its theirs sorry you cant work the observations of the participants into your version of realityis there someone i can contact for you a care giver or doctor you seem to be off your medicationsor in need of somewindjammer
sorry finn but it is me delilah i dont know windjammer and i dont believe hes ank not her writing voice i know hes not me if windjammer and my writing voice sound similar to you its because you are hearing two reasonable people coming to similar conclusions about your screeds windjammer thank you for taking the time to put together detailed interpretations with extracts ive tended to make broader points and then reference the threads your fine grained analysis is just what is needed cheers delilah
bump because of this post
well three cheers for the new char creator way to screw up another expansion despite the warningsmisgivings you got in advance ccp considering how there are some gripescomplaints about lack of diversity and racebloodline specifics over the forums exactly as stated in advance to you makes one wonder why one should even remotely bother to try to bring stuff to ccps attention not like theyd care anyway me hangs back and waits for yet another patch to fix the patch
its not much of a grind anyway
for those of us privileged to have had our alliance logo put into eve id love to have mine on the background of my portrait in some fashioni think this should be top priority
supportedeven if in my humble opinion is not only blasters and rails that need fixes but also revamp ship bonus so that the whole thing works better than nowthis is where im mostly concerned but also support all other chosen pointsedit wanted to bow my new masters the sanchas because wallentes are just a bunch of gays and junkeys
i agree there is a lot to be fixed about gallente most of it is really blasters  rails issuesbut dont you dare mess with my drone boats
vote no  you think that because you pay a set fee each month that you should have access to all the options and features ingame that everyone else getsthere are enough silly games like maplestory and what not that do this already micro transactions would add nothing to game play
nonot following the path of other mmos is what makes eve such a refreshing change selling gtcsplex is one thing they not only provide isk to the seller but provide a means for another player to add game time microtransactions do not
noi will not pay double for a gamemicropayment or standard contractboth in the same system is monetization which i will support with canceling of 4 accountsim more willing in paying 1 per account per month and get all the stuff for iskUFFFDs and be able to design things myselfno no noim paying already enough for this gameif micropayment will effect any graphical or ingame expirience im gone instantlymicropayment for changing my charpicture or charname or deleting my company history yes like paying for transfering an account the problem in this system is that a plex is relativly worthfully with around 15 so there has to be a second money system which i will not supportthere should be no way that eve uses more money than subscription from ingame think of childs which dont know what they are doing

well one thing i do agree with is that supercarriers do too much damage indeed and i can imagine that tackling 40 of them over a longer period of time is a tough thing to accomplish on the other hand i dont like the idea of leaving them more or less totally defenseless against 12 hics by crippling all the antisubcap abilities too hard even though they are predominantly capital killers they should still have some semidecent form of defenseat this point the most reasonable thing to me seems to be the idea of giving them 1 drone per lvl and 3 drones per dcu along with say 2533 total damage reduction on the bombers itself they would still be able to do massive damage if they are fitted with carrier class damage mods ie dcu while they would at the same time sacrifice selfdefense capabilities somewhat similar to how a bs sacrifices tank for damage or they could retain their selfdefense aka neuts remote ecm smarties with lesser damage i would also not be too averse to a pure fighterfb bay and a much smaller regular drone bay even though i am not too sure if less than 1000mUFFFD would be good i feel like you should still be able to launch one full group of almost every drone possible but that is just a gut feeling at the momentaltering their slots andor capacitor attributes on the other hand i dont see as necessary just because i think the lowering of the scan resolution which seems like an ok idea again would take care of the ha i will just quickly lock you and neut you outdrone you to death issue when it comes to smaller ships if a hic gets a point on a supercarrier and cant get anything that resambles a jesus blob or at least more hic backup on the field within say 12 minutes the supercarrier should still make it out in my bookalso bring in slave implants for shields and while you are at it even though a bit offtopic crystal implants for armor reps active armor tanking bs might become useful o fix the shield amount loss on jumpin and adjust the relative ehp of all supercapitals to one another tldr dont touch slots dont touch the capacitor yes reduce scan resolution hicdictors should take a while capitals not so much yes possibly add a seperate bay for 1 flight of either fighters or bombers plus 35 backup yes reduce the regular drone bay size but not to much 2000mUFFFD or 2500mUFFFD rather than 1000mUFFFD no dont increase cap usage for neuts instead do the 1 drone per lvl  3 drones per dcu thing yes reduce fb base damage by around 14 or 13and no dont even dare to touch their ewar immunity the day 10 falcons lolerjam even 5 supercarriers more or less permanently we all know how it goes while 5 arazus stomp their scan resolution totally into the ground is the day the server should shut down o
just want to add one more thing before i head to bed if anything was changed about super carriers where fitting drone control units was needed to get the damage they do now as in 1 drone per carrier level and 3 drones per dcu fit you absolutely have to make the dcu fully passive right now they are active modules and dont use cap i have no clue why they made it an active module but the last thing we need is for an epic fight to be happening lag hits and dcus stop cycling and all the super carriers lose control of their fighter bombers and thus almost all of their damagei know some of you would love it like that but we have to be reasonable
if the small gang wants to warp away not much the sc can do about it thus the sc cannot kill the small gang unless the small gang is a willing participant willingness displayed by staying when they should have warped awaysomething about this whole discussion has been bothering me for some time why do people assume that the super carrier was designed to be exclusively anti capital its ability to do sub cap damage is substantial and can be nothing less than an intended design when the bombers were added it was to create a situation in which the sc had to make a choice attack structures and capital ships with maximum effect or deal with the sub capitals bombers were found to be too effective against sub capitals and were dialed back accordingly to reduce their effect to sub caps i dont see the point at which they were designed to be exclusively anti capitalwindjammerps youre welcome for the bump
some interesting discussion here the ops ideas are quite good though i think theres some other good brainstorming in this thread the could develop them further im an sc pilot so i have a vested interest and some relevant experiencemy general philosophy is that a supercap ship should require and rely upon a support fleet in the real world a carrier always belongs to whats known as a carrier strike group the carrier is always accompanied by missile cruisers defensive ships like subs and destroyers and logistics ships id like to see changes that encourage teamwork and coordination  bringing an sc to a fight should be a brown pants moment for the enemy to that end id generally support changes that remove the scs ability to defend itself against subcaps and tackle id allow scs to carry only fbs and fighters and would remove the bonus to the number of fighters but leave it for fbs id remove most if not all sc ewar immunity probably just leaving them immune to ecm because i hate it id leave scs with huge dps against capital ships and a huge buffer tankid then look for cool ways to actually buff the scs so they fit the role of being the focus of a squad or wing id task the sc as a wing leader ship and provide it with some bonuses if it is in the fleet role of wing leader i would allow characters in the scs wing to dock in the sc while it cyno jumps allowing a small titanbridge like capability up to the maintenance bay capacity of the sc i think cynoing then having a dozen support ships undock from my ship would rock tldr  the scs should be nerfed so they need a support fleet and buffed so if they have a support fleet they are awesome awesomeness should be proportionate to the teamwork involved
thats not buffing thats giving them a rolecurrently scaps do not have their own roles but are instead straight upgrades of existing ships what youre thinking of is differentiating them from existing ships to get them out of the way of existing ships mostly the dread and carrier but also in large parts the support fleet that was made obsolete by the drone swarmsneedless to say that this would be a very positive thing for eve as a whole personally id like to see moms as combat oriented version of the carrier with much less dpsehpcost no ewar invulnerability and gained docking ability but a more fleet support oriented style would be okay too as long as the dps and ehp inflation is tuned down a lot
alot of this stuff sounds life nerfing for the sake of nerfingthe problem i see is scs lack their own rolethis idea probs wont be popular but i think it would give a purpose to each capitalbut my idea is make dreads immune to fighter bombers and change the explosion radious on fighter bombers so they can only hit stationary targetsthis would make it so that the role of dreads would again be anticapital andor poor mans sov bash shipit would also force sc to have their own role as anti sov structures would even be inclined to increase fb dps as they would only be able to hit nondread stationary targets the idea is that your scs would be your battering rams they would still be extremly effective against sub caps with their neuts sbs and fighters but would be very weak against other caps however with a dps increase they could put down say 15k20k dps against a sov structureand in turn dreads would once again have a role as anticapital as they would be the main defence against the sc battering ramthis is quite balenced imo as dreads in their current state are already very weak against regular subcaps and titans but alas each ship as its own designated purpose
seriously just leave this thread please
hmmm no admitablly it was an off the cuff idea but what makes it so outragiously wrong then all the above points mentioned are good at nerfing scs but none of them really seem to address the issue of giving scs their own unique role as well as giving a purpose back to dreadsdreads still have to seige and be stuck in place for 10 minutes in which time they are immune to rr scs can wipe dreads out with disgusting efficancy and are also currently better at taking down poss and sov structures my idea makes scs even more efficant at knocking out sov structures but gives dreads back a purpose of anticapitals at the moment dreads are simply eclipsed by scs
actually it has a role the role you suggested is already takenby dreads they were introduced as anti structure weapon platforms you want to make a supercap that effectively cant engage players anymore and is limited to sov structures this is seriously the worst idea i have seen in this thread that includes the guy who spams emotes
not really it only stops them from engaging other capitalsdreads are currently completly eclipsed atm by supercariers as they can apply more dps ewar imunity more mobility and repable as they dnt have to seigeadmitablly the idea was a bit too extreme what about the opersite then making it so super carriers cant hit sov structuresconcept being you would use a dread fleet for high antisov structure dps and the supercarrier blobs would be pure anticapitalim just trying to find a way to give dreads an actual usefull role that another ship cant already do 5x better atm scs are just too all purpose aka i win button
if only someone had posted a thread suggesting a way to make supercarriers anti everything
supercarriers really suck at taking down control towers
lol your a bit of a d really arent you pi like your original proposal as well as many of the other changes mentioned by other players they would go along way towards balancing the ship as a holehowever none of these ideas seem to address the fact that scs leave dreads with very little purpose was just trying to fire off ideas to give dreads some meaning other than sc fodderthe inability to be repd or move whilst in siege mean they are just to much of a liability compared to scs and even regular carrierswhat do you suggest as a solution to giving dreads an active purpose in current capwarfare
no
james your just terrible honestly wow being a pilot that has flown with ed several time i know that he can be a little harsh his proposal needs to be toned and i did as much earlier on but the point is moot because ccp opening said in the minutes they do not want to nerf the sc the the question that begs is how can it be changed then one idea that was proposed to me earlier this week in a corp meeting was giving fbs a limited clip size for their bombs this means theyd have to fly to the target attack until out of ammo then return to the sc for ammo then reapproach target this idea has pros and cons but i wasnt much of a fan the other idea that the same pilot proposed that i really enjoyed was a counter that was derived from the sub capitals it came in 2 ships1 a t2 destroyer hull needs a modification to the auto target selector that allows this mod to be set up to target specific things like fighter bombers fighters dronesthen the t2 destroyer hull which has the function of being an anti drone platform this hull would fit an auto target selector that would target the specific drone class maybe through scripts and the guns would cycle against the targetted dronesthese would give support fleets a counter to the drone swarm next the t2 cruiser torpedo boat this ship would be an anti capital platform the same as a stealth bomber is an anti bs platform it would fire citadels but it would not cloak and would be a paper tiger the idea being if defended by a support fleet and against a cap fleet or ship that is lacking a support fleet these ships would destroy caps but if the enemy caps were protected by a support fleet these ships would easily die before being able to deal significant damage to the caps and superswhy is this line of thinking goodbecause if we continue making the counter to one ship the next one on the food chain we wont have a cyclic system we will just have endless proliferation if we make the pvp system cyclic as in subcapscapssuperssubcaps we will eliminate one motive for force escalation in terms of ship class or sizeso the tldr is instead of nerfing scs bring the counter into place in the sub capital arsenal by doing this you make the force escalation for super capitals either more supers or more subcapitals and which is easier and costs less to field
ah sht the patch reset my default toon the above is me
ive been watching this thread but i got to say james1122 get out
im juat waiting for the well my cruiser should beable to kill a carrier 1v1 because by the time i can fly a carrier there will be something else thats trying to kill me omg i can almost fly a dread but scs own dreads sooo lets nerf scs so that dreads are cool  because im at least another 6 months from flying a sc and about the same for affording itjamess idea was neither a summation of previous ideas new constructive idea or an improvement on something previously stated it was basically a cry to make scs useless for pvp and dread fleets nigh invincible for pvp its pretty obvious he falls into one of these categories1 his main can almost get into a dread and wants it to be more powerful or op2 has a dread and does not like shooting sticks or waiting to enter a cap fight and click the russian roulette button for death known as siege3 is part of an alliance that cannot field any supers and only has a dread fleet but wants to fight against supers and larger 00 fleets4 honestly just has no grasp of capitals and cap warfare and 005 duhhh err i uhhhh i like post and errr myyyy name is james and my mommyyyy sayssss im spechial
because ccp said so
although i agree scatim the problem lies in the word exclusivelyccp never stated they were designed to be used only as an anti capital battery they just stated that would be the primary roll of the sci mean we really are just arguing the finer points of it but the difference beingexclusive anticap platform cannot or would not be used to attack anything but capitals no exceptions as that is their sole and only role nonexclusive anticap platform can be used to attack all classes and variations of ships in eve but excels at attacking capital class ships and has a primary use and purpose of attacking capital class vessels
bumping back up
the fact that a major graphics patch just came and went with no changes to cyno is evidence that the current management structure in ccp is flawedthey need to restructure possibly replace the top management or keep operating inefficiently
definitely supporthaving multiyear faces shoved into some tiny box limited by skillstimemoney without some recourse sucks the big one
orks is best
definitely yes not everyone seems to understand it but these kind of details are very important for some when its about a game they play and pay for voluntarily their opinion should be taken into account and not criticized for being too picky or something especially as allowing this would raise no issues with balance or game mechanics also its not just the portrait  this was simply a test for the character creation system that will be used once we can walk around and then such details will be even more important
hello everyonei have to agree with this overall now i dont think folks should be just changing races or bloodline just to be able to do it but there are some very legitimate reasons to do so currently and to be fair im not harmed in any way if someone does want to change their race or bloodline for no reason whatsoeverwhen i chose my main originally i wanted to play gallente but hated the way they looked but then i found vhorokhior pardon me if i misspelled that i liked the description and was able to make a character that looked like a native american i thought that was pretty cool my wife looked over all the races and chose the same as she was able to create a really nice looking character portrait that kinda looks like a sort of gypsy roma if you prefer now we can both certainly make acceptable and even attractive characters however we cant make ones that are close to our old ones heck my wife cant make a character that looks even remotely similar given that why not be able to choose what we like bestnew players get to look over everything and choose the one that looks best to them from among all the bloodlines the existing playerbase gets to modify the bloodline they chose long ago problem is many folks chose them for appearance and now that appearance is sometimes radically different since there are no mechanical benefits of being one bloodline or another why not give the option to change once i know itd be a pain to code but what isnt a pain to code anyway this idea has my firm support
i fully support this proposal also i dont have any problem giving ccp an extra 10 for this as it is now i cant see many people paying for the portrait swap just to fix a smile or change their hair color ccp is missing out on possible income herewhen all male character portraits except the brutor and amar looked feminine i chose to make a flashy looking female gallente with this new character creator the range of possibilities has jumped immensely i would like the chance to reboot my character in the new system even if i have to pay for itthe argument on the portrait swap page is weak in the first place if someone changes their looks it doesnt erase the trail of wrongdoing they may have done in game moreover this is the future if your prideful amarian ceo decides to turn into a chick with purple hair who gives a damn it sounds like it enhances roleplay to meget this done ccp
so its been 4 pages of supported and still not even a csm response great
completely in agreement id propose a full onetime change of race and bloodline there are no balancing issues involved here this shouldnt be such a problem i believe the only difference would be some minor attributes in the starter ship
supported
this ffs ill even take seibestor instead ill stay minmatar just let me change to something that remotely looks like i used to
where are my tatoos where are my implants
signed would be a fantastic idea even if limited to amount of changes per so many monthseither way good idea
oh yes
still ignoring us eh
i dont have a particular problem with my current choices but it would definitely be nice for other peoplealso might have the bonus of getting rid of the thousands of archura alts
i fully support a one time change to racebloodline when i started playing a year ago all new characters started with the same skillsattributesisk the only reason i picked the racebloodline i did was because i liked the appearancei spent around 6 hours making faces from all the different racesbloodlines before finally deciding on the one i did now overnight hes turned completely asian and after spending 3 hours yesterday on trying to make him look nonasian i had to shut off the computer and take a break
yes to race change
nay to free bloodline change you can not change who you arebut it would be interesting to have possibility to buy cosmetic surgery to make you look like different racebloodline
which is basibly changing bloodlines the whole point of it is so we can look different
change of such magnitude schouldnUFFFDt be available free of cost imho nor almost mandatory like in the real world you are not satisfied with your look well bad luck but you can always have plastic surgery to help you with thaton other hand there could be other way to make it work within eveworld logic simply to put changes in your new clone so you can change your racebloodline as you wish but at cost of loosing your current clone along with all the implants and jumpclonesin principia i just hate the possibility of free racebloodline change just because someone does not like how does some racebloodline looks like without any other backroud reasons and plausible explanation how to do so within rules of the gameworld
this thread is only for those that wish to vote yes something needs to be done about the performance of hybrids on gallente ships this thread is not for discussion of how to fix gallente the purpose of this thread is to unify all those that see a problem with gallente and who wish to demand action from ccp be that thru rebalancing the ships the weapons or the ammo please use the countless other threads for discussions on such matters

sorry mate its hard to support something if you have no idea what it is fix it is a little uncertain and it affects caldari too not to say that it fares any better on that sideill support it because i agree that it needs fixing but dont expect me to just xup i dont think fixit is particularly productive perhaps sometime we can discuss how it could be made better regardless ill respect your thread this much and not toss in abah i just read your thread again and cant bring myself to click on the support box

1the standard balance for video games is closer to a weapon with 12 the range getting 25 the damage of its competitors while this is a bit extreme hybrid weapons should be closer to it than they are now
nonconstructive post but positive
taisuke be kind to edit your post and use the support thread hitbox pleaseand to coment your post i would say that yes anything that is able to get close to a blaster boat should think twice because my shotgun doesnt cares of you if you are too far but when you came close to me looking for dance ill give you an entire ballet atm blaster are at the bar getting drunk doesnt matter whatelse can they do
we were discussing this the other night as one of our crew flys nothing but gallante ships and with the exception of the nyx there isnt a single ship the gallante have that is best in its class sure there are some niche uses among certain shipsganking drone boat etc but for mainstream purposes they are beat out by someone else virtually everywhere

i think any ship that uses a noncovert cloak that cloaks up that cant recharge cap is a nice addition to balance what situations for nonsub capital ships would be severely hurt their operation just dont throw out there all ships will be screwed over by this because that is not the case please list some examples
part of the reason i want new module is to make the fitting requirement for capital cloaks higher they shouldnt be so easy to cloakas for subcap consequences  they are mostly annoyance something that wont effect pvp in any noticeable way just annoy thousands of people for no good reason
there is a more comprehensive thread that considers the super capital ship issue more holistically point solutions such as this one wont solve the problem if this was about stopping people cloaking up for hours and hours in any ship at all other than covopsrecon then id actually be all for it however cloaking to regen cap is not something id look to change id probably go with something like cloak duration  15 minutes can be stopped at any time but has a 5 min recloak timer to start with  to force visible time onto any cloaked ship
hey look its the if you cant x then you didnt want it hard enough the nonargument people turn to when they cant think of any real reason for a mechanic to exist
a balanced reduction in caprecharge provided by noncovert ops cloaks as a included penalty based on module quality would be acceptable
an obviously good ideaedit arguably black ops ships should be excluded from this with a role bonus or something
anything without a role bonus or cov ops cloak shouldnt be able to regen cap the afk cloakers that are ting up the thread dont really have any argument beyond waaa this isnt fair let us abuse cloaks
wow im shocked a cloak change that i can agree on that doesnt ruin cov ops cloakers
supportin thisalso how about a similar penalty to shield recharge
youre only stupidly brave if youre carrying out an action with a high risk involved not just dropping your supercap on unsuspecting jump freighters
i was thinking about that but was worried it might not go over so well and the cap penalty not get the support if there is enough people that think it would be a good addition as well then i will add it to the op after all you cant armor repair while cloaked so it makes sense again people remember this is for all noncovert ops cloaks
oh think of the tears potential nice idea to nerf drive by dding
i support this with one caveat  that black ops and ships that fit covert cloaks are unaffected
epic idea is epicso long as black ops arnt affected by said change
i agree op updated
id be for that
agreed
i believe the entire cloaking mechanic should be reevaluated after ccp removes local as intelligence tooluntil that happens afk cloaks are necessary to negate some of the power of local chat
anymore supportcommentsrage about this idea or should i let it sink to the bottom of assembly hall
its an exploit it should be fixed
much easier to let the beacon stay for the duration and add a clause saying without a character attached to beacon one cannot jump to itplus slap an aggression timer on cyno pilot for as long as field is open so he cant logoffdisappear immediately  same as if stuck on beacon for duration
yes please
it wouldnt even harm the teen rating they went for from the esrb by removing pleasure hubs from stations againonly asking for some realistic movement to breastsnot nudity
kinda sexist isnt it what about male beer bellies wobbling then oh wait we dont have that fat belly option
i cant say i disagree if we have a way to make our characters fat then a beer belly should jiggle too i think the reason we dont is because you would think a pod pilot would be somewhat fit the pod would only give them as much nutrition as they need to survive and stay healthy not get fat but i digress
and while youre at it make sure you implement some skirts couldnt find any in the nearest caldari primes gapedit ohhhh and jesus footwear how can a female toon live without her wardrobe stocked with shoes

if you really want jigglage just play world of wacraft they have everything from 69 wobble on female dwarves even when they wear solid metal armor to the worgen whose breasts jiggle when slapped during their dance on a more serious note unless player model movements are so fluid that nonmoving breasts are a major distraction i see no reason for breast development to be a major priority for the programmersid much sooner see more variety in clothing and yes underwear as well as hair styles hair and eye color i really dont like that the all white eyes can only be white or that to get blue hair that looks fairly real i need to have white roots that comprise half the characters hair and the option to pick a new race or at least bloodline for those poor unfortunate vherokior souls who have a racebloodline that now does not suit them or that they picked purely for mechanical reasons years ago and are now stuck with something they wouldnt have chosen had race not affected mechanics back thenim all for jiggling but not for spending significant time on something ill spend all of 5 minutes paying attention to just so i can say yeah she jiggles
the legion needs to be fixed in almost every single role the other t3s perform significantly better missioning ratting buffer pvp active tank pvp the list goes on and the reason is a fundamental lack of focusthere are a few things that an amarr t3 cruiser should not have1 it should not have the ability to have 5 medium slots2 it should not have the ability to have only 3 low slots3 it should not have a laser capacitor bonus in a configuration with only 4 lasersa few small changes could make the legion radically better by improving its crappy configurations while leaving its already good setups completely untouchedfirst remove the mediumslot conversion for the covert ops and drone offensive subsystems none of the other t3s have slot changes for their offensive subs why should the legionsecond change the defensive subs so that they alternate a high slot with a medium instead of a high with a low the tengu absolutely needs med slots so it cannot go below 5 of them in the same way the legion needs low slots making any configuration with less than 5 of them a crippled ship this is not flexibility its a trap for the players to fall intothe current slot boundaries for the legion are as followslow 37medium 35high 57what im proposing would turn it into thislow 57medium 24high 57for reference the tengu is thislow 25medium 57high 57it seems pretty clear that the tengus options play to its strengths while the legions are counterintuitive and some are even selfdestructive the proteus cannot have less than 5 low slots and the loki has defensive subs that support either kind of tankone thing i want to make very clear this change would do absolutely nothing to bufferlaser fits it would do nothing to 1800dpstanked 250dpsdealing ham fits what it would affect are the dronesinterdiction nullifier fits that nobody uses and the 400dpstank ratting setups that have lower stats than a drakeif you have any doubts as to the imbalance here just look at market data for the t3 ships people sell maybe 15 as many legions as they do tengus yet the buffer and laser subsystems remain at a high price its because theyre the only subsystems people use the only good legion fits have 6 low slots and any subsystem layout with fewer than 5 results in a terrible shipregarding the missile subsystem i think the current damage numbers are tuned perfectly the tengu does more damage if it uses kinetic hams while the legion does more for the other 3 ham types however that doesnt mean assault optimization should just stop at 2 bonuses while every other offensive sub has either 3 bonuses or drones counting cov ops cloaking as 2so i propose the legion ham subsystem gain a 5level bonus to explosion velocity this will also be needed because the tweaked legion will find it much harder to fit webs a key part of ham strategyalternatively assault optimization could gain 2525 drone baybandwidth im not suggesting both of these be added but one of them is needed to bring it up to the standardfinally change the covert ops subsystem to a damage or even rof bonus its got 4 maybe 5 guns who cares how much cap they take people just use autocannons on their covops legions with 34 low slots you know so they can cloak fly to the station and get their covops cloaking ganking tengui very much hope that ccp will take a look at the strong evidence ive gathered here and make some small changes that will go a long wayto anybody who actually read this entire post i sincerely thank you
the big problem with the legion its only because ccp make some crazy choice with amarrnormaly the legion must be configured cruiser hasreconew  cruiserwhen you are caldary that is not really a problem because in all case you tank shield and the weapons its at 80  missilesamarr has like zealot tanking armor no drone weapons laserhas like sacrilege  tanking armor small drone weapons heavy assault missile extra capacurse and pilgrim  tanking mixte  massive drone  more missile than laser  ewthe legion with the configuration sacrilege or curse is good but the version zealot is not terrible the best way will be perhaps in this configuration to make 1 low and 1 medium slot that will be better than now
supporting my own proposal i think a lot of the people who cared about the legion in the past have moved on and are no longer monitoring these threads i will artificially keep bumping this if i have to because i believe its a clear improvement and no good argument can be made against it
yes the legion needs something
i support the general idea of shifting 1 medium slot into low slot for legion
i cant remember the last time i saw someone flying a legion lokis yes proteuses yes tengus i fly one myself legions hell no
actually ill go so far as to say i want gallente ships to be the fastest ideally wed have a situation where the gallente ships are the fastest but minmatar are almost as fast while being much more agile
you can catch them pretty easy by overheating a cycle without fitting speed mods that isthe way overheating mechanics and overview updates are right now it is way easier to get in range than to maintain range
i think its better to balance hybrids before deciding what kind of balancing gallente needsimo fixing hybrid and change all armor repair bonus to top velocity bonus would fix it
this would make minmatar worse not gallente better if gallente could reliably catch minmatar ships with there current stats minmatar would become useless
sported
not really the performance of minnie ships would be unchanged vs the other racial ships you would just see different fits youd see a lot more armor hurricanes rather than these bastardized shield ones
they couldnt neut out the gallente ships with their two high utility slots or they couldnt one shot ships with their massive artillery alphathey couldnt fit a web or two and kite the gallente ship with their longer range weaponsor they find some other way to fit their ship with the large pg and cpu available along with the easiest fitting requirements of any short range turret by farthe entire problem right now is that minmatar ships are better at the gallente niche than gallente ships 1 their hulls are better and 2 autocannons  blasters easier to fit  dont need fitting mods selectable damage no cap usage better range yada yada yada please ccp do something
no you wouldnt see any armor hurricanes because they would be outperformed by every other armor battlecruiser by a huge marginshield fits are being used because they allow them to fill the role the ships are supposed to fill which requires them to have room for 45 weapon upgrades
thats a completely ridiculous assertion on its face youre talking about a system that can get 70k ehp goes over 1kms with 3 trimarks thats currently imagine if we changed the trimark penalty has plenty of room for ewar does over 700 dps has no cap issues with the weapons gets selectable damage types and can still project dps to about 2025km compare that with a harbinger and youve got a ship thats faster meaner has better tracking and has much better armor resists to the type of damage the harb is going to be doing not to mention you can lose a little dps and gain the use of two medium neuts and gallente bcs stack up even less favorably against it
show me the armor hurricane that has 70k ehp does 700 dps and projects this damage to 25km please you are just cherrypicking stats from shield and armor fits and claim they all apply to the armor fitjust to get a bit of reality in here the 70k ehp armor cane does a bit over 600 dps at point blank same for harbinger about 500 at 7km compared to still over 600 for harbinger 250 dps nonselectable damage at 20km compared to 520dps harbinger that is a harbinger with fmps btw if we drop the medium neut in favor of a mixed hplfmp rack its even more skewedin other words there is a reason nobody flies armor canes these days the harbinger does that job just a whole lot better

its a no vote from me as it stands the projection of power problem isnt only a jump bridge problem its a jump bridge  cyno  we can move 500 ships to defend an ihub 3 regions away which allows us to hold 30 stations problem as long as cost of owning system  profit from owning system or renting it out is true then the will to grab more space and fill it with pets or renters pets who have to buy their own petfood will be strongwhatever the solution is it needs to make it much harder to project power and hold huge swaths of space jbs are probably part of the solution but not all of it
jump bridges were discussed along with a number of other things that ccp have been mulling over the csm didnt just agree blindly with ccps ideas and other options were also discussed any changes to 00 would be part of a proper iteration not just a nurf to jb logistics etc might be changed but there were all kinds of other things discussed that might make that unnecessaryas things like jb and logistics were ccp pitching ideas of course there are no csm proposals on this and it was impossible to discuss the issues with the players before hand yes the csm had some ideas from previous discussions but should ccp want to further discuss iteration on 00 the players will be consulted and it wont be just the current csmof course ccp reserve the right to do whatever they like no matter how much the csm or players as a whole sayso with that out of the way ccp think that it is an issue that shared jump bridge networks allow people to cross the universe in a relativity short time yes it takes an investment and coordination to pull it off but it also makes it less risky to attack another region if you can quickly return home to defend with the same fleet rather than calling everyone ed you have to explain to ccp why this isnt really an issue csm have already stated both sides of this argumentof all the ideas i was personally interested in drive spool up time based on jump distance as well as sized cynos only if it is done right of course cue the lolccp comments anyway the message over all wasnt csm want to nerf jump bridges it was csm want ccp to commit to iterating on 00 including fixing sov treaties etc and taking a look at supercap roles it remains to be seen if they will dedicate the development to it
just so its clear then did the entire csm agree that jbs could should be removed from the game or was it just the three csm delegates who said they had no problem removing them were there other changes discussed wrt jbs or was the meganerf the only on on the table again to clarify the minutes made it seem that the real objection wasnt so much travel speed but that ccp doesnt like coalitions or how the playerbase has divided up nullsec space and essentially ccp was trying to find game mechanics ways to change how players cooperate in nullsec is that accurate or am i misreading the minutesthe minutes misstated what happened can you link to andor summarize what the csm stated as the best arguments for both sides itd be a bit easier to address the meat of the issue if we know whats already been said and what were responding to i will support this only if you work to get the nyx model changed to a battlestar
agreed it would be a good thing for them to gobut as long as you have titan bridges as well this will simply increase demand for titans online which is even worseso on balance i would rather have jump bridges than titans
crap like this is why the csm is just a bunch of ss clowns nothing but a pr joke all that space will become nothing more than low sec unclaimed territory because alliances wont want to pay a sov bill for something that can move resources or assets to without making it an 8hour g0d damn projectyou guys are absolutely worthless i will gladly pod each and every one of you if i ever get the opportunity
before revelations 2 was released in mid2007 and jump bridges seeded nearly all of 00 sov was divided between 3 major powerblocs the rsf gbc and nc the only real exceptions were providence because cva lived there and the drone regions because ra were still fighting in the south east and hadnt yet fractured to create solar fleet and xdeathbut clearly its all the fault of the jump bridges right guys
fact is we want to gank your unscouted freighters all there is to it right now we cant because even when they might go unscouted they will do so at a deathstar pos no more than 12 jumps away via jb from your blob you can keep your naps we just want to weed out your dumb pilotstake jbs away and we can ambush your freighter unless its escorted properly and even then well probably try and go for it anyway so youll only get more pvp and also probably lose a couple freighters now and thenor allow us to scramblebubble jbs if a jb is pointed or bubbled noone can jump through not even from the other side this way bears get to keep their effort free logistics but it allows someone to gank them without having a 100 man blob showing up 30 seconds after the freighter is tackledalso i havent been around before jbs ive used jbs often and ive done logistics to 00 both with and without jbs and i still want them gone along with local jump freighters and other such crap and yes i own a jump freighter too and wouldnt want it gone but that doesnt change the fact that its edly overpowered
it wasnt a session where csm voted on ideas so there isnt anything recorded as to how many people supported the idea or not most people agreed that jbs should be looked at as part of a proper iteration on 00 and fixing the sov changes yes a number of other changes to jbs were discussed and some objections were also mentioned it was a small part of the whole iterating on 00 discussion including where are the fecking treaties the two are related with shared jb networks it is possible for a large group of blues to go help an ally many regions away and be back home in time for their own rf timers ccp believe this to be a problem they think that if jbs are scaled back in some way plus other ideas please understand that jbs will not be changed in isolation that alliances will find fights closer to home even if that means resetting nearby blues i dont have the transcript here so i cant quote exactly also please note that ccp brought this up without prior warning so we only had 1520 mins to discuss this stuff which is why this was not a session with voting on ideas but more a discussion of areas to look at in future so as a very high level summaryon the one side you have scaling back jbs to make large naps less able to move their frontline to any part of their space so quickly again for the xth time this in combination with other thingson the other side you concerns about making fleet logistics and movement through large areas of space more tedious and that it would annoy vukim more interested to hear reasoned opinion from other players because passing that on to the right people at ccp is what we doi think it would be easier to modify the hel plus it needs some reason for people to fly it
the big read extremely humongous differences are that back then you had to plan campaigns thoroughly and in advance allies on the periphery had to be able to hold their own sometimes for days until reinforcements could get therestrategy went out the window with bridges everywhere you can no longer split a coalitions forces with multipronged assaults you can attack  defend and be home for tea with one massive fleetwar has become a casual instant gratification thing with far fewer people and intelligence needed  id even say that the pvpercarebear ratio in null took a nosedive when bridges became omnipresent as one hardcore group of pew lovers can cover unlimited spacein short yeah bridges are pretty much to blame for amny of the null woes
sounds like someone wants to reassert control of a situation 
i personally dont care what kind of nap fests and power blocks there are in 00 im not trying to break eve into smaller political entitiesthe only thing i care about is good pvp strategic and tactical
there are numerous problems with that however the first is that they arent really related we had huge coalitions before jbs were put into the game we had a huge coalition fall apart twice even after jbs were put into the game the second is that they dont actually work that way anyways pls recent actions against the nc showed that not only was the nc not able to get back and forth easily but they had to call off an entire invasion in order to go back home and deal with pl ive also been in many large fleets over the years and after hours of traveling trying to load grid fighting reshipping etc the last thing a large fleet is normally fit to do is go racing across the map for another fight people want to stand down almost all the timeits also disturbing to see that ccp has set up a sandbox where players create the content and drive the storyline and then ccps decided that theyre doing it wrong the content and story shouldnt be able large power blocs it should be able smaller ones well why do the players decide what 00 looks like or not because if we dont then ccp needs to stop advertising the game as if players get to decide the politics in 00 space to say nothing of the fact that if people want to blue everything within 50 jumps and deploy to a forward zone just to pick on someone thats part of sandbox play ccp cant have their cake and eat it too they advertise the game as one in which massive battles are possible and players shape the universe its a game philosophy thats gotten ccp the kind of publicity you can not buy in the pages of papers like the ny times and instead they seem to want to say no you are sandboxing wrong create a playercreated world the way we want it to be created one of the main problems is that jbs provide a benefit to ownership and continued control build up the sov level and you get a way to avoid standard gate camps and get your ships into cynojammed systems remove it and what replaces it sov holders get what more sanctums it seems that the real problem is that ccp is trying to micromanage a game thats supposed to be playercreated in terms of content if there werent coalitions it seems ccp would have no problem with alliancelevel jb networks but as soon as people start cooperating and deployingdefending as groups then its an issue of no you are sandboxing wrong and whats the next step if this doesnt work obviously this is largely about breaking up power blocs what happens when jbs are removed and the nc doesnt tear itself apart does ccp admit its wrong and put jbs back in or more likely do we see another round of changes designed to accomplish an ingame political change through mechanics alterations perhaps i was unclear i will support that if you make my nyx a battlestar  all the rest of the nyxes
finnagain zero it is wrong to think that political environment in eve is the main reason for changing jb ccp doesnt care or shouldnt care about nc or its nap festswhat they should care about is how jb effect war strategy of eve and dynamics of pvpof course its still valid to discuss how removal of jb would effect political scene just dont make the mistake of thinking its the reason for change
sounds fun escorting frieghters for the first time but after doing escort ops like that it will make you want to shoot your self after the third time especially when it is 40 jumps though camping gates for frieghters sounds fun for the ones with the blob that is though without jb everyone would use carriers and titans to move stuff around and nerfing jump portals would remove the main reason to have a titanthough raising the 00 entry bar to must have own carrier unless they get nerfed to the point of cant leave home systemregion does not sound like a good ideaeditif i remember right they were also talking about removing jf and titan bridges but for the adverage noncap pilot moving his stuff around will be a pain
apparently you havent heard of jump freighters or titan bridges
thats not supported by the minutes which are things that would also be nerfed along with jbs
the nerfs proposed for cyno mechanics deal specifically with hot dropsunless you plan to jumpbridge your freighter into a hostile gang the cyno nerfs will not effect you other than maybe add 30 seconds waiting
those are not the only changes being discussed by ccp
now that weve all been playing with the character creator a bit i thought it might be useful to gather together some suggestions on improving the character creator user interface  in particular quick tweaks that will make life easierhopefully the result will be a proposal that the csm can raisei will kick it off with a few that occurred to me you should be able to tell the avatar to stop fidgeting dammit you often cannot see that a small change has in fact been made because the avatar moves fine adjustments of particular sculpting and posing elements can be very difficult especially if you are on a laptop or mac and are getting low framerates  it often takes several seconds for a tweak to actually happen therefore once you have grabbed something and while still holding the mouse button down the arrow keys andor wasd triangle for example should bump the feature setting one unit in the desired direction and shiftkey should move it multiple units in conjunction with the above visual feedback that a change has occurred not just the change itself which might be subtle would be helpful a reset to midrange key would be nice too scrolling through the lists of clothes backgrounds etc can also be a bit awkward shortcut keys for moving through the currently selected list would also be very very handy during posing when adjusting facial features there should be a way to choose whether to make symmetrical or asymmetrical changes to a feature at any time during character creation you should be able to save the current state to a file or into the clipboard in some encoded text form and restore state in a similar way why because it makes possible the ingame profession of professional avatar image consultant and will increase usage of the upcoming character resculpt feature btw you should also be able to save the state of a completed avatar so you can send it off to your consultant for a makeover

idea of brokenwrecked stations is old the main reason why gms always rejected it is that station is huge storage of player items and its impossible to totally destroy station with everything inside of itthis wall of text contains implementation details which avoid destroying of player items but still allows to destroy station naturally put it in broken or wrecked statewhen station moves into broken state1 every station office is closed and all items from corp hangars moves into impounded items2 all player hangars remains as they are3 station services cloningfittingrepair etc are shut down and cant be repaired while station is in broken state4 broken station have limited docking ability in following way station dont have standing filter or other docking restrictions everyone can dock only capitals cant dock to the broken station because of damaged docking bay viva piracy in sector of broken station5 in system with broken station cant be built new one6 broken station cant play defensive role in the sov warfare7 optional in order to return station to the good shape turn to the regular sovereignty should be acquired for the system players should make investments for reconstruction heal 100k of structure hp yeah use remote hull repairs for awhile after that station will have pocket where to place materials like half of the materials for new egg of this type  usual materials for station of this typewhat we have with broken stations feature1 ability to make damage to the alliance assets without capturing territory2 place for some categories of players who will live in this sector without standing place for ship storage only will have to use pos fitting or gang ship maintenance like pirates3 there is no need to care about stuff of players who didnt play for awhile they will be able to login and haul their stuff out4 minus one functioning stationfew ideas how to brake station1 possible special ship needed to broke station2 station have to be in system with no sovereignty in order to reach broken state2 broking should take big interval of time during which defenders could save it and it should take man hours for the attacker during which they should shoot station for a some constant damage per hour3 or possible 3rd rf cycleps storyline for the idea of broken stations could be tied to sansha invasion they came and taught capsuleers how to brake stationsedit spelling and typos

05 becausebriiliance idea but it would be better interesting and hardcorely to modify the given mechanismto receive control over station the person with a certain role in corporation or skill should enter into dock of station and reprogram the stati
i agree with the conceptdestroying stations outright is probably a step too far but allowing a degree of scorchedearth where stations can be smashed up to the extent that they barely function as anything other than hangar storage and that fixing them is no longer simply a matter of sitting on the undock with remote rep carriers could be interesting
1 i support no question
yea would be fun
seems ok
1good idea
as long as the procedure for breaking a station is labour intensive and not something one can do on a whim as well as being something that is defendable and stoppable the added isk sink is nice as long as its done right though i believe that parts of the services should be available such as the ability to update your clone as if you log in after being afk and the station is borked and you do not have an updated clone your pmuch screwed
providence must die
fo real
i want to add a little to the previous postit is possible to import flexibility and a variety to idea at least such momentprobably when the station functions it supports serviceability of all vital subsystems such as oxygen submission overlapping of the depressurized bays for preventing of leak of oxygen power supplies of subsystems controll of nanites function of a docking berthingtow and operation of various other automated processesit is possible to present that for station repairing it is necessary to bring to it some industrial ships with spare parts such as robotics coolant oxygen water mechanical parts nanites superconductors watercooled cpu enriched uranium robotics nuclear reactors ukomi super conductors supercomputers hightech transmitters recursive computing module nanofactory sterile conduits wetware mainframe selfharmonizing power core or maybe any salvaged materialsand this is only for bring station online for the further reprogramming of its brain that the corporation became the ownerfor example it is possible to enter an element of randomnessputting out of action station players never know for certain that they will partly or completely damage in itthe amount of necessary spare parts for station coercion in a working type should be generated in a random way and be displayed to all playersthe parts of station destroyed or put out of action can be as of what it is under construction station storage bay station storage bay station construction parts station office center and other and any new inventedit can be necessary here also skills of mechanics electronics and engineering but skill outpost construction isnt necessarythe amount of resources necessary for repair if the station isnt destroyed completely should be always less than it is necessary for construction of new such stationthe given method of revival of station can urge on necessity to extract planetary resources and will import some harcore difficulty in station capture actually this can bring more realism in to stations sieges

k whatever
its a step in the right directionsome mechanic needs to be developed to completely destroy a 00 outpost
so after creating my characters new avatar and taking his photo it only took about 3 hours before i realized i wasnt too happy with the pose character is fine but the pose kinda sucks a thought occured to meone that many before me have probably thought of and maybe there is even a few posts about this already but here it is anywaywhen incarna releases lets have barber shops and photo booths i dont think changing gender or race and bloodline is necessary as a feature that can be used at willmaybe a one time deal since some pretty drastic changes have come about with the new character creator but the ability to change hairstyles beards and portraits would be goodthis could also be an isk sink there is no reason to limit how often it can be done let us change our portraits as often as we can afford to at a cost same with hairstyles and beards this can be something obviously found in stations another reason for us to get out of our pods and walk around a bit frankly no matter how awesome i make my portrait or how perfect my characters hair iseventually i will get bored with it and want to change ita lot of other games do this i dont think it is too much to ask they are minor details in the game and should be easy to implement eve can also always use another isk sink and this is a decent way to do it since a lot of people will do this 2 mil for a shave and a cutmost expensive haircut ever 5 mil for a picture to be takenokmaybe the prices are a bit off but ccp can figure that one outthats why they pay those economists rightjust for the record i do have some faith in ccp that they have already thought of this and will implement it its a very basic feature found in most if not all modern mmos
i was just thinking of this today needed lower cost though 200000 isk tops
yes because photo technology is super expensive5kk for a picture is insane 5kk could build a whole city on some planet
that is funnynever seen anybody describe a million with kk anywayout of my entire post all you could think about was the price of taking a picture

back to the top
i completely agree i hate the dark layer my personal opinion is that it should be removed completely i gain absolution nothing by having it there if i want to know if i am too high or low i simply move the camera to look at it horizontally no indicators needed
i refuse to move back to wormhole space until this is fixed
have any of you bothered to scan since the patch they did a stealth fix of thisccp changed the scanning dot to some difficult to see arrowlike icon tho the dot needs to return
supportedtextures on stations and capships are dated
make super capitals lose their immunity to ewar when ewar is delivered by other capitals and super capitals this is a tweak not the nuke from orbit approach that ccp usually takes when making changes
would make armor capitals op because shield capitals would have to sacrifice tank to fit ewar
this is as opposed to the shield capitals that use cprs for cap instead of cap rechargers amirite liang
we arent talking supers here chief even if we were no good wyvern pilot would fit a cpr over cn pduand if your active tanking you will probably go cf over cpralso remember that cprs and cfs have distinct drawbacks for shield tanks while crs dont have a draw back for armor tanks
yep just like we see with the drake blobs everyone would forget about any tank at all and just fit warp disruptors
comments anyone fitting a cap flux to a capital ship is a moron we are talking about capital ships  not just supercapitals people already fit warp disruptors andor sensor boosters to their shield tanked capitals why do you feel this changes anything armor tankers who burn their mids on warp disruptors and sensor boosters have  all for capacitor and therefore rr andor local tank compared to shield caps that burn lows on cprsliang
liang this doesnt apply just to points it applies to ecm sensor damps webs and tracking disruptors all of these are denied by the ewar immunityso this is why im against your idea because you would see caps webbing off supers carriers tracking distrupting titans and damping scsi cannot agree to thisalso to the capacitor mods argument im a firm supporter of giving cap rechargers an armor draw back say reduce armor hp overall
two things not my idea the seems to be primarily about capssupercaps being able to tackle supercapitalsthats just edliang
cant be that fcked as cprs reduce shield booster cycle time and cfrs reduce shield hp overalland how do you propose the lack of immunity to points from capitals but not from any other ship without giving capitals a bonus to point and scram strength which is what makes supers immune to points and websi mean fck id love to beable to web my titan when i wanna warp away quickly
cprs are significantly more powerful than cap rechargers and the penalties are stacking nerfed this has been gone over repeatedly cap flux  moron cap recharger  ok cap power relay  ing epic zomg winid personally implement it by letting them mount capital mid slot wdfgs but that isnt the point  the point is the idea that cap and supercaps can tackle supercapsliang
the rmt was my point another asked me to add the margin trading problem i prolly shoulda done some more research first as i dont do anything like that but in the moment i just added it in the end though you can have a negative balance if ccp intervenes it can work both ways really ccp can give negative balances to both the buyer and the seller ccp keeps the accounts on the books and those users get nothingperhaps instead of banning botters ccp could just give negative balances to them and boom
margin trading is not a problem i however support the idea penalized characters should not be deletable untill the penalty is removed ie negative wallet
i have a simple proposal let us always be able to make new photos of our character that means access to the screen that allow you to tweak poseslighting etcnot asking for tweaking my face again  but i would think that a capsuleer would be able to afford having new pictures taken whenever heshe wanted to this should include changing clothes redoing makeup taking off glasses etc but not the shape of your face or the size of your boobs only changing the stuff that is not tied to genetics mkay and seriously redoing makeup and taking a new photo does not cost a plex you might want to cap the number of times a year we can take new photos though up to you ccpthanx

agreed and signed
agreed its difficult to tell exactly how you will appear ingame based on those 4 snapshots in the last creation screen some details i didnt desire became a bit more pronounced that otherwise didnt show on creationalso its easy for a brand new pilot to make a new avatar by simply rerolling a new pilot because no time has been spent training the pilot its an entirely different story when a vet has spent years training to 3050 million sps or more and is suddenly forced to make a highstakes prominent decision that lasts for eternity lz
while i am happy with my end result i agree some folks need some more chances to do the right face up    supportedm
i wholeheartedly agree with this indeed the documentation for the character creator has been severely lacking i didnt even know you could do things with the editor until it was too latehonestly im usually not one to try and get free stuff but in this case i feel its more than reasonable we get at least 1 free redo chance please ccp have a heart also the page which will generate your actual portrait comes severely short on information as overall btw didnt realize you could zoom out there with the mousewheel in a way that would affect the actual portrait or that you could tilt your head and rotate 3d and such the controls for which are purely a matter of guessinga few guys experimenting a bit on youtube  official ccp documentationi understand that timeconstraints probably played a part in not getting the documentation done which is all the more sad actually as eves new character creator is hands down the very best in the industry honestly ive never seen anything quite like it i would call it quite a breakthru even mass effects equivalent for example is vastly vastly inferiorhaving said the above and realizing the incredible importance our 3d character can play immersion and roleplay wise with the upcoming incarna i can only reiterate my request that ccp please allow people a grace period to get it right figuring out stuff for themselves where the documentation has been lacking
what she said 
this quote is appropriate here as welli support this thread too
agreed im still waiting on a petition response from 12 hours ago so i can only imagine how long it will take til i can redo my avatar properly after thinking i was able to redo it as many times as i liked during the grace period
now i hope you can understand why i want to have 1 name change as wellim stuck with this name for life  and didnt know it was gonna follow me for lifesame arguement for all who vetod that ideamisery likes company
i agree with the grace period but it matters not to me if i am stripped of my tattoos are we going to rewrite my minmatar history i feel naked and cheeted if it was a desions between sunglasses or tattoos let me recycle these silly glasses i know i am not he only minmatar that feels this way
aye hair did not show up for me in the chreator so was hard to see what she would look like hesitant to do my main atm for similar reason as i dont know what the portrait may look like
wholly agreedall of the options from the original character generator should have been available in the new one at the very least so that people have the option of replicating their initial characters if they so chosealso eye colors are washed out and terribly bland likewise hair huesoverall its pretty but im far far from satisfied with it the old avatars should be kept in game until all of the options are returned and no forced change implemented until such time

supported not for multiple opportunities however i believe everybody should be given the chance to recreate their characters once after 2 weeks no more and no less i looked in local today and found myself in agreement with most of what you said exception for that it looks like a lot of players just threw it together while some took the time to think about it i went for the latter myself but benefitted from practice on sisi as well a lot of players didnt take the time or opportunity to pop on sisi and try the new character creator out some of what i saw was of course awesome
considering the replies in the feedback threads looks like a redo option should be offeredinstructions were not clear and many people are very unhappy  supported

generally i support op idea and want to addsculpting body could be done once i mean after all possible trial periodshair and facial hair should available to change every 12 yearemotions of character its pose and background  any time we wantonly one disadvantage of this i see isthat could take too much programming and too much problems with server performance you know famous lag and such
oo thanks duch unlikely ccp just needs to add some timers that allow carious part of character to be changed only so often there is no serverload involved as character rendering is done on a separate mashinecluster

god nobad enough i almost had a case of carpel tunnel syndrome with the previous pi setup that had dozens of extractors that had to be individually reset for each planet while i have two accounts with multiple alts doing the pi for methe new system may not be perfect but its easier on the wrist and easier to manage
not supportedbut yes new extractors demand too much power
powerhungry  yes however  the new design  system is far better than the clickfest of the one before
challenge for your so superior pi skillsyou are in deep wh space and must make pos fuels using 3 planets and only 3 make pos fuels you have a barren gas and lava planet you may not be able to get an alt into the same system as your main for many days or weeks other corp members are responsible for other poses and you are responsible for 1 only 1 large pos
gscs take a little while to kill too
have we already reached the ooops i posted a bad idea stage where we get our friends to play the troll card
it was a troll from the start i thought i mean dammits a damm troll
damm i been dammed
if liking cute acronyms is wrong i dont want to be rightnow back to whether mining in eve should be abandoned to bots or not please
the new combat hotkey system seems pretty nice in paper it is supposed to save the effort trying to approach  align  warp to  dock using the small selected items panel however the execution is so poor that it is now actually faster to use the selected items panel and ignore combat hotkeys as a wholethe general sluggishnes of the new combat hotkeys seems to be a fourfold problem as described below1 when pressing ctrl the client waits for about 05 seconds before actually switching to lock mode this can be remedied by changing the lock hotkey into something thats not ctrlshiftalt such as z or x2 combat hotkeys all new hotkeys and the targeting hotkey are only valid for one click once you misclick you have to press the hotkey again3 before the change on hotkeys you could lock onto the target by using ctrlclick on the targets bracket this is no longer possible all combat hotkeys dont support this functionality4 all combat hotkeys somehow seem to be tied with destinys 1hz simulation rate this causes combat hotkeys to be executed much slower than the user wantsmy proposal for fixing the sluggishnes would be dealing with these problems on a oneonone basissolution 1 let the user to choose the sensitivity of these commands the delay between commands  command combinations measured in seconds  miliseconds should be allowed to be configured in the hotkeys optionsolution 2 make all combat hotkeys valid as long as the hotkey is pressedsolution 3 treat brackets as extensions of the overview just like prior to the patchsolution 4 provide instant feedback to all issued hotkey commands at the client level this will give the usersincluding me the illusion that their commands are being acknowledged and having an effect the actual serverside execution is what ccp has to worry aboutall of these fixes are relatively simple compared to creating a new hotkey system from scratch the difficult part is done so why not polish the rest and get all the credit you deserve the users ask one again please commit to excellence please take the last small but necessary steps to make the new system excellent
i support my proposal as usual
while in a chat with a csm some more stuff csm wants to see for supers1 removing ecm immunity2 removing fighters3 fighterbombers cant shoot structures
op is a total ing idiot
seconded
culture we have culture in internet spaceships woot
its a good idea and lowsec should represent a closed circuit in between high and null but you are doing it wrong instead of asking for an adjustment of security ratings you should be asking ccp to go over the map and add the handful of gate connections required to complete the circuitavoids all the potential nastiness and solves the issue
i support the genera lidea of interconnected lowsec to a point but i also think that having a few lowsec pockets makes some nice little areas for certain play style yes even rancer style play is a valid style for those who like itso basically yeah connect the the bigger areas that are used alot but leave a few small pockets about specifically for those who like that as their gameplay
an alternative idea is making smuggler jump gates that connect all low sec systems and are only available to players with a 5 and lower sec status

he got a minishirt because the layering process crapped out partway through
during last csm meeting grayscale proposed jump interdiction bubbles here his basic ideasgreyscale floated the idea of jump interdiction bubbles  not for a grid but for multiple lightyears they would prevent jumping through the bubble maybe sucking the capship to a certain point the csm isintrigued but a bit divided mechanics should be very costly and it should not be possible to use it tocastle upin the past i mentioned similar mechanicsgiant capital interdictor mobile space distortion generator
entirely dependent on how its done if it is a mesuckyyounojumpee thing then they will be used to castle up with a designated system used to kill whatever triesonly way of doing it that makes sense and adds strategic value is for such a bubble being impossible to pass through but still possible to enterleavecould then be deployed along projected path of a hostile fleet to force them to take a detour with the possibility of ambushing it while avoiding the bunkering scenariokind of a moot point either way since capitals are probably going to be revised long before any such addition even makes it beyond the brainfart stage read sc and jb threads
i like the idea of jump interdiction but how about a different way i dont like th esuck your cap into a camp and die in a fire idea at allhow about a capital size jump drive interdictor like a super hictor that basically does what a cyno jammer does except the whole system is shut down to jumps in and out by capitals but not to black ops covert cynos basically the super hic would have a siege cycle like dreads and carriers but its 10 minutes is the cycle for the system wide cyno jam using fuel stront or lo i guess for its siege cycle as other caps dothis would be usable offensivly or defensively it may even be a nice way to stop supercaps being utilised so frivolously as they are now ie 2 nyx hopped into lowsec to gank a carrier they may think twice if a super hic was a possibility locking them into system unable to dock and brought down
if ccp are smart theyd start with short range cyno jammers
i can see this mechanic being griefed to death omg goons are coming to kill our csma just drop one on every system the constellation now they cant effectively jump in period i agree with eph that a good start would be small scale cyno jammingthe other idea would be to generate a gravitational anomaly that would scramble jump drives in a certain distance from the location of origin causing a significant delay in entering and exiting the area encompassed or allow entries into system but not exits as in your jump drive can target into the affected area but once inside the area you cannot jump out of it
after reading over what ccp has said about how they do not like the current state of affairs with supercarriers and such and rolling the ideas around in my head for a few days i have come to the following conclusion supercarriers should be made closer to what real world carriers are thin hulls that hide while their fighters and bombers fly out and kill stuff so the short versionreduce supercarrier defenses to near nontriage carrier levelsallow supercarriers to dock due to reduced defenses and utility no more front line combatallow fighter bombers to be assigned to other ships as fighters arefor gate assaults allow fighter bombers to jump through gates with their assigned ships up to say one jump away optional there are other ways to get the supercarrier into the system so its fighters could participatepros except for the optional last point nothing here requires coding that has never been done before so would take no longer than any other balancing changecons optional last point would require new coding but is optional supercarrier pilots would not have pretty explosions to look at but that is what dreadnaught alts are for the long version all ships in eve are more or less based on the battleship idea of ship design fit the biggest guns and the most defenses on the hull as you can this also applies to carriers logistics are in effect extra defenses and supercarriers whos guns just happen to fly around a bit but in effect are still with the hull this idea is basically the same as the dreadnaught era in history when the best ship was the one with the most defences and firepowerto make supercarriers less desirable but still useful i believe that they should follow the pattern of real carriers during world war 2 and today in the real world a carrier uses its aircraft to strike and defends itself by being no where near the battle for eve i believe the same should follow which would restore the balance between capital ships and their use to do this supercarriers would need to be able to assign their fighterbombers to other ships their overall hp should be reduced to something near carriers out of triage and to make up for the lack of defenses they should be able to dock the reduced defenses should also reduce the price they would retain the ability to jump and their fighter bays would remain the same and just to make it worth the while allow fighter bombers to follow their assigned ship through jump gates up to one jump away to allow a supercarrier to give fire support to gate fights while not having to jump in as well this last point is optional but adds to the cool factorin all this would make supercarriers the long range support ships they should be and hopefully lead to less of them on the battlefield proper while still giving them a unique place and while not the primary reason behind this change but hopefully this would make dreadnaughts have a place again as closer range direct firepower ships as well as encouraging smaller ships to enter the formerly capital only battlefield to guide the fighters in
in other words you want supercarrier pilots to never deploy their ships more than 50 metres from the edge of the pos shield and preferably never to even see let alone directly engage a hostile shipgotchathat sounds fun
thats what it looks like and i must agree with the above its better to have them as front line just like our normal carriers they need to return to their logistics role imho carriers and scs should be logi dreads and titans should be dps all the problems with scs atm stem from them being dps ships in addition to a little bit of logi
alternate ideareduce supercarrier ehp to the aforementioned level increase grid size fivefold so that long range weapons now really have to perform and fighters fulfill their intended role as force projection at a distance on any particular battlefieldonly capitals should have extreme lockranges long enough to project their weapons systems to near the edge of the enlarged grid battleships would form the backbone of closemidlong range slugfests everything else would get more room to move aroundjust a thought
i kinda like this idea needs more work but its promising
if i recall what people were saying correctly when supercarriers were nothing but larger carrier logistic platforms no one used them since they cost too much and did nothing that a much cheaper carrier could not do even reducing the cost and defences and adding triage back in a carrier would do pretty much the same for less and there would be no unique slot for supercarriersfor the stationpos hugging comment well everyone plays docking games already without major changes to how that works it will continue though if a supercarrier goes into a pos shield if will lose control of the fighter bombers which could then be destroyed but this proposal is not changing that it is trying to give supercarriers a unique but not overpowering nitch there is already a cap logistics platform carriers there are already cap dps platforms dreads and titans this could then become a cap raiding platform beign able to do a fair amount of dps from very long range that is what a carrier is in real life and it seems to work pretty well jump a supercarrier in with some support logi carriers interceptors for fighter bomber control and make someones day rotten yes you might not see the explosion but you will still get the killmail of that baby titan as for fun your milage may vary me being able to sit somewhere and send my minions off to kill an enemy fleet while i watch for scan probes i think that would be pretty funedit for taking to long to respondogogov nice idea but the problem with your proposal is the lag would skyrocket i would think with a grid that size and its bad enough keeping supercarriers off the grip would let you get away from that and would probably draw others off as well since they would be searching for the supercarrier
this proposal differs from the other proposals in some key areasthe character generator is amazingly fun to play with yet once youve made your character the gameplay is over while it is understandable if ccp doesnt want us to remake our faces constantly due to lolrp reasons this does not extend to makeup cloths and poseslightingeven if they were to argue that rerendering and updating character portraits would put unnecessary load on the dedicated character image server there is no reason we shouldnt be able to at least keep playing dress up and funny pose making with our beloved charactersif implemented this would give players room to play what we pay ccp for anyway while keeping the characters recognizable
i messed up one of my alts because i had the wrong portrait highlighted when i clicked save i assumed the next screen would give me the choice of which portrait i wanted instead it picked the one i had highlighted and that was thatsupporting this

i especially want to change the backgroundis there any way that we can get the old selection of backgrounds backthe fist with the rays really grew on me similar to arizona flagand tribalwear i can deal with the sudden asioidlook of minmatar
i agree the physical features of a character should be set in stone id even go as far as making hair styles unchangeable but poses expressions backgrounds and clothing should be modifiable think of it as part of the transition to an actual character model that can walk around
supported
i say nowe had videos coments sisi test advices etc etc etc so once your choice is made it should be forevernow i entirely agree that you should have a big warning window saying something like thiswarning confirm  you will not be abble to retouch or make any changes after confirm your saving are you sure you want to save nowits the only tiny little thing they could do better for all the rest you are big boysgirls and responsable for your decisions
not trying to troll but horrible idea level vis are just fine the way they are i like taking out my domi and pewpewing serpentis thank you very much
woah there wait a minute with ideas this awful i highly doubt you have any friends i call shenanigans
so i was discussing eve with my 10 and 00 pals last nightthe topice of discussion moved on to risk free hisec00 isk generation with all parties agreeing that with the availability of limitless level 4 missionsanomliessactomsbelt rats the generation of isk high sec and 00 is nowhere near challenging enough some guy had the opinion that hisec00 isk generation should not neccessarily be harder but should at least be more of a challenge that scaled with the size of the operation the complete remove of the level 4 missionsanomliessactomsbelt rats was suggested and seemed to be widely accepted by a bunch of guys who live in 1000 and know nothing about each others isk generation whether or not this will actually happen though is anyones guess the general consensus was that ccp mite be willing to try anything to get people into low sec again
whoever came up with this idea must be a xxxxx lolbtw mining in high sec lol what kind of ppl do that if not using macro stuff lolxxxxx lolbtw the only risk free job in eve is 00 alliance leaders other people fighting for their space when they collect hundreds of billions moon income without need to do anythingtheyre the biggest carebears in game trying to win fights by making other people hard to fit betterexpensive ships
1 internets
i have read the entire post and still find it to be a terrible idea in every respectthis will never be implemented
i cant say i agree with you either and im one of those people doesnt much like jita sure i go there and buy my stuff but id rather it was more available elsewhere jita has become not only a market hub but a home for all the scammers in eve its bound to happen somewherejita is what it is theres no changing that fortunately each of the other empires does have its own market hub its just that they lack in faction items and special commodities like them not so bad really as you can get nearly anything else you needi understand you have an idea and it may not be that bad in theory but it isnt really a workable solution ot the problem or practical it isnt going to make faction warfare more popular and its only really going to serve to annoy players wanting to travel safelyanother reason your idea is somewhat offtarget is that the four empires actually get along to some extent just read any of the chronicles related to the subject or check into some of the back story best i can figure with some conviction is that ccp doesnt want to close borders in empire not only would it serve to prevent players from managing semiviable trade routes but it would prevent new players from leaving the empires they started in without risk sure that might seem good in some rspects but it will really only limit new players options
so you want the separation for the sake of having the separations ie for the gatecampers benefits not for any other reason like the game background or the war between empiresvery well so the reply to the op is very simple no the gatecampers dont need to be spoon feed or if they really need to get to get gifts of even easier kills they should change professionand i repeat use the search function next time
supported because i think highsec needs looking at as a whole even if this isnt the best optioni would say that 34 systems is way too much and it should only be 1 or 2 but then those systems would become camped like crazy which gives me an ideawhat if there was more lowsec introduced around hisec maybe not cutting off the routes but making it take much longer to go around than to go throughthen make it so people can build jump bridges in hisec with a severely increased fuel cost when they are used 2x5x what it is in nullsecpeople complain about how much organization there is in nullsec which is supposed to be less civilized than hisec give the players in hisec a problem to solve and the tools to solve them and youll get a beautiful network of infrastructure built up in hisec as well
withdrawn you have all had valid points thank you keep reading and commenting if you wish but i no longer think this idea is a solutioni have been reading through the csm minutes and forum threads there is a lot of issue with super capital blobs specifically with super carriersfrom what i am beginning to understand is that i dont believe that the ship itself it the issue but the way its abused now i maybe be wrong about this but instead of nerfing the super carries how about restricting the number of super capital class ships that can be in a fleet at one time vs the number of ships in a support fleet for example dont quote me on numbers but say in order to pilot multiple supercaps in a fleet you could only have 1 super cap per squad and you would have to have at least 10 ships in the squad below super cap or maybe even below capital class shipsecondly to rebalance the dread maybe give them a special bonus against super capitals without them being required to enter siege mode for exampleeditalso to prevent people from circumventing the system set it up so that super cap has to be in the fleet that the cyno is set up for when the cyno is lit that means that if one person were to try to cyno a super carrier blob they would have to do it one ship at a time per cyno if they didnt have the required support fleetthe logistics aspect has also been complained about in for the super carriers so make it ridged that they can only remote rep members of their fleet these features should reduce the likely hood of roaming super carrier blobs that can easily traverse great distanceto make the mechanic work when a player tries to join a fleet with a super cap and the limit is already reached make the join fleet fail with a given message stating the reason if a player should try to switch to a super cap after the fleet is formed and it is already at its max super cap post a warning that if he or she should continue they will be automaticly disbanded from the fleet the mechanics and fleet structure do not have to follow the format stated above could simply be a numbers game
thanks for trying to think about the issue in a lateral way but i think people with experience in these things and yes im a supercarrier pilot will tell you that we would work out a way to minimize the impact of your suggestion to the point where it would be effectively nullified
well if you think it would be easily nullifed what refinement would you suggest or do believe it should just be nerfedwhen you look at the resources to field a super carrier vs the resources that it takes to field a dread i dont believe it is in anyway over powered but thats just me i guess however the skill requirments to pilot such a ship i do believe are much too low
do youa have a deep understanding of the use of supercapsb own a supercapc fc capsd do logistics for supercap constructione live in 00 and operate at least a capital
hopefully if they dont nerf them they will at least keep them out of low sec much the same way they learned to keep caps out of high sec
fixed arbitrary fleet restrictions such as you suggest run counter to the open ended emergent nature of eves gameplay what would benefit us the most is not ccp imposing composition boundaries like you suggest but a rebalance of power so that fleet combat is no longer a 1dimensional arms race and that a viable counter exists to massed supercaps other than even more supercapsyour proposal doesnt do that it just forces alot of people or alts to tag along in what are currently suboptimal ships just so they can sit in a pos or on a gate while the alliance fields its supercarriers i should point out that this massively benefits large alliances who have the manpower to field a lot of spare pilots to act as cheerleaders while the supercaps do all the work
only thing i see this accomplishing is making it more difficult for small entities to field their own supercaps as an example most veteran small corpsalliances in npc 00 have supers they use sparingly if a small entity has say 60 pilots in it and 40 are online with your system regardless of how many supers they have the can only field a maximum of 4 in fleet so if they have 10 and needed 10 a larger entity can smoke them due to this mechanic alone
fair enough bad idea no i dont have a deep understanding of supercaps but if you look at the numbers the super carrier does not look over powered at all was my pointi was simply trying to think of an out of the box solution to balance the problem and hopefully at least inspire a good idea from someone else also i thought it may be an opportunity to help create the smaller goals for wings and squads like ccp had originally intended instead of just massive blobsthe problem seems that big alliance can field big blobs of super carriers thats the complaint i feel that has been the loudest and i was trying and obviously failing at trying to find away for smaller alliances to start leveling the playing field a littlemy original idea that i didnt mention was possibly impose debuffs for fleets with excessive super caps however i am not sure though that idea has anymore merit then the first idea
let it be sowhy well with a solid colour background it would be a piece of cake to photoshop it and use our photos in other projects eg a corp website you could also compost the photo into video easily think greenblue screen a single colour background with your favourite eperson in front nice eh celebrating the creative player are we not thanx
ive seen that happen a couple times before
well make sense to boost their sensor strengh in my opinion lang way to skill expensive so why should they not be good and since the new salvage ship they even are not as good in missions as a combination of faction bs and salvage ship so what are they good for now
i would more like to see the 8 slot opend for 2 salvagers and 2 traktors and same bonuses as the noct
marauder sensor strength could use a buff they currently dont do very well against guristas ecm rats as they get locked out
marauders were designed to be missionratting ships tractor is a dead give away no it is the only ship in eve that has been designed with a singular goal in mind without being corrupted by the incessant droning of must be able to pvpyou say yourself that the new faction ships are equal to or better than the marauders prices of pirate bs are roughly the same as that of marauders so why not use them for pvp which they are meant to instead of asking for a decarebearification of the maraudersif anything then the empires should with horror upon the pirate factions and get to work on a combat focused t2 bs to counter the threat they pose ie new ship not molestation of oldnpc ecm is purely chance based you could give them 1000 sensor strength and the result will be the same
this is no longer true
i thought we already getting that no
i tryed them out on sisi in high sec and not a rat anywhere near a gate and quite a few folks have said no also but in the off chance that they are still not coming for tq then this thread is here
nomaking boring hauling also annoying benefits no one
please let there be a massive sansha invasion in jita i want to see and hear all the tears
nope it seams that the one thing concord is able to do is keep the gates and stations clear of sansha  too bad for low sec and others
i ran into multiple sansha gatecamps in highsec on sisi not sure what youre going for with this proposal next you should propose we get new forums that are built into eve gate
i dont think its in anyones interest to have non functional neglected contentpersonally id be happy doing pve in pvp fits and then fighting the pirates that show up from what ive discusses this seems a common point of view doing missions in very expensive battleships that pop to everythingnot too funthe fw missions provide a decent template the problems with spawning would have to be fixed though and the pay should be competitive for there to be a point
i support this losec is basically just a deathtrap for anyone not out for pvp blood im not afraid of getting my pew on but if im going to run missions there is no way im doing it in lo just not at all worth the hassle it isnt so much the danger of getting killed as it is all the energy one has to spend on not getting killed sure you can stay aligned try to fit cheaper keep hitting the scanner and bolt everytime you get that gut feeling but how is that worth the extra 5 you get out of those missions simple  it isnt this is a great solution so i will add nothing do this do this now
you just hit the nail on the head its fairly easy to run missions safely in low sec the problem is there is still that risk and for so little extra rewards its just not worth it
supported
before i started using the pilgrim correctly i also complained about the range difference when you start using it for what it is good at youll realize what an amazing ship it is i sincerely hope ccp doesnt change it at all
the pilgrim is fine
there you go pilgrim threadnaughtnot that i really care anymore just dont use the thing for serious pvp easy as pie
have you tried alphaing said posget 500 tempests  easy peasy
i dont know if anyone of csm is aware pi has gone some major changes that have having some nasty consequences to anyone that made pi a way of living in eve they fixed the click fest by replacing the old extractor with a ecu but this is using so much power plus its heads that keeping the old production values in a planet or making p3 in one unique planet is now totally impossible in 00 there are reports of 2530 drops in production every 24 hours cycles in high sec reports are the other way around people seam to produce much more i have reports of 20 more than the old extractors people are starting to stress out about this complete planet production lines are dead some are rage quitting read the industrial section of the forums and there is no statement from ccp about these changes if they are intentional or not explanations comments nothing its absolute silencecan someone from csm contact ccp and obtain more data about what happen and why what was the motivation for these new power changes intentional or error they pretend to do something about it please provide us some feedback the silenceindifference is killing usthanksregards
lower supply of a demand driven resource  much higher prices and more profits not lessif your belly ache is that every one has lower output relax the profits will comeif your belly ache is not being able to fuel your pos string single handedly get over it eve is an mmo working together toward goals is the name of the game
not sure that works has intended but indeed power needs of a single extractor are very expensiveon the other side yes it will certainly help for prices and make pi become more interesting
how can it be intended when it is clearly an artefact of the artificial dt mechanics ccp have said their long term goal is to remove dt altogether great and then this would not happen at all in this case working as intended is essentially saying meh cba to fix it with our stretched resources and to avoid a discussion that might lead to a job that needs doing well pretend it is what we meant
not a bad idea jihn and i remember when fuel bays were introduced that ccp said we can have bays for anything now so how about a stront baymy fix for super carriers would be remove the more drones per skill level bonus completely then up the damage on the drones with a multiplier this way a sc could field 10 max 5 plus 5 x drone control units  if youre crazy and detoothing a supercarrier by killing its fighterbombers becomes practical today theres not only little that can hurt the sc but little that can counter its damage which to me is the kicker oh and there has to be lag benefits to only launching 7 odd fbs per sc compared to 20
i think you should stop posting
a well written and though out post outlining excellent and well structured argumentsthis isnt caod or cp try trolling there if you feel the need to
i was just thinking about this myself it makes perfect sense to have the ability to anchor your ships especially in a pos bubble at least super caps if nothing else you can anchor all sorts of things already and in real life you can anchor ships so why not eve too
at this point is any of this really important shes been gone for over 6 months and nothing is bringing her back cant we please just let this bull die already
ah yes who would ever doubt your honesty speaking of you constantly lying and trolling i guess you just forgot to provide proof of all those kills youve gotten as you so very love to pvp also speaking of your trolling your pattern is to simply claim that the facts are a smear or a screed or what have you without ever actually rebutting them because like the rest of anks troll brigade facts are your enemy just like youre pretending that your alt accounts arguments which are exactly the same as yours except they include one snipped quote are totally different not that congratulating your troll alt on using the same trolling but claiming that the same exact trolling is now fine grainedyep as predicted you cant do it because you were trolling and naturally everybody knows that the reality of what you actually said is out to get you and actually quoting what you said would show that its cruelly falsifying your denialas for your trolling about the csm only one member described it as an nonissue and did so in a rage post that they then retracted naturally youre dishonestly describing that too and naturally youre trolling on the general point as one members personal opinion of something does not mean that an adult throwing things at a business meeting is a nonissue and to point out how youre trolling you started by claiming or feigning ignorance and still tried to deny what had happened from a position of admitted absolute ignorance and then when you learned about the situation lo and behold it just happened to reinforce the view you held when you claimed to not know what had even happened what luck and of course you are dishonestly describing it and spinning it because like all of anks troll brigade facts eviscerate your nonsense much like the delilah accounts trolling you need to claim that the actual verifiable facts are overblown as if nuhn uhnn was a rebuttal of facts and again this is hilarious youre actually trolling on behalf of a disgraced crazy woman whos been totally removed from the game for half a year now at least troll about someone relevant
the quote i used from mynxee in which mynxee described spoongate as a nonevent was taken from a post mynxee made after mynxees self described rage post again for the casual reader and those impaired as zero is the url is
personally i dont mind him trying to convince others were the same person posts to that end and just about every other post hes made only serve to show people how foolish he is and the desperation with which he grasps at the merest wisp of a straw not to mention how he has to build the molehill first in order to make a mountain out of itmy pleasure and youre entirely welcomebest regardswindjammer
post with your mainwas her opinion designed to try to tamp down controversy that she thought would reflect on the entire csm but most of us realize that grown adults throwing things when they have a temper tantrum is not normal and not other peoples fault nope you made that upi did not dispute anybodys version of events i did not dispute anything straight from the horses mouth that a lie what actually happened was disagreement about the political consequences which were personal opinions and predictions which is not the same as disagreeing with the facts as reported by those who were there the actual from the horses mouth facts realty has a well known antitroll antiank bias its a smearscreedjust to prove my point about how yes your argument is trolling lets look at your earlier bit  qedyep how can we say as a relative certainty that ank violated the nda thats horrible of course you can say that a number of the csm delegates can be accurately accused of violating the nda we just cant say that about ank because wellhey look over there
i was there in the room i was sitting next to eva when the spoon was launched and more importantly i know what triggered it and who it was actually aimed at the actual facts reflect better on eva that most people might expectin the larger context of the meeting spoongate was as mynxee pithily put it a noneventwrt the ndaviolation i can have no opinion on that since i do not know the facts however i spent a fair amount of time with eva in iceland during that trip and found her to be quite different from her internet persona i quite liked her
no problem its all based in fact she was trying to ruin pvp in high sec she was voted in by the pve community and by people like you people who want to see eve as a friendly place inappropriate text removed as per the forum rules steviesg
interesting can you elaborate the story at the time iirc was that some rudenessside conversation was going on and ank was annoyed so she threw something to get attention is that not accurate in any case even if in the context of the meeting itself it was a nonevent to some people obviously not to others but the semantic value if you will of cutlery isnt an objective matter who did what why who it was aimed at etc is all factual and well and good but whether or not something was important enough to be considered or not isnt people throwing things out of frustration or really almost any reason is going to be seen as significant by quite a few whether or not it was thrown with malice or out of pique especially if its part of a pattern like anks reaction at the first several meetings of the year w hen people disagreed with her or werent voting her wayin a nutshell though the facts are all well and good but the interpretation is another matter entirely thats too bad and it raises the question of why exactlyshe created her internet persona if she really believed that people who play badguys in an internet spaceship game are real life sociopaths then that is pretty much a delusional disorder if she didnt believe in real life that people who played the game differently than her were sociopaths why the  were there quite so many times and quite so many quotes which were variations on that theme if her internet persona was just a ploy to win votes or appeal to the pve crowd thats kind of disturbing
the character creator doesnt lack diversity people just makes the same archetypal characters over and over again
having concord in low sec would defeat the purpose of having low sec low sec is all about being rewarded for taking risks having npc rentacops would kill that on the other hand if one wanted to do something risky like mine in low sec there nothing to prevent hiring a merc or bringing a corp mate along for protection i think thats what the game encourages and the point of being in a corp
where be the patch notes

i support the yarn and have a suggestion why not have both drives the old and the new each would have their advantages ans disadvantages while allowing a bit of personalization this would also help with the miner problem force somevery few ships into only being able to fit the old warm up engineyou could also make the warp drives an module with its own slotlike rigs so buy the drive you want and fit iton a site note the current warp effects were implmented during trinity the old warp effect was indeed stronger but ccp hates strong effects they like subtle ones
although i love the ideas i still believe that there must be an additional motivation big alliances are holding to their own spaces not because of pvp content but because of economical reasons changing occupancy of a system should bring some form of economical rewarda direct reward would be prone to abuse so it should be in form of additional accessible resources one thing that comes to my mind is let the bunkers spawn local militia force agents for the occupying faction these agents should give missions in their occupied systems and around so that once a system becomes occupied the occupying side gets access to fw missions with much less travelling involved maybe a lp bonus for completing these agents missions could be added as wellabout op suggestions1 i agreebut there should be some type of interaction with the button maybe a hacking module to hack it to run the timer2 just a message like amarrian slavers are attacking our major stronghold in dal system should be enough knowing amount of pilots and shiptypes beforehand is really too much intel that intel has to be gathered by pilots3 although i generally agree with this one post dt when there are fewer players has better chance of nice small gang action as the evening nears the size of gangs grows and pvp turns to blob warfare a solution would be limiting number of ships that can enter a plex at one time for example installations would allow max 3 players from each side at one time outposts 6 compunds 10 and strongholds unlimited this would somewhat limit the blobs inside plexesthought gate itself would be completely blobbable4 i agree this way i can use that utility slot for some other utility than probe launcher another solution would be increasing range of onboard scanner for fw plexes only this way overview wont be crowded with un attended plexes and we can know which amarr minor facility we have to warp to get combat when there are 3 of them in system p

thanks for the ideas guys dont forget that if support the discussion here to check the box i do agree that there needs to be better rewards for plexing the op doesnt address that issue the intent of the op changes were really just to make fw plexing more pvp centered and more fun  in itself but i am happy to have these ideas in the thread because giving better rewards is likely also necessaryx gallentiusi like the idea there the formulas you use seem to take into account the 2 main concerns with awarding occupancy the first concern is that everyone will just keep piling into the winning side the second concern is people will have alts in fw that do nothing but collect the rewards your formula seems to take into account both of these concerns so i tend to like the formulas but let me ask this what would be the matter with simply dividing a set of lp for the completion of a plex to everyone who is on grid if there are more people on grid fewer lp for each pilot perhaps it should a bit of both a formula similar to what you have proposed as well as some small immediate payment to the pilots involved perhaps the immediate payout should be based on how long you were in the plex that way if someone was mainly just sitting outside the gate because they wanted to keep their presence out of the intel they can but they wont get as much reward to help the side that is out numbered maybe there could be some sort of balancing as systems get occupied lets say caldari have occupied x of the systems on the gallente and caldari front x  some number greater than 50 obviously then all of a sudden the gallente can enter minor plexes in cruisers and medium plexes in bcs etc caldari would still be limited to the original plex size hence it becomes harder and harder to completely win if it comes down to 1 or 2 systems left they may even let battleships in the minor plexxes i can envision final stands where 20 battleships and 30 bcs are swarmed by 500 frigates and destroyers who knows how it would work out for the sake of space i wont give the story line explanations other than to say there are some
1 as far as interaction with the button i dont know anything about hacking would that require something else we would need to fit on the ship i really think ccp needs to make it so that the challenge to plexing is the other side trying to blow you up before the timer runs anything else is a sign of failure any pve requirements would just cover up the fact that the occupancy system comes up short2 i think the intel would make the game better the whole idea is both sides would have to react fast and assign pilots to the multitude of battles that would be constantly fought throughout the 8 regions of fw i think each faction has 2 regions in fw so 4 factions x2 8 regions before those timers run out it shouldnt be something where you see they are attacking then have to fly over there find out what they are in and then fly back and get the right ships etc and in the meantime they shipped up etc that is too much like the current system the npcs can see what ships they are in so they should report it and both sides should be reacting to constantly changing set of conditions in a somewhat frantic way to send pilots to try to holdtake these plexes 3 because there is such a large area of space to cover and already ship size restrictions on plexes blobbing wouldnt be a good way to go about the occupancy war if you are taking plexes with 3 ships when you only need 1 then you are only 13 as efficient as you should be the other side will be capping 3xs as many plexes per pilot as you are and yes blobs could camp the gate to the plex but again that is inefficient instead of those players sitting out and therefore perhaps not getting the award they could be doing plexes in other systems for these reasons i think they should allow as many ships as you want in the plex newer pvpers may indeed need numbers to take on more experienced pvpers as they gain experience in pvp they will be more valuable to the militia
noeves is the most persistent of online worlds and that is part of its attraction our destinies are a result of ingame actions  ours or others microtransactions will further diminish this illusion far more than plex and metagaming already do and thusly detract from the uniqueness of eve which youll have to agree would be detrimental to eve and thus to ccps financials in the mid to long term since much of eves success stems from it being so different from what other mmos have to offer also vanity items are just as much part of the eve economy as anything else if somebody absolutely must have a silver magnate let them buy plex for isk and then spend it the same might be true for silver sunglasses a different hair style or just a new mug shot but since such will not be realistically priced at the level of a 50m space frigate there shouldnt really be any point for it since an average lvl 1 mission should easily pay for the most luxurious of makeovers
i vote no let stuff cost isk instead

this is my top 1 issue major parts of the game need to be fixed redesigned or removed
yes more polished releases more refined features more community driven contentno halfbaked ideas last minute feature changes promising something that is not deliveredall in all i think eve is the best thing to happen to the mmo genre it needs to continue to push the scifi genre forward in a complete and excellent as it were manner
its not just the stuff they have released in expansions some things have been just plain stupid since day 1 mining what game developer thinks that sitting in front of an asteroid clicking a couple buttons every 3 minutes is fun
this thread isnt here to suggest a fix to make dreads useful that would likely be a seperate change to dreadsthis thread is here to discuss changes to sc vs subcaps so they cant roflstomp subcap fleets and any tacklers involved and ya im a  why would that bother me you obviously havent even read the op of the thread with your last 2 posts bobbeh your corp mate suggested my original fb idea verbatim congrats its my understanding they werent put into the game in that way because ccp would have had to alter drone mechanics heavily and they dont really know how drones work anymore
i thought it sounded familiarpyea i figured as much but as i said i think the change is in the subcapscyclical vs linear
keep everything the samebut remove ew immunity except for regular warp disruptors maybe reduce sensor strengths to concentrate the nerfproblem solvedthis means they are still useful in smaller numbers and multiplied in large numbers except they are counterable by something other than an equal number of supercaps because people will be able to jam and dampen the hell out of them
the only ewar that would be even remotely useful to use against them would be ecm so really youre wanting ecm immunity removed because one races overpowered ewar apparently balances thingshint it doesntjamming 3040 supercaps would take at least 100 dedicated ecm boats if not more using all the proper racial jammers and we all know what drones tend to do against those who are jamming their host this would just result in a lot of dead ecm boats followed by the rest of the subcaps an unjammed titan can alpha an ecm boat every 1516 seconsd
how about increasing the capacitor need or cooldown of supercarrier jumps making them hard to move around and nearly impossible to retreat from battle super carriers should be allor nothing ships ie if two fleets with supercarriers show up only one of them will leave with a single supercarrier alive hasnt ccp been saying they want them to die more give scs the ability to prevent other scs from warping jumping or logging out of the battleccp already wants big uberfleets to be less mobile they should start with the biggest ships and work their way down instead of looking at jump bridges firstas for actual stats i agree that fighterbombers should be easier to lock upheres an idea just a thought what if supercarriers couldnt be affected by any implants or boosters after all its a freaking huge ship why should a little chipset and some chemicals in your head increase its hitpoints by massive amounts this alone would reduce the overpowered tank of the nyx  friends to more reasonable levels
signedalthough im satisfied with my bloodline it would be nice to give people the option to change their bloodline since the new character creation is so different from the old one
voting to let us change it
i personally dont want to change my bloodline but i can see people wanting too there shouldnt be such a big issue with it it doesnt change gameplay at all and ccp already scrapped our old identitiesentire roleplay bios scrapped i would go as far as to say that ccp doesnt like the rp communityi dont rp a while back they nerfed the bio character limit then they nerfed the note character limit which cut some stories in half now they take something that to an rper is one of the most important things in the game their character or i guess the representation of their characterhell if i had my way i would allow you to have a 2ndmixed bloodline why cant a brutor have a kid with a caldari i would think it would be quite common among the new hipster pod pilots
im in the same boat as you i started my character in 2007 and the only reason for selecting the bloodline i chose then was for the starting advantage because picking a bloodline changed the stats and the skills you were given to start withalso i didnt check with other caldari bloodlines but why did ccp remove the long hair from civire they had when testing on sisi i wouldnt mind a gender change either for silly reasons ccp seems a little sexist right now because female characters seem to have better features or maybe im the only one who noticesedit forgot to state also that it would appear some bloodlines have this odd ability to make you have a fixed appearance no matter what options you take to individualize yourself
exactly how do you get tothis from this  same as in sigi was under the impression that minmatar were modeled after all tribal societies on terrai thought it was cool how europeanfeatures could be part of them not surprising actually as the hungarians can attest to how did i interpret thisminmatar means heavymetal tribalclothingtattoos norse shipnames etcall in all we are talking about pockets of terran colonies that were trapped on unfriendly planets plunged into darkness after the collapse of the evegate but still at minimum an entire planet matar not to mention the enslavement and subsequent slavebreeding programs by the amarrminmatar doesnt really mean one race but rather several different races trapped together working together surviving together as many tribes united under a republicso id bet that there would be several vherokior running around with slightly europeanfeaturesedit to add id rather support more character features than actual bloodlinechangeim actually tied to my characters back storysupported because there needs to be some kind of optionedit ii changed portrait looks batter but i still support others who are not satisfied
if this had been done with the release i could see it post release its a bigger issue i dont agree with radically changing every aspect at a whim but i do think that it should have been made possible with the updateas has been stated many chose their characters for the looks but long before that  you had racial bonuses that directly effected the abilities of characters along the lines of what they wanted to do in the gameallowing them to diversify their appearances 1 time that had no other effects would workit would actually fix some rp issues  i like that groups mindset i needed this groups abilities when i started those types can fix the problem
loving the whiny racism in this thread asians in my spaceships this is an outrage
of course i support this whatever the reasons people want to change their race or bloodline its only fair that with a new character creator people get another chance to choose what they think looks best to them my car dealer doesnt paint my black car red because theres new car paints and no the fact that i can pick a whole palette from scarlet red to burgundy red doesnt change that its not that its better or worse its just a matter of personal preference it should be respected and a lot of bloodlines are totally different now
no
1 especially since racebloodline has no impact on gameplay anymore
noif it is offered then i really hope its chargeable just like changing a portrait was
as some one who has had the same char since i made him in 2005 id welcome a changestrategic choices i made when it mattered should be free to change when the developer renders them pointless we see this all the time when a ship is nerfedfixedredesignedwatever players will switch to whatever ship suits them after the changealso where is my blue plastic shirt and hair
yes make an remape just like the atributes wouldt be to hard i gues
noyou made your choice now stick with it
i approve thisi started back in 2009 and then we had these old portraits which looked rather outdated or clumpsy back in the old days you didnt choose a certain racebloodlineancestory for its looks but you chose what was best for your first ever career in eve now they released the new character revamp making it an important part of the game with its realistic looks it looks awesome and for that reason people care how they look now it is not fair for these people to have chosen a race in the old days and let them stick to that racebloodlineancestory forever keeping the reasons above in mind after these amazing changes to your looksfor me this means im a negro i do not want to be one i chose the brutor bloodline for its stats not the looks because the portrait in the old days meant nothing heck in the old days you could only dream of your character getting out your ship someday and meet up with other people today however the portrait has something thats really cool and is worth showing off this makes me feel frustrated because i cant be the racebloodline i want to be we should be free changing the either the race or bloodline or ancestory we are in now nowadays the choice is more aesthetic dependant rather than stats dependant like in the old days having made a choice in the past and punishing customers for an unforseen change years later in the game is not fairso i approve jenny cameron in this going motion
from the day one in eve civires are stated as strict militaristic people who prefer short hair having some damned civire hippies running around smoking ganja would just kill the immersion for me so thank you ccp for not giving civire the long hair option it is the same with other caldari the society is strict and militaristic so it is good for the immersion to limit use of long haircaldari society is steeped in military tradition as a people its members had to fight a long and bloody war to gain their independence and even had to surrender their home planet to their hated enemies the gallenteansas long as you keep in line do your job uphold the laws and so forth life can be fairly pleasant and productive but for those who are not cut out for this strict disciplined regime life quickly becomes intolerable they lose their respect family status everything and the only options left to them are suicide or exileyeah no hippies allowed 
voting in support of a bloodline changelike alot of people back when i started the bloodline you chose had a real in game impact ever since they removed that and ive learned more about the lore of the game ive been wishing that i could go and change my bloodline to get the appearance that i wanted of course back then it wasnt as big of an issue for me since i had managed to create an avatar that i at least somewhat likedwith the new character creation though i havnt been able to do that even after spending hours playing with options nothing quite seems right and i dont think that we should be forced to settle for an avatar that we dont like based solely on decisions made years ago using an avatar creation method that has since been replaced

1please review gallente race like ccp did with minmatar
i fear that incursions will only make the weaknesses in the gallente weaponsships even more profound and there pilots will eventually be left behind or only brought along out of pity for such an arrogantly weak race
its not nearly that bad the taranis and ishkur are both considered by some to be the best in there class and by others the second best the dominix for what its worth is probably the only really solo capable bs minus the tempest but thats really a big battlecruiserafter that though i will say that i support rebalancing gallente ships as part of the removal of the tier system

hey look a bunch of people who have trained for race x are in favor of boosting race x my word this is surprising i would not have expected this in a million years what what what
signed gallente sucks currently dps equal or less than matar gun range sucks type of damage speed agility and with new ai on rats drones will sucks as well as theyll be killed like sleepers do
i can fly each races subcaps t1 and t2 gallente subcaps suck pretty bad the smaller the gallente ship the more the problem exists caldari hybrid platforms arent a lot better but their shield tanks vs armor tanks allow them to accelerate and fly a bit faster missiles work lasers work projectiles work each have a useful niche where they excel hybrids dont most painfully on gallente shipsthe only hybrid ship i still fly is a vulture and only because im not there to do damage

not a bad idea to be honest helps with the whole afk cloaking thing and is a pretty fair nerf to noncovert cloaking
those that think this idea is for afk cloaking  reread the opit does nothing to stop afk cloaking it just stops recharge so caps cant cyno out easily after waiting cloaked
fly away little troll
o hey look a great idea
supported
a good idea tbh my only concern would be about covert ops ships running out of cap as they move around a few warps and they are out of cap forcing them to decloak and rechargenot that its a bad thing
facepalmi guess i need to update my op and use the largest font available to say this hasnothing to do with covert ops cloaks
not a bad idea at all
i dont think it would take significant time to make breasts move even just a little they want this to be as real as possibleif walking in stations is anything like the videos for the carbon tech they were showing off a while ago then walking will be rather realistic too i am sure we will get more clothes hairstyles tattoos etcthats what the incarna team is for they have 6 months to add more content and get it all set the way they want this isnt asking much
makes sense to me incarna can support the same combat system as eve spaceshipscombat group of terror assault breast strikes serpentis admiral for 687 damage wreckingnotify loading the  into the  this will take approximately 10 seconds lol noob
bumpeven my portrait is more enhanced than my missiles now more support please
bumping this for the greater good
as someone who personally flies the legion i support this change 4 low slots on a covert ops setup is a joke
yep supertanked baitship is not a real role but i guess ccp can easily access and check the stats for t3 ships and subsystems sold in comparison cant they maybe just need a nudge to actually do it in order to realize if and where a rebalancing is in orderadditionally considering due to background stuff et al hams are supposed to be one of the two amarrish missile systems together with rockets a minor tweak to make sure a legion with hams does actually better than a tengu with hams might be in order as well
nowhere did i say that it could do all those things at once but then again neither can a harbinger the point is that you have tremendous versatility in an armor cane and the tank and dps numbers correspond accordingly with a harbinger with the only difference being the weapon systems what you neglect to mention is that the harbinger lacks the tracking to actually apply that dps except at the very tip of its optimal and you make it sound like the non selectable dps is the only one you can apply at 20km the harbinger has no defense against neuting which only mildly inconveniences a hurricane thats already in its optimal i also noticed you didnt mention anything about natural resists barely mentioned the selectable damage types and the raw speed difference between the twoand if were going to inject a little reality into this how about we be real about why we dont see armor hurricanes its because the general trend is towards mobility and logistics which means shield tanking and scimitars a scimi isnt going to do  for an armor cane if youre going to make disingenuous points do it in some other thread
in the csm minutes ccp said that they dont want to balance gallentehybrids because no one uses them and so it isnt an issuethey also want to keep the racial stereotypes such as minmatar being the fastest
you seem to underestimate medium pulse tracking quite a bit they hit just fine especially that the things getting closer than 10km are gonne be webbedand no you dont do anything with faction shortrange at 20km with your armor caneharbingers use cap injectors those work wonders against neutsi also didnt mention instant ammo switching between longrange and shortrange or the fact that you dont know if you are gonna shoot a shield or armor tanker its kinda funny loading fusion just to find out you are shooting at shields one of the main reasons youll default to phased plasma 90 of the time when not using barragegiven shields are so popular on battlecruisers lately i dont even understand why youd bring up resists unless you want to back up my argumenti think the general idea is to use the guardian aka best logi in game when running armor gangs doesnt change the fact that the cane is a subpar choice in armor gangs

you were talking about comparing armor bcs i think resists are a huge factor especially base resists who the hell is talking about using faction shortrange at 20km no  you dont use it you use barrage but the point is that you can switch the same way you switch between scorch and multifreq is it as fast a switch as a harb of course not but that doesnt mean that you cant use itall your saying with the tracking and web comment is that the harb wont suffer as much in web range guess what the harb does less dps so at that range its still going to get ed overand lastly the scimi comment was on the rise of shield bcs and why you dont see armor canes over shield canes i see plenty of armor canes in armor fleets and frankly even if the dps is marginally less because of falloff the cane can control range much better than the harbingerall of this just highlights the point that the cane is hardly helpless armor tanked or no and saying that a gallente speed buff is going to spell the death of minmatar ships is just plain wrong its a wrong conclusion based on wrong information
i tend to agree with the focus on main platforms but also think there is need for a hybrid rebalance range boost to optimal would be good for a start1 no comment really im not really familiar with how functional rsds are though i suspect you are mostly correct about this one2 this can be worked around to some extent such as not fitting trimarks and moving some dps to rigs instead of using a weapon upgrade or two this will allow for a resistance boost with energized membranes or dcii or something alternatively you can fit plate with agility penalties i tend to agree but think the rebalance is elsewhere3 like here boost the speed on gallente ships to equal or exceed that of minmatar ships we all know the main issue with gallente ships and hybrids is sustainable and achievable dps sure it works great in controlled and predictable pve environments it does not work well in pvp because you just cant get in range to use them switch to rails and suffer a significant loss in dps or become vulnerable to gain speed and agility in principal that doesnt sound so bad and follows fitting logi the reality is that it incapacitates the ship further and makes it ineffective and vulnerable rigs create penalize and stacking penalizes trying to improve something that is poor to begin with reduces any chance of success you might have 50 of nothing is still nothing upgrading speed would be a good thing and it would go a long way to improving gallente ships effectiveness4 or decrease the pg requirements for hybrids alternatively do both to a lesser extent gallente ships do suffer on powergrid as i recall cant imagine trying to fit that hurricane fit up there on a brutix speaking of which i might add regarding that you need to overheat everything for effect yep checked and its not even close its not a myrmi to properly compare but it doesnt even come close to fitting as it maxes pg shortly after mounting the hybrids and doesnt have the fitting room it would get very nice armor tank with trimarks though so you could modify the fit for effect though youd lose speed and so were back to that nobody is going to close with a brutix and take its dps if they are aware they can sit off 10km and take 0 dps or lower dps move a little further out as he swaps ammo you have 10 seconds and the next lower dps ammo wont touch you either who was it that mentioned almost instantly swapping out ammo anyway5 i cant really say much about the reppers save i noticed they are hard to fit and provide capacitor for generally not very practical massive pg req and lower rep per equal duration though at slightly less cost to capacitor not so much cpu cost its hard to be really specific about the balance there because the fitting requirements are different per ship and factionsupportededit the fact is everything is really well balanced which makes it hard to see problems on the surface once you enter gameplay however things become more apparentwarfare is about exploiting an enemies weaknesses while attempting to limit your own weaknesseswhen a nation fields and army and equips them to face the battle ahead they generally make an effort to gather intelligence to better understand enemy tactics and capabilities all nations will make an effort to improve their weapons of war and increase their tactical advantage whether actively engaged preparing for war or in peacetime research testing and development is done on an ongoing basis easily defeated technologies and tactics that were once powerful are discarded and replaced with technology and tactics that are proven more effectivea ship module or weapon can be redesigned and made more effective against enemy tactics if something proves ineffective its bound to be changed or discarded before the next engagement
i think you need to look at an actual armor cane it certainly cant project damage to 2025km even with barrage425s with barrage have 3  18km for its range220s with barrage have 27  17km for its rangeso with falloff formula you will not be putting out meaningful damage swapping to that would mean you lost 10s of damage in that fight as well due to no armor cane actually loading barrage on a regular basis from the start of the fightedit i would like to improve gallente but i would say making them the fastest ships kills minmatar kiting i would prefer to make it so once they have you in scram you dont leavealso thats funny that you just claimed a harbinger is out dpsd by a armor cane with everyone flying shield these days and the harbinger without tracking enhancers hitting reliably out to 20km with scorch im surprised so many people whinge about the laser damage type i just cross trained my alt to fly harbingers for that reasonedit 2 that hurricane fit is horrible and still doesnt do damage reliably out to 20km unless we talk drone damage only

ill concede that you cant project dps to 25km and only barely out to 20km however the base speed difference more than makes up for that with the cane being able to control range much better than a harbinger also the whole discussion was about comparing the performance of armor bcs so the damage types come into play but also just because not everything shield tanked is going to have a massive em hole nor is everything going to be shield tanked its easy to come up with scenarios where a particular ship will get pwnt hard but on the whole pvp is highly unpredictable and you can come up with a ton of scenarios where paper beats rock but selectable damage types tends to give an advantage on the whole compared with nonselectable damage typesalso heres the hurricane fit i did up in efthurricane new setup 1energized adaptive nano membrane iienergized adaptive nano membrane iidamage control ii1600mm reinforced rolled tungsten plates igyrostabilizer iigyrostabilizer iiyt8 overcharged hydrocarbon i microwarpdrivefaint epsilon warp scrambler ifleeting propulsion inhibitor ibalmer series tracking disruptor i220mm vulcan autocannon ii hail m220mm vulcan autocannon ii hail m220mm vulcan autocannon ii hail m220mm vulcan autocannon ii hail m220mm vulcan autocannon ii hail m220mm vulcan autocannon ii hail mheavy assault missile launcher ii caldari navy fulmination assault missileheavy assault missile launcher ii caldari navy fulmination assault missilemedium trimark armor pump imedium trimark armor pump imedium trimark armor pump ihammerhead ii x3the td allows you to control range even better on the harbinger due to its pathetic falloff or take a big chunk out of his dps if you decide to close range either way this is hardly a weak ship even if we do boost gallente speedand lastly one of my underlying points is that kiting is way too easy in this game minmatar kiting should be killed if you want to kite you should have to severely gimp your fit in order to get the amount of speed you need to do so you should not be able to kite things without any effort whatsoever the other races counter with range the gallente have no counter unless you count rails with  tracking and  dps
funny and still it would be desirable to be assured that no ratings censorships and financial affairs will force ccp to refuse a mature ratingbring more people to eve  certainly remarkablyto destroy the virtual world in which always lived many adult people who love scifi and their representation about him for the sake of attraction of interest to game at children  is an insidiousness and villainy
was a dumb idea to be able to link systems multiple jumps away and be able to jump those distances in a subcapital ship i remember laughing about how dumb they were when i traveled some 30 jumps with virtually zero risk youre ing ed or dying on purpose if you die navigating one of your jb networksget rid of jbs
can we please drop the zero risk nonsense its trivially easy to have a cloaked dictor and bomber gang sitting off a jb and capsfreighters that use jbs are easy targets for any hotdrop gank and often subcap ganks too jbs are not risk free and not virtually risk free either a competent opponent can and will murder your face on a jb network
remember that hot dropping will be nerfed too at very least there would be some delay between cyno activation and ships appearing if thats the cast the pos guns would lock on any dictor  stealth bomber within 1020 seconds and insta pop italso the freighter thing is just half of the major problem other half is that every alliance member in their little raven zealot dramiel whatever small ship  they all travel instantly and safely nobody is gonna use that dictor drop strategy for main jb traffic
there may be mechanics arent finalized or as far as i understand it even in the working on it stage yet just off the top of my head i can think of several easy counters and if i can others will and the community will come up with more have a disposable tackler to land initial tackle and a hard tanked damnation aligned just off grid that can warp in and pick up the tackle and then light a cyno on poss without lots of guns simply send in a hard tanked proteus and rep it when a gank squad jumps in on poss with proper guns use a few disposable rifters to land tackle in series as each one is about to pop and have a cyno just off grid or just 200 km off the jb itself or whatever and pop the cyno when the first rifter lands tackle alternatively alter any of the ideas above by scouting your opponents jb network and alerting your buddies to exactly when a ship is about to jump through when a ship warps tolands onis about to activate a jb pop your cyno in the destination system and get your ships insystem or hiding in the next system over ready to engage use bomber gangs to quickly land tackle and cycle off before the pos pops them with a few probepoint bombers to probe down anybody who logs off with aggro and have a subcap gank fleet waiting to alpha the hell out of anything smaller than a supecarrier the above took me about 180 seconds to come up with what do you think that entire gathered eve community could do with months of time again no they do not its trivially easy to eliminate almost any ship or gang of ships drams somewhat excludedby sitting a cloaked dictor off a jb and having a wave or two of bombers ready to go at a moments notice death is a virtual certainty if your enemy has the jb scouted and knows when youre about to jump through and you dont have intel about the other side except of course all the times when they do ive seen it more than once its remarkably cheap and effective and can yield a massive tally of killmails if performed correctly
remove drone regions you eliminate a large chunk of botters and restore some amount of balance to the mineral market
some people with very short memories out there anyone would think that eve has always had sovereignty and poses and jump bridgesim really not comprehending why it would be bad to wage war on your neighbours you know the guys with the other technetium moons rather than having to travel 30 jumps in any direction just to get a 1v1 that instantly turns into a blobfest
supported getting rid of them would be very much acceptable
thi is a great idea though it is coming from ccp itself and not from csmthis would make 00 wars more interesting decrease blobs and make the life in 00 more challenging than in high sec as it should bevery supportedbtwi my opinion jbs should be removed and the jump drive of capitals and super capitals should be removed gate travel or nerfed the timer system should be reworked when a tower is reinforced it can only keep up the big ff for 12h afterwards the ff shriks so that it only protects the tower after the ff has shrunck the anchored modules can be either hacked and stolen or destroyedblack ops should become cheaper and keep the ability to use covert cynos covert cynos should get a range buff covert cynos should get tight mass restrictions like wh covert cyno can be only opened every 36h in the same systemthis would give the sov holders an incentive to devide their forces in order to protect their assets since they cant cyno in the blob within minutes anymoreblack ops would become much more usefull
thats interesting since people are pointing out the fact that coalitions and blobs have been in eve since long before jbs and the sov system and removing them wont effect that but will get rid of a good game mechanic for no good reason how about because its not your choicethe game is a sandbox and people get to play their own way if they want to form pacts so their home is safe space and theyre not currently fighting with neighbors thats their call if they want to go 30 jumps for a fight thats their call tooyou either have playercreated playerdriven content or you dont you cant have a playercreated political landscape and then get upset that the politics that theyve created arent the ones youd create if you were in control
sandbox or not you can only do what tools let you and tools are provided by ccp you arent implying that tools are and should be built without regard to use im not sure that would be any good for the game as it is now
all of those are based on point of view right now power blocks things putting as many people into once system to lag it out is a tactic and a strategy also their version of good pvp is 50 of them verses 5 of you also with you not loading grid now that is a good fight for them any changes to take those tactics strategy and their version of a good fight will result in them fighting any change and raging on the forums as loud as possible to keep it from happeningin my opinion there is no good pvp left in 00 and the only tacticstrategy is blob the  out of the other person where a players skills fitting even ship sometimes is all irrelevantalso get rid of static moon income already so ing stupid that this is still aroundedit finnagain it is extremely entertaining watching you desperately try to counter everyone in this thread that is for jump bridge removal if anything all you are doing is making it more and more obvious how much you and a ton of others in power blocks rely on jump bridges for absolutely everything you doit is a huge crutch for a lot of power block members it will be interesting to see which ones are able to remember how to use their legs and which ones fall flat on their face if they are removed
this i was in a mediumsized alliance around the time jump bridges came out that tried to get into null sec we were given the ultimatum if you arent nc then you are with bob claiming there were three major power blocks at that time is almost a stretch i understand you are proud of goon heritage and all but in the grand scheme of things you guys were pretty small beans back thenremoving bridges wont break up the blocks if anything they will probably become tighter again i will point out that if you want to open up null space you need to increase the ability to project force in null sec this means alliancesblocks dont have time to worry about the little guys as they are more constantly under threat of attack by the other power blocks
jb have next to nothing to do with the fabled blob at all i dont get why people are still trying so hard to shoot themselves in the foot by repeating this fallacy over and over again it is doing this proposal a huge disservicethe problem of jb is one of force projection travel speed and the ease of defending large territories and how eve got a lot smaller due to that high numbers are only tangentially a result of this
yes they also have next to nothing to do with power blocs forming but people allege that too but as marlona demonstrates whats really going on is that some people are angry at coalitions and they think that removing jbs will hurt coalitions so theyre for it hell even greyscales logic is apparently that coalitions are bad so hed like to try to break them up it seems to be the school of eve is based around playercreated empires and playerdriven content and wait you are playercreating wrong do it the way id do it if i was creating it player see even there the effect is being overstated during the invasion of the drone regions recently thousands of pilots hauled all their gear down to the lowsec systems within jump range of the combat zone and we made significant gains that was 100 without jump bridges playing any effect once stores were moved to the front lines even rages advance in the northeast wasnt truly dependent on jump bridges and generally was simply speeded up by what 15 minutes a half hour that wouldnt have made any real difference in terms of invasions and defenders have the luxury of stront timeing and sov structure timing and so on you dont need to make it for the first attack and can easily ready a defense for the second even if you need to travel 15 extra jumps or 30 the ability to raise a fleet of pilots who are willing to spend hours on an op is what enables force projection not bridges not titan bridging not cynos and with jump clones even time isnt all that much of an issue move a fleet down to attack an objective dock up in lowsecnpc 00 and clone jump back to your hq if you need to defend something you could nerf jump drives jump bridges jump bridging and hell reduce ships warp velocity by 90 and a bunch of players who are willing to go x jumps to attack a target will still be able to project force yes and changing the tools that people are using because you dont like how theyre choosing to play in the sandbox means that youve no longer got a sandbox game if the objection is people should be using these tools to fight each other not cooperate as it certainly is as suggested by ccp then its bull the role of ccp is not to determine what the political landscape of the sandbox will look like thats the job of the people playing the game give proof or retract that any powerbloc in the game deliberately tries to induce lag rather than simply bringing a bunch of folks and not caring about lag as is well known lag only effects one side in a battle it can smell reds like wolves smell fear yes yes brilliant factual refutation or ad hominem bull hrmm yah on second thought definitely not the factual refutation one feel free to actually address the facts and the arguments made its neat
1 jump bridge per constellation
but they do have to determine validity of a tool its ccp job to say whether tool is or is not performing what it was built for once players find unintended uses its on ccp to either legalize such use or prevent it it cant be any other way players will always push whatever they can to win thats natural some ways of playing will be found lacking and ignored these ignored options are either removed or improved because maintaining ignored options is waste of resources thats what balance cycles doyou cant really put ccp out of game they have to have at least some vision where all of it is going while they should not have a say on who should be controlling space they most certainly should care how is controlling done
what unintended uses are we talking about though seriously people werent using jbs to get into jove space or anything the bridges are serving exactly as intended what they werent intended to do evidently is aid groups that want to cooperate past a certain arbitrary threshold but thats not how you design a tool if you want to design a tool that lets people move around then thats its use if you want to design a tool to make politics in a playerdriven game turn out the way you want then thats not a tool thats altering game mechanics to stop players from creating the content and driving the game which is fine i guess if thats the goal and ccp is honest about it if ccp came out tomorrow and said eve is no longer a playerdriven game with playercreated political content instead groups of players will have to adhere to official ccp guidelines they are as followsnow itd be a different game and one many of us probably wouldnt want to play anymore but itd at least be straight forward but this its a sandbox hey youre sandboxing wrong stuff is absurd their vision used to be eve is the biggest mmo on the market where players create and control their own destines and politics is a vibrant and interesting part of the game its a game where thousands of people from all parts of the world can fight over one single objective that is persistent and mattersthat doesnt seem to be the vision anymore they also dont have a leg to stand on assuming that politics are playercreated when they try to dictate how that controlling is done if my political system is to force my neighbors to mine minerals and pay tribute to me so i dont attack them why is that any more or less valid in a sandbox game than blueing my neighbor and kicking the head in of some guy across the map or setting all my neighbors red or setting the entire universe red and only accepting mercenary contracts or whatever eve is either a game whose politics and content are created and driven by players or its a game whose politics and content are created by ccp but if it is ccp needs to be explicit in the fact that theyre changing their model
finnagain zero i am aware that a dedicated pvp alliance with 20 gangs and 10 stealth bombers can effectively camp a jb i also know that after the first kill they would be scouted enemy becomes aware of their jb camp and warns everyone in the intel chat at which time a counterblob would be organized and sent again thru the jbjb are pretty good at organizing alliance blobs and projecting power over long distances but none of that is good for small scale fights or even for good fightsi spend nearly all my time in 00 for years and years and i very rarely see hostiles camping jbs i know it happens when theres a big fleet battle  pos bashing op but not on regular dayscasual pvp suffers due to lack of stargate traffic being able to quickly organize a huge blob is often worse than having a smaller blob  as you just scare off the hostiles needlessly so they dont bother engaging how often do alliance pvpers spend time just waiting waiting for hours until fc says its time to do somethingdunno about you but i find that very boring and thats what pvp is becoming  just lots of waiting and mega blob fighting thats what jb promote jb discourage everything else  as they reduce stargate traffic
itt strawmenthe problem is that it is currently trivial to project force and large fleets across the game in no timethe problem is that jump bridges titan bridges and cynos are not working as intendedwho determines what is working as intended ccp would be my guessthis is not a discussion about whether 00 has devolved into a safer than empire land of love where powers are completely entrenched and impossible to move due to said force protection and personally i dont care too much if ccp likes finns friends the nc it or whoever or not things are as determined by ccp not working as intendedit was not the intent of ccp to have highways that spawn the whole game and it is the intent of ccp to change thisand this is something that probably quite contrary to the desires of the person that started this thread and finn is supported by a vast amount of players furthermore as if finn claims its possible to project the same force without jump bridges and keep his coalitions intact then there is no grounds to oppose their removal as they wont affect any of the elements finn seems to support other than the highway connecting everything aspect which the playerbase and more importantly ccp wants gonebecause its not working as intended as stated by the devs of the system and personally i trust them more to know what they intended or not than finn who quite obviously has an underlaying agenda of leave things the way they are because i like them and strawmen about player created politicsand really if the system changes and the players change their politics nc is no longer the super friends or whatever does it stop being player controlled politics are the players replaced by aliens or somethingfact is ccp has changed sov mechanics a large number of times and well most mechanics in general beyond ships blow up when exploded they want to do so again and get rid of a broken system that makes space small moving blobs trivial attrition impossible and attack and defense riskless by allowing the same fleet to do both basically to bring risk to the part of the game with the greatest rewardsi missed the part where empire and low should be htfu and 00 hello kitty online i am sure a grave for jump bridges is right next to the one for the learnings and they will be about as missed
you do know what the most likely outcome is when a blob jumps through a jb with a dictor already waiting on the other side and a wave or two of bombers at pounce points above the jb right why is the game supposed to be about small scale fights if you want to find a small group of people to fight with your small group of people more power to you but its obvious that lots of people enjoy large scale pvp why is their way of enjoying the game any less valid than yoursas for good fights im just going to leave that one alone whether or not players chose to do it again sandbox is not relevant to whether or not they can why is it ccps job to funnel targets into your guns and make sure that your style of play casual pvp is boosted why dont you join red vs blue with stargate traffic generally youll only gank lone targets anyways as any halfdecent fleet will have you scouted and then whether or not they choose to jump into you will be the same whether or not they took jbs to get to you and if your only concern is getting ganks on stargates then ganking ratters or getting ganks on jbs should do just fine
eve is a created closed game system its built by ccp according to certain specifications it only allows players to do what system is designed to do by the developer any unintended action is effectively an exploit whether bug or feature to be addressed by devs maybe this breaks your vision of eve but thats the truth that did not change since beginningif you want a specific example regarding jump bridges yes jump bridges allow people to move around and thats its use however speed and cost of moving is what ccp has every right and duty to control while players may have ideas what such speed and cost should be its ccp that has to decide based on what ccp wants
people have been addressing facts about what jump bridges doing left and right all through the forums you just have the mindset to spin their words lie throw out statements like they are the law of all things use scare tactics like saying it will just cause larger blobs you only hurt yourself it will kill any hope of small alliances in 00 etc or just flat out ignore what people are sayingthe bottom line is you are scared you are scared that your 22000 or is it higher man super coalition will shatter you are scared to have enemies that are closer than three regions away you are scared that you will have to gasp use resources in your area to get supplies from instead of having everything stamped with made in jita all over it the thing you are scared of most is effort this is not wow or hello kitty online effort should yield reward you have it in your mind that it will be the end of the game as we know it if the jump bridge is removed you like to sling adapt or die around all the damn time so i say to you if ccp does remove jump bridges adapt or dieme personally i dont like coalitions never have even before jump bridges there is already a lot of mechanics to enable people to be friends in the game you can be in the same corp and then if enough corps like each other you can make an alliance this is fine a couple of alliances want to be blue to accomplish a goal now we are starting to get out of handthe best example of going over the top with standings of course is the northern coalition how many alliances are blue to each other i mean including renters and pets sorry but your part of it even if you claim your not if your blue your in i mean it is something like 30 or something perhaps someone could post actual numbers of alliances in the nc and total member countif anything it is just like super carriers one or two on the battlefield is one thing but when you put like 30 well now you hopefully understand what i mean oh and those 30 super caps are attacking 4 feroxs and iteron mark v that is the issue your just too blind with rage at the idea of having to put forth effort in 00 again when it comes to logistics and power projection but hey you have your mind made up and even when presented with endless facts you just choose to ignorespin everything in hopes that people will change their mind and think power blocks are good for 00
if you want evidence of how bridges have completely taken over transport in null take a look at jump statistics on mapone should think that with presumably tens of thousands of people ratting mining pewing all over the place that stargates would be seeing a lot more activity less than 15hr or so for the most partwant to bet that bridge traffic are an order of magnitude higher in most parts of nullit is fine to have them as a supplement or augmentation to normal gates but not as what is probably closer to a replacementthey need to be restricted in some way either by number or function 1 per 2 constellations in a region still allows for ease of movement or  limit them to industrial type ships letting titans handle military matters
as far as good fighting goes one can make an rts analogy eve is a bit similar to rtslets say you are playing starcraft or any other rts but with 1 new feature instant teleportation gates that you can setup all over the map in addition to being able to teleport these little things also act as strong turret and have a area force field that makes your force invulnerable while they are inside itnow think carefully what kind of gameplay that would createnaturally youd set a couple of them in your base and as you move toward the enemy on other end of the map you setup more and more of them you start by building up forces in your home base and then quickly teleporting them to enemy doorstep if it so happens that you didnt scout properly and enemy already has a force very near your base you dont need to worry as you just use the teleportation devices to quickly return home defend your basewhat would be the point of strategic manuevering would there ever be a need to have more than just 1 huge blob 1 blob can be anywhere you need it to be fast if you got those teleportation devices not to forget that you can always get safe in the force field if your enemy brings stronger forceim sure such rts would be amusing to play for a while  a short while  but as the novelty of it wears off any serious strategy gamer would see how lame the whole game is they would feel it instinctively as wrong because they would feel the limitation of viable strategy choices imposed by the rules of the gameif you honestly believe that you would enjoy such rts more than traditional ones and not just for a couple days then i guess its your preference for simplistic war games it cant be helped i suppose
that doesnt have anything to do with my vision for eve weve already established that people arent using jbs as an exploit but 100 in accord with the function as was developed they do but 1 just because they can do something doesnt mean that its a good idea and 2 if they want to do something explicitly in order to disrupt the sandbox and prevent certain political alignments then it becomes in violation of what ccp has said eve is all about ahh the argument from nuhn unhhh a breath of fresh air as always obviously if there were any truth to anything youre claiming you could quote what happened and refute my claims you cant because you made it all up its also ironic to see you lying in order to make up  and claim i ever did all the quotes youve used for instance are fabricated but please do point out where ive lied for example ahhh the everpopular ad hominem fallacy coupled with internet psychology convincing gasp not to belabor the obvious but youre playing eve people get to play the game the way they like it including fighting and helping who they like if you dont like it thats too bad not to belabor the obvious again but youre playing evea fair fight is an error on someones part if someone wants to gank your cruiser with a vindicator sucks to be you for balanced combat you need to seek instanced combat with level restrictions ya know like wow yah again why dont you actually point out any of my arguments that you claim are wrong and show why rather than lying andor just playing the argument from nuhn uhhn come on you obviously think my position is wrong try to show where its wrong and why one last thing ill point out that this is a further piece of dishonesty i think the idea of good or bad for 00 is an absurdity people will play the game as they see fit for those who enjoy it itll be good for them for those who dont itll be bad for them there is hardly a goodness o meter to detect how good any political landscape is people will form political structures as they see fit thats what playercreated playerdriven content means you saying that you should be able to force other people to play the game the way you like rather than allowing them to play the game the way they choose is hardly whats good for anything other than you now care to address my actual argument
you are taking statements out of context my point was that what you call a sandbox is a limited system based on limited resources designed for a purpose you cant blame ccp they want to break your sandbox because they have to maintain systems they designed
the reason that there are blobs and powerblocs in eve is to hold space they are needed because of sov mechanics periodit is sov mechanics not jump bridges which are causing blobs if people dont need to put up with their neighbors  they wontbecoming pvp in eve has always been waiting and boring then a few moments of terror it seems that you are attacking alliances which are organized and coordinated that will be difficult with a small forcenow i attempt to be constructiveif blob warfare is the problem and there needs to be more skirmish warfare then game mechanics can usually be blamed i personally enjoy blob warfare but not shooting stuff to claim or protect sovereignty whatever ccp decides to do i think they are on the correct path just moving slooww make every system deeper and more interesting with planetary interaction multiple stations tons of wormholes and scannable stuff make it so that pi mining and manufacturing can provide the necessary materials for selfsustaining corporations who never have to leave their constellation the sov mechanics absolutely require blobs to take and hold space if you cant drive off 50 capitals you have very little chance to take and hold space in 00so if taking space requires blobs those who form blobs hold spacesov mechanics need a sort of bottomup path as well as bloboriented if you cannot take sov without boots on the ground it will become a fight planetbyplanet that a reasonably wellfunded corp of say 100 people could actually claim a region without attacking the tcus sbus etc after say 2 weeks if not driven back increasing the depth of each system will prevent systems from being a notch in an alliances belt forcing them to skirmish and pay constant attention to a system so it will become more difficult to hold a lot of spaceit seems like we are suffering the interim of planned software releases with the incredibly smooth deployment of incursion 11 i guess ccp is sorta getting their quality under control maybe we will see walkinginstations and dust 514 released soon which i think will both change the nature of space
thats really only one reason any objective of sufficient value will cause a blob tech moon blob csaa building a titan blob vulnerable supercapital fleet thats bubbled blob any objective worth taking is generally going to be worth attacking and defending with everything you have no im not jump bridges are not an exploit they are not a tool being used contrary to its designed purpose they are a tool being used exactly as designed in accord with game mechanics as intended pos bowling was an exploit jbs are not
facepalmdude you need to relax and take a deep breath
he is just arguing to argue at this point he keeps screaming for people to present facts but he has as of yet to do the same
incidentally a tunnel network exactly matching this specification was included in cc generals an rts game released several years ago but only the terrorist side with weaker individual units had access to it and only 10 or so units could be stored inside at any one time
i accept that you wish to concede the argument and cannot provide any factual refutations thank you i zeee do you normally hear ze text as doing ze skreemink and do you know what ze color blue tastes like veddy veddy intereztink speaking of all the lies you posted earlier care to back any of them up or post on my actual argument instead of trolling as for your lie here about me not posting facts of course i have ive pointed out the fact that there were massive coalitions before jbs were introducedive pointed out the fact that blobbing and groups of alliances cooperating happened before sov was even introduced ive pointed out that the fact that jbs are insignificant when it comes to an alliance or coalition level forward deployment to a stocked hq system in lowsec or npc nullsec near a target ive pointed out the fact that that its easy to gank targets on jbs ive pointed out the fact that the ability to zip around the map is a theoretical and not a pragmatic one as fleets that are out for hours rarely if ever have the stamina and will left to go add a few more hours to their night and so on and so on and so on i understand that you cant address let alone refute my argument which is why youre arguing the way you are however feel free to address my actual argument any time youd like to stop trolling
ccp say that jump bridges and sov mechanics are not working as intended and wish to change themget rid of them as per their own statementsi would say that ccp are more of an authority and reliable source than finnigan is regarding the game that ccp makes ccp sells and ccp developsi think that should put whether they work as intended to rest they do not
jbs are being used to transport fleets of over 300 50 jumps and often times more than two regions in a space of 6 warpswho the hell are you to say whether this is their designed purpose heres a tip this probably isnt their intended purposeedit in conclusion youre a  who doesnt want to lose his blob mechanics csm is right on the money
i really think the logical solution is to do one of two things1 only allow 1 jb per constellation imo best option2 only allow 1 jb per system ive lived the nullsec life ive had the chance to basically go from period basis to outer ring with using only a handful of gates i simply think we should do away with the ability to spam jbs in any and every system 1 per constellation seems in theory to be awesome you can still move around with relative ease and keep logistics up with a bit more work ofc  however the jb now plays a much larger strategic role which system do i link what other constellations in range will be missed if you we do x instead of y one could argue that this would just bring about the rise of titan taxis but the human element required makes it hit or miss which is good ie youre only as mobile as the people you have onlinei dont think its appropriate to remove jbs i actually think a complete removal would actually hinder overall population in a lot of deeper nullsec or just say screw it and allow anybody with the jb password to use them friend or foe add a little spice
from that list1 strawman argument nobody is denying it its not why jb should be nerfed2 strawman jb have nothing to do with it3 irrelevant this is about force projection on the defensive primarily and secondarily about it being easier on an offensive eye of terror anyone4 strawman nobody cares5 umifountain back and forth 30 minutes including making bms for an entire fleet entire trip less than 2 hours shot some venal moons afterwards force projection literally across the mapyour example about the drone region deployment is completely moot jb are used to quickly project force on a smaller scale and much more spontaneus the spontanity is whats making them so damagingstop creating strawmen arguments all the time the problem with jb lies where overstreched empires compensate overexpansion by rapid movement through bridges and where it is used to effectively render scouting pointless theyve cut down travel speed and made it possible to reach even backwater constellations without problems create highly defensible fortresses see fortress tribute and eliminate the need for travel by gates almost entirely camp on the hw gate in d7 just use a jb around it
ive already corrected you on this point please dont replicate your errors greyscale specifically stated that part of his desire to get rid of jbs was to break up coalitions since coalitions existed before jbs obviously introducing jbs is independent of the existence of coalitions do you understand what a strawman is my point is that jbs have nothing to do with it despite peoples claims that blobbing is related to them i see that youre agreeing with my point why youre calling it a strawman is anybodys guess youre not even reading before you post offthecuff answers i already pointed out that jbs only allows fleets to zip back on the defensive in theory and in fact theyre almost always spent and not ready for hours more pvp i also pointed out that with timers being what they are you dont need to get back you are also evidently ignorant of whats going on the issue of force projection especially as brought up by greyscale explicitly included offensive deployments across the galactic map okay you definitely dont understand what a strawman is you are also evidently not even reading the thread as i just got done on this very page of the thread with a discussion i had with someone claiming that one reason jbs had to go is that its so hard to gank ships coming through them numerous other people have also claimed that jbs have to go because they offer complete or virtual safety mmm hmmm umi to pnq is 19 jumps with jbs its a whole gasp 10 more jumps without jbs obviously that 10 minutes is game breaking you are also ignoring what i actually pointed out which is that after a deployment that can last hours most pilots do not have the energy left to go back and get into another hours long fight the number of jumps involved is inconsequential the time investment is whats at issue which is why i pointed out that the benefit of jbs is deceptive if its not looked at in context yep as pointed out thats a benefit of ownership you get to modify the chokepoint landscape and as pointed out by me and then handwaved by you you can be ganked on a jb just like a gate too in other words it shows you are wrong as its perfectly possible and indeed often the chosen method to deploy without using jbs and without needing them at all especially for an invasion in which the invaders do not have even the potential to use jbs as theyre in systems where their enemies still have sov figure out wtf a strawman is before you try to argue against them thats just basic10 jumps saved umi to pnqy your point does not hold and defense is and was perfectly possible with rapid reactions before jbs saving a handfull of minutes is hardly game breaking if your fcs are clueless i suppose a good fc knows the enemy jb network and titan poss and has scouts watching them mmm hmmm just like sov 4 was unbreakable and couldnt be shattered until the great war ii when we broke and shattered bobs allies sov 4 and tribute wouldnt be defensible without jbs nawww umi to mo without jbs a crushing seven whole jumps through the snow uphill both ways
the main arguments have been presented and rehashed several times theres no need to keep posting unless you have something new to addwe need more information from ccp to continue
ccp should just remove the ability for anyone to use a jump bridge if they have standings and a password there is no other module that lets someone outside of the alliance standings blue or not be able to use it outside of being able to go in a pos force field which should be changed toothey should just do a patch right now that eliminates blues from using jump bridges and going in a pos force field even if they are blue you dont see a blue manning a pos gun on a blues pos just because they are blue do youso finnagain i suppose you dont think there is a problem with super carriers do you i mean to change them at all would qualify this game as no longer being a sandbox according to your rules
unlike posting to tell someone else to stop posting thats important so marlona you going to actually address anything ive said ever maybe just for a change honestly im not sure if thats a troll or if you simply dont understand what ive said at all this is why it would help if you respond to my actual argument rather than lying about things i havent actually said or using the argument from nuhn uhnn changing how things work is not sandbox breaking ive never said it is and i think you probably know that what i did say correctly is that altering mechanics in order to change the political landscape of playercreated playergenerated content violates the principles of a sandbox game do you honestly not understand the distinction between rockets need to be boosted so that ships that use them will be more balanced or supers are currently not able to be countered effectively by something other than supers and wed like to change that and we need to come up with gameplay and mechanics changes so we can try to hurt certain political groups and try to get them to fragment and to change the playercreated content so that its the way we want it not the way the players create it really because honestly im at a loss to figure out what about that is unclear to you can you clarify what exactly you dont grok

good idea to assemble some input lets hope ccp is willing to listen for a change 2 possibilities come to my mind either a freeze button that suspends movements for a couple seconds or a classical playpause button id rather not have movement totally suspended just because some people cba to upgrade their computers from 5 years ago not sure the one unit bump would be that great an idea might actually lead to even heavier calculation load if the suggestion above with a freeze function passes through it might be unnecessary anyway nice idea but again would prolly slow down the whole interface even more and some people do already whine about low framerates in the cc prolly easier to have some sort of log scroll in a small window at the bottom with text entries for each change should require less in terms of system resources than a fancy visual gimmicksounds good in theory but if you want to convert all the data to some textbased format not a problem if ten people do it at a time or maybe even 100 but unless the whole process does not in any way involve data transfer to the server id rather not have the risk of massive extra server load and thus people playing dress a doll impact the people actually trying to play the game by bogging down the server so it does have to be a purely clientside solution there imoill add three more inputs from my side add a limited option for coloring the clothing it seems rather unreasonable you can color to some extent makeup hair etc but are stuck with exactly one color on the rather limited supply of clothing not asking for 50 colors to pick from for any given piece of clothing but maybe 5 or 6 especially the pants seem rather too uniform atm rather than have like currently 3 trouser models displayed in 2 or 3 colors just go with a single model and enable coloring there might sure make it more userfriendly  give people a chance to show some leg on their fullbody avatars sure it will not show up as of now but were getting input for future tweaks here and there is no apparent reason why male chars cannot wear kneelength shorts eg or why there is no option for female chars with the longish closedup overcoatdress to simply waive the bottom option and thus get a short dress and shoes and some decent amount of leg showing latter should actually be rather easy to implement just check if flag for long overcoatgown is set if so enable an extra option to not choose pants already during test phase on sisi the issue of skin tones had been raised the now existing ones seem nicely balanced and all but theyre too few for some bloodlines would be nice if they could be expanded to at least the state of the old ones if that is for some reason impractical then maybe an extra option additionally shading the existing 5 per bloodline a single extra slider might do for that one especially as the the current wheel for skin tones does not really seem to reflect the actual tone applied to the model
not shortcuts in fact not even scrolling id like a fixed grid as then there would be no need to render the scrolling ate up resources on my pc
add for user interfacecustomization step1 when i change one shirt for a other shirt their changeover happens not at once and it is visible that on hoses and some other parts of clothes there is a color from previous for a few secondsit suggests at once that would be very good to make possibility of a choice of color and a coloring for each model of a jacket a boot a shirt and trousersit will be very good flexibility and diversifies selection of clothes for color for choosy playersgirls for example cant live without that colors of clothes were combined was harmonic among themselves2 that we can create the character in an unbuttoned jacket without putting on of a vest it is very good i have created such characterbut from here there is very unpleasant momenton female characters very much not the beautiful bra by default is put on there should be a small variation of underwearportrait creation step1 on a step of creation of a portrait we have possibility create four photos from which we can to select only one for avatarmany peoples say that were mistaken that didnt know or didnt note what of four photos is selected automaticalyi was mistaken thus two times on a test serverthe first time i simply didnt know that the photo need to be selectedthe second time i simply havent noted that that photo which was necessary to me is selected notit is necessary to make the frame of the selected photo fatter and brighter and also the warning that it is necessary to select one of four which very well would remind dont forget to select the best picture at the leftsame idea in this post2 it would be good if there was a possibility to zoomin each of four made photos because they so small that it is very difficult to see on them an overall picturesometimes very badly visible even that the character has blinked during making photo3 to add some facial muscles and to expand their mobility for more floppy mimicry eyes for example can move very little the character cant look sideways at alland still it is a lot of manymany questions and missing parts but maybe more of it is not about interfacefor some long hairdresses it would be magnificent to have a slider regulating length of hairfor female and males characters there is a impossibility to change width of shoulders their thickness and the form changes onlythe classical female figure  hips is wider than shoulders but often there is also a reverse pattern in life in the editor almost always it turns out that shoulders are wider than hips or the width of shoulders is equal to width of hipsnot clearly why so hair color there is not enough also there are no bright shouting colors after all implementation of superimposing of color on ready model of a hairdress is not so difficult i thinkin real life the person can go to shop and buy a hairdye of any colorthe person can burn out color of the hair to the blonde and any color lays down on hair very brightin game are presented only natural a hair color but why there is no possibility to make any other colorwhen hair grow it becomes visible natural color about their roots but if hair are painted just even roots are coloredalso are disregarded widows peaks about which it is written in this posti support all ideas wited on first post of this thread
excellent ideas postedim missing the timeline allowing you to revert to a previous state which was displayed on sisi and can be seen on movies but apparently got pulledsome of the small preview images barely show visible differencesone of my main complaints on the new creator altho it isnt really ui is the limited amount of art assets for most clothes there are actually only two models repeated in different color palettes then there are the limited color palettes on things like makeup limited number of accessories and ofc the missing tattoos the backgrounds apart from the higher resolution are barely a step up i am quite annoyed at the much more limited lighting and lighting color options
i can agree with these changes especially the clothing colors image freeze and zoomed photo suggestions the new character creator is very nice but it could be improved supported
small note trebor if you want to pool the suggestions for the cc development you prolly should sticky this thread
not sure if this has been suggested but an undo button would be nicealso for modeling the skin a wireframe overlay so that we can see the subtle curves would help

particularly if it could be linked with redeployment say that if a station is in a broken state a new egg can be deployed effectively replacing the previous station with the new one and all player hangars move over to the new station upgrades are lostfurther upgrade platforms must go through a separate reinforcement cycle set before a station can be broken much like the ihub you break the platform first and then can finally break the station

as the idea of hankey and my idea will look together at a real station outpost siegepossibility to appropriate station appears only after period of the third reinforced mode and after destruction of half or 13 of a structureit will cause serious failures in operation of its vital subsystems and station cant resist to capture and assignment by corporationfor the corporation owning stations in 00 regions it will be necessary to have a store of spare parts and supplies for repairing of stations and to urge on extraction of planetary minerals by purchase of a quantity of these resources or to develop extraction by own forcesthe given resources will cost certain completely not small total of money but not such which is necessary for construction of the whole new stationthereby for corporation the stimulus wont allow to the enemy even to do its attempt to destroyfor corporation or an alliance it is necessary will not only destroy a shield and the station armor being not killed in fight but also to provide during certain time protection of the repair crew consisting of several transport ships with spare partsthey should remote repair the armor and a transport shield not to allow to enemies to approach too close probably to have in a store one more truck with spare partsthe enemy can prevent station assignment having destroyed the trucks with spare parts and supplies before the outflow of time of minimum repairing of station
when wormholes came out they were the big unknown unpredictable nobody knew about statics so they were interesting and fun nowadays we have staticmapper and every wormhole has become mapped we always know exactly what to expect what statics there are and so on and so forth what i suggest is making wspace unpredictable again as it should be make it always have 1 or 2 exits as it has nowadays but make these exits random if a wormhole has a static to another wormhole make that wormhole randomly be a connection to any type of wormhole so anything from c1 to c6 likewise if the wormhole has a kspace connection make this random too either hs ls or null it would make life a lot more interesting and fun plus it would prevent having certain systems being valueable whereas other systems being completely worthless due to their statics
thumbs up to making wh space interesting again
supporting my own proposal

maybe something where it becomes chance based and completely based on class of system number of outbound wh would be 0 to 3 with 1 being highest likelihood then each wh has certain chance of being either wspace or kspace if kspace the high low null would also be chance based witrh class 1 being maybe 503020 but a class 6 being 52570 or something if wspace they would be more heavily weighted to the same class system so a class 1 would connect more to class 1 and 2 then 5 and 6 same in reverse then also each wh has a chance of respawningbut whole heartedly vote for more randomness in statics
i like thisalso add more in wspace roaming patrols i think its safe to say that weve manage to wake the sleepers let them be more active include random chance some higher level signatures and anomalies in lower systems ie c1 can spawn c2 or c3 c4 can spawn c5 or c6  this provides an occasional challenge to local residents and a potentially serious surprise to whole raiders
i support this and wish to see it implemented
1as i know little about wormholes i thought this was how they worked already im a bit disappointed to learn that is not the case
when busy also make some anomalies at least have random spawns and that shouldnt mean they bbq everything in site just that you get a bit more different situations when busy also implement that for missions normal anomalies well pretty much everything
i support the general idea another thing to do would be to prevent towers above a certain size from being anchored in low clevel wormholes wormhole space is supposed to be unknown not an impregnable fortresshome
proposing removing concording for rr someone that gets himself concorded its not like you can tank concord with rr anyway it may become a major problem for public incursion fleets if not removed
at some point you could tank concord with rr but i agree fleets of people not in the same corp with rr will become death traps if this is not changedsupported
ing supported its rediculous that you can be concorded for helping someone out is the peace loving concord against the spirit of charity and universal capsuleer support
actually this is a problem because of the new grieving tactic to deal with the incursions a lot of people are planning on spider tanking becasue of this one person getting concorded could lead to the entire fleet getting wiped out by concord it would be a messat one point this was needed but now its going to cause issues with the new content ccp should fix it

warp to 0 to a station in lowsec land 2000 off get podded as it wont let you dock till your under 500mpetition our logs show nothingthanks for reading
why are you wasting gm time by petitioning dying away from station range you are crying about landing a few meters away from station when previously it was 15kmif anything station dock range should be reduced at the moment you can undock hold invulnerability and instantly dock up again
what ship were you indock range on stations is 2000 ive never heard of a ship landing outside it when they warp to 0
yeah dock range is 2000 sometimes you land up to 2500 though same thing with gates sometimes land a few meters from the 2500m jump range

i for the most part agree completely with the op one thing that really annoys me is shooting at a pos all of the beams missiles and whatever go right through the shield and hit the pos itself i want to see the damage being done to the sheild itself ships used to have a bubble sort of shield around them ccp pulled the shields in tight to make it more realistic i think visible ship damageabsolutely rendered client side not by the server base it on the level of shields armor and hull missiles dont missunless they fall short of the target in which case they dissapearthis is finebut if a beam missesi wanna see that beam fly off into space and dissipate seeing beams hit the same point on a ship over and over is also annoying is there something special about that spot on the ship i am also a little tired of seeing myself warp through objects in space make it so we cannot see what is around us while in warp and this issue is resolved nobody will even care at that point whether you warped through the planet or not i know they already stated that they would be updating the nebulae and cloundsso thats comingsoon we know that all the ships are going to get an update for textures and whatnot and possibly complete facelifts like the scorpion redesignhopefully stations will to as to thatmy guess is that the inside of stations will change with incarna p

instead of giving capitals and supercapitals such an ability consider giving assault frigates a unique role bonus in that they can apply ewar towards ships normally immune to such effects supercapitals carriers in triage dreads in seige assault frigates are not invulnerable on their own but with appropriate support they can be used as a handy counter
well liang i have no idea who you are but your grasp on what is needed is loose to say the least giving supers and caps the ability to tackle eachother does not reduce capital or super capital spam which was the problem discussed by ccp in the minutesfurthermore if your grasp on shield tanking fits is just lacking and thats all i can say any low slot cap mod other than a pdu is a terrible idea on an active shield tank which is the only kind of shield tank that truly requires large amounts of cap for short period of time not to mention the lac of a lowslot cap battery and a lowslot cap injector so zip the lip before you lose the tip chip this fix to capital spam will be found in the sub capital class is ccp is smart crosses fingersbecause this will end the linear escalation of force present in eve at the moment it will transform the linear system of escalation to a cyclical system where the counter to a super cap fleet is a sub cap fleet and the counter to a sup cap fleet is a cap fleet and the counter to a cap fleet is a super cap fleet and through the circle we gothis wouldnt be hard and would for all intensive purposes fix 3 problems in eve1 super cap proliferation2 escalation to super cap blob for no reason3 the only effective counter to supers being more supersso think outside the box out side of the nerf buff frame of mind its so immature and 2009 following the my dad can beat up your dad argument
this would be a neat ideaif 10 supercaps couldnt kill an 80 man supercap fleet with ease if you want a capital ewar ship that would probably have to be a new ship type and right now ccp wants to reduce capitals online not make it worse
i agree that ewar needs some changing and that it should come in the form of a small tweak but i disagree with simply allowing capitals to ewar each other if any ship can ewar a capital it should be a black opsas for the cap rechargercpr debate its finely balanced asis boosters take up more capacitorperhp than reppers but require 1 less slot if you want a heavy tank obviously a lowslot module that gives large capacitor regeneration should have a tradeoff with the one module that could truly be overpowered with it the shield booster an armor dualrep setup would have one less low slot to use a cpr so its balanced
it isnt intended to be an ewar platform the thing is that if 2 opposing super caps land on each other nobody will die they will sit there and bash on each others shields then warp off make it so all capitals can warp disrupt super capitals they might actually start dieingit isnt intended to be a end all fix for the problem either it is a tweak that in reality there could be a meeting at ccp about it tomorrow and could go into the next patch
no of course it a tweak like this wouldnt make an immediate difference to supercap spam but it would add more ways to tackle them im not sure why you would think that adding more ways to tackle supercaps wouldnt reduce their overall numbersmy grasp on shield tanking capitals is obviously much better than your own a pdu i can understand youre going for max ehp and get the ability to run your local or remote reps for a few more seconds as as side benefit the cap flux you suggested is just flat ed the penalty on cprs is stacking nefed and shield boost amps almost entirley negate that penalty furthermore their cap generation is not stacking nerfed and extremely powerful you will want cap power relays to run your rr and it still leaves you with a very reasonable active tanked shield capitala few comments what we have now is already not linear supercaps are far more powerful than regular capitals sub capital fleets dont have the dps to kill supercaps even if they get them tackled we already have sub capital counters to supercapsliang

i would not support at firstthis might  would effect ship prices too much instead of building ships in their area and selling them there  the ships can be built in a cheaper region with cheaper minerals and shipped too easilythats why i would not support this type of ship at firstgive the ship 1hp for shields  for armor and hull and then its very gankable  so i would go with it
my proposal is a simple graphical bar that comes up the screen when activating your mining beams on the bar there is an arrow that at any time can randomly drift to the left and right showing the mining lasers are going out of alignment when the beams are aligned the arrow is green and when they begin missaligning they flash yellow turning red when they reach the end if they reach the end of either side of the bar the lasers shut off all thats needed to steady the lasers is to use your mouse to bring the arrow back to the middle and hold it for a few seconds until the arrow turns green again if the arrow turns red and your lasers shut off you must use the mouse to bring the arrow back to the middle of the bar and hold it until it turns green and reactivate your lasers the beauty of the system is that the timing of misalignment is random and the mouse is required to bring thing back into sync requiring an actual player to be on hand to keep things operating

while copying obscure dat files inside eve settings directory provides for a way to share the same settings between different characters and accounts this is not the best way both to shortcut configuration and eve configuration as a wholeplease implement exportimport of the keyboard shortcuts tofrom some external filesit can be in the xml form as with overview settings or it can be anything else but it would be good if it will be humanreadable and humaneditable in a simple text editorand the use case is thisafter i configured shortcuts on one character i want to export them and then import them back on another character without the need to resetreconfigure the same keystrokes again
simple easy and makes sense especially since you can already export overview settingsccp should make hotkeys exportable and i think they also should make the entire cache easier to get at maybe some enterprising individual could make a free little evemover app that throws all your overviewhotkeywindowbookmark folder settings into a zip file for easy moves to new computers

tldr the aim of this proposal is to make the ecm mechanic less random while not changing the relative balance between ecm ships and their targets its neither a nerf nor boost just a change sensor strength is multiplied with max number of targets giving a tempest 719  133 combined sensor strength ecm jammers get a higher number than today around 20 for a t2 module each point of jamming from an ecm cancels out one point of sensor strength on the target each time more than 19 sensor strength for a tempest is removed his max number of targets is reduced by one if this happens while the tempest had something locked the lock might drop if the tempest receives more than 133 points of jamming hes totally locked downlong versionimagine that eve ships have one targeting radar per available target slot each of these radars have the sensor strength currently displayed in the sensor strength fieldexample minmatar tempestmax locked targets number of targeting radars or ladars in this case 7sensor strength 19 type ladarcombined sensor strength 719  133in comes the new ecm mechanic each ecm module has a certain ecm jamming value say 20 against their racial opposite and 5 against anything else for a t2 versionnow for each ladar ecm applied to our tempest above we remove 20 sensor strength each time we pass 19 sensor strength we remove one of his max targetsexample two t2 ladar ecm is applied to tempest40 points of sensor strength is removed we passed 19 twice hence two of his max targets is removed and he now has 5 max targets and 17 sensor strength left until the next target slot is removedif the tempest at this time had something locked he has a 27 chance of losing that lock however given that he still has 5 available slots he can immediately relock if he lost the lockif he had all 7 targets locked he will lose two random locks and will not be able to relock unless another lock is dropped firstif the tempest was hit by 7 t2 ladar ecm modules for a total of 207  140 points of jamming it will have a remaining 7 points of sensor strength meaning it has 0 max targets left it is now truly jammed with no chance of getting out of it any more jamming makes no difference what so everecm ships such as falcons and scorpions could like today get a bonus towards ecm jamming strength making a single ecm module on a falcon being able to maybe take out as much as 3 target slots at oncenotice how chance is removed from the equation except for which lock drops
nope sorry either adapt or die me tends to run his mwd drake right at the falcon pilot while spraying fof missilesits a rather quick leave or die messageyou should do the same
what do you insinuate that i fail against ecm ships or fail in ecm ships this suggestion will not modify the effectiveness of ecm in either direction all it does is making it more predictable more in line with other ewar systemspersonally i love flying falcons and would not see this as neither a boost nor nerf of themalso what makes you think the falcon doesnt have an mwd of his own and keeps out of range
its an interesting idea but theres plenty of situations where still being able to lock one target results in a negligible loss of combat ability so it still suffers from a binary nature  the difference between being able to lock one target and being able to lock none is too great in your case a tempest would require 7 s20 jammers to be locked down  applying 6 would often have very little effect  which is just silly
very true but consider thiseach time one of the ecm modules cycle it will remove one of two available target slots the one itself just let go of and the previously untouched one this results in a 50 probability of the tempest losing its current target when the new jam goes throughif the six ecm modules were spread out evenly and the cycle time of each is 20 seconds an ecm module will cycle every 33 seconds typically 50 of those cycles will result in a target loss for the tempest  he will have to relock his target every 66 seconds hes not out of the fight but he sure isnt very effective either
few things you need to consider you need to find a solution for light ships cruiser down which are currently more or less useless with ecm on the field you need to be able to shut most targets down completely without using an entire rack compare to effect of 23 dampstdsif not then it becomes a massive nerf which is neither needed nor wanted you need to account for eccm and what effect it should have in relation to ecmpersonally think that the idea of ecm manipulating max targets is the best one that has been brought up so far been sniffed at a few times in other threads
it is only a good idea if your agenda is a complete removal of ecmif max locked targets is not zero for damage dealers the jammed ship is free to shoot the primary and the jammer did not accomplish anythingsupport such as logistics can conveniently operate at full efficiency with 23 target slots and even having only a single slot doesnt render them inoperable
edit oops posted with alt i cant say this change wouldnt affect users with small amounts of ecm the cost of removing randomness is less efficiency at smaller numbers and higher at high numbersbut remember that even though not all target slots are jammed there is still a chance on each cycle for each ecm module to break a random lock even if the target can relock it will still take him time and in combination with a locking time jammer it will be even more severe so just because all slots arent taken out doesnt mean the ecm is totally ineffectiveexample how much different ewar affects a target with 6 target slots ofrangeecmmodsjammer1lightlight2mediumlight3heavymedium4overkillmedium5overkillheavy6overkilltotalhelldeathwhile a target range jammer reach its peak at around 23 modules ecm wont reach its peak until 6 modules but when the target range jammer peaks the target can still fight at close range its not taken out entirely and no amount of target range jamming can change this however ecm at 6 modules will take the entire target out and that is better than the target range jammer can do therefore it should be more expensive to use the ecmis it more reasonable that a frigate with a single ecm module might get a lucky jam and totally disable an entire battleship for 20 seconds or that a falcon fails to jam a frigate
first i tell you my experiencewhen is jamming annoying in small scale pvpie sabrefalcon that is quite common to camp in 00 and it is very effective 1 recon 1 interdictor now you want to break the camp well you can break the camp by taking a ship which can permatank the sabre and sit on the gate wait until the falcon misses a jam cycle and drive the sabre off usually he calls then his friends but thats it there is no way to catch the sabre or falcon the falcon will jam the tackler and they are gone and no more come out of their ss before you are gone you will need 3 fleet members so the falcon can not jam all of you when is flying a falcon annoying when it becomes bigger than small scaleit is too often jam everything or nothing and die first i lose falcons faster than any other recon or any other ship class at all it can only jam nothing else if you shield tank it it is bad at jamming too if you armor tank it it aligns too slow if there is no shield tank it is paper thin far worse tank than other recons have so if there are 23 bc on the enemy side i start already thinking about becoming primary i will be primary and be the first who dies if i do not leave the field before they reach me or i jam them all sometimes it is even 1 ship too much once i disconnected after a jump it took me 10 sec to log back in the falcon was already killed by a single vaga and the logs showed nothing gg ccp so some things can be said for sure it is too strong against small ships or single ships it is too weak especially the falcon if there are more than just 23 enemies and they get a lockbtw ecm drones are also sometimes superannoying in 1v1 or 2v2 especially if enemies recall them until they get a cycle i hate those guys who pull them out when they see they lose the fight somehow they always seem to get the jam and escape maybe i would take ecm out of the game if i look at npcs guristas ew are the most annoying ew the other npcs ew has also effects but you do not lose a whole 20 sec per cycle
oh look one race that can reliably counter ecmwhat do you suggest for the other racesops suggestion makes sense but could use some polish
no youre working off the assumption that the tempest would have locked the maximum number of targets possible in reality it would have say the primary and another locked taking the maximum number of locks available down to five from seven when youre only locking two targets to start with is basically meaningless  its unnoticeable ships are quite capable of operating even with one lockable target which is why you end up with the current binary effectnoeffect system being unchanged except that its a lot harder to actually jam a targetthe current chancebased system is crappy but this isnt an improvement and whatever changes you propose you need to leave the caldari ewar as the most powerful because ewar is a caldari racial thing they have a full line of ewar ships almost equal in stature to the missile and rail lines
having two eccm iis running a geddon and still being very nearly permajammed by a single falcon yeah ecm needs a change maybe the change should be a debuff like the other ew are being totally jammed is no fun for anyone
currently one can do a neural remap a 2 times then you have to wait a year before you can do it againif we can change attributes why cant we change skillsfor instance a industrial pilot presents with 3million skill points in industry but decides one day that he is tired of industry and wants gunnerywhy not give him the option of once a year or or once every 6 months or some sort of cooldown all ow him to basically take his 3 mill industry sps and allow him to convert them into 3million gunnery skill pointsthis would mean that said pilot would lose the ability and benefits that came with the 3million industry skill points to include modules bonusesbut he would also gain all bonuses and such in the target field in this case gunneryi believe the primary skill fields that should be allowed for revamping should beindustrysciencegunnerymissilesnaturally there would need to be some warnings that doing this revamp would affect thingsthey could only subtract from one category and add to one category so subtracting 2 million from industry and 1 million from missiles wouldnt be an option like wise you couldnt add 15mill to gunnery and 15mill to missiles add it all to gunnery or all to missilesi think it should be accessible to the largest amount of players but should have very serious un recoverable undoable consequences with a respectable cool down time similar to neural remapthere seem to be 3 major methods of playing gunneryindustrymining narcotics production research etcmissileshence i would suggest they be the ones that qualify for the remap
i like this idea not sure that this would actually happen 1 for whatever its worth
oh god the stupid it burns ahhh
not supported it is not a new idea and has already been debated before in essence it violates the principle of causeconsequence that is so central to eve  you live with the decisions you make there is most of the time no going backso no the skill system is working as intended and need not be changed
one of the things youll learn about eve is that the choices we make affect our character almost permanently except with things such as security status another is that all of the skills are useful even if not for the primary reason you took them corporations could always ask you to assist in other ways such as with mining opsive thought a lot about this myself and was once in support of such a measure however i have during my long career here in eve come to accept and even enjoy the system completely unique in the mmo industrynot supported
couldnt have said it better myself
thank you for your invaluable contribution to this topic
i understand your point however even while what i do today echoes in tommorow i can still change myselfi can go back to school for something else a druggie or alcoholic can one day decide to no longer touch drugsalcohol sure the person who spent the past several years drinking non stop may have health problems now or in several years but i do see your point and im glad you contributed to it but isnt neural remap a violation of cause consequencesure there are consequence to actions but you can still change your ways life is about change be it the now sober alcoholic the former pirate who has a 5 sec rating now instead of a 99 or the pilot who uses neural remapping to cut x days off a skill plan in evemon
well as referenced in previous responses change is a part of life be it addictions education etcbut what if instead of being instantaneous like neural remapping you could inniate it but then had to wait 4 days for it to take effect representing a struggle much in the same way it can take a while for someone to recover from substance abuse
i can support what this guy saidfor the opnot supported
no no no no no nooooo this is a game breaking idea even giving remaps more often for plex was shown to drastically change eve for the worst not supported 1
this argument is all over the place generally speaking threads break down to omgz i liek and nononononononononoicanthearyougamebreakin personally i think this should be allowed one single time to allow new players who have no flying  what they are training to get a break for instance when i first started i trained all the races to bs level to see which i liked turns out im a matar and amarr fan now ive got a few million sp wasted in hybrids gallente and caldariif they allowed a skill change a single time 6 months after your character was born i wouldnt mind but i dont think it should be a yearly occurrence unless you want to penalize the sp return by at least 70
i do like this and would support it if it was suggested as a separate proposal
this is what i understood the op was trying to say it should be an option but it should have rather stringent rulesso then the requirements to do it would behas to be after atleast 6months from the date your charecter was born and can only be done once
see no reason not to have this
bump
good point you could be shot at in the structure and all rats would show up and be targetable even if you could not see themlooks like this would be very complexmaybe you have to travel through said structure to get in range of loot object or even an ecceleration gateso you need to pass into the wreck with a smaller ship and find your way to the container to loot it and then back out something that could not be tractoredstill options but a full mission in one is looking a bit hard dratany other ideas on how they could make space more intresting and flet you fly into and through things
ok so theres a lot of people who have found that even with elite command centers you really cant make robotics on plasma planets any morethat said i believe the problem is not with the new setup its with some of the restrictions on it to that end i propose that instead of having it so when you scan for heavy metals it drops a heavy metal drill then when you click noble metals it drops a noble metal drill that way a single command station can extract multiple p0 materials each material would have to be routed
please go back to features and ideas
umm have you even tried the new pi system yet
either your pi skills are all at 1 or you need to watch your clock more closely as you workalso since the current pi system is the only way of obtaining the materials you get from it it isnt and cant be broken if its difficult to work with or frustrating in some way then the people more willing to work through it will reap greater rewards if the total yield from all players is decreased then prices of stuff requiring those materials will go up
the new system really really really sucks what was wrong with old one ever hear the expression  if its not broke dont fix it two thumbs down extremis horribilis is an understatement omg what were they thinking comes to mind
0osome of these responses make me wonder if the posters actually tried the new pi systemive found that yield is up overallsure the ecu power requirements are high  all this limits is the number of simultaneous materials we can pull from a single worldthis in turn limits jackofalltrading and forces either multiworlding or  and hold onto your implants here  interacting with other pilotsid slide off my seat for a decent pi market  everything sellorder is at a huge markup and every buy order at a pathetic amountalso you can now set your extraction times to cover the exact time you sleep go out or go to work this is awesomesure it makes it less finetuned precise maths  23 hour cycle  profit but its a damn sight easier on the ol nervous system as a resultofftopic a wee  anyone found themselves returning to the old preskillqueue waking up at obscene hours to check eve patterns
i like the new system not supported
i am realy wondering how you managed to spend 2030 minutes on the new system it is only one click per planet every day  hauling
with the new system it takes 20 minutes to figure out how the new system works and to setup a single colony after figuring it out after that it will only take not even 57 minutes to setup an additional colony after that since you will already know what to do then after all the colonies are setup up to the limit of your planetary consolidation skill level it only take no more than 1 minute to restart each colonyi have two accounts with four characters doing pi and i notice the benefits of the new system in terms of time spent restarting all the colonies and yields gained so far im loving it as you can see the long setup of the colonies for novices pays for itself in a very short time

ey chapsi am sure this topic has been opened at some stage but i have a question here why are we not allowed to train skills on more than one char on the same account at the same time what is the use of the 2 extra character slots then eve is about training skills and if you dont you get left behind so i want to make a new character to explore the other races and professions but now i cant train on my main cause i need to train my alts hence no alts get made cause basicly what is the usecan we not have a look at this and maybe open the opportunity to do so or should i now add another account to my already 2 accounts
you can use your 2 extra slots for alts which need no further training 
while i do not have the figures at hand i do not think it is an unfair estimate to say that a significant part of the eve player base ie active accounts are actually alts if this was implemented it would more or less instantly after transfers of course kill off almost 23 of said accounts resulting in much less profit for ccp hence it will most likely never happen
also i have all three slots used on both of my accounts  so your argument that no one ever does that sort of falls flat the point is eve is about choices and the consequences of those choices i needed an occasional alt so i paused my training on my main and trained the alt for the purpose i needed her fortrust me its not the end of the world the skill points race youre involved in is only against yourself
i want to bring up again something that would be an extremely simple fix but crucial in its implicationsthe single most devastating thing that can happen to any capsuleer in eve is without much debate to be podded in an outdated med clone yet although this is so we still are getting no warnings whenever we forget to update our clones i have never forgotten myself and i agree it would take carelesness and clumsiness to do so yet we get warnings when we are not training skills we get warnings when we try to enter lowsec warnings when we try to aggress someone else in hisec warnings when we try to make a contractif we get warnings for these things how come we dont get a warning when trying to undock without updating our med clones why doesnt the character sheet flash as when we are not training skills why is everything left to the player in this crucial case when such ample warning are given in other and generally much less damaging onesi suggest that an easy feature is implemented in the spirit of the above to let players know their medclones are outdated anything will do some examples mentioned above but the warning has to be there
fit do away with all the astroid belts and make them all probe out locations
that i can supportto the op congrats on having exhumers skill to level 4 got you beat i have exhumers level 5 and i can operate an orcaanyways i guess were just going to be in an endless pointcounterpoint debate between you can me about this as both of us seem to have made up our minds to finish this off i understand what your point it my point is to ensure that the miners feel active and productive while they mine the rocks so far i regularly check my colonies while i mine so that i can avoid the boredom
yes if you place no value on invested personhoursyears before i was in merch i used to be in an empire mining corp and we would mount full wing hulk ops and strip belts dry in short order what i realize now is that this was a remarkable waste of time and effortccp likes to talk about income sources as being point or diffuse active or passive throughout the history of eve the point passive sources of income have always been the most lucrative because they require the least maintenancewhat the op is trying to water down the active nature of mining which i endorse if i could sit at a pos shield and have fighterminers go fetch me ore from several aus away id be stupid not to
i have to disagree i think that your proposal is too much like pi because it is a passive isk generation a good fix for mining would be one that makes it more interactive such that macroers have difficulty running a good business while players willing to invest the time are rewarded bestalso the eve economy doesnt rely on mining its a major part of the total ore income in eve but quite likely less than half of the total a lot of ore comes from reprocessed modules also
i can see what you mean but no it might be ok for lownull space but definently not empire and if it was ever thought of it should be severely limitedlike 1 pr char limited and max 5 dronesand definently destroyablei would much rather see a end to macro bots and similar than a end to mining industry as it would become if you had your waydefinently not supported  ever 
just make that damm under attack cant gather any ore and everything is fineminer no longer needs to mine only to defend his mining operation
just helping keep things alive
so youre going to fire what is effectively a large tactical nuke from what a stealth bomber and what do you plan on collecting up the moon goo with bring along a buddy in a blokade runner that deep into nc sovereign territory you are talking about disrupting powerblocks and making a profit from it how much profit do you think youll net in this fancy little endeavour you just nuked the surface of the moon turned the greater majority of it into dust and glass then happened along to pick up whatever little bits blew out into orbit how much time is that going to take chunks of rock expeled from the planet surface floating all through space and orbiting at some 23000 ms might as well fly your ship into a blob of titanium sabot flinging cruiserssilly notion and poorly thought out there are only a few moons which are truly profitable turning 128 billion isk a month in surplus revenues most everyone else is struggling just to maintan there profit margin while they manage their pos and try to keep it fueled and functional sure some of them profit a great deal but not nearly like that maybe 20 billion isk for a null pos near highsec in a protected area of alliance territory with buds to back you up until some alliance manages to slip in and destroys all your pos while the alliance that guards you is off fighting somewhere elsenow you want to jump in and throw a wrench in the gears for everyone you dont think a new mechanic like this will be abused or that it wont prove the undoing of the little guys who dont have alliance protection you thought it was hard getting through null unmolested before what do you think will happen after this nowhere outside empire will be safe every ship that enters territory outside of empire will be chased and shot down and you wont have a chance to fire your little probes but the alliances will
maybe i wasnt clear enough on a few pointsin 07 concord may take a moment to appear but the attacker will still lose their ship every time you cant warp out as soon as you perform an illegal attack regardless of how long it takes concord to start blowing your ship to pieces its just more time to finish the kill than 05 currently grantsin 06 just because escape is theoretically possible does not mean ganking will be commonplace if concord had say 5 warp scramble to a distance of 30km and ridiculous dps near the current highsec values the only possible way to escape would be in a fast frigate that was lucky enough not to be struck or in a shield buffertanked battleship with 5 warp core stabilizers the frigate cant do a lot of damage before concord shows up and forces it to run away and the battleship has to haul its sluggish self to pointblank range before it can fire its weapons giving the player time to see whats happening and escapein 05 there would be a wider range of ships that could survive an attack but they would still be limited in gank potential from having to fit either warp stabilizers or a lot of speed so in my proposal 05 might have a fair amount of ganking the rest of highsec would be fairly safe freighters would also be pretty safe because avoiding concord is all about not waiting around but if you plan to take a freighter loaded with expensive goodies into 05 or 06 it might be reasonable to bring some escort just to be on the safe side even as it is freighters can and do get ganked in highsecand lastly having concord ships with ratvalue stats doesnt necessarily mean they wont be a threat if a 04 security system had 34 battleships at any given time in an asteroid belt with some other ships for variety perhaps with warp scramble and would warp more in to fend off an attack then you have to be prepared to take on them and the player at the same time its best to be in a fleet with multiple buddies to do that or use a carrier a player can protect themselves by only flying in decent combat ships ganking will also be less common since you cant just fly by in your stealth bomber pop someone and run off any time ganking takes preparation lazy players wont do it
i dont think it would ruin your profession youd just have to fly with buddies like have a tackler and a ship or two to fend off concord while you conduct business youd also have to adapt your profession to a new environment but with a lot more players in lowsec you should at least have as much room for your piracy as you have now you might get more or it might be offset by more people taking up your profession that could also have the effect of increasing the size of your corporationalliance and thus make it easier to group up with fellow pirates
industrialists are vital to the economy1008 is not enough space of industrialistsindustrialists main ships have no tank or defense capabilities to speak ofindustrialists rarely have many sp in combat skills so they cant just refit for combat as they cant fit the mods nor will their ships let them anywaysnot supported and you should be ashamed of yourself
you obviously didnt read what i put very carefully and dont seem to understand eve industry very well either theres so much room out there that industrialists dont need as much protection as they have to thrive in most high sec systems the suicide ganking rates are extremely low to the point of virtually never happening unless someone does something just stupid enough at the exact right time anything beyond that is almost always directed at specific individuals for specific reasonsindustrialists could definitely thrive in the 06 and 05 which i described and i believe plenty are shrewd enough to find even 04 or 03 to be lucrative beyond the losses incurred so no the industry haven wouldnt be confined to 08 in fact it would be expanded perhaps as far out as 03 but it would also be somewhat separated as the weaker andor lazier industrialists will reside in higher security systems and and try to avoid lower sec most of the timethe pirates at the gank spot between jita and dodixie would lose a large amount of their income as pilots would find it quite easy to simply fly around that system other than that the only people who will lose out are those who arent willing to learn a slightly different system or are too lazy to work or think for their income but dont believe its fair to give up their easy isk in 06 and 05
ok with the release of the latest patch you know have a single station that sends out drills to mine what ever you want only problem is know you have an insane amount of materials coming down one link and even the small amount require to fill 5 processors requires multiple upgradeshence i suggest that all links can transfer any amount of materials  it was a ok mechanic for balancing pi phase one but its just as old as the extractors sitting on my lava world
a senseful opinion agreed
best post
i believe the alteration is an intended consequencethe old way was that you could have 1 extractor per each resource on a planet and manage that every 30 minutes for an evening stocking up all required resources and having your t1 and t2 factories producing 100 of the time then offshoring the t2 products to a planet with spare cpupower for t3 production this new way means that you are limitted to the facilities you can use and thus must use them wisely if you want to extract every resource from a planet at maximum efficiency you wont be doing much production past t1 however by focusing on 2 or 3 resources per planet you get those 20 or more resources per cycle while producing t2 products however ultimately you you have to transfer goods around to do the higher end production at least moreso than beforepeople simply need to relearn how to manage the planet production because you have much more control over your raw income rate now than you did before which means you can essentially be more efficient with 1 or 2 heads where you needed 4 or so before in my experience i had to drop a couple resource extractors from my planets but i found the increased rate from the other materials more than made up for it i simply need an alt or a partner to produce the type of resources i no longer make for myself which is fine because it was way too easy before an alternate method is to put the ecu in between two resources and move the heads around to get both resources as needed because its possible to get surplus raw materials now

heya im as exited as the next person about the new avatar pics but but but could we please get someone or a group of someones to check the avatars being made cause some of them are really really wrongthe reason for a avatar as i see it is to make the person identifyable for when eventual release of walking in stations and seriously some avatars that i have seen many by piclinks in ingame channels are downright 2 second slapped together weird angled misfits some are way to dark some found a way to have a hoodie cover half or more of face  i know you say there will be options for editing them when new stuff comes along but thats not my pointmy point is that i really hope that someone in ccp figures out to make a verification program to say ok to decent avatars and redo to those that just make weird ugly and downright wrong avatarsend rant  hopefully others agree 
came to thread thinking you would complain about your ability to get good characters out of the new creatorpeople are making bad chars thats their right they will use all the latitude of adjustments that ccp enables and personally i think it is still too limiting but mostly on the number of art assets

nope i didnt make it up you argued with a csm delegate in the initial spoongate thread and one does not have to go far to see you arguing with yet another csm delegate trebor daehdoow who was also present at the nonevent take a look at you arguing with trebor in post 685 of this thread in reference to his post 683 of this thread you still refuse to accept the incident as perceived by the people who experienced it you continue to insist upon your fantasy versiondo try harder zero your current attempts are doing too much to make you look the fool and leaving me with little more to do than smile and wave you on to your perpetual train crashwindjammer
oh not this nonsense again first of all it should be apparent to you that im not a particularly friendly or even nice person second ankhs support base was not exclusively the pve community although some of the pve community did support her for instance ankh was a noted advocate and participant in factional warfare fw in point of fact she was the one who gave the fw presentation to ccp and was considered to have done a nice job even by people who didnt particularly like her factional warfare was intended to be pvp light and a way to get more people involved with pvp and hopefully go in for the harder core types of pvp once they saw their hair wasnt going to fall out from engaging in pvp so in a very real sense ankh supported pvpfar from wanting to eliminate anything she was an advocate for balanced play in other words she didnt want to see either pvp pve or bear activity eliminated in any sec of the game she strove to make these things balanced and fair to each of the concerned parties that she advocated some things the pure pew pew pvp community disliked is undeniable but that does not indicate she wished to eliminate pvp anywhere in the gamewhat really lit her fuse though was ccps determination to devote resources to developing new content at the expense of fixing existing content since this is a universal complaint amongst the eve community she can hardly be faulted for it and should be thanked for it by all eve participants regardless of their particular choice of activitypeople who want to see eve as a friendly place ok color me confused and in need of clarification by what you mean in my experience there are very few people in eve who want eve to be a friendly place and those people are demonstrably out of touch with the situation around themselves reeducated they make fine additions to eveor they are persuaded to leave eveim not sure if you want to blow my imaginary video game spaceship up or if youre threatening real life physical contest either way im half puzzled and half amused okay im more amused than puzzled but its a close contestwellnot that close but in the same neighborhoodwindjammer
again almost as if you participated in the campaign go figurepost with your mainhrm do we believe you when you tell us what ank really thought about pvp or ank when she told us what she really thought about pvp hard to make that call ank campaign talking point 7 post with your main again who to believe your claims about what ank thought or anks claims about what ank thought truly it is hard to choose
windjammers description of anks position is right on the money and the best yet written on this subject if some of her statements were clumsy or overheated at times who amongst us cannot say the same her policy focus in eve was balance and finishing content now contrast that with ildryns moral panic over the end of pvp anks desire to fix the bounty system or set up a workable player police system or end insurance payments for suicide gankers are cases in point one can legitimately argue the merits of implementing any of these but to bring them up is hardly the same thing as advocating the end of pvp as for ildryns obvious threat toward windjammer i do not find it amusing as it is personally directed i do not care what ones position on eve policy may be this goes over the line so assuming it to be genuine ive reported the threat to ccp and strongly suggested that disciplinary action be taken whether ccp will or not i cannot say even so the incident is now formally on record cheers delilah
the above account is inaccurate in a subtle but very crucial way i am hampered in replying because to give the details might cause pain to an innocent third party but i will say this just before eva threw the spoon i threw a rolleyes wtf across the roomsome 35 years of experience online have taught me that one should never judge a persons rl persona by their forum persona especially if that forum persona is extreme and if for example her forum persona was a conscious attempt to scam votes all i can say is  this is eve not hello kitty onlinehowever it is more likely that she simply had a tendency to overreact to what she perceived as personal attacks in this i can sympathize as i suffered from the same tendency when i was her agein any case ive said my piece on the subject

well fair enough but i dont think that substantially changes the interpretation of events even if someone was being rude then all that means is that two people were behaving badly yes harsh gritty and all that but pretending to be unable to distinguish between fiction and reality is still odd and if it was all a troll to get votes its a damn strange one ehhhh youre an idiot and your mommy hates you might be a strong reaction to an individual person you and everybody who plays the game like you is a psychopath in real life and youre all scum is on a different level entirely and anks own description of her own position should be ignored because it doesnt fit with the position im trying to sellthank you for playing your parting gift will be a lovely halibut
i would love to see her try to make something of this judge these people on this internet spaceship game i play are calling me crazy and now i cant get a job yes i did get removed from an elected advisory position on a council in said internet spaceship game due to a breach of an nda with an international game developer but im really here because these people are saying im crazy yes i did throw a spoon during a meeting and yes i think people should be penalized in real life for the behavior of their internet spaceship characters no technically i didnt work for this video game developer even though i stated i did in my cv under employment history you see judge the important thing is these people are saying bad things about me theyre the reason i cant get a job nowthrowing any object in any business meeting is unacceptable the csm is unique in that it is made up of real life people taken from a online game for a business purpose they arent there to make friends they are there for a business purpose period nobody throws something at anyone during a business meeting if you have an issue with someone disrupting a meeting you either ask them to stop or ask them to step out of the room anks behavior is indicative of someone who is not in touch with reality and who cannot properly process the way the world around them works this is someone who claimed on her resume that she worked for ccp she had a skewed perception of reality one where real life consequences should be bestowed up someone based on their behavior in an online game i honestly cant believe any logical person could defend her behavior
nope it is your intentional misrepresentations that we are ignoring thank you but you can keep the halibut cheers delilah
aaaaaand youre back to that trolling pattern seriously youre not fooling anybody realty is an assault on ank the facts are out to get her the truth is a smear do you realize how that sounds to someone whos not trolling for ank anks own words quoted verbatim are intentional misrepresentations of anks own words seriously who do you expect to fool with such an obvious lie im honestly curious what do you hope to gain by your trolling

the creator is hands down the best morphing creator ive ever seen its easy to use and understand that said there is some bad points1 total lack of head gear why is it some races can have glasses and others cant why are there no hats crowns and really simple items like nose rings ear rings piercings etc2 facial structure limited to race are you kidding me take a look at my picture that nose is the smallest i could make it yet other races can pretty much elimination the nose down to a little tiny button3 clothing im not too concerned about cant expect to have a full wardrobe of stuff but there is a wardrobe why is some races able to have a leather looking black jacket yet others cant these is something i consider a poor oversight the end result is everyone from that race is walking around in next to identical clothing just open up the clothing for everyone if want to wear a male shirt i should be able to if i want to put minmatar pants i canthe amarrian female was royally screwed because the bone structure is very male structures deeper inset smaller eyes larger nose and bridge its like they accentually put a male nose structure on it the second part is the horrible horrible clothing choices for an amarrian the outer and bottoms specialty clothing options are uglybelieve it not my character looked damn good without pants on but had the long amarrian outer coat on looked like a dress you couldnt accept that though because you had to have pants which is stupid because the outer top is long enough the skirt section comes down to just above the knees there is no need to have pants on and its not like youll be running around half naked the dress did a fine job covering up the crutch areashoes why must you have shoes the ugly baggy pants the amarrian female has looked beyond ation when you put any shoes on it looked 10000 better with no shoesthe fixes are simple and can allow a much more dynamic creation platform1 allow all characters access to all facial and bones structures i dont want to look like a bobble head because my body bone structure is thin yet my head is like a man head give everyone complete access to all body and face bone structures then allow you to manipulate the bonesmuscles within their limitations2 give everyone every bit of clothing accessories makeup hair eyebrows there is no reason why i cant as an amarrian have glassesit shouldnt be limited in any way save yourself the time and effort ccp open up the clothing facial and body structures so anyone any race any bloodline can use them that way when you want to try and suck 15 out of people in six months you only need to developrelease a few new added clothing and structures instead of 1 or 2 for each race
there is but you must not have it there is an amarrian female skin tone that i call totally void of sunlight lolin fact most of the skin tones the amarrians have are pale apart from the one i chose which kind of orange like a bad beach spray on tan if amarrs didnt have turd colored clothing they could have an awesome emo character black hair pale white pasty skin coloring dark makeup too bad the clothing options are completely devoid of anything blackon the upside you can create an incredible albino with amarr lol
try a khanid male then which falls under greater amarr as well takes quite some effort to not look like some future clone of genghis khan and you end up with something like adolf hiller misspelled on purpose with a nice tan yay i think the majority of players will agree that the cc in itself is a really nice addition to the game just some of its options need a fair bit of tweaking still sadly we lack a single central place to pool all the feedback from the playerbase on it
extrapolating it out to low sec would change the dynamic too much i think but otherwise i like the idea of having to pay a fee to concord for protection within high sec it defies realism that concord would do as good a job as they do without any incentive to do so real life cops who get paid the same whether they do a good job or not certainly act nothing like concord

whatever the end result you need1 selflimiting rewards total capacity k distributed by various means if only one guy is doing plexing everywhere then hes going to get a ton of isk or lp every day this activity will be seen as a great way to make some easy isk as the number of plexers increases the rewards k will be split among many more people and itll likely balance out to whatever other forms of income are available 2 conflict to be rewarded you must complete the plexing mission and to maximize the reward you need to maximize your rewards and minimize your opponents rewardsvp to lp concept should have been implemented years ago whatever is used for vp should be used for this figure of merit in this case if there are 1000 poeople piled into a plex then the vp awarded should be 1000baseline vp the reason is that those same 1000 people could have been running 1000 missions instead the total distributed will still be a function of total vp awarded so whether 1000 guys do one plex one guy does one plex or 1000 guys do 1000 plexes the total payout is the same
why do you think it should be self limitingi agree with the conflict idea im not sure how to implement it though perhaps they could put more fw exclusive items that are available to all militias that way basic econmics would encourage you to keep your competitors from getting lop perhaps you would get some sort of small lp bonus if any ships blow up in the taking of the plex it couldnt be too big because people would exploit it by blowing up alts in rookie ships but if the reward were not that much larger it woudlnt be worth ithere are some more thoughts on rewardsif the new plexing mechanic works at all like i think it would there will be a lot more exploding ships in fw a lot more everyone will know where you are doing these so there will be many more fights if it didnt pay anything all the pilots would be bankruptim thinking the value that you get from the plex should be enough on average to cover say 23 of your losses for t2 fit t1 hullsafter insurance and with t1 rigs so lets say a t2 fit frigate costs 6 mill a t2 fit cruiser cost 25 mill a t2 fit bc costs 35 mill just throwing some numbers out therelets assume you get about 25k isk per lp and lets assume that on average you will finish the equivalent of 2 plexes solo before getting blown up or if you travel with 2 pilots you will finish 4 but the lp would be divided equally so its the same the thing is the bigger the group you travel with the more you will likely finish before getting blown up but you will also be dividing your rewards more ways if you can beat the odds and get 3 plexes in before you die you paid for your ship if you can beat the odds and get more than that then you are actually profiting not as much as running missions but youre pvping so lets say a minor defensive plex would pay 600 lp a minor offensive would pay 850 lp offensive pay a bit more because the defensive plexes are basically in your back yard and offensive may require some travel of course some pilots may start to base deep in enemy territory which spreads things out and is in general goodmedium plexes would pay about 2500 lp for a defensive and 3500 lp for an offensive etcagain the numbers i propose are pretty rough if they are wrong we can adjust it and no i didnt use a calculator so its likely not exactly 23sccp should make plenty of plexes available in allot of systems when there are more people online and fewer available more spread out when fewer people are online otherwise timezones where there are few people online will simply cap plexes with much less fighting all of this would need to be tweaked over time
the problem with a direct lp payout without a cap on total resourcesunfortunately is that one set of alts will run plexes risk free and the other set of alts will run plexes risk free  no conflict fighting over limited resources hopefully means that there will be gangs going around trying to hunt those plexers how these gangs that hunt plexers get paid i dont know but i bet there could be some sort of gentlemens agreement with the guys who actually run the plexes
im thinking i may not understand fully what you are saying here but i to dont want this to turn into some sort of new way to get isk without pvp however it seems to me that with the limited direct payout described there would still be a lot of conflict consider these points 1 because the other militia knows exactly where you are plexing as soon as you enter the plex you will almost certainly get company you will probably find there are people doing plexes within 1 or 2 jumps of you wouldnt you go check it out if you were roaming2 as long as plexing pays much less than fw missions and high sec missions people will not plex primarily as a means of income if you just want to carebear you would still be much better off doing fw missions consider how many lp you can make per hour doing fw missions whatever that may benow consider how many lp you will get plexing even if no one responded to the calls the plex timers take long enough that you would be much better off isk wise running fw missions considering a minor plex timer runs 10 minutes so with ideal circumstances where you 1never get chased out or blown up 2 you are able to do it solo and 3there is 0 travel time you could only do 6 in an hour so 6 x750 lp  4500 lphour for medium plexes there is a 15 minute timer so again assuming the same completely unrealistic ideal conditions you could only run 4 per hour yielding 14000 lp per hour even if you have multiple accounts you of course should then be able to multiply the amount of isk you make by running fw missions as well so thats a wash but even if it doesnt scale exactly the same the lp gains from plexing even given unrealistic conditions are not even coming close to missioning if you want to fight rats and run from pvp you still have the fw missions that will still be the much better way to make isk this lp for plexing will just be an attempt to help defray the substantial losses of ships pilots who fight for occupancy will no doubt incur these changes to occupancy plexing will make it a way to get constant good quality small scale pvp without getting blobbed something ccp has never been able to do in any other setting i am convinced that with these changes fw plexing would be a huge draw for pvpers and there would be more than enough conflict
no pleaseid rather pay more in monthly fee than have microtransactionslet things cost isk instead you can already buy isk with money through the plex system if you dont have enough isk
nocosmetics are pretty important part of any gameccp has spend alot of effort to update eve graphics overtime and for pricey sub fee i feel that i should be getting best possible eve experience that devs can offerim not going to pay both sub fee and microtransactions and if micros are idroduced to the game and i want that content but dont get it for sub fee im not going to pay either sub fee nor microtransactions
noisk yes
im not ashamed to say that i have sold a few plex to get the isk i cant get due to limited playtimeuse isk this microtransactions thing stinksno

still waiting since 2 years for ccp to do something after they removed blaster pvp with webscramspeedagility change
either fix gallente or give their space to sansha in their current incarnation the identity of the gallente is a bastard race theyll try to fit anything but rails or blasters to their hulls

while on the topic why not give black ops a bonus to cap and shield regen while cloaked
dont fix whats not broken not supported sorry
but it is broken
sounds like a great idea adds more risks for dropping caps on people
this is good idea
no its not trying to fix capital issues by braking cloaking devices is something like a rectal surgery on the eye fyi capital ships can refit near each other and they can cap transfer to each other no cap pilots will be affected by this xpt a lonely jackie chan on a route from chribba meeting point to his home system did you noticed a lot of cloaking devices in a capital kill mails
i do not support your proposalyou have neglected to explain why noncapital ships should also be affected by this changeif you simply edit your proposal to be exclusive to capital ships i shall approve or please add an explanation as to why subcap ships should also be affected by this change
this change does nothing overly negative to users of non covert cloaking devices that arent in capital shipscompletely irrelevantcompletely irrelevantbulland being able to catch jackie chan is bad are you familiar with the term population controlwhy would there be any the entire point of this is that cloaking makes it hard to kill them
if this gets implemented i predict a high sec filled with caps due to ccp
should be fixed asap its a wonder that it is not fixed yet after x yearsnot only does it prevent warping to cyno but no one can kill and loot the cynoship sadface

gallente cant counter range due to them over nerfing remote sensor dampeners and rails being crap not due to the speed differencei would say cutting your ehp by between 20k2 lses and shield rigs fit and 30kagility rigs is a fairly large sacrifice to gain the speed and range to use autocannons properly not to mention going from having three utility mids to just the one is a fairly large sacrifice in your theoretical eftfight yes the minmatar has selectable damage types but only if he knows what he is facing and changes in warp you start the same fight with emp loaded you lose 10s of dps to change pvp isnt always mutual and you dont always get the drop on people also well done for posting a look my can gets  this much dps eft high damage set up without thinking about the fact that hail has a max effective range of 4kmish and ty trackingwith that tracking disruptor you knock the harbinger range down to 12km of which 10km is still optimalas you seem to want to play this out in eft what happens when the harbinger launches medium ecm drones and you get jammed 40 of the time what happens if the harbinger isnt the standard 1600mm plate fit and can keep you outside of scram rangeedit changed the wallotext
the problem is youre talking about armor tanking ships which you want to use for dps and amaar consistently gets the win with all those mid slots and a higher armor baselook at the harbinger and the myrmi twomore comparableships harbi has a faster base speed more armor base a more even spread of resistances its actually faster than the myrmi by 5 ms drops sig by 35 m and has a better scan res and thats just the surface with no skills whatsoeverharbi also gets a 5 bonus to laser damage and 10 reduction to laser capacitor need per level compared to myrmi with 10 bonus drone hp damage and 75 bonus armor repair amount then compare the harbis ability to fit 7 lasers with one high slot to spare and the myrmis limit of 6 hybrids with no high slots to spare though it does get the extra mid slot the myrmi becomes a mission ship where it can fight in controlled circumstances or it gets fit in a manner contrary to its purpose to make it effective in pvp the harbi just slides on smoothly into either role as it is needed without the need for modifications contrary to its purposewhen comparing the cane and the harbi even the cane comes up a little short lower pgstill more than myrmi 1 less turret slotit can fit neuts or launchers it actually gets the same base dps with 6 projectiles and two launchers less one as the myrmi and harbi get with their respective full load of weapons up top despite that fact the cane can fit all that without maxing pg while the harbi and myrmi are both over on theirs fortunately the cane pulls ahead when you push its skill to 5 beating both the harbi andsignificantlythe myrmiarmor capabilites are of course variable between the 3 ships and take more time to consider and weigh characteristics of honestly dont really feel like doing it right now though i will note the canes even lower sig higher scan res and automatic cap stability granted by its guns i think the primary factor here is balancing everything individually without consideration for bonuses applied in one situation a hurricane does significantly improve dps with its bonuses and a myrmi does gets its bonuses to drones and armor rep these are situations they are not constants individually any one weapon or module should be as good as any other in its class ships should apply role bonuses that make sense for their factionclassification and all should be equally capable of holding their own on the battlefield i think this is all any player can ask
to be honest i never wanted to argue the difference between armor tanking bcs my point was that if gallente became the fastest race you would not be able to use the minmatar ships to kite as a shield brutix with a scram will always catch a shield hurricane then and it becomes a case of ehpdps race which the shield brutix winsas far as armor tanking bcs go the harbinger is generally considered the king for plated tank and gank work with the cane coming in second due to utilitycap stability the myrm is a fantastic armor tanker though and has plenty of utility and is extremely versatile more so than either of the others it can be fitted as dual rep boat a triple rep boat multi plate bait shield gank shield kite  theres more but i cant be bothered to write them all out its main issue is its speededit i am in no way saying that the myrm is the best ship i would still use the harbinger or hurricane i do i was just pointing out that as an armor tanker its good
i was just considering the possibility of penalties applied for ships fitting other factions weapons not simply the loss of role or ship bonuses as those are generally inconsistent and not applied to those weapons in every circumstance thus a myrmi fitting autocannons would gain the benefit of low cap and pg req while it would actually take a hit to dps output and tracking for example this would of course be a compatibility issue based on the ships computers interfacing with foreign weapon systems similar penalties could be applied to various modules which would be more consistent with a certain factions use of assisting modules such as gallente sensor dampeners similarly armor ships could fit shield tech but suffer from its use while shield tanking ships would suffer from applying armor tanking modulesthis would help to reduce or remove exploitation of fitting for max benefit from all factions the reason for this is that nerfs typically occur when one factiontype of module or weapon is used something else more powerful example being myrmi with autocannons suddenly the myrmi has pg to spare more versatile dps and a full cap reserve while being able to dish out less dps but at greater range and still field its dronesim not sure the range increase for autocannons is worth that drop in dps they have it loses some 60 dps without role bonuses for the addtion of 57 km falloff with max skillanother thing to consider is speed vs range which has been mentioned already theres a reason minmatar ships are considered one of the best pvp ships its a combination of speed maneuverability low sig radius and weapon range factors they have the ability to control the battlefield by achieving positional superiority while not only mitigating the damage they recieve but applying dps at range and being able to maintain a reasonable shield or armor tank this is optimalgallente suffer from poor weapon range speed and maneuverability which bring us back to the original post this is the commonly recognized problem and one which has to be remedied in some fashion as an alternative to blasters or autocannons you can fit hybrid rails and increase range this increases both pg and cpu req while reducing dps significantly providing nearly 100 dps loss per group of 6 highest t2 mediums the benefit there is range the downside is the dps cant eat through anything dpstoehp or dpstoactive tank and stronger close range ships will just close in and dps you to death lets face it max dps on a myrmi with 250mm tech ii rails and all level v skills coupled with all six lows filled with tech ii mag stabs is only 295 not only that but ive got frigs that could survive 45 of its alpha strikesdrones added to that does make it more significant but its not the only one that can use them it does have more than usual of course and 2 hammerhead ii 2 ogre ii and 1 hobgoblin ii will dish out a decent 315 dps unfortunately somebody wipes out your ogre iis and it drops to a measly 125 dps until you field 2 more so they suffer not only in positional superiority but in logistical superiority as well it does make for a nice initial deployment though still suffering in overall dpsthats just a myrmi role and ship bonuss combined with high drone bandwidth and capacity make it more practical than other gallente vessels
the main reason people fit myrms with autocannons is for the cap not really the range the main things gallente need is more damage so they are the kings damage wise inside scram range according to some other posters in other threads a geddon out dps a mega at 8kmi think when really the only time a geddon should out dps a mega is outside scramor overheated web range gallente ships should be able to be kited by longer range boats thats the point of hte range boats but if a gallente ship gets tackle scram and web on an equivalent sized ship it should be lights out atm blasters although still the highest dps guns do not out dps the amarr or minmatar boats by enough to make it a forgone conclusion
the problem with that is that it creates an auotwin situation that sort of thing shouldnt exist as it allows players to set up that dynamic fit a mwd 2 ods nano shield tank scram web and two mag stabs launch drones and press the i win button when the first ship jumps through gate it might not work on a battleship with a scrambler and web but thats not really the point is it as two or 3 ships like that will this logic doesnt really solve anything it just creates more exploits to take advantage ofmy thought is give all gallente ships a 10 boost to scan resolution and a 30 decrease in signature radius to start this will effectively increase their damage mitigation and allow for faster target locking test it on sisi so maybe theyre slow and perhaps they should be the majority of gallente ships dont appear to be designed for speed but that doesnt mean they cant have electronic shielding reducing their sig radius look at all weapons and compare them to the factions and ships they are intended to be used on then rebalance them appropriate to those ships general statistics slow ships should have longer range weapons theres no reason hybrid plasma cant maintain coherence at greater ranges and blasters could effectively dps at greater distances the possible addition of explosive damage could work with hybrid plasma too giving them more versatile dps and potentially more effective dps unfortunately theres nothing you can do with lasers em and thermal is about all a laser can projectas i mentioned before compatibility issues could arrise from using other faction weapons on your ships this would be to remove the use of exploit fits where ships achieve stupid dpsandabsurd tanks or speed due to the varying nature of different factions ship designs weapon fitting exploitation becomes a problem when weapons are balanced for those ships this is something we dont wantwhile i agree with this thread and have supported it i do believe the whole system need to be looked at not just those modules weapons and ships which are strictly gallente in origin if one thing is changed it will affect another or result in an exploit somewhere it will be mass dps tactical advantage in situation or it will be something else youll find people fitting hybrid blasters on minmatar ships with no turret bonuses and maxing their speed for highly efective dps they wouldnt normally obtain

dont read too much into the hail in the fit it was just what i had in there at the time of copying also the tracking disruptor makes a huge difference because the harb is now in webscram range and once the cane gets in there he can switch up the td to nullify a lot of the harbis dps as well as control the range because of his greater speed we can play fittings all day but that was never my point with this the point was that the armor hurricane is by no means useless and is quite a good ship actually buffing gallente will not mean minmatar boats are suddenly relegated to uselessnessto the more important point about speed there is no reason why minmatar boats should be able to kite gallente boats without seriously altering their fits to give them a speed bonus its ridiculous that the race with the shortest range should not ever be able to catch up to the other race it doesnt work in theory and it definitely does not work in practice rsds cant be a counter in and of themselves because a gallente ewar ship cant control everything on the battlefield just like an ecm ship cant now as gang size goes up a ship has to rely more on its own functionality if we rebuff rsds for everyone then were back to the bad old days and theres nothing stopping a faster ship like the cane from fitting its own rsd and swapping for longer range ammo another automatic i win buttonand frankly its not the shield tanking that makes minmatar speed op its the mass combined with base speed a shield cane is way faster than a shield brutix same with an armor cane vs an armor brutix even though it has better range and comparable dps clearly something is wrong with that picture from a fundamental design perspective
unfortunately your hurricane has no means to tackle the harbinger at long range to make use of its td without waving a huge sign reading warp away now please in its facethe myrmidon on the other hand has that ability in a td buffer fit as well as superior damage projection at range it can also dominate your hurricane in the same wayquite the contrary there is no reason gallente boats should catch up to minmatar boats without altering their fitshow is a hurricane supposed to stand up to a myrmidon if not by speed advantagetds are the counter you are looking for fortunately the myrmidon has an extra mid over the hurricane to use them properlyyou are comparing a tier1 battlecruiser to a tier2 battlecruiser this is bound to fail given the current tier system and frankly gallente get pretty much the best deal for their tier1 battlecruiser of all the racesalso a properly fit shield brutix is merely 60ms slower than a properly fit shield hurricane that is nothing with current overheating mechanics its very easy to grab the shield cane for a competent pilotanyway this whole minmatar vs gallente speed discussion is pretty much pointless as this idea will never see the light of day for very good reason if you want to go down the speed argument road maybe ask yourself why the amarr platforms enjoy the same speed as gallente ones and work from therepretty much the only thing in your op i can agree with is fittings that is for the medium size platforms thorax brutix deimos astarte this is where work needs to be done preferrably by upgrading fittings instead of reducing requirements of the weapons then some bonus adjustments could be done for brutix and astartethats not enough to give support to your topic unfortunately as some of your other ideas are just not helping at all and some obviously not properly thought out at all regarding their consequences for game balance

while i admit that i thought the same thing when i first heard of repair drones and was dissapointed when i realised i couldnt rep myself i see no need for this changecurrently ships have no real problems with tanking  so why spend time fixing a problem that doesnt exist additionally you run into all sorts of risks with ship balancing both against other ships and against npc encounters given that there is no immediate problem that needs to be fixed theres no justification of taking this risktldr  repair drones are fine as they are
in that case there needs to be a change to the descriptions stating that they cannot be used in this way nowhere does it indicate that these are remote effects that can only be used on other people
supportedits a non sense that your drones frigate sized ships under your command are incapable of repair your own steel spacebikegive us another skill to learn and most important number limit of drones on self repair  5
youre an idiot if you dont have experience at an issue calling you out on it is credible this why potato peelers from chip shops arent called to discuss the effects of tpa on stroke at neuro conferences furthermore if you are insulted by being told you dont understand how drones were set to work then i suggest you htfu

this may be the simplest and most elegant solution though i wonder if ccp would go for it being that easy they may get a giggle out of some of us using our ecmcombat drones on your own ships
while i have some doubts about whether anyone from ivy can really speak about anything related to combat id like to point out that this suggestion would have some very big effects in certain situationsit would allow armor buffer tanked ships to repair themselves without going to a station and quite possibly give armor a true passive tank while still costing it the use of drones for other thingsit would reduce the proliferation of ecm dronesit would reduce the proliferation of warrior ii drones on some ships which means ivy itself will have less to worry aboutit would create an entire drone culture based on defense which is right now not in existenceit would buff solo pvp

some people just cant take a hint
yes i was hinting that if you have a problem with people posting the you probably shouldnt be posting yourself especially not just so you can post to tell people that you dont think they should be posting i see i wasnt explicit enough
so you are saying that in theory large blobs can zip around the map when in fact they really dontalso you say it is more of an accurate statement that fleets that are out for hours rarely have the stamina to add more hours to their trip if jump bridges are gonesorry if my depth of vocabulary and word usage is not as vast as yours i just want to make sure i fully understand what you are saying before i make a reply to it
none of the last 6 posts add anything relevant to the main topicof course i could just ignore it it happens all the time in every long thread but itd be nice if reminder to be considerate actually worked
none of your recent posts do either but you keep posting about how posting is bad i do not understand your source of confusion the ability to zip around the map is a theoretical and not a pragmatic onebecausefleets that are out for hours rarely if ever have the stamina and will left to go add a few more hours to their nighthow many major fights have you been in that drag on for hours with one or both sides repeatedly reshipping and after theyre done the members in the fleet are eager to spend another several hours in a slugging match somewhere else
this thread is lol is it possible to use the same fleet for offense and defense in trivial time regardless of distanceyesdoes ccp csm or from reading the thread a significant amount of people like thisnothe attempts to deflect the discussion of the main subject to politics and now player stamina are hilarious and worthy of a third rate magician by the way 1 to jump bridges burning 00 is hello kitty and friends online
already identified is the fact that depending on regions jbs dont save any significant time at all were talking a difference of ten minutes or twenty minutes round trip tribute to fountain core and yes the fact that players dont generally have the desire to play for hours straight in a major battle and then turn around and play more hours in another one is perfectly relevant to whether or not people will actually play for hours straight in a major battle and then turn around and play more hours in another one its funny that you call that a deflection
and in other regions they save a significant amount of time funny you neglect to acknowledge that oh wait you dont like facts that dont fit your argument rightand whether those players play in a fleet again right after or not it doesnt change the underlying fact that when they play again if they didnt get too tired they will be able to move huge fleets in trivial amounts of time regardless of distance depending on the region in some the time savings arent significant however in others most you could say they are and so i call it a deflection the underlying problem is the ease of force projection and mobility bridges allow and that ccp does not think bridges are working as intended this is a problem you dont address and which you replace with well i think they work just dandy which they plainly and obviously do notaccording to those who make the gamethat is the discussion and not politics player stamina or the color of your underwear
yeah because you made it up ccp never said that bridges arent working as intended theyre working exactly as intended pos bowling was a feature not working at intended being able to jump capitals to covert cynos is a feature not working at intended greyscale said that nullsec politics werent working the way he wanted not that jbs werent working as intended thats totally different and youre trying to substitute what was actually said for a completely different issue swing and a miss you being wrong is not me ignoring somethingeven going from the eastern tip of tenal at sfxj to pnqy youre looking at a difference of 29 jumps with bridges and 18 more without even if we were talking 30 jumps or 40 that amount of time saved is insignificant to major battles that can and do go on for 48 hours which is essential to determining whether or not jb networks actually allow for big fights at one end of the galaxy and then the other with the same fleet in theory or in standard practice but whats that oh wait you dont like facts that dont fit your argument right 1w on the eastern tip of vale to pnqy 28 jumps with bridges 38 without when compared to the process of getting thousands of people to a combat zone in multiple reinforcement waves whether or not you save 20 minuets on the trip is not game breaking if that was really the objection you could keep jump bridges and nerf ships warp speed by 90 force projection is accomplished whenever a large bunch of people decide to hit a target that extra 20 minutes wont change that and if thats really the goal its pointless
but they did they want to change bridges because they dont work as they wish they arent changing politics or any of the things you would rather discuss and you accusing people of making something up hilarious quit your day job comedy is for you your opinion is noted it is however wrong it is my postulation that of ccps and from reading the thread quite a few reasonable people that the amount of time saved is not insignificant it may be to you for you are immortal and got unlimited time but apparently for everyone else its not in theory or standard practice it happens and is deemed a problem again your opinion is valued but unfortunately not based on factsand if those ships arent fighting offensive and defensive battles in different eds of the galaxy well where do they go when the pilots succumb to stamina vanish into thin air just to reintegrate somewhere else oh yeah they jump back when needed yep jump bridges again but the problem is not warp speed and warp speed does not teleport ships by the way i like your new act of dismissing bridges now as irrelevant classy you seem to be the only one with that opinion i think that those extra 20 minutes will change that the devs do too and really if you are convinced its an irrelevant change that wont affect anything you care about well then you have no objection to it and your numerous posts of straw men and out of context quoting ommissions and whatnot are but part of your arguing for the sake of arguing fetishintriguing
i support this nullsec is too small alliances hold too much space force people not to hold as much spaceif this doesnt pan out then put jump bridges on planets or a module for the ihub itself
and both of you making the classic nonengineer mistake of confusing do what i say and do what i meanin the end all of ccps decisions are done with the intent of making the game better but because they invest very little time in planning testing review or for that matter really any part of the iterative model other then implement and deliver the results are at best unreliablewhen ccp added bridges their intent was to link nullsec together but their overriding intent has always been to make the game better that is still their goal but now theyre less convinced that what they did jives with what they want to dotheyre kinda stuck on their own marketing bs really they have a principle of providing deliverables on a timetable that leaves little room for serious thought about how to proceed considering that ccp is the only major software company in iceland of any kind im not exactly surprised that their adherence to good software design principles falls a bit short of say blizzard
i do not support the idea of jump bridge removal im not paying my subscription to look at gate getting slowly closer if you want bigger universe add more systems
space means nothing without time if it takes one hour to go from one end to other thats how big space is regardless of how many systems there are we could have huge universe with 100 systems if it would take one hour from gate to gate and jump drives were limited to once per day and we could have tiny universe with 10000 systems if it takes 10 seconds from gate to gate and jump drives can jump from one side to other at will
only anchor jbs at planets and only those of a particular type plasma storm  one per planetwith dust mercs can then interfere with jbs as one of their high tier objectives either by greatly increasing fuel cost causing a cooldown or whatever look ccp synergy
post with your main stop making  upccp has not stated that bridges are not working as intended they are working exactly as intended greyscale specifically stated that one of the reasons for getting rid of bridges was to change politics its also rather dishonest for you to claim that the idea was to change bridges or to fix them so they work as they wish the idea was to remove them completely from the game and yet youre claiming that completely removing jbs from the game is fixing them so they workits a fact not an opinion and youve attempted to deny it with the bandwagon fallacy plus the fallacy of appeal to authority its a bit hard to tell what you actually understand as it seems that rafia landras audeles evidently doesnt have combat experience and is an alt that started posting within the last 24 hours but the ability to save half an hour on deployment is insignificant when compared to how a battle actually unfolds that getting podded home is often the way people return and that folks often get to a system and fight until theyre spent and then just log off somewhere and try to caravan back home at a later date that ccp doesnt get it is unsurprising these are the people surprised when told what effects lag has on a big fleet battle give proof or retract how often does it happen and how much of an effect does it have on actual conflicts in progress also as you keep ignoring it how much of a difference are those 10 to 20 extra jumps do you have evidence that fleets say ah well itll take us 10 extra minutes to get into another fight that we want to be in so everybody stand down and make yourself a sammichand yes if those ships arent fighting offensive and defensive battles they stand down or log off in highseclowsec or log off in nullsec and try to get a scout back later and again having 1020 or even gasp 30 fewer minutes to make it back to home base is hardly game breaking and here we see that your argument is pretty much a troll youve just been going on and on and on about travel time i point out a very good way to reduce travel time and all of a sudden nope its not about travel time anymore and the objection that jbs teleport ships is immaterial as gates do too and you can campgank on both gates and jbs as for dismissing bridges as irrelevant yah youre making that up too bandwagon fallacy coupled with calling facts an opinion coalitions projected force long before jbs existed yes sometimes even when it took a while to get where they were going because thats whats essential for force projection the will to travel not the ability to save 10 minutes on travel the argument from nuhn unhh doesnt change that fact yah stop making  upoh and even changes that dont effect things might be bad ideas too letting a five year old draw new ship models would suck youre making things up thereve been no stawmen youre making things up ive quoted nothing out of context youre making things up there were no omissions but nice trolling obviously proving you wrong is only done because i have a fetish for arguing for its own sake post with your main
absolutely true but they are the sole reason for powerblocs being able to supersizethe gbc ra goons et al of old were not coalitions made up of half the bloody map but rather regional powers forming alliances with neighbours that changed dramatically as bridges grew in numbers and distance was no longer a hindrancelol at using an invasion of the single hardest part of space to get to as example of anything regarding force projection being balancedwhen i lived there it it took half an hour to get to lowsec with bridges  truly the assend of the clusterbridges make null too easy too convenient too prosperous and provides power disproportionate to the costsand really that crap about the sandbox  stop it already or use it properlyccp not only owns the bloody box but are the sole purveyors on the sand within itthey have on several occasion been forced to replace some of the sand that turned out to be cement in order for the box to be open for everyoneadditional suggestion to bridge balance bridge consumes all available cpugrid of poskeeps the convenience but with same vulnerability as stargates
i support the ideahowever the logistical itemmoving that jump bridges support should not be ignoredi think jump bridges should be reworked as hangars that may be accessed in two locations with fuel requirements based on the cubic meters of volume moved
wait whatat its prejump bridge height the gbc stretched from omist to fountain and the nc if you choose to treat the current deklein bloc as part of the nc held more or less exactly the same space as they do now
are you using the fallacy of post hoc ergo propter hoc or hoc ergo propter hoc hard to tell can you elaborate you are simply wrong the forces arrayed against bob in the first great war included most of the north plus the goons plus ra bobs empire was also significantly larger taking up most of the west and much of the south and youre drawing a distinction without a difference sure there were massive coalitions but now coalitions are bigger so it doesnt count as identified the actual saving on time are fairly trivial if distance is not a hinderance now then it was equally not a hinderance before when the only difference was 1020 minutes extra travel time in many cases there are any number of factors that may have influenced the game from the personality and agenda of the leadeship of the games alliances to the influx of new players to sov mechanics and so on claiming that bridges are the sole cause is an abdication of reason post hoc is a fallacy not a piece of logical reasoning you have no idea what youre talking about do youa massive invasion force was assembled entire regions were invaded and a lot of space including highly vital space fell the invasion was orchestrated for all practical purposes with jbs being irrelevant along one front and of negligable impact on the second and the defenders had their own jb network but they were still beaten by invaders in numerous key battles this shows both that force projection can be accomplished without requiring bridges and that bridges are perfectly capable of being countered even on a multiregion scale with a huge coalition defending them the too easy claim is not just subjective but nonsensical saving people time in lugging  around hardly makes nullsec easier in any essential manner a coalition thats put to siege and their jbs reinforced is hardly going to have an easy time of things too convenient is simply subjective preference masquerading as objective truth and its one that disagrees with the perspective of many other people whod rather spend more time playing the game and less time moving to say nothing of the fact that again if moving slowly is the goal then you could cut warp speed down to 10 of current and accomplish it easily as for jbs making nullsec prosperous thats simply fictional not even subjective plexes sanctums and moons would still exist without jbs the fact that ccp makes the game doesnt mean that they get to determine that playercreated playerdriven content is being done wrong not if its a sandbox game making a game and owning a game doesnt mean that you can turn it into a nonsandbox game and then claim that its still a sandbox because you own it
couple of ideas here1 have only 2 jb per constellation and not let them be in the same system as one another this allows the smaller guys to be able to have a jb going from one side of their constellation to the other while mitigating the bigger guys ability to make an unbroken chain of them across multiple regions2 eliminate standing or password requirement for nonalliance members to use jb this will mean that you need to be in the owning alliance of the jb in order to use it personally not in favor of this one because it favors the supermegaultra alliance3 make jbs an invulnerable structure that is not set up at a pos this is my favorite option maybe because i thought of it and maybe because its awesome lol because it then solves at least one major issue of jbs while maintaining an ability to control choke points on the map this would mean that instead of specific and rather boring ways to go about destroying someone at a jb cloaky dictor bombers etc you could have a real subcapital fleet camping a jb an maybe get a real fight out of the mess this way the people jumping through into the next system might actually have to use scouts instead of using a deathstar to guarantee their safetywith the jb an invulnerable structure in the system  much like the tcus or the ihubs  they would only become vulnerable when sbus are anchored i believe the reason that the jbs are forced to be placed at poss is for their protection not the protection of those traveling through them this eliminates that necessityflame away boys and girls
oops forgot4 remove them entirelyas a proviso to this option however nullsec would need to become more self sufficient less logistical need for infrastructure and more real living in your space the military logistics should be hard as it is
perhaps we should look to creating dynamic region stargates that connect to certain regions at certain timesas was proved with planetside static links tend to force combat towards the common ground which in the case of eve is wherever hisec is nearesti think jbs were intended to nullify this tendency and while their removal is certainly a good idea from a pvp point of view you are still left with the utter isolation of the far reaches of nullsec though perhaps thats a good thing
if vuk didnt have irl stuff at the time of the summit i doubt this nonsense would have seen the light of dayanyway im running im not going to let this kind of idiocy take hold without a fight
and mittens knows where you live
dear finnagain zeroyet again i find your lack of reason  logic unsurprising unlike you many people in this thread have actually read the notes released on the proposed changes and they are to be frank completely within reason the fact that you run out here attempting to blindly brow beat anyone suggesting that these proposed changes are anything but terrible is easily read to be desperation or ignorancewhile you might think that you are helping your cause and your coalition your lack of well reasoned arguments and lack of understanding as to what the proposed changes are reveals you and anyone else blindly complaining about issues which have no relation to what is being discussed ie sandbox games  if i want to put turrets on my drake i should be allowed to because its a sandbox game in paniced frenzy are not concerned in the slightest about the wellbeing of this game but your own misguided desire to keep winningive got news for you if you say these changes will do nothing to you and your coalition and honestly believed that as i do i doubt you would be so fervently defending themon a closing note the man who designed jumpbridges is now one of the biggest advocates for their removal if this doesnt speek louder than the rest of this thread there is nothing that can be done for youforeveralonejpg
limegreen trolling what a surprise stop trolling and identify an actual argument you disagree with then show why its wrong lying troll not only have i read them ive found myself continually correcting people whove claimed things like that theyre not explicitly about breaking up coalitions yes it speaks to your utter lack of honesty and logic jbs were not designed by one guy and even if true the minutes show that his objection was not that theyre not functioning as intended but that he wants to violate the sandbox and try to alter mechanics in order to hurt political choices he doensnt like youre also trolling as the people who voice certain positions is an irrelevancy and the support for those positions is all that matters ive been over all this which is why you resort to trolling and cant actually address what ive said and instead need to spew personal insults and babble about mistakes ive made rather than pointing out a single one
desperate complaining is not an argument the fact that you feel the need to pick through every single post that isnt agreeing with you in some feeble attempt to discredit it is both childish and weaki would disagree with you if you actually believed what you are saying as it stands you are going down a path where the ends justify the means where you are willing to say pretty much anything to stop these proposed changes going through of course if you actually knew what the changes were you might have a better shot at making arguments against them but then you wouldnt be finnagain zero so thats beyond the point
yah againstop trollingif you claim that ive made any errors actually point them out an rebut them rather than spewing empty and impotent personal insultsdefinitely stop trying to play internet psychologist its embarrassing and does not mesh well with your conspiracy theories either just because youre dishonest and troll because you hate coalitions doesnt mean that others are engaging in your same behavior liars think everybody lies thieves think everybody steals and trolls cannot understand that other people believe their own argumentsfeel free to address the actual arguments or admit that you can not and your position is utterly bankrupt by just trolling some more
no they didnt alliances still exist
we are finaly making progress with you it seems attempting to address arguments rather than choice exertsive made my point that is you have not carefully read or understood the proposed changes even should you i dont expect you to see reason or be happy about them the man who owns the cheap labor factory is never the most willing to see the world change that isnt to say that he doesnt see its wrong just his integrity has a price on it you have been compromised your opinion on these matters is highly prejudice and you are incapable of weighing the benefits to this game against your own personal satisfactioni could spend a good hour or so going through the issues you have raised such as sandbox game coalition mentality and other largely poorly formed arugments you have made to smokescreen the real issues these changes are addressing but im certain it will get me nowhere with youanyone who want to sit down on ts with me at any time and get a full explanation of my beliefs and reasoning is welcome to
the onus is not on me to prove that you have not read or understood the notesjust sayin brahedit although given it would be more fun if it wasyou assume you know what ccp intends and how the mechanics should be used i say that ccp intended for ecm bursts to hit ships inside poses giving them agro prove me wrongyou address the notes as though they are irrelevant given human nature the notes as i read them had nothing to do with removing blobs from the game the fact that they will make it harder to blob does not remove your free choice to join blobs and does not stop your blob flying 60 jumps to do whatever it is you want to do it is about ballance and providing hopefully more instances of pvp the fact that so many people have read this to be the end of pvp or the rise of macros or best yet the death of small alliances proves to me beyond a shadow of a doubt that these people have either not understood the changes or are so concerned for their own abusive style of play that they are prepared to spread panic and poor arguments to further their causenow at the end of the day when you cant really argue with this as an argument i expect you to either dismiss it as lies and trolls or pick out random bits and try shout it downbut that my friend is how ive come to the belief that you dont know what you are talking about
i accept your admission that you are lying and trolling and you can not rebut or debunk a single thing i have said
he who joyfully marches to music in rank and file has already earned my contempt he has been given a large brain by mistake since for him the spinal cord would surely suffice
ah i see that after i pointed out that you were still trolling you edited your post to make it look like you arent of course youre still trollingtrollin we do know what was intended and that the mechanic is working as intended just like we know that you are lying about having read the minutes as greyscale never said that there was an exploit involved but that he wanted to institute a mechanics change to try to hurt political forms he doesnt like and to stop sandbox play so that only content that is ccp approved can be engaged in by the players trolling it was specifically stated that it was about trying to hurt players ability to create political situations as they saw fitstrawman people have pointed out that making it take longer to get fights may possibly slow the pace andor encourage turtleingtrolling you are trying to pretend that game mechanics aimed at breaking the sandbox and stopping players from creating bullard content that us bit approved by ccp is about more pvp because you are dishonestly shilling for a position where ccp while prevent people from creating their own content in a sandbox game and instead try to force them to fight people theyd otherwise choose to cooperate withtrolling when people creating playerdriven content that you do not like and cant counter in game is abusive you are obviously just flaming people for choosing to creat playercreated content in a way that you subjectively hateinternet psychologist just because you argue dishonestly and troll to support your position does not mean anybody else is doing so let alone everybody who points out your many errors obvious trolling no further elaboration requiredtrolling responding to the premises or an argument is hardly improper if essential context was actuallly missed you could then point it out and rebut any errors instead you simply troll about the fact that arguments are responded to individually and not with a wall of texttrolling by lying and trolling and then stating that your lying and trolling will be pointed out you are trying to premptively protect your trolling and dishonesty from rebuttal trolling as proven i have bit only read the minutes but either you have not or you are lying about their contents
for the record im 3 from 3 in predictions in this thread and i would like to encourage you to never stop posting each time you sperge like this you give strength to everything ive been sayingi doubt the panic and ignorance you hope to sew will change the decisions makers minds at this stage as it is just sperging
for people who are not finnagain zero i would like to provide you with something to think about he will no doubt sperge i hope you learn from his mistakes and actually think about the changesthese changes do not take away you choice or your ability to group up in numbers what it does is encourages the use of stargates and increases the danger in sovreign 00 whether it be yours or your enemys how is this likely to affect 00 provide overall more instances of pvp by bring slightly more imperative to dealing with hostile gangs and by encouraging convoy systems arguments based on the nature of this game being a sandbox are completely irrelevant and nonsensical as these changes in no way affect your option to make choices and form what coalitions you want that these changes encourage smaller scale pvp again hopefully revitalising 00 pvp and giving meaning to smaller gangs once more  which has been lacking for some timeif you are reading these changes as an attack on the coalition system you are so so so wrong the point is not to stop people blobbing and ccp nor their representatives have ever said anything like this that you read encourage smaller gangs and more pvp to the deliberate attack on coalitions i think is very telling seeking to victimise yourselves i find highly ironic as every time a game mechanic crops up that you deem unfair you are more than willing to spam all up and down these forums until such a thing is changed  point in case 07 carrier changeshowever when this game is at the precipice of changing for greater oppertunities for pvp and a more vibrant and active 00scape you are prepared to throw it all away for your own ignorant feari promiss you and im on a bit of a roll with cool quotes today the greatest ignorance is to reject something you know nothing about these changes are of great benefit to anyone who enjoys pvp if you dont enjoy pvp then fine contest these changes but do so on those ground not some false sense of moral panic
trolling yet again in this thread minigin is unable to accurately describe facts engage actual arguments deal with others let alone provide factual refutations of his own and can only trollspeaking of whichtrolling an lying minigin proves that he did not actually read the minutes and had been trolling about how others allegedly did not greyscale makes clear specifically that his goals are to try to hurt coalitions and force them to fight amongst themselves rather than going across the map and attacking other groups simply to start wars for th sake of pvp
they have and it was greyscale who threw the idea of deleting jump bridges altogether you know the dev wishing to remove something because well it doesnt work as intended you may want to read the minutes ad hominem fallacy zip up bro your hypocresy is showing no its an opinion with nothing backing it up but your own unreliable statements facts are backed by something and you have neither statistics nor well facts to back any of your utterly wrong opinions the developers disagree i disagree etc in b4 omfg fallacies the onus is on you to prove your nonsensical claims do you have numbers regarding any of this didnt think so more misdirection first it was politics then sandboxing wrong now it is warp speed that is the problem protip the topic today is jump bridges i know you dont want to talk about those feel free to submit your grandiose ideas about warp speed in a relevant thread inb4 no really the problem is local your opinion as has been established is an opinion your opinion is not a fact i dont think the word fact means what you think it means protip it does not mean finnagains opinionso now the problem is five year olds and ship models one whole post is too much for you to stay on topic and where is you know proof for anything you claimthere is only one troll here and that would be youby the by here is a map of the northern bridge network see the colorful tendrils those are jump bridges connecting well everywhere with everywhere i guess some people see the time savings as significant go figure map
you want to make space bigger let us blow up stationsstations are more to blame for how spread out alliances are than bridges if there wasnt a station in near every single large alliance null sec system people wouldnt be as spread out bridges wouldnt be used to connect all the ratting grounds it would take time and warfare but the sandbox would then be molded by the players rather than some artificial intervention by ccp
yes im sure that sounds aweful for you nearby pvp as opposed to the other side of the map ludacris thats just unfair people should be encouraged by mechanics to form giant naplists that there are no closeby targets i dont see how anyone should be for changing jumpbridges now well played sirfor those of you who actually want to read the minutes though ccp has always wanted smaller goals that can be achieved with smaller fleet subsetsccp has gone too far in the direction of making players lives easy  weve got jump freighters and jump bridges and all this stuff  and i think there is an agreement here at ccp that we want to pull back from thatmuch of the csm agreed that alliance logistics is too easyit was suggested that ccp as part of any changes to logistics take the opportunity to eliminate mindless pain and add gameplay valuemore opportunities for conflict in the logistics making it easier for other players to trap you if youre being sloppythere is concern that logistics into deep nullsec will be much more difficult than shallow nullsecgreyscale awesome more things to fight over and more importantly more differentiation between different areas of spacegreyscale feels that reduction in mobility will decrease need for big coalitions because huge coalition blobs wont be able to move as fast result should be smaller local warsit is noted that the cost of supporting coalition allies will increase which will increase friction coalitions may fragment so reds are easier to find this may make it easier for small alliances to set up shop with less supercapital curb stompingthe csm notes that if changes are made to make logistics more difficult entry points into nullsec will become even bigger chokepoints than at present this issue was discussed in june with the csm suggesting more entry pointswhat is ccps vision about small alliances ccp wants them to be able to be independent if they want and feels reducing the ability of large alliances to hold a lot of space will make this more viable  it make the curbstomping harder another issue is that at present large alliances start feeling secure get bored and say we have nothing better to do lets go crush these guysthe csm feels that avoiding a fight should cost you and notes that when controlling large amounts of space its hard to respond to stuff happening on the periphery there needs to be incentives to take the fight vs let them knock it over and well go fix it afterwardsgreyscale shooting structures suck it is a terrible mechanicwith respect to the issue of aggression timers and logoffski greyscale deployed his catchphrase  it sucks balls the problem of legitimate disconnects remains but if you are in a fight and lose your connection then that ought to be tough luckwell done ccp for heading in the right direction a big thank you from me
minigin is trolling again notice that the part he underlined was about shooting structures and did not even that it was not working as intended just that the intention had been bad mini proves he was lying and trolling and hadnt read it and is kind enough to quote it where greyscale says over and over that his goal is to break playercreated content try to hurt politics he doesnt like and break up coalitionsno seriously though stop lying they did not allege a single exploit or claim that jbs were somehow operating other than designed minigin inexplicably posted the text of the minutes to prove that hed been lying about their content and having read them who do you expect to fool when theyre still postedi know that you heard someone talk about fallacies and thought it was cool but they have actual definitions you clearly have no clue what an ad hom is you also clearly have no idea what hypocrisy is ive spent time in many many long fleet fight and speak from experience you are on an alt troll account with no combat stats and no facts to back up your nonsenselying and trolling the objection came from greyscale not the developers also trolling as you have no data to back up your pains and you are posting on an alt troll account with no combat experience while i actually know from experiencemore trolling your lack of compehension is not q lack of clarity on my part the minutes clearly show that the intend is to alter nullsecs political landscape it obvious that youre trolling as it explicitly says just that likewise you are trolling by pretending that you dont understand the playercreated politics is the same exact thing as sandbox gaming and telling people that their playercreates politics are wrong is indeed telling them theyre sandboxing wrongthe point about warp speed showed that you were trolling in that point as well as you claim that you want to make it slower to move long distances which nerfing warp speed would do but you babble and try to avoid that fact especially relevant since a need to warp speed would be fair and applied to everybody and not just sov holdersmore trolling caught using the bandwagon fallacy being wrong about game history and bit understanding how cooperation and force projection actually work youre calling facts opinions additionally you are trolling as you claimed that correctly pointing out that your subjective opinions werent factual was a ad hominem and that you object to hypocrisy also trolling in that youve opted for a i know you are but what an i tacticno the problem is that you wont stop trolling i pointed out that even things which would have zero effect on gameplay like five year olds drawing ship models could be oppose as bad ideas you are now trolling and pretending that a direct response to your claim is a change of topic you are also trolling about proof when everything i have pointed out is either documented fact about the games history unlike your ignorance if the history of coalitions or drawn from extensive experience with fleets unlike your alt troll account with no combat statstrolling the jb network does not connect everywhere only nc territoryalso trolling in an already refuted point the time savings even from the eastern tip of tenal or vale to pnq are fairly minimal and not enough to significantly influence force projection and certainly not 48 hour long battles let alone full scale invasions like the recent drone regions invasion still no prof from an alt troll with no combat stats
oh i didnt see any proof of anything finn you are of course entitled to your opinions unsubstantiated as they may beby the way ill save you the trip to google ad hoUFFFDmiUFFFDnem   ad homuhnuhm nem ahd show ipaadjective1appealing to ones prejudices emotions or special interests rather than to ones intellect or reason2attacking an opponents character rather than answering his argumentfunny your claim of me being a troll while offering nothing to substantiate your opinions fits perfectly there but hey troll is your favorite word and a reasonable fallback for when you have nothing to saythats okay i understand you have no argument and concede in the guise of childish personal attacks i know i know expecting you to give any substantiation to your claims is asking for too much from you and as we all know you are of the opinion that bridges offer insignificant time savings and that ship models are somehow relevant i would buy you a dictionary because you clearly do not understand half the words you use but if google is too hard for you to use i dont see why youd use a paper one i recommend you look up fact hypocrisy troll and lyingat any rate i am glad that you think that the changes would be inconsequential and that the bridges everywhere not specific enough sorry go back to internet lawyer school are there because they look pretty in maps and not because they offer any significant tactical or time advantage although i disagree on the current impact of the bridges if you think them so insignificant which they arent then there is no objection you can raise against them goingby the way ccp is the authority on bridges and i believe that their arguments that they dont work as intended hold vastly more water than yours that they do  especially since ccp has you know facts and data and you have unsupported opinions and forum posturingso the bridges go
lack of engagement of core issues fixation on assumptionspoor ones at that senseless reiteration of the same poor pointsyou dont even bother changing the wording most of the time lack of ability to engage a complete argument you rather clutch at exerts and even then you dont deal with those exerts you seek only to discredit them not on their merrits but with general fabrications you have been throwing at anything that isnt yes i think jumpbridges should not be changedwhat is the point of discussing anything with youyes we know you dont like the propsed changes why dont you give us the real reasons you dont like them
if bridges disappear it will change nothing we will still form coalitions and we will still be fighting halfway across the map because we love technetium and we love shooting it and we love that the one lets us do the other a lot
this thread shows exactly the problem with the csm and taking feedback from this forumabout 90 of the people here clearly dont know how jump bridges are usedccp consulting the current csm on any 00 detail like this also seems absurd given two thirds of the group havent reached 00 fallacy 1jump bridges encourage blobs allow blobs to move allow blobs to formrubbish large fleets only occasionally use jbs nothing stops fleets moving through normal gates anyway they arent going to be ganked or blocked on a gate route it is just a more boring way to play you know how we know this it happens today when there doesnt happen to be a jb route where we want to go ie most of the ing time jump bridges arent what allows a 200 man fleet to form in a staging system either  jump clones dofallacy 2jump bridges reduce small scale pvpgankingill tell you want reduces small scale pvp the fact that there are no small scale objectives worth fighting for in a contested pvp encounter and ganking gets steadily harder as the player base gains a better understanding of game mechanics warping to a safespot is not hardall jump bridges really do is allow member and small corp level logistical and industrial activity within alliance organisations take away jump bridges and youll just leave more activities that can only be performed by alliance blob level organisation or by bitter vets with capitals the guys who are currently hard not that hard to gank on jbs will be impossible to gank in a blob theyll just be more bored because everything is taking longer for no reasonsmall gangs use them to chase targets as well but i dont see how that is a bad thing  given that it means more pew pewprofessional game designers ought to have realised by now that players will always feel they have to do things the best possible way or not at all they will then complain or go off in a huff when they then find they are not having as much funfallacy 3logistics doesnt take long enoughwell jesus ing christ this is what you get when you vote for the current csm nobody can seriously think this
if bridges disappear it will change pvp dynamics significantly stargate traffic would increase significantly number of small scale pvp encounters would rise large scale pvp operations would require more effort to organize and execute with more risks for counter attacks and multiple fronts00 would become more hardcore  that cannot be disputed it will have minimal impact on political structures of eveits not the intent of ccp to break up big power blocks but ccp seems to be concerned with pvp strategies used by the power blocks
you seem to assume that people would use gates i would say they would be using jump capable ships instead carriers are nowadays cheaper than ships people use for ratting for quite significant portion of playerbase so its quite easy to get one and use it to haul your pod and whatever ships you need to be moving only ones using gates would be alts in shuttles this not the eve that was when jump bridges were first introduced when hotdroppin people with 3 carriers was a statement nowadays 3 carriers at a gate are a bait
actually the only thing this thread has proven is that finnagain loves his jump bridges he manages to make a point to reply to every post that is for a change to jump bridges with arguments that can be directly applied right back at himccp csm and many players agree that there needs to be a change it is time to let this thread that is nothing more than people debating back and forth further entrenching each other into what they believe to be so called facts diei suggest we take this over to features and ideas section where we can talk about it
im sorry but anyone who claims jump bridges dont reduce small scale pvp doesnt actually spend any time doing small scale pvpthe simple easily understandable fact of the matter is that jb are designed to provide easy and safe alternative to stargate travel thats pretty much a given the vast majority of small scale pvp engagements happens either around a stargate or asteroid belt therefore reducing the traffic thru stargates would automatically reduce number of small pvp encountersthere are small scale objectives worth fighting for i fight for sake of getting kills which i find a fun thing to do the main objective of the game is fun  not isk not outpost holding not moon holding  but funwhile large organizations need concrete game objectives to justify their existence small scale entities such as individuals and small groups of people have pvp fun as their main objectivesure not all people want to pvp for fun but quite a few do and thats enough reason to start most of the small scale fighting that goes on all over eve  high sec low sec and 00

some players want to have an opportunity to export the character in xmlfile and import it and i had an idea why it can be usefulfor example i want to create together with the friend or the girlfriend characters  brothers twins with the same surname and then it would be healthy to have possibility to load the same character

no no
i am strongly against requiring the use of a 3rd party datamining and advertisingdriven website just to tally voting on something that could be accomplished simply on ccps own inhouse website

i do not support your proposalhowever i do support the idea that stations can be critically broken requiring another massive investment of resources in some way proportional to the cost of building outposts in order to once again become fully functionalwhen a station reaches this critically broken phase docking will take some amount of time to complete no instadock and would not be able to store additional items in the station only remove existing items and repackage itemschange of station ownership shall follow whatever the current scheme involvesit would add to the sandbox allowing corporations to adopt a scorched earth approach if attackers are able to be repulsed or do not have enough presence to control a systemrepair of the outpost will follow the current mechanics of building an outpost perhaps at a slightly discounted cost
i support this idea

1 good ideabut i think there will be a little problem with future incarna
hey raath worked hard on staticmapper and i worked hard on betatesting ityes wh space is predictable but its a hell of alot less predictable than null also not supported because i like my cushy c1 pos farm with highsec exit
the answer to this one is simple if you find that staticmapper makes your life in wh space too easy and you want the element of surprise back stop using staticmapperforget i ever wrote it this game is all about using our imaginations and make believe so pretend the site doesnt exist and never use it again and hey presto you have your element of surprise backin all honesty though before i wrote staticmapper aharm and ccres already had most of the systems mapped out they knew where you all were and it really ticked them off when i went public with that site so all because a small minority of wh dwellers i see the site statistics and page hits per day find life a little too easy wont stop the big boys from having the upper advantage if you want surprise and challenge find which systems aharm are inhabiting and drop a tower there thatll present quite a lot of unknowns for you to deal withthere are still a lot of unknowns about wh space its impossible to map wh space because the destination is random but what youre asking also is a little crazy imagine being a noob corp in a c1 then spawn a c6 exit and ccres pop through to say hello if thats what you guys want then petition ccp to your little hearts out but i still think your crazyleave alone is what i say
the point is not that staticmapper causes it to be unpredictable rather that the mechanics cause it to be unpredictable staticmapper is just a result of those mechanics and opportunity if you used a system like the one mentioned a few posts up then your chances of getting higher class whs in lower class ones are weighted against it happening too often if you make use of mass limits relative to the class of the hole that its going to then people cant for example drop a carrier on a c1 pos as amusing as it would be from time to timeif things were truely random then no the big corpsalliances would not still have things mapped out you cant map our randomness you even stated that yourself sometimes being a little crazy is a good thing the world would be a boring place otherwise
so stop using it if you dont use the site wh space wont be predictableok have you actually looked into the mass allowance for the static types this is already a mechanic in the game c1s only spawn statics allowing bcs ore smaller in c3sc4s nothing larger than an orca c5s and above anything below super caps youll never get a carrier in a c1 unless you build it there but theres nothing to stop a blob of bcsthat is one mindset however i think folks are missing a massive pointer here if the cryptic comments of the developers from other threads are anything to go by theres a reason that ccp didnt add a random mechanic to the wh spawn it would have been very easy for them to do it but they didnt now my reasoning is they did this for a reason perhaps as part of the lore and background story regarding wh space leads me to believe that these whs are not as random as some people suppose or would wish them to be perhaps theres some intelligent reasoning behind the grouping of certain static types into regions and constellations who are the sleepers are whs really natural occuring events or was there something more behind themwh space appears to be a massive puzzle and the assignment of the statics appears to be part of the key my site helps to visualise the puzzle and perhaps one day someone will look at the region view and go ahah therea a pattern herethe devs have even said that theyre waiting for us to progress the story along and find something and most folks who do crossword puzzles scribble notes in the margin staticmapper is little more than a doodle on the side of the cosmic tabloid and i have a feeling that this is an intention of ccp that one of us create a search tool like it why else did they not add a random mechanic to the spawn
this suggestion has absolutely nothing to do with your site so please dont act as if i insulted you or your work because i didnt it is useful and good to have with the current way wormholes work not using staticmapper wouldnt change a thing because the wormholes will still have the same statics as before my home will still have the same exit wormholes every day
if you read what i said regarding mass in relation on one of the suggestions about weighted spawning it makes sense assuming im talking about the current spawning is incorrect as were talking about ways it could be improvedi know very well how current mass limits work however if you went around having random spawns to random classes then you would have to completely ensure that there would be no way on new eden that people could get things they should be able to into those lower class systemsif theres a reason for it then so be it these are suggestions and nothing moreand as was said i dont see why your acting like this is a personal attack on your site
i never thought for one moment that you were slating my site at all but theres a reason why wh space is the way it is if you look at the development blogs and other posts on the characteristics of wh space theres cryptic comment after cryptic comment about why wh space operates as it does but what youre proposing is that ccp forget about whatever future plans they have for w space and ignore what theyve already put in place for us to discoverunless we get an official ccp confirmation were all left guessing but i still thing ccp did this for a planned purpose i for one have always been excited about w space and cant wait to crack this nut and find out what juicy kernel ccp has in store for us
not supportedi suspect raath nambode is correct i cite as supporting evidence for raaths pointofview
random connections would be a nerf to all wspace people would find it harder to get in and out and unable to rely on their connections for somewhere to pve or jump those doing pve or even find people to pvp against who are used to the same level of gangs  effectshow do you think most people would take it if they get even a few days of only very highlow class holes with no route to restock no anoms they can reasonably run and corps with cap ships coming in to break their stuffid say wspace could do with having a few more dynamics sprinkled about it but they still wont form a much greater network unless people are scanning more than just static sigs and size 10s
every time a website can be built around a game feature that is billed as difficult unknown or just random that game feature is not difficult unknown or random enough
raath is correct whs work as intended and if they arent random enough for you dont use the statics and just use the random exits when they presentvery not supported
noif you want unpredictable move into a c6 wh and wait for aharm to find you i guarantee you will have as much unpredictable as you can stand at that pointyou will also be very glad you know how whs work so you can gtfo when they reinforce all your towers with their dreadnought and carrier pairing3 you guys though

change it so they just jam rrers instead of killing them no gcc dock or warp to unjam
sure its not like anything can tank concord anyway
concord is untankable now so i dont see why this should still be kept
i died because my rr teammate shot me justice
i think that this proposal is a must as some people may wish to try and assist sansha incursion fleets by rring this is huge role playing hole for some people that want to help sansha but simply cant
i also would like to rr my fellow people while they gank freghters this helps roleplaying and incursionrole on 100 man rr gangs outside jita 44 and perimiter gate
being able to rep npcs is way too open for griefing and should never be allowedhowever the incursion fleets themselves really need to be able to repair each other without aggression spreading through rr the poor pug groups will have it hard enough as it is in incursions they dont need this added complication its crucial that griefers cant blow up someone else ship by getting themselves concorded
how will it affect public fleetsthe only time it becomes a problem is when a logistics gets infected with a criminal counter since you dont get flagged for shooting sansha there will be nothing to be concordokkened foris there some hiddensecret mechanic that i am unaware of then please enlighten me because as things are i see no problem
quite easy really griefer takes cheap t1 frigate or cruiser and insures it for the maximum he joins the fleet and waits to get rred as soon as he is he attacks a player ship the rr ship itself for maximum lols this equals player aggression the aggression propagates to the rr ship and concord arrives and blow them both up with the difference that the griefer lose maybe 100k isk and the rr pilot might lose around 150m isknow this doesnt even have to be a griefer it can be any noob that isnt used to the interface and thinks the rr ship attacks him he shoots back and get them both concorded
this
i would like to suggest a modification to your proposalin addition to your current proposal of removing concord aggression towards rrcause any player taking damage from concord security immune to any and all repair effects easiest way to do this is probably just give concord an ewar effect to concord security that reduces all repair effects on the target to zerothis way you are not affected until concord actually responds starts shooting youthis will accommodate any future repair effects that may be implemented by ccpthis will not change current gameplay as current concord tanking setups are ehp based
i dont see any need to do this concord shoots you down because you are aiding a criminal the only thing you need to is just give reps to people you knownot supported
and you want to open a massive can of highlowsec griefing worms out of the goodness of your heart if it is possible to prevent gcc transfer to in incursion systems then yes a good idea  but that is not what the op asks for exempting rr from concord will just make the neutral rr crap even worse
i think youre mixing your concepts aggression transfer and neutral rr are separate issuesanyway the best idea ive seen this far was that all remote modules deactivate if the target change security status in a way that it can be dangerous to you that way you have a choise do i still want to repair this person nowif you really really want your rr ship concorded you can just begin again but otherwise you can just lean back and let concord handle your problem
nope not mixing it up exempting rr from concord means that rr alts will swarm out in lowsec to repair pirates on gatesstations as sentries no longer fire on them  would be especially insane on highsec gates if rr could jump to safety as normalpoint is ccp are obviously already making massive changes to systems affected by an incursion so should be possible to add an rr exception on top
because cooperating should be discouraged in an mmoissue with concord jamming rr is that it gives other problems how should it be done with gcc in low sec there it is less relevant but also happens and doesnt solve problems doing exactly the same but then by getting flagged to other players which transfers via rr to the repairing shipso the logical solution would be imo adding what is already present if you start rring someone you get a warning popup so just add popups seperately for repping a player who is flagged to other players and one for people with gcc both you can disable if you want but on default you get it and it doesnt matter if you just start repping now or he gets flagged when you are repping
supported in principlealternate proposal if you are remote repairing someone who then commits a global criminal countdown act then your remote repair modules are immediately shut off you have to activate them on the same target again to continue providing assistance and if you didnt suppress concord warnings this will result in a confirmation dialog to appear
yhis really
that is already possible to do and i can tell you it is fun to do  altough never tried to do it in high sec only did it in 00
something must be done1

thnx you very much for one constructive no this si soooo rareand to macro users try to be a little less obviousand yea you dont help the economy in any way but if its helping you to think that every criminal neads reason to be a criminal
no i dont live in a police state in rl and wont live in one in a gameno im not a botter but of course youll say i am because obviously the only people that wouldnt want inconveniences added into their game are bottersbotters make tons and tons of isk and live of plex umm where does the plex come from they are generated from gtcs purchased out of game with real money thus ccp is still getting paid
sorry but ccps profit is for me on the last place when it comes to bottingproblem is that ore that i mine becouse of bots worth 2 to 3 times lessproblem is that plex becouse of bots costs 15 to 2 times morethe problem is that i cant even mine that much ore becouse bots mine out belts before i come onlinethe problem is that when i kill them they just buy new ship and when they kill me i must earn for new shipthe problem is that they play the game and dont have to worry about isk and i must calculate can i afford to play the game that way or i must wait to play it becouse i dont have isk for that ship or somethingthe problem is that they play the game only when its fun and i must to do less fun parts for longer time becouse of themi dont say that mine proposal is the best i only want that something is done about this problemand if you are against this proposal ok but if some person is against all proposals you know
captchas to mineseriouslyi so stopped reading there
to whom it may concerni am writing to call your attention to an accessibility feature long neglected in the world of eve and to the scanning ui in particular i am a color blind individual and find it extremely difficult to perform the most basic functions in eve because of the extensive use of color and the lack of ability in the game to modify or customize that color the scanning ui has always been difficult because of the red signatures blending into the dark backgrounds but i have managed largely because the icon was a red circle with a white ring the recent changes to the ui have made it completely unusable normally i simply try to get by in whatever way i can and have been largely successful even if at a disadvantage but this change has made entire sections of the game inaccessible to me i realize that i am only one individual but know of many more that are in a similar situation to my own the new scanning ui is much more difficult for even completely sighted individuals to use much less myself there is little excuse in these times not to have even the most rudimentary customization features to help those in my situation compete and enjoy your product on an equal level i also realize that broad sweeping changes are not possible to implement quickly or sometimes at all but rolling back the scanning ui to its previous symbol set should be a relatively simple task another possible solution to this issue would be to allow third party utilities to modify the ui in such a way as to make it usable i understand this may not be a particularly implementable option but it is there if this is not the proper forum for this type of communication please let me know the best individuals to contact in order to get this issue resolved quickly and with the minimum of trouble for all parties involvedthank you in advance for your time
please fix this
this needs supporting come on ccp what do you think youre doing
fix this and stop fcking messing with my drop down menus
plz fix this is ruining gatebased or any large scale pvp
gate camping is not pvpalso the game works better like this not supported
so then how are gate nobody said anything about camping but that is pvp just like trading fights not pvpalso how is the game better like this this improves nothing
you actually have to pay attention to the game instead of freezing overview and holding the cursor just below the last entry to insta target at the gate campthat seems like a gameplay improvement to me eve should be hard i hear
not supported the op uses kthnkx which just makes him look stupid and therefor his idea or proposal is stupid that and it annoys me
haha you really think people have tons of junk on their overview when camping or fail to sort it properly so they can just click the first entry anyway
dear own alliance terribadkthnkx your terrible2ndalthough my compadres like to gatecamp i usually go around in frigates looking for honor bushido duelsalso seeing as though you know we gatecamp alot your probably on a couple mails on our board so you madbeing able to freeze the overview gives the player the ability to focus on a target he or she read he is attempting to find be this on a gatecamp be this your in a logistic cruiser or triage carrier and trying to find who the hell just broadcast for armorshieldcaphull the ability also allows you to focus on a destination like attempting to warp to a planet when eveuni minmatar fw gaylente fw amarr fw any sort of 00 alliance like your terrible alliance blobs you and your waiting to warp out your pod btw kthnkxpaging tailor swift for snipe
your an idiot
no you are
yes but does that mean it is supposed to be a twitching game where you have to have very very fast eye to hand coordination or a game where youre supposed to use your brainsfocusing on the overview trying to catch the split second where the target stays at a certain location isnt what id expect from a game like eve when told its hardthats something id more expect from a shooterby your logic shouldnt guns also not autotarget but be manually controlled

i think th eissue isnt with gatecamps or small fights teh real problem is when you have 176 targets and your trying to find khntdeathlord89 and he keeps jiggling up and down the target list due to warpoffs warpins distance changes or deathskhntdeathlord89 is a fictional character and in no way represents or is an imitation of any person living or dead andy resemblance to a person living or dead is entirely accidental no khntdeathlord89s were hurt making this infomercial
1 for the menus pls for the love of god leave them alone
freezable overview or else ccp
110 for receiving some responseshopefully this is a bug and will be patched quickly
yeah this needs to be fixed it obviously is one of the many glitches that were introduced with the new patch including overview and local standings issues neutral coloring on overview the toggle special overview bracket hotkey not working ectanyone who doesnt think this feature shouldnt be brought back obviously doesnt know anything about pvp and probably has a real ty pvp record prove me wrong
supportedin large 20 fleets  its a mess now to follow primaries

thanks for the support guys tell your friends and this might be fixed in 4 yearsunless another game designer is found to be smoken teh crackthen maybe a little later
the last and first time it happened was months ago every station i warp to at 0 drops at a different range depending on what direction if it is outside 500m it says setting course for docking perimeter at which point i would be vulnerable which is s warp to 0 should be 0you old s that had to fight without warp to 0 i couldnt care less about eve has moved on so should you and i have just as much right to waste ccps time as you do by replying pointlessly to this thread so  yourself you pompous nope not mad i just think warp to 0 should mean warp to 0
i take it you dont know how to make all your dock attempts 100 secure
lol what an incredibly ignorant reply rife with profanity and not a touch of respect for those who have made this game better for you you do realize that forum warriors have made suggestions that ccp have then taken up as fixes and improvements dont you well from your imbecilic post im assuming notnow youre trying to follow in the same vein and suggest something that you feel should be fixed which is all well and good but then you go and act like a child and an idiotyes more precision in jumping may be a noble goal but i would rather drill a hole through my foot than support you
nope would you care to share with the rest of us that werent born with your insight and built in perfect eve playing no i dont expect you to share since you havnt alreadyif i wanted your opinion i would give to you
you sir are just adorable how long did it take for you to think up that catchy quip nope yeah you didnt think that tired useless reply up at all i have no idea how to express how much fun it is to hate on youand by the way you have to be an idiot to get podded at a station by warping slightly outside of the docking radius im not sure if youve heard of player owned structures theyre those shiny glowing orbs with a stick in them floating in space you might want to try them out when a red is in system but wait wed have to hear a whine thread about you not putting in the password and failing all over yourselfdie quietly
im sure youll figure it out for yourself eventuallyi wouldnt want to hold your hand considering what youve been doing with it
bookmarks boooookmaaaaaarks the mr says booooookmaaaaaaarks let me try again bokmarks
this was in highsec moan somewhere else thanks for helping me legitimately keep this at the top of the 1st page even if all i have only attracted is morons and trollspost with your main instead of hiding with an alt and i might put some stock in your opinion jk your an self important foolnot that smart thats why i came on the forum and suggested it be fixedthanks not sure i like the idea of bookmarking every station in the entire eve universe that im ever likely to use especially when i should be landing at 0 anyway
warp to 0 doesnt mean warp to 0 exactlystop whiningedit thought i would make this less trolly the reason you dont land at 0 every time is the same reason that when you and a buddy warp to the same belt at 0 you dont end up inside each others ships
edit fixedit should do what it says on the tin otherwise its pointless i think it should be fixed so i posted here im not whining no hint of emo at all just morons trolling giving me the understandable with a fleet warp dont see why it should do it without though
i didnt mean with a fleet warp i meant in generaltry it you undock and warp to a belt then your mate does it see if you land in the same spots obviously in the same ship types if you do it in a bs and him in a frig you will always land in different positions due to the amount of time it takes to align
for reference on the current situationevery object has an imaginary outer boundary sphere around it and so does your ship the range between your ship and another object is the distance from the surface of your outer boundary sphere to the distance of the other objects outer boundary sphere itll become clear in a moment why this is relevantwhen a group of ships are slowing down from warp towards the same destination the game clumps them together randomly on a drop out of warp sphere about 2 kilometers in radius the center of this sphere is then dropped exactly on the destination point with the result that any ship on the drop out of warp sphere is about 2 kilometers off of that exact destination pointwhen you warp to zero on a station or stargate the center of your drop out of warp sphere is placed exactly on the edge of the stations or stargates outer boundary sphere because you yourself are randomly placed somewhere on the drop out of warp sphere you might land as far as 2 kilometers inside or 2 kilometers outside the stations or stargates outer boundary sphere for stargates this is generally irrelevant since jump requests are accepted at 2500 meters for stations however docking requests are accepted at 250 meters you can issue a docking request at 25 kilometers but it wont be accepted until your ship gets within 250 meters ive tested this personallyi have no opinion on the proposal
this
my idea is to stop gate and station guns putting agro on to dronesim not talking about fighters just drones 2 reasons 1 it takes damage off the ships that are attacking a ship2 it takes dps off of drone ships especially gallente ones its not like gates shoot defender missiles like the concord billboard dose
i reckon this is a great idea
i support this idea this is posted with an alt but my main supports it too 
i agree gate guns shouldnt shoot drones because it takes focus off the aggressor
well it stops a lot of dps off of gal ships as i dont see cal missiles get shot down why should drones get killed off  best thing it would only be a little patch to fix it d

used to be that only the portraits showed up of people i bothered to check out usually when they saiddid something interesting that way i could get to know them better as i did not have to focus on 100 other portraits and the new ones look so blandaverage too making it even harder

i like how you didnt actually specify what it was from everything im able to see cap flux coils cuts your cap life by over 3x and greatly increases your susceptibility to neuts furthermore as you say carriers dont tend to fly alone  and thus cap is life cap flux coils give you less of iti would also point out that faction fitting a carrier these days is pretty stupid so its probably for the best you fly wyverns instead of chimeras these daysyes i saw that i pointed it out to my corpmates and we all had a good laugh at your expense here are some comments towards your idea cruiser sized ships capable of meaningfully damaging supercaps will utterly obsolete all normal capitals  and potentially large portions of subcapitals cruiser sized ships incapable of meaninfully damaging normal capitals or other subcapitals will rarely be in position outside of preplanned supercapital ganks they will be eft warrior counters creating supercapital killers that are for all intents and purposes immune to supercapitals is poor balancing requiring a significant number of these ships to down supercapitals is not any better than requiring a significant number of dreads we already require 5 hics to tackle a supercarrier this already doesnt scale  why do you believe that massed t2 torpedo cruisers would scale betteri dont believe thats what would actually happen and frankly creating uber counters in such a way is poor balancing id much rather see capitals  which are easily killed by supercapitals  able to provide a bite back in the form of tackleliang
supported that is the concern yes an orca can only move an assembled battlecruiser at most the ship maintenance bay is too small for a battleship but yes an alt orca sits in the target system with a gank battlecruiser or smaller in the bay a pirate jumps into the system in a pod warps to the orca and access the ship maintenance bay to get into the gankship and then goes and finds a targetit doesnt need to be that weak suppose the interbus ship freighter can move 6 rigged battleships give the interbus freighter enough hitpoints that at least 6 gankfit tech 1 battleships are needed to suicide gank an interbus freighter in 05 space that way if youre moving cheap ships around its not worth it to suicide gank you but if youre moving marauders black ops or faction battleships around then you become a juicy target
ccp the players and the csm dont like massive ehp on the sov structures forcing you to sit and shoot them for forever and a day there is also a desire for some increased use of smallgangproposal on certain sovereignty structures sbu tcu ihub perhaps hp will be drastically nerfed and in return during vulnerability including onlining there will be miniature reinforcement timers randomly 1030 minutes with a timer showing or 510 minutes with a hidden timer they no longer have stupid amounts of ehp change to say 75k on an sbu with 3 minitimers but cant be instaninjapopped by a solo vaga eithersmaller more mobile gangs who can get in shoot and get out will now be possible though not the sole solution supercap dropping will no longer be the optimal way of dealing with these structures for obvious reasons though still possible blobbing wont be quite as favoured either as again its overkillcaps and supercaps will remain ideal for station shooting in addition to pos takedownsthis solution is not be the perfect fix to sov mechanics many of us would still pefer multiple concurrent smaller targets spread across a constellation for example however it could be introduced without a time consuming complete rework of the sovereignty system it should be relatively quick and easy to do codewise and would in my opinion be a good step in the right direction a viable steppingstone
are you ing kidding me thats something that a bot could easily overcome not to mention the pain it would be to non bottersthis is a terrible solution
i think your grossly underestimating the complexity of bot programs im still in favor of adding a recaptcha for the docking of mining barges that way you dont kill afk mining i dont think many miners will be in favor of your idea  of course i dont think miners will be in favor of any changes everill support it for s and giggles though
no to the guy above me it wouldnt be too hard to program the macro bots to keep the thing deadcenter
to the guy above me no duh thats why i said hes underestimating bot programs thats why i would rather recaptcha but that will happen in 50 years i only support for s ive seen worse suggestions
nothis is quite annoying just to think about having to do it then i remembered that i use up to 3 accounts mining at once
hey at least im trying to come up with a solution instead of just complaining about the problem you say that mining is boring and there isnt enough to do 90 of botters use nothing but a simple keystroke recording program that could in no way deal with my suggestion at all it wouldnt solve the problem entirely but it would reduce it quite a bit and for all i know everyone in this thread runs bots and fears something like this screwing things up for themexactly what pain would it be to nonbotters so you would actually have to pay attention to what your doing and stop rubbing one out while you afk mine eves already full of enough asshats that play the game while watching youtube and ing off why even bother playing the game if you arent actually going to participate in playing it

that is reasonable supported
1that is reasonable supported
yes
i like this idea

speaks for itself let it be so
this is an excellent plan
im beginning to doubt your commitment
the csm may want to make ccp aware that we the player base find the wod tech demo sorry eve character creator jolly interesting but we note youve removed all the eve character futuristic tattoos metal bits exotic costume in favour of generic contemporary forgettable mehwell ok its one of ccps famous first iterations no problem but just a marker i think the csm can lay down here noone is going to be the slightest bit impressed when ccp declare all the options we had before this week to be vanity items and start microtrans for themi cant believe your art department hasnt noticed the dramatic artistic shift from the exotic to the austere making us pay again for something that was available as standard last week would not be cool

ccp has already commented about this tattoos and such were left out of this initial release due to time constraints but they claim to be working on them now expect to see them in the summer release

we all know ccp would like to do two big additions to the world of eve but getting to the point of this topic would be changes from idea of one addition from ccp new and other addition maybe from csm for additions purely from common eve player so im asking if ccp would do their own addition and one from csm of purly changes of the game
has anyone really been far even as decided to use even go want to do look more like
their are lots of ideas out their to be looked over and pass on but with ccp working on their own ideas so point of this would be fact of ccp working only to change what common user or member would like to see changed without other on going things
almost forgot to support my idea
this is true however training to do anything in eve is a commitment new players do not have the know how or experience to know what they should or should not do what they should train and what they will like or what they wont like the permanent nature of the system does not allow for exploration or experimentation this rigid nature makes it hard for new players to explore if they were allowed one penalized remap they would be allowed to experience all of the races ships not from a theorycrafting point of view but from real experience and decide what they like and what they dont when i know what they like in the game right now they would just have a new million left over sp in some races ships they do not care to use and in weaponry that their ships wont support getting one remap lets them get to the funner roles in combat that they decided they want to pursue

1sounds pretty much what the other poster intended
said i would support it and i do
dont support live with your mistakes i have mining 5 and the skills for an orca its wasted sp as i have never used either but i live with it
he is speaking about new players those who due to lack of knowing better train all over the place and only later after they have gotten a good grip on the game realize they shouldnt have there is nothing wrong with allowing them a onceandonceonly opportunity to correct that
the problem is that if as you suggest it gets applied to all characters currently in game which is what i am reading youre going to have older characters dumping a metric ton of skill points into the fotmthen they will whine and  when that gets nerfed and those skill points are useless and ask pretty please just one more we swearno were better off never letting that genie out of the bottle there are plenty of resources for newer players if they arent clever enough to look for them or are too lazy to ask in the available channels thats really not our problem
the way i understood it he meant within the first 6 months of a characters life the op will have to clarify it seems reasonable since the context of the post was new players if it is so then current characters older than 6 months would not be getting one i believe this is the case and that i and the op discussed it in another thread already though i cant remember which oneif this is so i do not believe it would be all too problematic and very beneficial towards retaining new playersif it is not so ie skill remaps for everyone then i will retract my support for it
i am not talking about mistakes you need to have knowhow about the game to make mistakes the problem is when new players join eve they make a character knowing nothing about the game mechanics the difference between races ships and weapon systems and nothing about what they want to do in the game the way the system is now if they choose to experiment and fly all the ships available in eve they basically get penalized when they realize that those sp spent exploring are completely worthless most players specialize into a role or race of ships often dualtraining to get pirate ships giving new characters a single use remap at a penalty will give them time to explore the game decide what they want to do and when theyve chosen a role to make their career a refund of those exploratory points to help them get to where they want to bethis is precisely what i intend there is a single oneuse remap at 50 penalty 6 months after the character is born i intend the sp remap for new players only then again if ccp did implement something like this chances are they would give all players a single remap even older characters i suppose it is only fair in this case if some oldtimer is really foolish enough to yank however many million sp out of their skills and apply 50 of those to the fotm shipsdramiels drakes daredevils then they deserve every pain they getfor most people this would be a minor minor boon even for older players for newer players i believe this softens the blow of the learning curve and it would help with player retention which i think is always a good thing
you shot yourself in the foot when you brought up a skill point loss from doing this and to be honest 50 is lets put it this way you should be shot
it only applies to new players not everyone
this law would seem to apply
malcanis please see my answer above it would not help older players in the slightest
so a character that is 6 months old can remap their skill points but will lose 3 months of themi dont support this at all1 it opens the door for you can remap under these conditions so whats wrong with allowing  2 the player can simply spend 3 months training the actual skills they want3 what  of the sp they remap will they realize 6 more months down the road that they put in the wrong skills
within the first 6 months i agree 1 there is a lot to learn for new players and mistakes can be made when dealing with the learning curve after 6 months you live with your mistakes
not sure what ccp was going for here but now it is not only impossible to freeze the overview with ctrl but now its also impossible to take neutrals off the overview entirely you ccpi havent found anyone who thinks that this makes any sense let alone that its an improvement over the old system are you guys trying to remove small scale pvp entirelyi want my old overview back immediately
from the new character creator update insider blog as reported by ccp caedmoni dont know how often they mean to give people the freedom to mess with their hair but at least some repeatable customization is planned
since bloodlines no longer hold any sway on anything other than looks with the new character maker shouldnt we be given the option to change our bloodline so we can pick the look we want for our characters rather than be stuck with a choice we made based on an old system
i dont want to look like lucy liu
yeahbut theres a 6 page thread about this same thing about 57 threads down
ohshi youre rightheres the link
this would be a workable solution if you could mine several different resources at the same time from the same extractor with each head mining a different resource the graphic could would show total units extracted with a heavier line between layers of different mineralsas it is you have to move heads run program a wait 24 hours move the heads around and run program b  back to the ol clickfest
there are also loads of bugs  resource depletion rates are ridiculous meaning moving and rebuilding colonies every 315 days extractors dont route properlynothing substantive in pi has been fixedadded although it is supposed to be high prioritycould you please give someone a nudge and find out why 1 they didnt respond to any of the considered feedback on the test server2 havent responded since the patch3 have not committed to excellence with this release of pi it is very buggythe most annoying thing was lots of people got on the the test server weeks before  and tested it  and just had their comments ignored the lack of informationfeedback is really rude and frustratingthey were also warned days before of the mac patch problems and weeks before of the ss2 patch problems on the test server  but just ignored those reports too
not really how often did you interact with it before every 96 hours so you set it up on one resource for 4 days then you set it up with the other resource for 4 days its the same clickfest it was before however now you have the option of setting it up for weeks on 1 resource then setting it up for weeks on another and while that means you wont be producing much for the first week once youre set up you are golden and you have wiggle room in case you are late and miss a day honestly dont turn pi into moon mining a set up and go and forget about it thing till its time to extract your money theres hardly any interaction in that at all and it makes the whole thing boringeditthe biggest issue is mostly that the numbers they show you arent 100 accurate
at the very least dt should not be altering the state of the game the reduction of a poss shield by 50 due to downtime is simply unacceptablethe best fix i can come up with is to make the pos shield unaffected by a pulsarthe base intention of the starbase shield is to give defenders a reasonable time to respond to attackers and as attackers get no damage bonus from a pulsar i consider it balancedit does make the starbase less effective at destroying players but thats the intended mechanic of the pulsar in generaleditin addition to this i think the pos bubble shield should be unaffected by damage increases the wormhole might offer the players i recall one giving a damage bonus to projectile weapons or some suchi see no reason to extend any exceptions in the wormhole mechanics to starbase structures just the pos bubble shield
so your saying that there should be no ugly capsuleers i completely agree just like there are no ugly people in real life right i mean what are they thinking putting ugly people in a game that is supposed to be realisticyou cant honestly be serious about this remember what one person thinks looks good another person might not im pretty sure from the confidence of your post that you think your own avatar is pretty good looking right well i for one dont think so but that is all a matter of opinion so no no there should not be any verification of avatars
you gott to be jokingyou cant say that eve gott to be a game of only sexy hott gode lokking avatarswhat if i whant to lokke like a slimy pthats my call
lol
i was thinking of it in relation to the walking in stations thing when it gets releaseddont know how many of you would want to run into some of the avatars i have seen pics ofbut seeing as most if not all of those bothering to respond to thread obviously wouldnt mind bumping into a couple of very odd looking darkhoodied ppl and still buy them drinks well  wonder if theres light on the other side 
unless im wrong im guessing you are referring to some amarr characters all i can say is the old editor allowed that and tbh from what i have seen under the hood we are lucky we cant see the face

ever heard of data centres you trade tags for standings so basically a bribe

no
old one was awesome current one just sux
the only thing i dont like about the character creation process is the limiting of hair styles clothing etc what if i want to rp a caldari hippy exile it just doesnt make sense to limit those things the other thing i dont like is the age restriction as amarramarr i can only be old which doesnt make any sense i understand each race has its own backstory and ideals but they shouldnt be imposed on everyone
supported because this issue needs fixing but i dont think bloodline changes are the answeri think ccp just needs to add more content over time such as more varied hair styles and clothing like they probably already have plans to dohowever what they may not be planning to do is increase the amount of variety within bloodlines i dont think it would be a bad thing if it was possible to create 2 characters of the same race different bloodlines and make them look completely identical now i dont mean open up all options to all bloodlines but a bit more overlap would allow people more options when theyre being creative
suported i have this exact problem

theres nothing you can do to keep someone from running unless they want to in the first place a harb is going to have to get in point range anyway if he wants to engage at which point you can use your greater speed to close the gasp extra 10 km to get him i know that must be hard for someone like you but im sure your delicate self can get over there by the time he realizes he cant hit you without going into scram range this is getting old you keep trying to come up with more and more obscure scenarios to prove a point which you have to realize by now you cant make anything can beat anything in the exact right circumstance if your biggest complaint is that he can warp away then you obviously dont understand pvp enough to keep arguing about thishow about greater ranged weapons how about more utility slots to use neuts how about greater dps gallente boats have to be able to catch minnie ships because they have the worst range in the game the only other option is to use rails and those have  tracking and  dps compared to acs so you get kited by a ship that has to sacrifice nothing for its speed and can still hit farther than you how do you not see that is wrong and this isnt just about the myrm vs hurricane its all the ships if you want a more blatant example take the thorax vs the rupturetoo bad the range difference is such that if a cane fits a td and a webscram he can still dictate range he can still outrange your guns and you cannot hold him there even if you do catch him also tds do nothing against drakesthis is the funniest part in your whole argument i mean i have to admire your balls for putting it in here as it clearly shows youre either totally ignorant or just trolling me anyone with eft can see that the bcs for each race have the same speed as their tier1 counterpart and are affected by mass changes in exactly the same way so whatever you say about the speed of the brutix compared to a cane has nothing to do with tiers as the myrm will have exactly the same stats even better a simple check reveals that the shield cane is a full 200ms faster than the shield brutix i have to wonder if you just didnt bother to check or if you actually expected a brutix to fit 2 nanos and a cane to fit none either way it is profoundly wrongif you actually flew gallente ships then you would know where im coming from but judging by some of your responses i have to wonder if you pvp at all
so you are basically saying that he has about a minute until your cane has moved into range do you even realize how easy it is to just align out and warp as soon as you reveal your tdif your thorax cant outdamage a rupture it is a horrible failfithahaha you fail the myrm can choose between dual tds or dual webs good luck with range dictation chiefi bolded the important part everyone with eft and a little common sense should know ships are not fitted equally the cookie cutter shield brutix fits a speedmod by default only the idiots fit a rcu and neutronsthe cookie cutter shield cane on the other hand fits no speed mods if he does he does not only trade a huge chunk of his damagerange but more importantly fit for the specific purpose to kite you betternot that i expect someone that lives as a drone in the safety of the blob to even understand the finer points here
besides the fact that you make seemingly unfounded jusdgement calls on other peoples character i think you might have gotten your battlecruisers mixed up when it comes to the myrmi and the brutix the myrmi is by far the superior of the two vessels just like the cyclone is the lesser when compared to the cane aside from pirates gate camping lowsec how often do you really see either used for pvp in low and null not often would be my guess and i can say honestly ive almost never seen them just because it has a tech ii variant or two does not mean it is a tier 2 shipa tech ii variant of the cane or myrmi would really be something to see either would put the tech ii brutix or cyclone to shame especially as the tech i versions are nearly a match for those obviously a superior fit command vessel will win but it does have superior statsyou seem to be very vocal in opposition to this thread which has me wondering about your intentions and motives your obvious dislike and disregard for the op might be clouding your judgement somewhat it is very obvious to anyone that has flown gallente for any time or worked with those who have that the gallente ships are lacking in many respects and suffer in pvp its not a big difference ill agree so little in fact you have a hard time picking it up in eft when you see them out on the battlefield however or fly them there you will soon come to the conclusion that they are less than a match when compared to other faction vessels i have not done so much of either and in fact traded gallente for caldari early on ive always found hybrid platforms to be sketchy at best barely sufficient for the task whatever it may be
not everyone lands 3040km off when they land and start pvping in fact most gang pvp in low sec happens at gates and again this is hardly relevant since if he warps off he knows he cant win hence understating the fact that the ship is effectivenice job avoiding what i said about the cane having utility slots and everything else also try fighting a ruppy with a thorax see how far you get through his buffer before you popsorry youre the only one failing here if the myrm goes dual tds he still doesnt have enough slots to hold the cane in place if he goes dual webs he cant keep the cane from kiting him not to mention the neuts on the caneexcept that brutix pilots know they cant match the tank of anything so they have to fit at least 2 or 3 damage mods or they wont be able to outdps anything combined with being slow having much less tank and having still terrible range also the vast majority of shield canes ive seen have had some sort of speed mod fitted we can keep doing this all day but frankly its just getting ridiculous with you trying to find all these scenarios where minmatar ships are actually terrible at pvp and only their op speed keeps them alive atm i think most of eve would disagree with you
keep in mind what i said about fittings on the thorax the only reason it doesnt have adequate buffer in armor fit is its fitting restrictions in shield fittings its actually an equal buffer and a huge damage advantage for the thoraxbut there is more than just brute damage to this matchup the flight of ec600s you can bring on the thorax have a 50 chance to get a jam on the rupture and with the recallattack trick they cycle roughly every 5 seconds thats quite a bit better than the 30 chance a ecm loadout on the rupture can achievepretty much everyone that ever soloed in a cruiser knows what a huge advantage a 50mUFFFD dronebay is for this reasona single td forces your armor cane into scram range or off the field the buffer myrm is also 100 capindependant neuts are useless and it has better damage projection inside engagement range even given both are tdedboth cane and brutix dc triple magstab and overdrive in case you dont know how its fit share the exact same tank in a shield configuration and before you jump to conclusions rf emp is exactly as good as cn antimatter against itshield canes pretty much always fit neuts if not they are fail the standard lows that a decent pilot has are dc triple gyro and dual tesure the hurricane can sacrifice damage and range for kiting ability but seriously you dont see a competent hurricane pilot flying these fits simply because it does sacrifice the main strength of the shield fit for a dubious advantage a single frigate tackler is gonna nullifyon a side note a brutix pilot should know its a terrible idea to fit an active rep zero buffer and no cap injector on a ship that relies on cap for everything it does if he does i dont think he is a good authority on fittings and pvp in general tbh
a brutix pilot knows that he cant fit buffer because hes way too slow to apply dps to anyone he also knows that he cant shield tank it and still apply dps because he needs a web and a td to get in range plus his mwd he cant go gank with a cap injector because of fitting issues and the range of electrons and the single rep is simply to keep him alive from drones once he gets under a bss guns a third magstab would add a paltry amount of dps and buffer defeats the purpose of speed if you want to try and make it sound like i failfit my brutixes go ahead im quite happy with my setup and ive got the kb to prove it and by the way no one i know who flies brutixes even shield ones fits an od on it because youre still slow and it takes away slots that can be used for range modsas for the cane considering half or more of the myrms dps is in drones even if the myrm is able to control range which it cant unless its pilot error half its dps can be blown away in a few seconds the neuts may not kill the guns but theyll kill the tackle the mwd and any ewar once it gets down far enough it also outdpss the myrm by a lot and the whole point of the armor cane is to fight in scram range why the hell would he want to be out of it and finally a cane doesnt have to sacrifice anything for kiting ability it can kite everything as it is unless you went armor and youre fighting a shield shipagain you cant get away from the fact that hybrid platforms need to be faster if theyre going to keep the same range as they have now otherwise theyll continue to be the redheaded step children of pvp
i agree that something needs to be done with gallente ships i too agree with another poster that the lach and arazu both need damp boosts its ridiculous that you have to use a ton of damps on a ship just to keep safe never mind the fact that if they even have one range booster all the damps in the world wont help you if its a cruiser or larger ship
it would be nice to fly my own races ships with hybrids and an armor tank and not have to worry about being constantly out gunned

that rupture doesnt fit a full rack of cruiser sized mods either your thorax would fit just fine if you dropped two guns down to light neutrons

i always wondered why this wasnt possible
youre quick to make claims about trolling regarding comments that are worded carefully and with some thought arent you yet you quite obviously misinterpret and manipulate others words to suit your argument while trashing somebody elses and making statements about their ignorance and knowledge of the subject in questioni think we can disregard anything you have to say given the gross distortion of facts i wonder what greyscale would say i would assume he wouldnt be particularly happy about how you twist his words based on what little representation he has in the meeting minutes ive read some of them and scanned others and i know what he didnt say
i havent distorted a single fact let alone greyscales own words which are perfectly clear on the subject if you actually believed id distorted anything you could quote it instead you just went straight to an ad hom fallacy trolling i pointed out that my experience of how hourslong fleets work especially wrt the nc which you keep freaking about is relevant ive asked you to show anything that backs up your claims as your posting on an alt troll account with no kills and you still havent given any proof at all trolling pointing out that youre an alt troll with no fleet experience or facts is relevant to whether or not you have facts or experience of how fleets work experience and knowledge is hardly an attack on your character instead of your understanding and factual support you like the color blue therefore your argument is wrong is an ad hom fallacy you dont understand what youre talking about and you have no facts to back up your claims is not lying and trolling i have pointed out that actual numbers in terms of minutesjumps saved i have pointed out that i have hundreds of hours of experience with the fleets and the jump bridge network that youre freaking out about trolling i have made numerous points as part of my argument from why altering game mechanics to curtail playercreated political content is a dangerous precedent to the fact that there were massive coalitions before jbs and there will be after them to the fact that force projection requires only dedication not bridges and so on you keep feigning ignorance and trolling on each point like trolling you were lying and trolling and claimed that id said that jbs are insignificant so i shouldnt mind if theyre changed i pointed out that even if they really were insignificant to game play that its perfectly rational to oppose stupid things that have no impact on game play like letting 5 year olds design our ship models you immediately started trolling and have kept up claiming that a direct response to your own point is somehow off topic trolling see above about your feigned objection to personal insults you were also trolling earlier when you claimed that i was engaging in hypocrisy as well i pointed out that i had experience of how things work to back up my claims and you didnt have any facts or any experience to back up yours you claimed that was hypocritical and pointing out that you had no facts and no experience to substantiate your claims was an ad hominem fallacy trolling and lying thats the tangent that brought up your trolling of the five year olds shouldnt design our ships either rebuttal to say nothing of your trolling on that point as ive already listed other reasons why breaking sandbox play is the wrong thing to do even if it was an insignificant change that was implemented in order to break sandbox play trolling and lying ccp never claimed that the bridges arent working as intended they have never claimed that theyre an exploit bridges were designed to let any blues with the password jump thats exactly what they do theyre functioning as intended the issue that youre deliberately ignoring is that greyscale wants to alter game mechanics to hurt playercreated content that he doesnt like
this is simply fiction or are you going to claim that fragment is totally different from break up
so what you are saying is that large coalitions wouldnt exist without all the insentives ccp gives them to nap up
rafia i realized you were an alt i didnt realize just how much thats it less than 48 hours old so yeah identify what you actually know about fleet combat and what facts if any you have to support your position and do it with your main
no offence finnagain but for someone who puts so much emphasis on stats and pvp knowledge you seem to have very little of either
no seriously minigin ive had enough of your trolling and im not going to feed you anymore only an idiot reading along would believe that someone with a 48 hour character had pvp experience or someone whos spent hundreds of hours in nc fleets doesnt know how nc fleets operate if you want to troll for the idiots thats your deal but youll have to troll on your own hell anybody whos not an idiot who clicks on the link you inexplicably provided will know that youre trolling and lying about my experience too no matter how you troll people will always be free to play eve the way they want to its player created content and not minigindictated content its also not greyscale created content which is why stupidly nerfing or eliminating jbs still wont change the fact that people will play the way they want to not the way anybody else tells them todeal with it go away until you stop trolling im more than willing to have an honest discussion with you in this forum if youe capable of being honest and stopping trolling and seriously stop with your ing creepy invitations to your ts server but you obviously only want to troll stop trolling and discuss issues honestly or at least go troll someone else

even if this was a terrible idea i would support it out of trolling potentialgood thing i like the ideasupported
well this threads well and truly killedlooks like someone made the mistake of correlating a proposed mechanics change with nerfing the nc cue trollagain zero northern coalition forum defender extraordinaire
yeah thatd be greyscale who wants the change to hurt all coalitions troll of course pointing that out becomes defending the nc does it even occur to you while trolling just how absurd it is to assume that people playing a sandbox game and cooperating with who they choose needs to be defended for playing the game how they want to as youre trolling ill also point out that it was our 48 hour old alttroll who decided that it was about the nc i pointed out that the proposed changes fail on merit utility and design philosphy troll harderoh and tertiacero thank you for trolling too obviously you are correct and someone playing eve for 48 hours would have a solid understanding of nullsec mechanics yes
all ccp were saying is that change is proposed without any solution being ruled out so do any and all possible changes fail in all respects status quo onlyalso please use the word troll at least another half dozen times per post its good reading
no thats fiction again what was actually said was that jbs being removed from the game was the proposal and it might actually be put through within the next three months and again after youve just been corrected why make the same error again its not about no solution being ruled out its about finding a way through game mechanics to try to stop playercreated political content and force it to be created in a model that greyscale wants the funny thing is that the trolls dont even seem to understand that while theyre supporting it because they see it as a way to hurt specific coalitions that they dont like that it sets a precedent that can easily be used against them later thats the problem with changes to mechanics informed by wanting to  over politics thats the whole point of integrity you dont have to worry if the next change thats designed to hurt someones ingame political alliances is going to be targeted at you or not if you dont have any changes designed to hurt anybodys ingame political alliances supporting a change designed to stop playercreated content because you think youll get an advantage simply leaves you vulnerable if caprice or chance leaves you on the chopping block next if the next change is to ban all roleplaying alliances because people taking the fiction seriously makes eve look nutty youll have nothing to complain about and if roleplayers are banned for roleplaying maybe youll be lucky enough to have someone troll you with status quo onlysee this is just obvious trolling i wish folks would stop ive pointed out that the precedent is a dangerous one that should be avoided ive pointed out that getting rid of jbs wont actually have the desired effect as there were massive coalitions before there ever were jbs ive pointed out that fleets can and do project force without jbs and the time savings for jbs even on the longest routes are insignificant compared to the massive battles that theyre sometimes used to get people to ive pointed out that massive invasions can be and are carried out without any significant jb use at all as alliances set up forward staging hqs and that even defending coalitions with a full jb network can still be beaten on their home turf and your response to that is well so nothing at all should ever change right does that even make sense to you and yes the fact that youre trolling and other people are trolling thats good comedy lowell and such but how about you identify anything but trolling that gets you from these are all the reasons why this specific change and the reasons its been suggested is a bad idea to okay so nothing in eve should ever change ever not ever
finn any and all game mechanic changes invariably affect someones sandbox by that line any change would be impossible as long as someone opposes it thats not how things work man
oh quoting is itccp are only looking at complete removal as one possible solution this thread has had moved on to the point where it was discussed as only one possible solution since then youve come along shouting down everything with hurf blurf about how wrong it would be to remove jbs entirely over and overplease allow discussion to continue instead of redundantly whiteknighting about one possible idea which might make things difficult for you and your friends
yet again nothere would be a series of objections to removing jbs based on mechanics if it was only a mechanics change but since its a change specifically to try to stop stop nonccp approved player created content so thats another factor against it and again its a very dangerous precedent and the people supporting it now will have nothing to fall back on if next round of changes ccp decides that they dont like how someone is playing the eve political game and they try to stop them the only difference between this change designed to stop playercreated content and having devs get into jove ships and drop on alliances they dont like is that this is a bit less overt its a difference in scale not in kind and anybody who values their ability to play eve as a sandbox should be very wary of changes designed to limit that for political reasons yes even if they stand to benefit from this specific round of changes during the actual discussion they noted that the option of removing jbs wont be discarded by the writeup however the minutes clearly state that not only is it simply another option to consider but that it might be implemented within the next 3 months and notice the thread title this is a thread to show the csm whether or not the playerbase supports removing jbs and how we want the csm to react to such plans if you want to discuss how youd like jbs to be changed we have the features and ideas forumyet again its other people who made this about the nc not me ive already pointed out that it wont make things particularly difficult to any great extent ive also pointed out that since this is a change designed to stop playercreated content and force it to adhere to ccpapproved content that the precedent can then be applied to anybody for any reason you see it as a change that only effects certain alliances who youre not a part of but the fact is that im arguing that we should be protecting your interests and your friends and their friends and every friend in eve since once ccp decides to start altering 00 playercreated politics the only guarantee is that the players will only be allowed to play a sandbox game and form pacts if ccp okays it yes even the trolls who see this solely as a way to hurt coalitions they dont like still deserve to be protected from ccp deciding that they dont like the playercreated content that theyre creating and then trying to stop them by changing how the game itself works and thats bad for everybody
well guess what that is the downside of blueing  most alliances have some hostility to neighbouring allies and wont be affected by this if you are blue to everything in 30 jumps atm then you may as well return to empireccp and the csm have agreed that the reason for the decision was to encourage neighbouring warfare right now it is nc drf it and whatever the south is thats not what ccp wanted 00 to be likeburn jump bridges nerf supercaps and buff dreads maybe then people will actually move out of empire to 00there is a reason why 00 isnt popular and it because the current mechanics and hand holding makes it pointless to do anything there unless you are a pet or in providence
no thats the downside that ccp wants to create the largest invasion in eves history just went on a few months ago and it was in the east all the way from the north one poster ironically argued that it was the hardest to reach area in the entire gametoo bad then that ccp arent creating the content and its a sandbox where the whole selling point is that 00 is all about playercreated content eh again just because you dont like the content that other players create does not mean its valid for ccp to tell them youre sandboxing wrong and again while youre willing to support this change because it might hurt your political opponents in eve that simply leaves you vulnerable and sets a precedent and if the next change is designed to hurt how you play the game because that type of playercreated content is now objectionable you dont have a leg to stand on funny pandemic had excellent success with their subcap fleets time and time again against a vastly numerically superior opponent during november and much of december its a good thing that they didnt listen to talk about how impotent and powerless they were and how impossible it was to accomplish things in eve and instead actually set about accomplishing  argue for how impossible it is for you to accomplish something and gee it turns out to be true go figure
from the ancient history of a few pages backso stop trolling and actually contribute to the thread please if you have any plans of contributing that is
mother of godedit try tell me that these changes wont increase the instances of pvp in 00 go on tell mealso im sorry i never realised that someone ranked 20k in eve could have valid opinions about 00 from what you were sayingthe biggest flaw in your argument is that none of it is real how can i see this through the blatant contradictions constantly cropping up for example you say that these proposed changes are specifically aimed at hurting coalitions yet you then go on to say that these changes wont change anything for coalitions have you even decided which is true you then display a blatant lack of understanding of day to day gameplay deciding unilatteraly that jumpbridges are easy to attack and camp the reverse is true its far too easy to defend these structures and the best part is you dont really need to if one is reinforced you go out there kill it and reanchor another for 9m isk camping jumpbridge poses is risky and unprofitable disabling them is the same just take it like a man drawing this out is not going to win you more support its just going to lose you any credibility you may have still had
some examples regarding numbers of jumps compared to jump bridge network1woks vale of the silent  bdbyq in cloud ringusing shortest route through empire 29 jumpsusing nc jump bridge system 19 jumpsgoing through nc alliance space via normal gates 45 jumpsso basically its quicker to take the jumpbridge network then go straight through empire and high secand 45 jumps vs 19 jumps through the same area dont come here and say that cutting away 26 jumps more then half the number of jumps isnt wrongsource nc jumpbridge network mapjump bridges are r e t a r d e d
massive dragon are you completely stupid are you it is very very clear that finnagain zero has an absolutely exemplary pvp career with 1667 kills and 70 losses this quite vast and obvious career which has been spent in 00 is being trolled by an ignorant idiot posting with an alt with absoloutely no history of pvpmassive dragon you really do need to stop trolling you are absolutely clueless
you just want to hurt large coalitions rabble rabble you are clearly jealous of how good they are and how bad you are maybe you should learn to play the game instead of crying about it
so in reality its a savings of ten jumps roughly a whole 10 minutes maybe 15 maybe pilots even need to fly a shuttle through empire if their sec status is too low and have an altbuddy move a ship to a lowsec staging area for them near the end of that dreadful 29 jump deployment definitely game breaking see thats the problem hes obviously very passionate about the issues and hed obviously like to discuss them but i cant seem to get him to discuss the issue honestly i point out that a 48 hour old char with no pvp experience cant speak as an authority about pvp he claims that since i have fewer kills than him my experience and knowledge from hundreds of hours of deployment relating to the coalition and jb network many people are specifically complaining about is invalid i point out that according to the summit minutes themselves removing jbs is designed to hurt coalitions but i argue for why the actual impact would be negligible contrary to intents he claims that intents that arent born out by results is a contradiction in my reasoning not a flaw in the proposal and so on id love to have him actually support his position honestly since for an issue as important as whether or not ccp should internationally alter game mechanics to control playercreated content someone as passionate as he is about the issue would make for a rousing discussion instead he wont stop trolling i dont get it
facepalmjpg
jump bridges are working as intended i am not keen with the idea that ccp may want to intervene and dictate to the players how to play their sandbox just because they dont like it
if its not such a big deal what does it matter so much to you if it goesits clear that the only thing you really want is for things to be as easy as possible for you trying to paint this any other way is just sad
i like how people think roaming in 00 space will make things easier if jbs are removedlook at the facts95 of 00 residents are complete pants on head ed theres no word to describe how bad they are because they have everything handed to them doesnt really need to think for them selves and being a bad isnt that harsh on you tooif you start making  harder for them then they might stop being so ed as theyll have to start thinking for them selvesso from that perspective keep jbs id rather fight a  tonne of idiot bads and pawn rather than a bunch of goods
lmao what does this have to do with the actual argument one could also argue that his alliance is good at exploiting the whole jbcyno thing in order to hotdrop small fleets with their blob and removing this system would obviously hurt them even though it might benefit the majority of players thus he has a strong incentive to be against such changes  this however has also nothing in common with the actual argument casue one could make up tons of such meaningless arguments
while i appreciate that you think you know what ccps intentions are i have a perfectly good set of ccp released notes that tells me this is not the casethe fact that you then believe this is a sandbox issue is somewhat frightening i want you to think carefully about this next qa was eve a sandbox game before jumpbridges was it a sandbox game after jumpbridges will it be a sandbox game after jumpbridges are removedin light of this i suggest you go look up what a sandbox game isnb a sandbox game does not mean i get to fit 9 turrets on my apoc because i feel like it
the point was that someone posting with a 48 hour old alt and no pvp history was making claims about pvp but refused to provide any facts to back it up i pointed that out minigin then decided to troll me by playing dumb unfortunately the way he often trolls for some reason and pretended that if someone with absolutely no pvp experience at all doesnt have an informed opinion then someone with hundreds of hours dealing with the specific coalition and the specific jb network that several posters have complained about also doesnt have an informed opinion or look at his argument above its pointed out yet again that as per ccps own official minuts the goal of the changes is to hurt coalitions and force them to tear themselves apart that changing gameplay mechanics to stop playercreated content is a violation of the sandbox is obvious instead mini pretends that the issue is simply jbs existing or being removed and that anybody has claimed that their simple existence rather than removing them with the explicit statement that its to stop sandbox play makes the game a sandbox or that fitting guns on a drake is the same thing as deliberately changing game mechanics explicitly to harm playercreated content that you dont like he knows its not true and makes no sense its obvious that he knows its not true and it makes no sense but hes trolling its a shame as he obviously feels very very strongly about it and an honest discussion with such a person would be a good thingi have no idea how to get him to stop trolling ive tried
this thread tldrbawwwww remove jbsbawwwww dont remove jbs
you really dont get it do youyou are reducing the numbers of jumps with 10 despite you are moving around empire in a space that would have taken 45 jumps if you went through normal gatesill draw up another example where going through empire is not an option and where leaving nc space would gain nothing if you travelled through normal gatesrg9  bdbyq normal gates 26 jumpsrg9  bdbyq jump bridge  13 jumpsrg9  umi normal gates  26 jumpsrg9  umi jump bridge  13 jumpsq3bay  ipay normal gates  17 jumpsq3bay  ipay jump bridge  5 jumpsneed more examples
sit down on ts with me you can record it if you like
irrelevant and obfuscatory empire gates are normal gates all youve described is two potential routes perhaps one with a totally unimportant bit of additional effort for someone with low sec status and one route is 10 jumps longer than the other and allows dictor bubbles bomber runs hot dropsits rather obvious that youre trying to claim that people would have to move entirely through nullsec even though that makes absolutely no sense at all simply because that gives you a larger number to point to well  getting from mo to hed using only 00 would be pretty long too thats why people can take the shortest route the devil you say roughly 15 minutes saved in each case obviously game breaking edit minigin again your ubercreepy proposal that i chat with you on teamspeak is a silly troll were here in this forum talking now that you refuse to stop trolling unless we leave this forum makes no sense stop trolling and well discuss the issue where were already talking again were talking here now in this forum just honestly discuss the issue here rather than demanding to go to a different forum entirely tangent i hope that people will stop trolling about how this isnt about the nc since weve had what a dozen posters now explicitly make this about the nc and nc jump bridgestangent
this is the problem with your argumentif you could fit 9 turrets on an apoc then this would need addressing since an apoc has 8 turret slots i cant fit 9 turrets to my apoc because it only has 8 slots i can however use this apoc with 8 slots to do pretty much whatever i choose tojump bridges are being used for whatever use people see fit for them now if jump bridges were being used to jump a titan to jita then this would need addressing people cant to my knowledge use jump bridges to jump titans to jita 44 because they feel like it there is no problem with jump bridges to my knowledge they are working as they were intended to be
and if they change apocs to only have 7 turretsand finn there is a big difference in 15 jumps or so especially if youre not required to go anywhere more dangerous than a friendly deathstar pos the entire time
not having 9 gun apocs or not having jumpbridges does not change this game from being a sandboxand that is the problem your knowledge is incomplete and at a different standard to other people ccp has said that it is not working as intended and that it is too easy this is like having the discussion about the time they added stacking penalities to damage mods sure rolling around in a maxed heat sink geddon was fun sure it was your free choice to do this it was however imballanced and not working as intended thus it was nerfed and no one complainedthis is really a very similar situation you can cry till your heart is content that it is working as intended but it is not it is working how you want it to work not as it was intended and certainly not in a manner which is providing the most ballance and funi think you should be applauding ccp that they are finaly encouraging more pvp in this game rather than taking away more and more consequences of pvp
thank you for stopping trolling i appreciate it you are however wrong bomber gangs can and do absolutely annihilate fleets using jb networks especially with something as simple as a cloaky dictor and scouts to say nothing of hotdrops on jbs that have seen some truly massive kills over the yearsthe idea that jbs on deathstar poss are somehow hard to attack is simply false but as with all things in eve if you argue for how impossible it is you wont be able to do it best not to get in the way of those who are out doing it though yep thats honest truth thats being trolled on jump bridges were designed to let anybody whos blue and has a password jump to where theyre connected to jbs do that theyre working as intended there arent any exploits with jbs or unintended functionality thats showing that theyre not working as intended even if ccp decided that apocs get 9 high slots and 9 turret hardpoints and patched that into the game that would then mean that now apocs were supposed to have 9 turret slots and were working as intended the proposed change to jbs is more like saying that 8 gun artiepocs are cheap and can put out roughly 115k alpha for suicide ganking so you can still fit 8 guns but if you use your artiepoc to gank stuff in empire youre at risk of a ban edit i see that minigin is still trolling that having or not having jbs makes it a sandbox and not removing them in order to hurt a specific type of playercreated political content maybe youll have better luck to get him to stop trolling
that is the most ed analogy i have ever heardits more like ccp changing the apocs so they only have 7 turret slots and then you crying about it for 13 pages straight
i guess if ccp decided to remove jumpbridges from the game and patched that in it would be a mistake because they wouldnt have intended for that changehow do you exist seriously
your knowledge is incomplete and at a different standard to other people
yeah i dont get it minigin isnt stupid i dont know why he pretends to be in order to trollhe knows that altering game mechanics in order to hurt playercreated political content is a sandbox issue he knows that jbs were designed to move blues with the right password and theyre doing exactly that he knows that if ccp patches something or removes a function then it changes and thats its new intended function hes not confused about any of this but he compares changing the intended function of something in eve with altering gameplay mechanics with the deliberate aim of hurting certain sandbox play its a shame i really do wish hed stop trolling hes obviously got a lot of passion and a very strong point of view and trolling is no help to anybody
what you are not taking into account are all the other bits and peices in the bigger picture if someone needs to log while on a roam or are left behind for some reason there is a big difference in travelling 13 jumps where 90 of them are on jump bridges with a deathstar attached to it and going through 26 normal gates where every gate can potentially have a small gang waiting for him logistics a scouted freighter will think twice before he jumps into a local with only 1 hostile in it when that jump is done on a pos with deathstar the risk is greatly reduced reinforcements when you are fighting and you get reinforcements within 1015 minutes instead of 2530 minutes that usually has an impact also when people looses a shipor get podded and end up in whatever system he had his clone in the chance of him coming back with a ship alone unscouted through 26 gates isnt very high but through a jumpbridge network that also cuts the jumps in half we are talking great success powerprojection moving about when its possible for people to move up 3x the distance in the same amount of time the area you are able to controllhabitate greatly increases when you also add that any hostility can be met with a great deal of numbers cause of jump bridges it doesnt excactly make it harder for you to controll the space without jumpbridges those reinforcements would have needed to go through normal gates and possible be cought up fighting another small gang in their region other would maybe be ganked on a gate casue they travelled alone without scout
you i like a lotthe mins do actually discuss in part what you are talking about any jb nerf would obviously be accompanied by a whole host of changes to the way capships jumped and how titan bridges worked as well as most likely the introduction of new 00 entry points so that it isnt living hell to try move things in and out of empireas i see it these changes are not so much about hurting coalitions as they are about giving 00 more pvpby default obviously this will make it harder for coalitions but this does not make it hard they were fine before jumpbridges and they will be fine after the fact that there will be more pvp should benefit all people not just people not in coalitions whether it be defence or offence it is all more content i think the problem with coalitions is that they tend to attract people who want easy mode and to never lose any fear about these changes stems from fear of losing more because it isnt as easy to nonstop win  easy mode everything
every deathstar pos can equally have a gang on it waiting to gank returning stragglers youve drawn a distinction without a differnce a red in local in a jb system especially if youre jumping a juicy target in like a freighter is a very good indication of a potential hotdrop honestly pl has been carrying off this tactic highly successfully for quite some time now again argue strongly enough for your inability to do something and sure enough youre proven right but dont interrupt the people who are showing that theyre able to do it except its not 1015 versus 2530 its rallying a reinforcement fleet making sure composition is correct fcing it to the destination and coordinating it with the other fcs already on the field its an added 1015 minutes to the rally time and youre also carefully constructing your example to use the longest routes if you save 4 or 6 jumps thats also hardly a game changer in most battles your other point is also wrong as noted several times jbs can be and are camped especially if the enemy is halfway decent and wants to interdict your ability to move reinforcements to the front lines many many many times over the years ive seen jb networks campedin order to stop the flow of reinforcements along them youre also wrong in that theres generally no need for someone to travel alone and unscouted thats why players can cooperate with each other and form reinforcement fleets to caravan over rather than trickling in one by one to a battle in progress disproven by the actual course of eve again one of the largest invasions in the history of eve just carried out against the drone regions was done largely by setting up forward staging zones well beyond jb networks groups can project power just fine without jbs just as they did before jbs were put into the game additionally having a jb network is a benefit that defenders are supposed to have but hardly one thats insurmountable in the above referenced drone invasion for example despite having an entire coalition and a jb network of their own many strategic systems were lost including the gateways from vale of the silent and the forge in point of fact cvas jb network was part of what made hunting there so much fun and a large part of what made pvping in provi during cvas reign so much fun for almost everybody who went there to hunt jbs made pvp better you are overexaggerating the impact of jbs to make your point
the only person in this thread yet to address the issues is you ive even opened my ts for you to come on and make it clear that you know what the issues are and you have rejected this
minigin your trolling is creepy and obvious anything you can say over ts you can say here in a thread that youre already posting in while refusing to participate honestly and trolling instead youve already been caught lying by saying that i hadnt addressed the issues to say nothing of the obviousness of your new lie as several people have made the same exactly arguments i have so its physically impossible for me to be the only one whos done something and again you are pretending to be stupid to troll you know its not trueagain youre not a stupid person you know that theres no actual connection to someone not wanting to agree to your creepy offer to go talk to you on ts and their argument being wrong you know that theres no actual reason why someone has to agree to your creepy offer to talk to you on your ts since you are already posting in this thread right here and right now while demanding to go have the conversation were having here somewhere elseyoure just pretending to be stupid in order to trollnow stop it and stop trolling and stop pretending to be stupid in order to annoy people and post honestly in this threadyoure already posting here youre not stupid although why you pretend to be is beyond me you obviously care very deeply about this issue and want to talk about it but you refuse to nottroll anywhere but your own tswhy is this so hard just post here and dont troll its hardly brain surgery ill most likely just go back to not responding to you until you stop trolling no skin of my nose but you seem really really invested in challenging my arguments but bizarrely refuse to actually do so in this thread ive been asking you to honestly discuss the issue for some time now go for it seriously im more than willing to agree to a truce if you just stop trolling why is that so hard for you
there is a number of reasons i prefer ts1 its far easier to explain things due to the live nature2 it provides you with a faster means of discussion3 it is more efficent  the explanations are more pointed4 should one of us not be taking it seriously its easier to telladdressts53gameserverscom9151also im not sure why it would be more creepy than hopping on any other voice coms for the first time unless of course rzr doesnt do that sort of thing
then stop posting to this thread if you dont want to talk about something in text asynchronously i do so im posting here or if you do want to post about it in text dont trollcome on if you dont want to use text then just make that your last post and repost your ts info and let those of us who do want to talk about it in text keep doing so without trolling or join in again you obviously feel strongly about it and have a point of view youd like to share and youre already here posting in text so why not stop trolling
double post nvm
as i and other people in this thread have pointed out closing your eyes and saying i cant see you you arnt there is not the way to win an argumentits what you have consistently doneto summarise my views in this thread that havnt been trying to get you to answer questions1 these changes are not taylor made to hurt coalitions they are made to provide more pvpcontent in 002 ccp is not happy with the way these mechanics work currently and rightly so imo you have shifted your argument from ha this wont change anything for coalitions to this is made specifically to kill off coalitions which to me seemed strange but i may have missed somethingneither of which btw is a good argument to not introduce such changes
ive asked you to stop trolling and post honestly its unfortunately that youre refusing your two issues whether or not the change is designed to alter playercreated politics and whether or not the mechanic needs to change are both subjectes ive posted extensively on in this thread you are lying your claim that ive shifted my argument is also a lie ive pointed out that this wouldnt be the kind of change that people are claiming it will be and as such it wouldnt accomplish its intended goal and ive pointed out that its wrong for ccp to alter game mechanics to attempt to stop legitimate sandbox play so that only ccpapproved playercreated content is allowed youve again reverted to playing stupid in order to troll you know full well that both things can be true and can be argued for at the same time without contradiction or change you know that in fact i have done soah well i tried really did you refuse to stop trolling here and will only stop trolling on your ts i wish then that youd stop posting here or at least stop trolling here but its not to be it seemsmy offer is still good by the way if you stop trolling ill be happy to have a discussion with youbut im not going to feed a troll such is life adios
well that isnt true because i havnt been trolling if you dont think these proposed changes will have the effect they are said to what changes will they make and why i assume they will make some change in your mind as you are posting to stop this supposedly unforseen bad consequence of their removal
you have shifted your argumentfirst you were sayingnow you are sayingwith reference to the eve online wiki
i guess you got me saying this is not working a it was intended is completely overriden by ccp is not happy with thisdamn italso it is one thing to say ccp intended jumpbridges to save time which is true and another thing to say ccp intended jumpbridges to make players less vulnerable while doing logistics or be sprawled litteraly all over the entirety of 00 which is most likely falseand the best part is either way whether or not they are working as intended which they are not this is not a reason not to remove them should the alternative be better
ok and now imagine it would have decided at the same time to attack you from the west what would nc have done they would set the timers the way that the towersstationssov stuff dont come out of rf at the same time in east and west they would first defend their assets in the east and then use a titan bridge to bridge to the nearest jb and use then the jb network to transfer the entire blob to the west within minutes finally they would defend their assets against it with their entire blob there is no need to devide the forcesbut what would you do without titan bridges and jb what if timer system would be changed eg as i have proposed it above obviously you would have to devide your blob in ordet to be able to protect all your assets on top of that it would be harder to motivate pilots who live really deep in 00 and have to travel 30j back and forth for every fight
so with your logic only way to actually cut off the supplyreinforcementtravel is to camp a deathstar pos with a covert suicide cynoand there is a very low chance of anyone camping a certain jump bridge in a hope of getting a straggler compared to him running up against a roaming gang of a few people going through normal gateswho said it has to be a red one it could be neutral anything thats not blue to you im not sure if you remember but we where up there shooting the nc in hw and from what we saw travelling through gates was a very rare thing for the nc 90 of the time you guys went through a gate was when you had to jump over to a different jump bridge routea roaming hostile gang will have problems finding targets when most of the targets go through jump bridges and engaging them there will mean they will need to deal woth the tower as wellim not talking about fleets im talking about small gangs i mentioned 3 different routes all of them cut the travel time with minimum 50 if you optimize your routes from ab you can cut even more but i guess most of that are already done when it comes to connecting important strategic locationsi saw how you guys moved up north people where trickling in one by one sometimes in small groups of 3 or more over the jump bridge network it wasnt until the people got to the main staging area that stuff started getting organized everything before that was like looking at lemmings crossing the roadif any hostile fleet is big anough to actually engage on a pos against a reeinforcement fleet it would be much more effective to just shoot the bridge and move on to the next bridgesmall scale camping works but you cant engage on the pos for a long time you get scrammed by the pos webbed and shot at on top of getting shot by the gang you are trying to kill yes its possible to do a hit and run with stealth bombers but if the bubble isnt at the right place or they run into the protection of the pos field it isnt much you can do sure but you had no way of defending you tech moons from pl at the same time did you if you had jb network it would have been much easier for you to fight on two fronts cause there isnt much point in sitting idle waiting for the reinforcement timer is it
theres no need for a hypothetical pl actually did attack us from the west and the jbs and jump clones all proved insufficient and we had to relocate to deal with pl completely aborted our entire invasion and we quickly lost all of the gains wed main this despite having the jb network that many posters in this thread are very upset by
although your incompetance played a bigger part in your initial failure than anything else
no you didnt you just stated that you had no jb network in the drone regions ergo you could not use your jb network to your advantage and go back and forth this again forced you to stop your campaign in that region and jump clones proved to be useless due to the 24 hour cooldown
was there any particular reason you cut out the reasonings on why ccp  csm want this i did try to explain that ccp doesnt want 00 to be ruled by huge coalitions who are blue to everything within 30 jumps and they wanted to encourage local wars and make it harder to control more spacemy comment about living in 00 was in regards to alliances with sovereignty i am well aware of pls success but you cant possibly compare pl to every other non sov holding allianceare you also aware that 2 members of the csm are in your coalitionthe argument on here is stupid anyway the op doesnt even give anything that we should support  unsupport s and for the past several pages you have argued against a proposal that has only been discussed with no confirmation on if it will happen and hownow i understand ncs reluctance to remove jump bridges but if your own coalition leader thinks its a good decision dont you think you should go argue with him after all there was no one who disagreed with removing jump bridges completelyedit seriously though wtf are we meant to be supporting  unsupporting
seriously thats not according to my argument or with my logic that doesnt follow at all and no ive already mentioned several ways that both capital and subcapital ships can be ganked on jbs quite easily you also mentioned dealing with the pos itself which is another option too this is nonsensical if you want a higher chance of ganks camp more jbs neutrals are counted as reds by any pilot with half a brain jumping into a system besides its not as if pl hasnt been known to use alt scouts yes they offer a defensive advantage by designposs and mods can be dealt with however and why is it a problem that you have more trouble finding targets why should ccp funnel people in front of your guns it would be great for pvp if any time you logged in ccp teleported you to jove space to an arena where you were forced to fight another player the point is that travel time is only part of the situation when raising reinforcement fleets so its not a question of 1015 vs 2530 but 3045 vs 4560 or what have you this is especially negated if you have waves of reinforcements coming but yes bridges are supposed to provide something of an advantage in terms of time why exactly is that advantage bad then during max ii did you see gank after gank after gank including entire bs fleets obliterated by well timed bomber fleets camping our jbs to the point where moving from mo to umi was damn near lethal on some days and moving by gate with a caravan was actually safer and yes that is another option why does everything have to be a niche for small scale pvp why cant there be a place for small scale pvp and large scale pvp and medium scale and and if you like fighting in small roaming gangs go find someone else who also likes fighting in small roaming gangs otherwise all youre really talking about is ccp funneling targets into your gunsights so you can get ganks on gates i fail to see the definitive gameplay benefit to that with a well timed bomber run ships slamming on the mwd to try to get back into the pos is absolutely ideal nah not really hw to lxq is 15 jumps with bridges 24 without an extra 9ish minutes isnt what kept us from dealing with pl and saving that 9ish minutes wouldnt have meant that wed have fought a war on two fronts 
unlike you ive actually camped jumpbridgesi can tell you it is boring as  with little chance of catching people after the first 5 mins and very high risk
we dont have the jb network that many posters in this thread are upset about thats been the whole point people are claiming that jbs offer game breaking advantages both on offense and defense especially while deploying half way across the map youre arguing both sides of the issue the jb network we do have up saved us 9 jumps and about 50 of travel jumps when youre making the argument 1015 minutes and 50 is a huge deal when i am suddenly those savings are inconsequential unless theres a jb network going all the way to the destination oh and minigins trolling has reminded me often when ive hunted on jb poss we had the jb password as pretty much everybody and their sister does for the nc these days once in particular that let us use a medium sized about 40 dudes ahax fleet to camp a bridge in an enemys main staging system for about an hour we managed to aggro a jf before it logoffskid but our prober had had to go just a few minutes before that due to wife aggro that missed kill still annoys me i dont remember exactly why as this thread is moving pretty fast but my best guess would be that because for that argument to work you have to accept that its acceptable for ccp to deliberately alter game mechanics specifically to hurt certain playercreated politics that they dont like why not pls shown that its possible theyre awesome at what they do and deserve respect for it but theyve also proven that its possible to do what they do since after all theyve done it hrm mynxee mazz dierdra korvin tea meissa trebor sok vuk however is and even if true that means that the supermajority of csm members arent in the nc and vuk wasnt at the summit iirc im not sure what youre getting at though it doesnt matter if theres confirmation the point is that the thread is to tell the csm whether or not we want them to try to support the elimination of jbs or oppose it just because im in a coalition why should i let coalition leadership think for me that makes no sense besides vuk fits damage control gang links to his damnation all that means is that they made the wrong call theyre our elected officials not my cerebellum  do we want the csm to support or oppose the removal of jbs from the game
in that case i support the removal or alteration to jumpbridges on the grounds that 00 has become a coalition joke and making it harder for one coalition to maintain several hundred moons will encourage alliances to reduce in sizeconflict will change from lets attack the opposite end of the map to lets focus on whats good  bad in local areas alliances will be able to work with their own territory rather than what the powerblock is doingi am a huge fan of smaller wars and increased activity while it would take alot more than jump bridge changes to fix 00 i support the change and hope it happens in the next expansionbtw i use damage control ii on my damnation too
if they do this theyll have to look at cyno ranges as well but the pros outweigh the consitll cut down on empire bloat make space big again reduce blob mobility and therefore formup size itll help small alliances because itll always be easier to get a home defense fleet up than convince a bunch of people to go 30 jumps to curb stomp people they dont know and make 00 worry about industry again rather than just ferrying things in from jita
the evidence falsified that claim however before jbs coalitions still went to war with each other on different sides of the map and there were still large coalitions okay you are a fan of smaller wars and such some people are fans of larger wars why should ccp decide that one or for that matter the other viewpoint is the right one and try to alter game mechanics to help or hurt playercreated content of the wrong sort shouldnt the players who are creating the playercreated content get to decide how its created not a damage control module the damage control ganglink its the third armor link and absolutely useless lots of people never actually read its description in anything but an rr bs fleet the bonus goes utterly wasted vuk is a good guy but the point is that even good smart people sometimes make mistakes
ccp will invariably chose what is and what is nothowever it is my belief that should napalitions be scaled down because of these changes it is not because ccp decided it be that way but because players decided they dont want to stay blue to each other if they dont have the insentives of jumpbridgessuch a thing is your choice not ccps so using this as an example of ccp taking away your choice is pretty silly if anything they are giving all players more choice you will still have the option to retain your entire naplist now there will just be a set of different consequences for doing soalso in line with this saying that people have a right to chose this large scale style is completely valid and unchanged by these proposed changes
with several you mean bomber gang or a blob just because your in an alliance doesnt mean you should be immune to small gangs just sayingwho said i was after ganks i would be happy to get a fight but as it is now its impossible either you run to the jumpbridge under the cover of scrambler webs and pos guns or you just dont fight at all without having a numerical advantage hell we had problems getting a fight out of you when we where in hw and you had over 600 in local takes like 10 min to fix that not an option and any small group trying to incap a pos in nc homespace is asking to get blobbedlagged outi hardly roam and im not saying that ccp needs to funnel targets infront of our guns im saying that logistics in 00 needs to be more then just getting past the lowsec00 point and jump on the jump bridge train cause it makes it possible to travel in 00 with no scouts without hardly any risk and your stealth bomb gangs of doom are ed if they spring the trap on lone travelers when what they really want is a freighter or a bigger gang and you cant stay and fight with a stealth bomber gang they will pop left and right im not saying it has to be small gang niche but with all your arguments you are bringing up it seems like you feel you should be immune to any small gangs comming to your spaceas it is now most alliances doesnt care or wont lift a finger if there is a small gang comming through their space simply cause it has no effectevery camp or roaming gang can be bypassed by a jump bridge still not getting it are you15 jumps through a jump bridge network is a big difference compared to 24 jumps through 00 space specially when some of it is in a hostile region maybe not when you are in a fleet but for every straggler or smaler group comming to it or going back to hw if you are saying it doesnt affect your travel time then you would have no issues in them getting nerfed or removed would you also if moving by the means of a jump bridge network is the same risk as moving through gates you shouldnt really have any issues there as well
bombers driveby snipers armor hac fleets other fleets that have the password capital fleets and whoever said that alliances should be immune to small gangs certainly not me you were complaining that lone pilots have a better chance of getting ganked on a gate than a bridge now it seems its not about that either what exactly is the problem then it takes 10 minutes to fix a pos thats put into reinforced and dropping caps on a pos to rep it make them ideal targets especially if theyre triage carriers if you cant rally sufficient forces to reinforce a pos or defang it without being countered why is that a problem if i attack two battleships and im in an omen are you really saying that battleships should be invulnerable just because i cant gank them so the defenders can bring more than you can attack with that is unfair and bad why if i was in a five man corp should you be prohibited from responding with six people if i attack you except its not hardly any risk as long as you have a competent enemy and if bomber ganks reveal themselves and you know that a bridge is hot either you use it and risk dying or it dosnt get used and viola successful interdiction of forces mobility ive never said anything like that of course it will be more difficult for a small force to counter a large force if theyre not on their game but theres no problem with that any more than it is that if i bring out one battleship and you bring out two youll probably kill me instead of me killing you youre trying to have your cake and eat it too again 9 fewer jumps are a big deal they make a lot of difference theyre very important and yet the nc had to return home and the jb network didnt prevent us being unable to fight a war on two fronts but then 9 fewer jumps doesnt matter and can be ignored when your argument needs it 9 jumps are important when it doesnt theyre not come on this same stuff has been posted and debunked again and again it has an impact it does not have a game breaking impact even if it didnt have an impact on gameplay that doesnt mean a change is for the good i do not want my ship models replaced by crayon drawings from a five year old i never said that either of course the risk is different but its hardly risk free and you can still get made dead i in fact have specifically argued that granting a defensive bonus as a benefit to ownership and holding sov is fair and reasonable
i believe the minutes stated greyscales words as sweet which could any number of things which is a long way from your interpretted drama child unless you have some secret ear in the csm or are an alt of one then i dont see how you could know exactly what he did saydirectly quoted from the minutes for your pleasureperhaps you should read them again when youre not drunk stoned or whatever
yes if hes said awesome it would have been even less clear of course the relevant bit is the one ive posted several times already the bit about how the change was going to potentially make coalitions fragment and tear themselves apart oh trolling thats novel and unexpected yet again i appreciate you being so angry when youre wrong
so basically ccp wants to nerf how easy it is to maintain a super coalition csm agreed that it needed to be done jump bridges were mentioned cue rage about how unfair it is that someone wants to try to encourage more pvp in a pvp gamehonestly though i cant believe that you honestly believe the  that youre typing right now youre making your whole aliance look bad right now if youre a troll then 1010if not then you just got a perfect score on the standard plague black common scale of derp
i support finnagainzeros quest to remove jump bridges and fight all those who plan to keep them in the game as they are cowardly and dishonourable
ccp wants to nerf how easy it is to maintain a super coalition they probably do they really are that stupid csm agreed that it needed to be done what the hell do the csm think they are doing there is no way that can be representative of the super coalitionscue rage about how unfair it is that someone wants to try to encourage more pvp in a pvp game what the hell are you talking about that is the stupidest thing i have heard how completely ridiculous the rage is for someone trying to nerf jump bridgesit is you tertiacero that is making your alliance look bad
see the long discussion on why altering game mechanics to penalize or reward playercreated content is a bad precedent and the wrong move the ability to maintain a coalition should be based on whether or not players can work together not whether or not ccp can try to frustrate that ability if people werent cooperating nobody would be as upset about jbs theyd be as happy with them as everybody was to hunt providence under cva because you always knew that cva could bring a fight through their jb network if they wanted that shows that the problem isnt with jbs at all but its a back door method to try to screw with players creating a political landscape in eve that some dont like your position is also hypocritical youre fine with ccp wanting to nerf how easy it is to maintain a super coalition but your position has no support its just your personal preference you have absolutely no room to complain if instead ccp wanted to nerf how easy it is to maintain a small alliance you like small alliances others like large scale pvp neither is right or wrong and theres more than enough room for both in the game but you want your personal preferences imposed on others again its a very dangerous precedent if ccp deliberately alters game mechanics to hurt player created content that they dont like today tomorrow if they decide to target you not only do you not have a leg to stand on but you will have already voiced your support by endorsing the basic premise that ccp is free to break sandbox play if they dont like how the players are creating their playercreated content ive asked you several times to stop trolling now would be a good time encouraging pvp is a nonsense phrase anyway jabberwockian but protean enough to mean whatever you want it to mean mandatory teleportation upon login to an arena in jove space where you have to fight it out with another pilot that too would see a lot more pvp giving everybody free ships and no loot drops and death only results in res sickness would also encourage more pvp simply claiming that youre trying to encourage pvp is meaningless besides which you are ignoring the fact that its player created content people will cooperate and fight as they see fit if that annoys you thats too bad you cant claim its a pvp sandbox game and then get angry that people are pvping and cooperating with who they want to when and where rather than who youd want them to if you could control them like a puppet im sure there are some fans of solo combat who are annoyed that you guys fly around in awful blobs maybe even with six or seven guys in a fleet maybe the next change should be to eliminate alliances and corps too after all those who love solo pvp dont like getting blobbed by your small gang pvp your possible defense of but thats how i choose to play the game and who i choose to cooperate with and this is a sandbox has already been removed by your own rhetoric oh andmem i understand that youre responding to some silly trolling but dont respond in kind peoples actions only reflect on the people making them blaming groups for individuals behavior is the basis for most of the prejudice that we see and its simply a logical fallacy hes just trying to troll me and get me annoyed its not working let him troll about how someone with an alliance ticker automatically represents their entire alliance with everything they say dont lower yourself to the same level though
you are making this alliance look terrible and full of ignorant terrible posters with no idea about game play you are doing the polar opposite to what finnagainzero is doing here you should learn from him
finagain seems terrified of jb nerfas he should be since nc is going to get it ballsdeep once nerf arrives
only way to kill someone then would be that people where jumping blindly through the jumpbridge and by your earlier argument that would be very slimif one red in local is a good indication i wonder what a drive by sniper gang is or a hac fleet or whateverwrong im complaining about the ease of travelling through jump bridges vs normal gates if someone looses their ship or get podded back if he can come back via jumpbridges there is a high probability he will if he need to go through a bunch of normal gates and happens to be a hostile small gang roaming around nearby he would need to think twice before moving about i think we are talking past eachother here who will go to a incapped pos for protection and if im not mistaken a reinforced pos dont have a working jump bridgethe 10 minutes i was refering to was the jump bridge itselfwow so from having single ganksfights on the gates we need to reinforce poss to stop people moving through the jump bridge network you know what kinda manpower and ships are needed then right not what im refeering to and you know it we fight outnumbered plenty of times its the need for a fleetgang that can counter a deathstar pos to even have a shot at killing a lone travellernot much since jumpbridges can be rerouted new one can be put up or just take a different jump bridge network10 jumps through a jump bridge network is quite different then 10 jumps through normal gates i would be happy if the jump bridges where moved away from the safety of deathstar pos
can you guys continue this drama somewhere else it now shows 400 replies and 25 supports when really theres only about 40 postersshame really but if you want to  about csm go to jita forums
youre reading to deeply into the meeting minutes with a bias to their content i think which should be obvious to anyone who reads the quote you just threw up thereheres a few more quotes from youthats a fairly exaggerated from what the actual meeting minutes state occured and this is what i was leading to from my earlier post you make broad claims of fictitious staements made by ccp greyscale during the meeting that took place nowhere in the minutes does it indicate he said anything of the sort it does indicate that he is attempting to gain support for ccp to proceed to make plans to adjust the effects of various game mechanics on 00 life i see from your posts that you obviously have experience regarding the subject but i doubt the arguments you press forward are made with a clear mind you dont really have to be drunk or stoned to make overdramatic claims of grand conspiricies by ccp and csm the topic of jump bridges wasnt evendirectlybrought forth by ccp and instead was simply pitched in at the end by a csm delegate inferential comprehension a way of indirectly determining the value of a statement based on the context of the discussion in which it was madesweet  awesome so we have free reign to make any changes as we see neccessary based on our judgment and perception of the best way to change a given situationthe situation excessive blobbing proliferated by easy mobility of alliances through 00 spacethe solution reduce mobilitynowhere did it say that they were going to completely destroy coalitions or prevent sandbox play only that any changes will have consequences and will impact gameplay for everyone involved
not at all jumping with a scout hardly saves a fleet from being bubbled andor bombed dealing with a competent bomber gang camping a jb is difficult and they serve as very effective area denial your question isnt clear one redneut in local is a good indicator especially if you have valuable cargoa valuable ship that you may be walking into a hot drop trap as for a driveby sniper gang its exactly what it sounds like nanopocs work well hacs whatever generally as long as you get the vectors right dont hit your mwds and have your  together you can volley someone quite quickly as for what hac gangs are i dont understand you confusion at all you just put wrong right before saying exactly what i said you were saying exactly you can disable their functionality entirely if you want the dynamic is exactly the same whether its an omen versus two pulse armageddons or a small group of people versus a defended pos again you deny what im saying is accurate this time claiming that i know it to be inaccurate before repeating the same thing if the defenders have more defenses in the form of a pos than you can bring to gank those lone travelers why is that any more of a problem than a five man corp trying to take burn eden on alone what specifically is the problem so they need to bring in a fleet to rep up a pos mod or you can camp both forks of a jump bridge network again its not difficult at all during max ii we often had jbs camped along multiple routes andor incapped and we had to wait until we could muster sufficient forces to rep them or to destroy them and anchor new ones the fact still remains that youre claiming that nine extra jumps meant that there was no way of defending its not like those nine jumps were crushing or fleets didnt take the gate route quite frequently going back and forth
factcited and quoted above he doesnt like coalitions and thinks that small alliances should be independent even if the political realities of playercreated content would normally mean that theyd face too much opposition that theyre looking for ways to tweak mechanics in order to achieve those political results is exactly the point strangely i was able to quote themevidently i can quote things that dont exist i am good
we can be arguing until the server shuts down we still wont come closer to an conclusion or agrementuntil ccp actually do something this is where we stand today ccp feels the logistics are to easy ccp are thinking on different ways of dealing with jump bridges where removing them completely are one of them if jump bridges will be removed are yet to be seen but that there are coming a change is no secret or ifs and buts its whenit will be fun to se what ccp comes up with
this is astonishing a member of ccp wants to increase friction if you said anything like that in customer service about any of your customers you would be fired
basically we got a clash of ideologies here carebears vs hardcore pvpcarebears want to keep jump bridgeshardcore pvpers want to nerf themarguing over the issue is about as pointless as arguing over religion or politics  no matter how hard you try you will never convince your oppositetherefore realizing that the best thing to do is to present your arguments as clearly as possible once and not get drawn into pointless debates that serve no other purpose than to confuse the issue and discredit the people involved tho i suppose the opposition may view this as valid stalling tactic to prevent action
right now a rail ship is a fail ship even if this particular fix doesnt pan out at least we can make the csm look at hybrid turrets againalso why cant i do em or explosive damage hybrid ammo is all good and fine if i am shooting at serpentis but we are right hosed on a roam
not supported it is not a problem but a symptom of older changes made to the game fixing symptons will only create new symptons if every new change requires patchwork like the one suggested here then the races will continue to see changes and lose their distinction because the changes are motivated only by other changes and the entire game will lose its variety complexity and character races need to have a clear distinction in order for new players to pick the ones they like this requires direction not endless patchwork problems need to be solved at the root
and what is the root of the problem and how would you fix it
ok i can agree with that each race does need to feel different from one another and hybrid turrets should be functionally different than lasers missiles and projectile turrets in a mixed race fleet the 4 different factions should have a different combat philosophy and different roles to playso we should avoid patches that make rails feel too much like autocannons or too much like lasershowever the problem is balance people come into this game and see the little 4 intro movies on the different factions then they get in game and slowly realize awww you picked gallente your turrets are pointless and you cant fly a drake wah wah wah hope you can fit autocannons on your myrmadon sucks to be youi think that raising a few numbers here or there if done correctly would help with game balance but not throw off the overall feel of the races
i dont care how its done but damnit something needs to change i started as gallente and trained lots into hybrid weapons only to discover they were craptastic and have now switched to projectiles the issue of course with switching guns though is that to take advantage of weapon type bonuses you have to change up ships as wellperhaps if ccp had seen fit to give ships generic turret bonuses switching weapon types would not have been such a ridiculous strain on both time and training and resources indeed because of the weapon specific bonuses involved the crappiness of hybrids nave made using gallente ships crap which is no good for anyone
how about being able to cloak dronesfrom a pve perspective i think this would be a great additionwhen theyre being shot at you could hit a key that would cloak allselected possibly forcing them to return to orbit if you think its too awesome to still have control over their navigation while theyre cloakedthis sets their stance temporarily to passive and cloaked until new commands are given where they will revert to their chosen stancethis would make for a more elegant aggrodump than the returntobayrelaunch which i personally think is a kinda clunky mechanism mainly because i dont know the state of the drones being relaunchedpossibly severely damaged but also because it feels like an unpolished brute force way of removing aggrowith this system one would also be able to remote repair the damaged drones while taking aggro from the npcsas for pvp it would be amazing to have drones just pop out of their cloak orbiting your enemy
mining is a pretty hot topic considering how simple and boring it looks to the majority of eve i think the system could benefit from some small but powerful tweaksccp has tried to keep mining on the same risktoreward scale as everything else in eve you stay in hisec you get to sc up veldspar pebbles you go to some rare remote places in nullsec youre chewing on juicy abc ores you go to lowsec youre either a ninja or you have a heavy escort to keep pirates from chewing on you if you see where im going with thisnobody mines in lowsecat the same time macro miners are a problem some people believe mining shouldnt happen at all but i say if a person is willing to sit around at a belt for hours on end he should get more money than a person warping about killing npcs and salvaging wrecks macro miners depress the mineral market and take a lot of the profit away from people who actually put thought into their mining ops the only thing more annoying than sitting around mining is sitting around in a pvp ship protecting minersi have a proposal that could change all that a new type of special belt rat these rats would be completely separate from the current system of belt rats and take a different form in different security areaswhen a player mines from a belt it activates the spawn trigger for adaptive rats as im calling them for simplicity as long as he continues mining there is a small chance to get an adaptive spawn this spawn is completely separate from the regular belt spawn and they do not interact which means it is possible for both spawns to show up at the same time in hisec the spawn would be 1 frigate maybe 23 in 67 space this frigate announces itself to the player but does nothing 30 seconds after its arrival the frigate will orbit and warp scramble the mining ship if the player warps out before it attacks the frigate will warp off and he can return and resume mining this will function as a counter to macro miners plus encourage humans to have friends nearby to assist in case they werent paying attentionin lowsec and nullsec however the spawns will be much more powerful they will still come with a 30second delay and warpoff if the belt becomes empty so they dont pose a much greater effect to afk miners and bots than to humans however these spawns include battleships with the same level of bounty as truesec rats 600k15 million isk eachwhat this will meanmacro miners have a much harder time exploiting the systemlowsec and nullsec mining operations need escorts already with this the escorts dont come away from their job with empty pocketsa belt with a miner in it produces more ratting income than otherwise creating a powerful synergistic effect between belt ratters and miners you get a sort of bonus income when your alliance diversifies its operationsfinally the rats should be exactly the same for nullsec and lowsec lowsec is every bit as dangerous as 00 space and most players agree it needs new sources of income when i first started playing eve the idea of a mining expedition deep into uncharted space with a team of 20some miners and escorts sounded amazingly cool i have since learned that it doesnt work that way but i think that it shoulda second related proposal i have is to modify the rorqual i believe it should have a significantly reduced volume and mass to allow better access to wormholes as well as the ability to deploy and packup faster having a rorqual deployed on the grid with your mining operation should provide bonuses unlike anything we have today i mean like 30 there should be rorquals getting hotdropped and killed in nullsec and the owners are willing to field another oneif you have any more ideas or changes to suggest please do i want to tune this until we have a perfect ideato anybody who actually read this entire post i sincerely thank you
i see no real issues with this certainly better then what we have now
not so sure if a single frigate will be able to interfere with hisec macroing that much really unless it puts out a rather significant amount of damageand that is assuming the macro cant be easily adapted to avoid them completelystill a good idea as far as lowsec goes imo with a good spawn rate of the rats this might even make it worthwhile for organized mining ops
this i think i would support compared to the last proposal i read its absolutely golden and all covered in honey cant even think of a way to improve upon it or work in some sort of balance right now thats how bad the last one wasit needs polish and it needs balance but its probably the best idea yetsupportededitforgot about the rorqual bit not sure thats a good idea
the main problem i see with this is that macros would be programmed to detect said communication from the rat and immediately warp off only to return and continue macros are pretty advanced some can even do scanning from what ive heardi think there should be normal npc frigates with scrams and if theyre not killed within 1 minute an easy task for a person at the keyboard they call in significant reinforcements including maybe a commander rat this would make it easy to take them out before the onslaught begins and would work the same way as your current proposal for lowsecthe rorq idea im also unsure about but for now i would like them to do something with mining and lowsec so ill support this proposal
excellent idea
the main consequence of this is that bot creators would spend five minutes writing a new bit of code that says if scrambled by npc pull in mining drones pop out combat drones kill npc return to mining and then make even more cash as macro miners would have to pay out for the new updated versionnot sure how this is good either for for ccp or the non botcreating players
so you are saying dont do anything so that macro users dont need to buy new macro programs 
supporting my own proposalyou have a point im starting to realize that bot creators could adapt to just about anything and my idea wont solve the problem permanently however making bot programs for eve is currently very easy to do and i think a feature like this would still have an impact it would completely knock out bot mining for a short time until new macros can be written and that should be enough for players to take back some groundregarding the rorqual maybe a straight mining bonus would be problematic what if a few of the ores were made slower to mine and the rorqual got bonuses to bring those ores back to normal mining rateseven if you disagree with an idea please give your support if you think this thread is at least going in the right direction im willing to keep changing my ideas until i find the correct answer but getting ccps attention is a bit harder in order to get the csm to recognize these concerns i want to have as close to 100 approval as possible
supported ccp said they would do something about mining years ago still havent though unless they consider the orca doing something about mining
the rorqual bit is tricky but i like the idea of adaptive belt ratsi suggest shortening the attack timer according to security status base announcement delay would be 30 seconds and for every 01 sec level lowered the delay will decrease by 3 seconds installing sleeper ai into those rats may also be nice
i wonder if a csm delegate might care to comment on the possibility of discussing this with ccp againwindjammer
yeah f that noise
i know there are many threads about this but i feel they dont offer concrete ideas so ill throw this inthere have been many people railing on the forums that gallente ships and hybrid turrets need to be boosted and theyre right lasers have long suffered from terrible t2 ammunition drawbacks while autocannons had to give up damage to alternate their damage types as intended both of these issues have been fixed and fixed very well but they have left hybrid turrets in the dust im going to start by talking about blastersthe conceptblasters are balanced with high damage a good solid damage type and supershort rangethe problems1 as ships get closer to 0m from each other their angular velocity goes through the roof the pitiful range of blasters means their already good tracking just isnt enough2 as time goes on t2 and t3 ships are becoming more and more common and more than half of them caldarigallente caldari fielded more than other races have high kineticthermal resists kintherm is no longer a solid damage type in fact its generally the worst spread to havethe solutionsi propose that hybrid ammo and guns be reconfigured to produce more varietyfor ammo it should be divided into sets of 2 antimatterplutonium with 50 range uraniumthorium with 20 range leadiridium with 20 range and tungsteniron with 60 range each pair has one ammo type that deals primarily kinetic damage about 34 kin 14 therm and one that deals primarily thermal damage this way you keep the overall damage type but allow for a little bit of flexibility think about killing ships fitted with sanshablood raider tanks vs angel tanksfor guns split the 3 blasters to have specific abilities electrons can receive superior tracking speed to kill small ships if you get into range ions should get improved range perhaps 50 to give them more flexibility and allow them to synergize with caldari range bonuses and then theres the mighty neutron blaster neutron blasters should get massive damage with a low rate of fire converting them into a shortrange version of artillery this will give gallente ships the clear role of tankbreaker and encourage fleet synergies like the current alphamael fleetson top of these changes i propose an overall small buff for hybrids as shown belowtypetrackingrangedamageelectron5010ion255010neutron1010reasoning pvpyou cannot assume that a battleship with 6km optimal range fights at 6km this is an incredibly hard range to maintain the enemy will simply close with you and get under your tracking at around 3km the effective band of ranges in which blasters are effective at full damage is 37km i believe with a range this low the band should be 17reasoning pveone thing that looks like a problem is blaster ships getting an edge in pve where you can sidle up to npc battleships and theyll fly straight away giving you perfect shots however i dont think this would be much of a problem since they have to reach the ship first blaster fits lose a lot of time just flying around that drakes and ravens dont have to deal with its appropriate for them to kill things a few hpsecond faster for their troublerailsi dont have very much to say about rails at the momenti think its odd that beam lasers often deal better sniper damage i believe this is because lasers have a worse damage type a premise that is no longer true the hybrid ammo change i suggested would help rails out as well other than that do people think they need tweakingthis post is part of my giving eve a tuneup series if you are interested in reading more go heregiving eve a tuneup introduction and links
supporting my own proposalone thing i didnt have room to mention in the above post that is actually a key part of the argument caldarigallente ships are limited by their powergridsyou cannot fit a rack of neutrons mwd and armor plates on a medium gallente shipyou also cannot fit a rack of neutrons with dualreps on a gallente battleship such as the hyperion which only applies its bonus to armor reps and not buffermy proposal would not make it easy for gallente to have awesome nukeboats if they do fit neutron racks they will be very limited in the other things they put on their ship since mwds are pretty much required for any fleet ship this would mean ancillary current routers or reactor controls which in turn reduce either the ships tank or its damagethis is effectively combining the traits of 1400s and tachs into one shortrange bundle of fun and giggles

we all know its coming but what would we all like to see available i for one would like to see not only avatar vanity options but ship options as well particularly the ability to paint you ships even if the options are preselected for us also let us not forget the ability to place logos allowing us to represent our corps and alliances in stylewhat about changes to ship models nothing that would alter the functions or stats of the game but perhaps just some preselected model choices or even better yet a character design system like the avatars have that would allow us to make some configuration choices like color gun locations engine design and the like this is something that star trek online has managed to implement without any real issues and cryptic stos maker suck as a developers while ccp has enormous talent i have no doubt that they could pull this off and it would offer a welcome change in ship personalization that eve not only currently lacks but looks behind the times in mmo technology for not having hell sto even has name of the ship on the hull and you can change it on the fly in real time eve players needs nay deserves this kind of treatment and its long over dueas long as new options dont increase lag and still make it easy to identify ship classes i see no reason for these options to not exist your thoughts on the matteradditional ranthaving had time to think about by post it made me angry that ccp took the damn time and energy to create this new avatar system for something we wont even have a use for for probably the next 78 months while meanwhile our ships our true characters have no customization ability at all which is in my opinion complete and utter bull this is a damn spaceship game and a ship configuration tool should have taken precedence to a human configuration tool
1i recently started what im calling the tuneup project a series of threads addressing specific tweaks to the existing content of eve ill take a closer look at your suggestions let me know if you have any others or you want to help out
npc dont get concorded for shooting players you dont get concorded for rring them
this
that would be past concord tanking setups are ehp based current concord is not tankable
not to open a different can of worms here but how many people bot in wormholes none i bet removing local in 00 systems would go a long way to fighting the macro ratting problem with is ever increasing it does not resolved the highsec macro miner problem though and for that i support the move of warpable belt rats to and increase of scannable grav sites it all boils down to ccp fixing their ing code though if other companies can manage to detect and stop bots in their games ccp should too
this is an interesting idea i just posted my own idea to stop macro mining before i saw yours people should check it out and decide which one they like bettermaking mining more fun for everyone
guys if something can be done by a bot a human should not be reasonably required to do itpunishing players for no reason other then require them to put effort into arbitrary things and then punish them for getting around the punishment is the worst sort of game design possiblewant people to mine  make it so that they dont have to stare at the same thing for 3 hours this is a game dont make it a job
youve got some interesting ideas there though i cant really say i agree with them in entirety the idea of scanning down roid belts isnt horrible but i think simply making a more dynamic system would be betterheres my thought and perhaps it can work together with the other afforementioned thread idea1 rather than setting it up so you have to scan down gravs set it up so they autogreen when you hit your scanner in the same way as combat sites this makes it simpler while maintaining the dynamic value and requiring a more human element to be involved its already been said that bots can likely scan as effectively as any one of us so why not just maintain the dynamic nature without making it to cumbersome2 lets extrapolate on the dynamic spawning of sites allow for sites to sites to spawn within belt regions around moons and planets and at varying distances from the sun always within an orbital path as would naturally occur eliminate the circumferance effect of the belts as they are always a crescent shape of unrealistic scale planets and moons are large and have 10s of thousands of kilometer distance across their respective orbital pathways diameter belts should be relatively straight in physical appearance with smaller asteroids intermixed and being trapped by their larger cousinsorbital pathway is rather a vague term with no real equivalent in science but for this purpose we should consider it that distance from the planet at which an eliptical orbit of 20 ms can be achieved by large tumbling asteroidsthis adds to the flavour of exploration and the vastness of space while preventing site access from becoming a tedious exploration it also prevents standard mining belts from interfering with gravimetric site spawning these should be two different entitiesadditionally no more than 25 such belts should exist in a system at any one time belt life should be limited to 3 hours at most unless an individual is continuously present at the site the ability to lose a belt becomes possible while not occuring randomly while a player is present at most a belt should contain no more than 80 of the current largest belt in a given security status and the composition of the belt should be very similar to what they are now allow for an exceptional asteroid to occur rarely being one of the smallest in the belt and limited in its mineral wealth nothing near what youd find in its lowsec or null equivalentadd depleted asteroids to the mix as the other 20 of a given belts asteroids and prevent asteroids from despawning when they have lost their mineral wealth to a mining barge laser not really neccessary but itll keep the miners guessing it will also make survey scanners useful for more than simply evaluated when an asteroid is all but depleted 3 allow for a more intelligent ai in asteroid rats and use of warp scrambling and disruption and stasis webs as well as reevaluating targets remote repping and similar tactics allow the rats to function in gangs this will make things more interesting for players while allowing for additonal income from such persuits it will be more complicated than regular ratting but will potentially be more rewarding as well scale rat spawns and usable effectsabilities based on system security as usual this shouldnt make mining impossible just more difficult and requiring of awareness allow for concurrent spawns and system security dependent triggered waves of rats at a given belt being mined any given asteroid upon being mined may trigger one of these waves or just a small gang create a general dependancy between the two activities without a miner ratting is very limited and without combat support vessels there can be little or no mining allow for waves and gangs to spawn at a distance allowing an alert miner to get out of there
 i love to see constructive post written on this subject 
this is another suggestion that would simply mean reprograming the bots software or a little alteration to supervising the bots you need to think of an idea that couldnt be affected by a bots software
if the grav site was set to never scan out to 100 on 16 or 32 au scans then your average haven running macro wouldnt be sophisticated enough to figure out the little scanning mini gameand all miners would have to do is scan at 16 or 32 then scan at 8 over all the little red dots that show up it wouldnt take too much time for most people the real question is whether or not a 14 day free trial noob can figure out scanning long enough to get some veldspari guess in theory a bot could be programmed to blanket space with 8 au scans in a grid pattern across the solar system you could always kick down the minimum scan radius for grav sites down to 4 or 2 if you were blanketing a system in a grid of scans then each reduction in size increases the total amount of scans by roughly 8x from the previous level so a 32 au scan area is 8 16 au bubbles and 64 8 au bubbles and 512 4 au bubblesalso on ccps end someone doing blanket 8 au scans in a grid across a solar system would be really easy to detect basically youd look for someone scanning a lot in a short amount of time in one solar system especially if the majority of their scans werent anywhere near a cosmic anomaly for a decently sized gang its not too hard to get one person to put a combat probe scanner on their ship this might actually encourage people to take roles in pvp rather than everyone going for straight dpsalso if you are solo pvping it doesnt take too much cpu and power grid to fit a core scanner and just warp to each anomaly in turn the same way you would run through the belts and if you wanted all your powergrid and cpu and you were patient enough you could offline another module to online the probes then once you scan out a system offline the probes and online your other module
and selfdestructing even gives you a chance to change your mind
i didnt know you could eject from a pod and now ill never see it happen 
i will not be ignored

no anything that make afk mining more difficult make an already boring chore annoying as wellif you want to fix mining make it actually fun to do rather then making it so that no sane person would enjoy it
as we all know ccp makes income off of botters each time they ban a bot account they lose precious monies that could be used for keeping eve alive my proposal is simplelet the bots stayi know i knowemoragequit but seriouslyccp knows who the bots are with that said all that needs to be done is to give the players of eve something to do mark each bot account with a flag that lets players know that they are bots if one character is flagged as a bot then all 3 characters on the account are players can then attack and kill these bots without reproach of concord to prevent this from being abused by pirates make it so that if the bot attacks a player back concord will come in and destroy the bot allowing the player to finish off the pod treat the kill like a ratting killno killboard mailno reason to pad stats with this maybe even put small bounties on the bots as wellobviously this has no effect in nullsecbut players can already do what they need to there this would allow ccp to retain the cashflow from bot accounts while at the same time lower the impact that bots have on the economy and give players a way to help control itobviously if ccp were to make an error and flag an innocent account as a bot account many tears would ensuethats what petitions are for if you do not use bot programsyou have nothing to fear
or you know you could change ratting and mining so it would be somewhat pointless  hard using a bot
hmm interesting make it legal to bot but also make it easy to kill themwell at the very least it could be funnote not supporting but only because i want to hear other opinions first i see nothing wrong with this but someone else might think of something i cant
i would like to know how you think this could be done and where is your proposal thread
most of the botters are sov null ratters hidden deep within the blue ass of large alliances you wont get to them
som update by ccp on this wuld be nice

that would mean this is not a works as intended feature similar to capital ships jumping to covert cynos or the ninja buff to incoming hulkageddon
supported i have nfi why it was removed it was a great feature i hope you have bugreported it
cmon im here consider dit a divorceps raimo looks pretty gay imo
fix it plz
reserved for abusing trolls
thats more about the docking size of teh station if you warp to 0 and land on the edge of the stations docking rangewould the morons please read and understand the op before chiming in with pointless jibber jabberthanks for the specific information its such a small change and would be relatively easy for a programmer with an iq add a 0 to 250 and theres a docking range that makes warp to 0 effectively 0 wouldnt be surprised if they did miss the extra 0 when they programmed it
what you need to do is jet a can on undock bookmark that can warp to bm next time and spam dock station on exit docking was a problem even in highsec mission hubs where a single suicide ganker would camp in direction of a gate and volley a low ehp tengu with rack of 1400s on docking the ship comes out of warp to a standstill still under command to dock unresponsive to other commands and thus vulnerable think of it as landing in a bubble with people waiting for something thats exploited even in highsec lowsec ganking is a matter of course tentatively supported this is just like lack of warp to zero for gates before people started mass bming and lag the server you cannot make real players into yerrpirate fodder through the use of arbitrary and stupid mechanic limitations as is with that last case people can get around it and it only ends up being a hassle that detracts from the game itself
forum warriors respect themand docking ranges need to be fixed its random like yeah what you whant a button to do exactly what it says tss such nonsence not in eve what does align time have to do with warpin position thats right it doesnt
kinda undecided on this as it can actually be an advantage for droneheavy ships tanking the guns as long as you got replacementsi frequently use disposable drones like ecms for that purposethen again probably unfair to be able to mitigate damage with your drones
as long as there is gate gunsno
so i take it you would not car if that gates and stations fired defender missiles out as well grate idea as long as blasters are  gal needs as much help as they can get lol one up for this post
i wont even go into your cap philosophy cause it lowsec ish and short sightedjust remember that when 2 chimeras cap transfer eachother they is cap created both ships gain capto your points1  cruiser sized ships capable  like stealth bombers making everything above them useless cause its the same concept and they didnt unbalance anything having 3 cit torp launchers wouldnt make it op against anything since anything larger then a cap can outrun the majority of the damage cruiser sized ships incapable  wtf are you smoking man if it fires capital size weapons it will be effective against normal caps and to an extent bs im sorry do hics only bring focus scripts when your sure theres gonna be super caps no what i mean is you could fold 5 or 6 of these into a fleet if you know your going to be shooting structures caps or supers and let them move in once you control the field til then they could be safed up creating supercapital killers  ok soooo answer me this if it can fly in space it can be ddd also it would bring to light the flaw in pvp at the moment which is that super caps dont need a support fleet they wouldnt be immune by any means but for a group of super carriers theyd be annoying and hard to kill i agree except noone wants to bonus dreads cause it would unbalance them from bs not to mention its not a question of bringing number we will always bring numbers the problem with always needing something bigger to destroy something is that this system of thinking never ends we already require 5 hics  you are seriously fail if you need 5 hics to tackle 1 single super carrier since unless it has help can only neut out 2 hics at a time if the pilot is good and if they are all cycling focused points every time 1 came close to capping out it would just fly outa range cap up and fly back in5 hics would have an easy time with 1 super carrieryour corp m8s might laugh cause they are short sighted and rooks to eve but anyone who thinks long term can see the only way to make eve last is to make it cyclical not linear in as many systems as possiblecreating a cruiser that uses 23 citadel launchers that had a low ehp and cannot cloak how could it possibly be op it would be easily taken out by cruisers t1 and t2 frigates bcsbs the ships focus would be large volley but it would need to be protected this would encourage team play and fleet strategic planning also posting with your alt just shows how unprofessional you are true assembly hall going post with mainsbut thats not the point the point is if you look for the solution in caps then you will find that those will just be blobbed omg you make the falcon of caps and they will just be spammed till they need to be built a counter you build a hic for caps and they will just be spammed if you built the ship i recommended it would be spammed by the spam of a cruiser hulls that have next to no ehp well then a regular fleet could be formed to wipe them outthink logically for once nub
there is the not completely unrealistic scenario that it would lead to a situation where you only deploy supercaps if you are sure you got enough to not only annihilate a small fleet of hics and dictors in short order but you got enough to annihilate a substantial force of carriers and dreads in short order ie before losing more than 12 supersgiving capitals the ability to tackle them will just introduce another round of the arms race to mass the largest possible supercap fleetno a sensible solution is to improve the survivability of subcap counters against supercaps read nerf their damage projection against subcaps and as far as lowsec is concerned rething the availability of ecm bursts and other means of antihic capabilties ecm drone swarm neuts but also fighters and dps dronesedit and the logoff safeguard its kinda funny how the standard tactic to save a supercap that actually gets tackled in lowsec is ctrlq or whatever the shortcut is after the patch if agression would scale a bit or even extend as long as something is being shot at this whole problem would not exist in lowsec to this extend
why are you trying to fill the role of the dread with a cruiser your idea replaces the role of the dread with lower sp requirment and lower isk investment and on top of that only further s the dread into only ass hats use territoryyou are a dumb ass who seems to have focused on a very narrow minded idea the complete rebalanced of everything that would have to unfold because you toss citadel torps on a cruiser hull far exceeds the balance issues that come up from super caps losing their ability to warp off when other caps are on the field
if you are going to remove a useful tool namely the jump to drop down menu accessed by right button clicking your capacitor please make the replacement capital navigation panel usablethe biggest fail of this new ui interaction is that previously by using the drop down menu you could see player cynos and their locationthis had the advantage of both knowing where your jumping and more importantly not having to broadcast a cynoim sure most capital pilots already knew about the capital navigational panel previously and while useful for the occasional check against range and fuel consumption i myself tended to ignore it most of the times since it took up valuable screen space and there was much better option the now removed drop down menuthere is also have been issues reported by others that this tool doesnt work in laggy situations remember that lag also affects broadcasting meaning player cynos will be difficult  if not impossible to findso eithera return the old system which most found useful unlikely given ccps tendency not to backtrack on bad feature additionsorb provide a new tab under capital navigation for active player cynos show name and location and remove its resize restrictions to allow docking with other windows ie tab hidden under the overview window
well eh upvote and bump id at least like 30 views without support before abandoning the idea as bad 
yes why did ccp nerf pi and make it a even larger klick fest as i am now unable to run my planets like i did before and have to use even lower rates on my extractors to get enough material the actual problem is that the extractor control units use too much power and make pre incursion setups impossible to workthe solution to this would be to move all cpu and power the extractor control units use and shift it to the extractor headsonly a few people are using 10 heads on one control unit anyway but want to extract many different materials
please enough about the new pi system learn to master italso there are hundreds of threads on this look around before you post
number one rule in the eve verse adapt or die why do you think there are so many pirate tears in the forums as of late so you cant make robotics on a plasma planet any more big freaken deal my whole setup for the past x months we have had pi was nothing but extractor colonys and one or 2 processing colones and it worked great i personal love the new system cause it means that i dont have to click 45 times per instalation for the stuff i want due to my setup its a maximum 40 times and its actualy fun finding the best layout for the white rings to max mat production
new pi system is less clicks same output your doing it wrong
i cant see the nerfyou click less after setup i mean you can make almost twice as much per hour though it does take time to get the setup right for thatthe only possible nerf is for those who want to extract 4 or more materials from the same planet and still have industry and thats a maybe because i havent tried it
i dont suppose youve ever mined have you its boring as heck so boring in fact i cant even stand it ive got a thing about paying attention incase somebody comes along to suicide gank in high or if in null or low just to gank cant really rationalize the loss of a 200 million isk ship because i was too bored to bother watching while im making 4 million isk an hour more or less mining is unprofitable boring and thoroughly uninteresting while the lasers crackle away in a most annoying fashion just to irritate you its frickin profound how dull it is and you want guys to manage a tracking laser every cycle youre out of your mind except for bots theyll stop mining entirely i cant believe they actually do it with the way it is now the only mining i can handle is gas mining low displacement gas thats worth a bit at least my effort and boredom is lessened by reasonable returns and limited time 10 minutes to handle a cloud of c70 with a few guys no more if i have to mine anything 5 cu meters a unit or more i get sick of it and the extension of the time requirements even at 70k a unit definitely not supported
no supportnot mining afk is insane
any kind of mechanical process that does not include complex human interaction such as discerning intelligible shapes against a fuzzy background captchastyle is easily automated by a bot your input is appreciated we need to deal with botting but this is not the way to do it
1 define mining ship it is a ship with a mining laserstipminer in a high slotyou have just damned all the new players to use captcha every time they dock player retention will droponly a bargeexumer apocrook bot for miners will be out next week it will require a complementary hauler and a lot of drag and drop but bots dont fear carpal tunnel after the needed time for retraining the situation will be back to normal bottingif you include industrialtransport ships and the orca you will annoy plenty of people think doking in jita while doing a captcha that even assuming that the bots will have problems with captcha plenty of macro can decipher them2 it will kill player miners we will get plenty of elite pvpers ready to kill miners near the stations while they input captcha 3 it will annoy plenty of players for no discernible gain
i think major problem with botting this and that is that theyre not worth shooting while in space bot miners and haulers and ratters hardly ever drop anything worth looting considering the time effort andor sec loss spent shooting them
it would be very easy to stop macro miners all you would have to do is apply a 30 this figure could revised cut to mining yield of mining turretsdrones whilst in an npc corp to mine effectively you would need to be in a player corporation which would make you war decable macro miners could mine in safety in npc corps if they wished but since their mining yield would be diminished this would very beneficial to the economy genuine miners will usually gravitate to player corporations and as such wont be affected for the genuine player who mines in an npc corporation all i can say is time to find a good well balanced corp and please remember that mission runners had to take an 11 cut to bountys when ccp introduced tax for npc corps i have always wondered why ccp over looked miners
well it was just and idea i thank you all for your imput and i apologize for my previous post which was both hostile and rude
any system that allows you to run multiple mining characters at once is likely to be very easy to bot so you miners need to decide which you prefer multiple hulks or not competing against bots that never get tired or boredas long as ore is widely available and mining is really easy it will be heavily botted
im making this post to address possible solutions to the 00 problem id appreciate it if you could keep playertoplayer harrassment down to a minimum unlike a previous thread which only addressed a small portion of the overall discussion below im going to be quoting the actual meeting minutes from the csm december summit which this discussion will reflect oni believe there are changes that need to be made and i believe some of you may have some valuable input on the subject the csm is a small group which represents us in new eden as such they have only limited knowledge of our actual needs andor interests it is a fact in any corporation or alliance in eve that leadership rarely listens to the little guy while persuing their goals they often make decisions that affect all their members in some fashion without consulting those members with regard to their opinions this is reflected in standard operating procedures alliance dues and other policies all of which are expected to be obeyed without argument or discussion sometimes they are well thought out and reasonable in practice and occaisionally they are designed to pad leadership wallets or are simply redundant or even tyrannical orders this is what happens when you have a governmentoptionally you may simply click support to show your support for ccp and csm with regards to their opinions and conclusions found in these minutes giving reasons for or against certain aspects of this discussion being within the realm of a supporting vote but allowing for alternative means of implementation to be discussed

shameless plug 
like in the game perpetuum for thoses who know the gamefor now u are forced to use your skill point even if u dont know what is the good choice to do or if you are happy with what you have spent your points in being able to stockpile for future use would be greatif being able to insta train something would be a problem for the game balance the max number of skill points u could stockpile could be capped or for doing some skill points sink ccp could create a skill like a brand new learning skill memory rank 1each level allow you to stockpile 100k speideitic memory or something need memory to 5rank 5allow you to stockpile 200k sp for each level
perpetuum seems to be a eve clone only inferior in almost every way eve probably shouldnt be taking ideas from itplus ccp wants people actually logging in to play from time to time thats why the 24hr limitation was put in on the skillqueue allowing players to vanish for a month or more and come back to a huge amount of freely allocatable sp would seem to go against this desire
how would you do this you accumulate sp at different speeds depending on what primary and secondary atts a given skill depends onno i cant support this
might have been a good idea 3 years or more ago but it would make the attribute remap obsoletemax out two attribs and train all skills associated with them bank all future sp and apply to skills where attribs are crap essentially just a max train speed sggestion which is not needed
no
how is a game based on driving robots on the ground remotely similar to internet spaceships much less a clone its an updated clone for mechwarrior google black prophecy if youre looking for potential competition for eve as for training speed they can always store raw points and apply penalty according to current remapstats its the same process that happens in real time currently
not supported different training times were instituted for a reason and i believe should remain as such

so i started playing eve a few weeks back and im still learning all the ropes when the new patch hit with the new character creation i literally took 30 minutes to create my characteryes i tend to be perfectionist seeing how after youre done you take a picture of only from the shoulders up i kinda felt like i wasted lot of my time so i asked ingame if there was going to be anything involving our characters be able to walk in stations and they replied that there might be soon in months to come so i really wanted to know and so i ask dear eve forum habitantsare there any hints of character being able to walk freely in stations in the futurealso i know some players will dispute against this by saying that this game revolves around ships or whatever excuse just to say no to characters walking but if it was just like that then there wouldnt be any sense in making such complex character creation feature might as well left it like it was before upgrade the facial graphics and features and leave it with a simple character creation system
it is called incarna read about walking in stations in the evelopedia herealso moved from assembly hall
there was a playable demo about 2 years ago it was pretty coolill find the video for you
greeting i hva e alittle problem i would like to talk about i never looked at description of teh bloodline but only how much the diferant bloodline were affecting teh clothes hair and facial of my avatar but now that the new carcacter creator is out its all changed and i cant make a good looking caracter like before i want it to look like an emperor since it will be my titan rider account but i dont want to start all what i learned to zero just to change my bloodline to make it look cooler so what im asking is to let us the ability to explore all the other possibility of our new races custumisation or then i dunno make that all bloodline can have the same clothes and hair and everything cause it really suck that i cant make a good portrait due to teh bloodline i choosed before and anyway is there a diferance between the bloodlinenote i might be counfounding ancestry and bloodline but you get the main messageforgot to say taht this caracter and my first oen calyster solaris are both perfect but i cant make emperor solaris look like an emperorthx for your comprehentionsorry for my bad english im a french canadian
change of bloodline has been requested before it seems unlikely to happen
tadaa
o sorry never saw it lol gm just asked me to post this idea here i should have looke daround lol
many good ideas over the years as to what could be done to make them worth the cost most focusing on tankgank aspect creating minihacs if you will  will work but rather boring if you ask mefirst a change that is needed to facilitate itwarp disruption field generator wdfg range reduced to 10km and the bonus on heavy interdictors quadrupled 20lvl hics will have same range at lvl5 as current but with larger incrementsenyo harpy retribution and wolf80 to 90 reduction in power and cpu need per level when fitting wdfgincrease capacitor sizerecharge to where they can run the wdfgabweapons roughly 910 caps ie retribution levelsishkur hawk vengeance and jaguar5 bonus bonus to the velocity factor of stasis webifiers per level half that of marauders  75 webs at lvl5noteswhile technically they can run with bubble in nullsec the speed hit denial of remote assistance and small size 10km should make that option a last resortallows for a much more accessible tackle option against supercapitals which is sorely needed in lowsec where bubbles are prohibited and supers bolt at the first sign of a hicthe pointers were intentionally made cap unstable to minimize the risk of them becoming the primary tackle against supers they are a stopgap until a more permanent point can be fielded ie hic
rather not we already have interceptors as tackle shipsalso frigs have close to no use in low sec as they cant tank gate guns so that argument is invalid i think they should get a second damage bonus like hacs do or a speed agility bonus on some
i could see a t2 destroyer class ship designed for hunting cloakersthat has special scan probes that can pick up a cloakers signature if they are moving or can track down if they warp within a certain amount of time before the signature fades and can also fit special guns that fire anti cloaking charges in a 30 km circular radius around it that will temporarily disable the cloaking device if the charge passes close enough 60 secsit would still be difficult to find afk cloakers especially good ones but it would provide a counter that shouldnt be too over powered

last time i checked custom officials can still fine you randomly at gates if you happen to be carrying illegal goods depending on quantitys in cargo hold i imagine this could throw you in the negative so technically there are ways to go into the negative without violating the eula something to think about
so youd rather drive people out of the game that once bought isk and got caught instead of reeducating themthats stupid and the reason ccp wont do it
i thought ccp frowns at used alts recycling how does that reeducate people
next time dont buy isk or dont scam and the devsgms wont move to you negative wallet byebyeps pls cheaters dont cry when you got punishment affter tricks
are dumb mommies money is not how you should get better
makes sense
am i the only one who reads dev blogs ccp specifically said that with the next expansion we can take new photos at will so we can take advantage of all the new accessories and tattoos
suported
supported but why not boobs  no plastic surgeons then perhaps thats in incarna too 
supported new portraits fine new avatar only with microtransationnew stuff implemented by devs
personally im a fan of jump bridges this despite not being in an alliance much less having access to any jump bridges why you ask jump bridges provide another frequent locus of pvp theyre not too difficult to fight on to kill high value targets cause significant alliance disruption when you destroy them and breed laziness and stupidity in to those who grow to rely on them so why change them simple to decrease the overall benefit gained from using jump bridges increase the risk involved and im of the opinion that any changes removing them would simply see a mass proliferation in titan bridging for even the most miniscule of large alliance fleets so with the preamble in order i offer to you a simple set of changes to keep jump bridges viable yet still not overpowered 1 increase jump bridge fitting enormously such that a pos that has a jump bridge anchored can manage maybe 6 small guns a warp disruption battery and a web battery and very little else this will mean that even meagerly equipped small gangs can fight pretty effectively at jump bridges while still giving some advantage to the defender some tooling will be needed to accomodate the various pos fitting and likely faction pos might be able to muster some more impressive defense but with any luck not much more2 increase the size of jump bridges by about 45 times to ensure that planting a jump bridge is a freighter affair 3 reduce jump bridge shield and armor hp by 90 1m to 100k for shields 15m to 15m for armor increase the structure hp by 100 100000200000 the object here is to reduce the amount of time it takes to incap a jump bridge by doing so it allows attackers to negate a strong defensive advantage that defenders currently have with mobility alternative means of system entry titan bridge gate entry then bring their own risks 4 reduce jump bridge limit to 1 per system 2 or 4 per constellation while overall not a huge change it will add on rougly 13 minutes per jump when moving fleets across vast networks if more rapid deployment means are needed titan bridges can always be set up furthermore forces some modicrum of gate travel within a constellation to get to your intended destination 5 reduce both the material cost and upkeep cost of jump bridges only fair that if theyre now made of less hardy construction they shouldnt cost as much given that they give a much less significant advantage 6 likewise increase fitting restrictions on cyno beacons not to the same degree as is proposed for jump bridges but enough so that a moderate gang can destroyignore the defenses in a reasonable time frame to deny the asset and force a confrontation also as a means to prevent titan bridge chains from cyno beacons being a much more viable solution with these changes i hope that itll further increase the ability of roamersattackers to do damage to the infrastructure network of the defender limit the overwhelming advantage thats currently accrued as a defender with jump bridges and add an additional friction point where fights can occur feel free to tear apart this proposal to pieces
that will nerf logistics but what about force projection also be ready for finnagain to decend upon your thread and argue with everyone and try to derail it
i dont think jump bridges should be altered independently in any way any changes made should be as a part of a bigger redesign of mobilityforce projectioncyno mechanic as a whole those bigger design outline changes should then dictate what alterations should be made to jump bridgespeople spitballing ideas is fine but i wont support any independent changes
if we really need to change something about jumpbridges these are pretty good ideasbut i believe the current jumpbridges are just fine
anchorable only at storm planets or plasma some relatively rare one with fairly even distribution one per planetdust mercs can then mess with them as a hightier objective
black ops battleships came into existence late in eves expanding roles stage and as such never got the ability to doanything on a battlefield recently ccp has been tentatively poking the widow seeing what they can do without committing to anythingi believe the proper role for black ops ships is areaofeffect ewar yes that sounds awesome yes it also sounds like it would be broken and laggy but i dont think sowe have heavy interdictors that project moving bubbles around themselves i propose that black ops become a new kind of ewar hictor where the bubble cycles like any other module and applies its effect to all ships in the areato see what this would mean im going to look at the alreadyexisting aoewar module the ecm burst it can be used on any ship but when used on a widow its strength gets up to a 150 bonus as of incursion 11 if two fleets are in close combat the effect will hit friendlies as well although the friendly fleet could have been prepared i have already suggested some means for battleships to defend themselves against ewar in my previous thread giving eve a tuneup episode 4 the evolving battlefield ewarhowever in the case of fleets firing at each other from a distance a single widow decloaking and activating its ecm burst could have a powerful effect on the battle the widow itself would have a very good chance of dying however it could even get dddkeep in mind that what i just described is not a suggestion it already works this way the widow can use aoewar already to great effect i havent heard of anyone doing it in the last 2 days but i expect itll happen if similar modules are to be developed for the other races black ops there are a couple key rules i believe they should follow for one thing multiple aoewar bubbles of the same type would not stackamarr tracking disruption probably not energy draining but im not saying thats a bad idea we have energy draining bombs remembergallente sensor dampeningminmatar target painting once again i dont know about area webs it makes sense lorewise and would be cool but it would stack brutally with warp disruption bubbles otherwise you could use it to speed up your own fleets warpingcaldari already have ecm bursts note that each ship can only burst with 1 module at a time but multiple ships can stack burstslike hictors black ops should be able to use focusing scripts on their aoewar modules to allow them to target one enemy ship with deadly effect this focused ewar should work on all capitals and supercaps perhaps with a 30 chance to jam a supercarrier each cycle or a 70 tracking speed and range penalty on a dread one of these could seriously disable a capital ship if used appropriately but keep in mind that after insurance a black ops can cost more to lose than a dread or carrieri propose that all these weapons should be highslot modules and ecm bursts should be made highslot in addition black ops be able to fit bomb launchers with range area and damage bonuses ill release episode 5 soon with an indepth explanation of my reasoning why i think eve needs more aoe weaponsnow for the slot configurations i propose black ops should get 5 high slots 4 for gallente but has drones with 3gallente 2 turretmissile hardpoints and 100 bonus damage to its native guns so a black ops can fit for decent damage with a cloak and aoewar or a bomb launcher or it can increase its options at the cost of 13 its damage per highslot moduleto anybody who actually read this entire post i sincerely thank youthis post is part of my giving eve a tuneup series if you are interested in reading more go heregiving eve a tuneup introduction and links
the current setupelectronic warfare in eve is effective varied and very wellconceived it is also very simple and limited to a small set of ships and situations you can be an elite shooter90 days worth of sp you can be an elite logistics or command pilot but you cant be an elite ewar pilot in the current systemthe opportunities1 electronic warfare has to be very carefully balanced because it scales differently from other things like damage and rr an ewar ship that shuts down the enemy completely is no fun in 1v1 powerful in small gangs and relatively useless in largescale pvp if you try to balance it for one arena it becomes unbalanced for the others2 electronic warfare is very specific about which ships can use it and which ships are vulnerable to it while this makes sense and adds variety to the battlefield for a dedicated ewar pilot it means training all 4 races and being able to switch ships on the fly if your curse runs into a drake gang the only thing you can do is get another ship this is why there are very very few players who call themselves ewar pilotsnow i want to address issue 3 first and work my way backproposal 1 vulnerability by sizeit is difficult and chaotic to track what your enemy is using and line up your ewar accordingly because you dont know what race ships the enemy will be flying 2 hac gangs of nearly identical configurations can have completely different ewar vulnerabilities so what if the vulnerabilities were based more on ship roles ive been thinking about this a lot lately and what if ccp introduced a highslot module for battleships that either blocks or weakens ewar effects after all one would expect a large ship to have a much bigger sensor suite than its smaller peers larger ships already have higher sensor strengths in response to ecm and in battle it is generally easier to disrupt a battleships performance for example tracking disruptors than that of a smaller shipas a much less radical change i propose that combat recon ships receive 12 the applicable bonus to all other forms of ewar this way only the rook would get the full ecm bonus but another combat recon ship would still use it better than any t1 give ewar pilots the flexibility they desperately need and theyll give you a more dynamic gameproposal 2 advanced scriptsi propose that ccp introduce a new script for each type of ewar only usable by players with level 5 of the appropriate electronics skill this script will grant a substantial bonus 75 to both effects of the ewar but prevent the effects from stacking there are 2 options for this either only 1 ewar module of that type can affect the target vessel or the effect has a hard limit say 5 or 10km for sensor damps this would encourage players to spread out their ewar andor allow them to affect enemies with only 1 module so they still have room for tankfinally i have some special ideas for black ops which will be in a separate post expect to see the link here soonto anybody who actually read this entire post i sincerely thank youthis post is part of my giving eve a tuneup series if you are interested in reading more go heregiving eve a tuneup introduction and links
i know there is proposal for afk status a year ago ccp should implement this feature how wow has it and eve doesnt
i am just going to beat a dead horse here but seeing how the idea is rising to remove jbs from 00 i would like to revive another ideahigh sec wars revisedsince the dawn of high sec wars there have been station hugging games with the heavily increased hp on ships in most cases you can undock take a few popshots at a target and redock way in time before your armor or shield suffors real damagethe 30 second timer is a thing of oldand why would a stationmanager allow heavy agressive people back in after a mere 30 seconds of none agressionmake it 15 minutes and you are sure that pvp will happen between those engaging eachother outside a stationbut that 15 minute timer kicks in after agression so not when you dont agressabout neutral reppersas soon as someone uses a neutral repper or gets repaired by a neutral that neutral actually declares he isnt neutral and should be flagged as a legal wartarget for the remainder of the waractivly participating in a war should have its consequences even if you arent shooting by aiding one side the other side should have you as legal target for the remainder of the warresult will be more active combat since the useage of neutral reppers only lasts as long as you have unflagged onesas it is now you can use a neutral repper who will unflag within a real short amount of timedockingranges of stationsdo something about that its absurd that some stations have a dockingrange that exceeds well over 30km from undock whereas others have a small docking radiusmake them all as small as the smallest currently in exsistance ingame

ankh gently tossed a 3 inch teaspoon down onto the table it was done to make a small amount of noise to get the attention of someone at the meeting a far cry from having a problem with reality it could just as easily have been a pencil being tapped on the table or a rustling of paper and it would have meant exactly the same thingankh seems to have done this to stop something which was disrupting the meeting it was a far better choice than interrupting the entire meeting to publicly correct someone and thereby embarrass them on a larger scale than necessary the method ankh used was relatively discreet and low key and that speaks to her stability rather than lack of itwindjammer

would it surprise you if i said no i dont entirely agree with youi dont and the reason its really very simple actually im fully confident that ccp is capable of addressing these issues while managing to maintain there future expansion release schedules the problems arent nearly as bad as you make them out to be most of what ive seen is just gate camping on ccps doorstep a lot of issues are minimal impact issues which can be addressed later while the real existing issues can be addressed as soon as reasonably possibleccp doesnt need a system for dealing with content revival they simply need to apply balances to what is already there polish if you will some content has been left unfinished so they should address that and finalize itso what ccp really needs is a core team of content fixers a group that has one goal look at existing content and apply fixes and final features to it starting with the content that doesnt deliver and finishing with the content that needs a little polish they could even switch between the two for a lighter workload once in awhile release all content fixes as minor patches once per quarter and move on to the next set of features that needs to be addressedi would compare this to the guy pushing a broom around a workshop while the rest of the crew are still working and tossing junk about the more effort the work crew makes to keep their area tidy the less effort is required by the guy with the broom broom guy incidently gets to replace and reorganize tools restock inventory and a whole bunch of other little jobs which are not unworthy of attentiona crew of 57 guys could easily handle this
thumbs up for old issue that is still a problemseriously most of us spend all day staring at a computer we have bad eyes give us a break
the cyno effect still needs to be reworked in my opinioni really miss the old one it set apart what exactly a capital ship was vs dated gate technology
what a deceiption i was hoping for the tunnel of love back can we have any explanation for the removal i still cant find any good reason its not so difficult just put the old effect backits been a long time people are complaining about it well am i wrong or is ccp just ignoring us

supporting this so hardi dislike the new sebiestors 
signedi too dislike the sebiestors look
signedi agree the sebiestors are the worst but there are flaws in other bloodlines if there are no racial stats what does it matter just allow us to change the bloodline
signedplease allow a bloodline change the only thing is could mess up is rp and is that really that important
signedi would not have picked my bloodline a year ago if i knew what it would be changed too

i would like to take the time to point out that the usage of vherokior with the character im using to post says thisi made this character to be a science and industry alt i wanted the highest intellect and memory i could get and for this and other statbased reasons the vherokior race was superior to the one or maybe two others that were close just like all the achura caldari stat s i too am a stat that is what my choice of verokior says at least thats what it said until ccp changed the game so that blood line no longer affected your attributesitem 3 of the portrait swap faq does not and should not apply to my character because1 what my choice of bloodline says about me is no longer valid due to changes made by ccp2 due to ccp not implementing a visually pleasing vherokior blood line it is currently impossible to fix elements i am not happy about without being able to pick a new blood line at the least and race at the worstthrough ccps own actions section three of that faq is no longer applicable to me sadly i doubt they would see it that way as such this suggestion is supported

what not into womeni dont understand why this is such a touchy subject for so many people its just boobsthey need to jiggle
some people just see the word boobs or breasts and then instantly translate this to omg sex which translates to their own sexual repressionin other words they just cant handle a jiggy pair of 
if you want to move from internet space ships to ultimate science fiction simulator i am afraid proper boob kinetics are an absolute must
no dont misunderstand im into women real womenanywaydo you really think this is necessary you want the eve development team to take resources away from other projects so they can make boobie physicsplease dont waste precious development time with something this ridiculous
i am pretty sure oveur doesnt think that way
all the jugs i have seen have been saggy they must of used  as a template
there is already a team that works solely on incarnait is going to be that way for a while i am sure so you wouldnt be taking precious resources away from anything that and i seriously doubt it would take much effort or time to make boobs jiggle a little
op may have just realised why its taking the devs so long to come up with incarnatheyre busy testing the character animations

blasters increase trackingthread
i think i read this somewhere in a dev blog or something but ccp said that they believe blasters are working as they should but they were wondering if the real issue is the fact that there is no way to close in on the enemy fast enough so really what do you guys think if there was a way to get close enough to the enemy and not be so ed tank wise would that solve the problem not sure what they are gonna do bought rails tho
uping the range bonus of the blaster t2 longrange ammo should solve the problem making it a short to midrange weapon like the others and not just a short to failrange
bump
woooow
im not really sure what to think of this one but hey it does make a certain amount of sense i do have a few concerns of course im also not certain as to the difficulties involved in implementation maybe its simpler than anyone really thinks or it may be hard to nigh impossible to bring into playhere is what i think is good about itinstead of each server tick requiring all events to play out in real time the server runs through multiple ticks prior to launching all events for the next cycle this is similar to old strategy games in some respects though it wouldnt function in the same way with command windows the fraps thing is a cool idea slowing down events while maintaining decent fps would make for the potential to get nice videos unfortunately it would also induce clientside lag while making for huge files and a significant amount of editingand heres some things i think would help1 implementation of a client side click prevention would have to be implemented so once a module has been activated it highlights green till the next server cycle or click highlighted like this it will only send the server one additional command which will prevent some of the requirement for lag slowdown the client side would then have to allow for a module deactivation which will allow for a module shutdown cycle to begin and would highlight red so maximum to clicks per modulegroup that could send commands to the server you could denote this with a second ring which would be available in all gameplay click the module and the command is sent and client informs you click it again and shutdown command is sent and client informs you nothing more will occur with that module until the next tick or cycle or until it has finished its full timer cycle in either case once in shutdown it will not accept any more commands until it has shutdown which makes things relatively simple as far as that goes that would eliminate the need to click on a module until it shows some form of activation timer sent back from the server lag is bad that wayeven if you know its hard not to try anyway2 make the slowdown scalable if possible as ships come into system and fighting ensues allow the server to scale the time dilation effect as it is needed 10 minutes is a long time for a tick each tick would occur as normal without executing events or actions until the server had run a full cycle of ticks this would be the time dilation the server would say x number of ticks required to activate all events without lag becomes one cycle for the purpose of handling lag in this system and would then proceed to inform players that the system was moving into time dilation for physics purposes the server would slow down all physics events to an appropriate level and proceed to allow the last cycles events play out while it takes commands for the next cycle in this way time dilation could occur as needed anywhere and would be based on the number of active pilots in a given system3 as systems become overloaded with pilots communications could be blocked regional markets would become inaccessible local markets would be shut down and chat entries would be limited to one text entry per cycle which would be queued client side like the module activation indicators fleet communications would be limited to external voice or text communications this would occur as a result of system communications bottlenecks preventing access to regional or constellation data streams due to datanet bandwidth overloads gates into and out of the system would function based on the full cycle of ticks as it plays out in systemits conceivable that multiple systems could be effected by this and the effect would spread outwards from the primary system effected this would be to a lesser degree and would slow down reinforcements called into system

i totally agree i loled when i compared my hyperion with a chimera
remember the super star destroyer in star wars in its introductory scene it blotted out the sunsupported
fine ill support
a small change but a needed one
1ms are undersized
yes but make pos shield bigger aswell
wait a second are you seriously suggesting that thoraxes give up their dmg bonus on 40 of their guns and drastically reduce their effective fighting range reallyplease tell me you are being sarcastic
on the topic of rigsi could live with rigs having more easy pragmatic or whatever reasonssomething likearmor rigs have a penalty to shield amount and regenshield rigs come with a penalty to armor and hull amountdrone rigs should be like weapon rigs better drone equipment on the ship requires more grid rightfrom a rping point of view its totally feasible  more armor armor rigs means you have to drop shield support systems shield hp and regen and shield rigs means you need to drop some armor and hull plating in order to install those shield enhancements
supported the very idea of having repair drones that cannot repair the host ship is and always has been stupid
okay first of all if you are going to troll please include something to improve the thread i admit this is a very controversial topic but i personally think the mechanics of this needs to changeso without further ado1 i propose that wardecs are changed so that the corp that started the war pays slightly more isk every week this will make it so that griefer corps will not be able to continue wars forever and ruin the game experiencepros will stop griefing warscons will create a new isk sink this could possibly be under both depending on the way you think about itwill make legit wars cost far moreor2 wars can only last a certain amount of time then they need a cooldown periodpros again will prevent wars just for the sake of griefingcons will make legit wars end at a certain pointor3 just increase the war dec cost themselvespros and cons same as the first option
id say 3 wardec cost 2 mil atm with a starting point like that slightly more every week hardly makes a dent limiting time artificially wouldnt do much for griefer decs which usually dont last long anyway but will interfere with the handful of real wars between large alliances atm
the problem with it being 2 million is that i could mine that in a covetor in about an hour which is nothing it needs to be more around 10 million for a wardec
mine for an hour 2 mil is shooting 2 rats 10 mil is shooting 10 rats have to be more than that to even make people pause and blink before dec
make wars cost more make them start immediately
i admit that 2mil isnt much but it does go up by double every single week my experience is that most wars dont last longer than 2 or 3 weeks before the agressor breaks up or the victims find allies or disband and those that start and stop over longer periods of time do so with infrequency and it costs muchmuch more to goto war against alliances and they get wardecs frequently for all kinds of reasons so changing the ammount of isk wont change the fact that wars will be declared the whole point of eve is thrashing folks who dont realize they are in your space also the 2mil for corp vs corp warfare is to allow a low cost of entry for newbcorps wanting to declare war on other newb corps honestly i dont see what wed get out of changing the mechanic in anyway less war decs more war decs a better user experience for those who want to goto war a worse experience for those who want to go to war or a better or worse experience for those who are getting war declared on them as it stands those who are gearing up for war endure a 3 day process calling the vote concluding the vote starting the war process and waiting the last day of which the enemy is notified given 24 hours to prepare after which they arent gauranteed any conflict because 90 times out of 100 the people getting decd do everything in their power to avoid a fight including not logging in moving to other corps and staying inside stations and they cant even walk in stations yet if they get a fight at all it probably will stay inside a stations docking perimeter and thats kinda lame if youre lucky you might catch someone passing through a gate whats really missing is a mechanic to conlude a war without the agressor retracting it willfully often because the victim corp surrenders informally or just out of boredom which is often concluded as an invalidation when they no longer pay the concord war bill what should be added to wardecs is a system of binding contract that offers a terms of surrender in which the victor can claim isk or assets the other corp has in exchange for the rapid dismissal of the war and a long prohibition that keeps the agressing corp from declaring war on the surrendered corp again for whatever agreed to time a better warbill cost than the current system would be based on how many more members the attacking corp has over the victim corp so that even matches would cost less than insanely uneven ones but there would need to be a minimum cost as a baseline but its not about the cost really and since there isnt much worth takinggetting under the current systemplayers mostly declare wars for the lols and the cost is really irrelevant as far as griefing wars go if a corp has earned another corps hatred to the point of griefing they are playing for your corps extermination and upping the cost of wars isnt going to change their goal at all paying someone else to help you bloddy their noses might but even thats not a gaurantee tldr overall i go with option 4 create a mechanic for a peace contract that will quickly end a war declare a winner and enforce a gauranteed period of time in which the winning corp gains something for the victory and is prevented from going to war with the victim corp for as long a period as agreed to in the contract
this only shows how much you actually know about the game mechanics please learn to play the game and the rules and then propose something
making wardeccing more expensive wont change anything same as with every other mechanic people have a ton of isk corporations have two tons and alliances have sttons so its not like theyll run out any time soonforcing wars to end wont help much either just need to make a secondary corp where members can jump to when the first corp is running out of war timeand how are these griefing wars not legit or maybe to word that better which wars are not griefing wars i bet the answer will be something along the lines of pvp corps deccing pve corps is griefing to which i might reply lol
not supported if someone wants to declare war on you they will pay the price whatever that may be a high war dec fee might prevent new players from starting a war which would discourage pvp not a good thing
theres low and null if you want pvp griefing miners and haulers does not constituted pvp with the current 2 mil fee anyone can just go shoot 2 rats and fund a war
except that eve is built on conflict pvp also remember wars boost economy more ship explosions is good for everyone
haha yes you are right of course  its more the case of ccps attitude that i am concerned about
number of posts by finnagain zero 61longest post finnagain zero with 6588 charactersi will update these statistics as finnagain continues to rage postfinnagain you have argued with absolutely everyone in this thread if they dont think exactly like you when it comes to jump bridges i suggest you give it a rest or if you prefer leet speak stfu
the main problem of jbs is not that they make logistic of a large empire too easy but to move ppl around half the universe in no time risk free is the real problem nc has setup a network that is ridicoulus  taking this as example as there is the map posted drf or it probally got some comparable network but with your size combinded with the abilitie to be anywhere in your 9 region whide empire is just ridicoulusjbs make it easy to reship and go back to the fight risk free this makes it even harder for small alliances that dont have a jb network at their dispossal to win fight cause the powerblocks will just throw ships at you till you have been driven of the field titans can do that too but itll be tougher to setup 5 titans from the alliances hub to the far boardersboost jfs all the way but itll be fun again to roam through 0 space and see ppl use gatesi do think that jbs where in general a good idea but when your whole blue list is able to use makes it hard to balance it would be a great asset to small alliances to move around in 0 space but it becomes a problem when large empirepowerblocks combine their efforts and menpower to exploit its benefits to death
maybe jbs need a different uses getting rid of them in null and making them useable in wh to link systems that a corp or alliance may occupy
i read it as ccp asking how far can we go if necessary to fix 00 force projection etcdoesnt mean they will go as far as removing them just means that they will include them on their list of options for improving the 00 experience
again eve is based on playercreated playerdriven conflict if people choose not to fight in certain circumstances thats part of sandbox play too and again teleporting people to arenas in jove space automatically when they log on would also see lots more pvp just because a change may possibly increase the amount of pvp that goes on doesnt mean that its a good idea see thats okay ish its still not a terribly good idea but could be argued on the ideas merits alone complicating matters here however is ccps stated position that regardless of how playercreated politics work small alliances should be independent why the games content is created by players and if they want to fight to dominate every inch of 00 then thats how the game will work same with introducing changes designed to try to make groups who are currently cooperating more likely to tear each other apart people are largely in support of that because they personally like small scale pvp but others like large scale pvp if the only real argument is boost small scale pvp because i like it and what i like it good for the game if theres another dev who decides large scale combat is really whats best then the boost smale scale crowd is left without an argument once you accept that ccp can decide who is sandboxing wrong then all you have is hope that the way you and your buddies play isnt something that ccp is going to decide needs opposing remember zulus nerf carriers propoal
worst case scenario for those who rely on jump bridges to do logistics and power projection is ccp just removes them and they have to put effort back into itfinnagain you just need to calm the  down bro remember this is not finnagainonline there are other people who play this game you know 00 is  right now and you ing know it your just scared of change did you play the game before jump bridgeseven if ccp just takes the easy route and deletes jump bridges from the pos and removes bridging from titans and does no other changes at all it still would be infinity better than the pile of steaming dog  for 00 we have nowfinnagain post count in this thread 62
so what are you doing in responsedo you really not understand what ccpcsm are trying to doyour opinion i assumeare they they supported by the player base read this thread it is clear that while many do many dont we are talking about the way ccpcsm are trying to fix things not the very fact they are trying to fixyet again your opinion that he correctly notes this may well be the case of coursethe professed goal this is highly subjective do you really feel that removeing player created networks using sanctioned and functioning game mechanics make the game more eveyour analogy is outrageously stupid and quite frankly is not suitableyou are the troll anyone can see that
speaking of which i still havent supported this allow us some compromise finn and form an argument based on your own thoughts without quoting and casting down other peoples thoughts weve been trying to make you see something very simple this is not about coalitions or sandbox play its about restricting alliance mobility the reason coalitions may fall apart isnt because ccp is going to make an effort to destroy them its because you and your friends will find less reason to maintain them this is entirely up to you and your mates and there is no mechanic that can make it otherwise its a player driven choice that exists outside of gameplay and cannot be changed by it what will change it is having your allies fly a large fleet through your space to assist in a battle giving opportunities for diplomatic incidents or even them not flying at all suddenly they dont have the time to make that effort and remain in their own space guarding their own borders this is what will hurt coalitions and create friction not the modification or removal of a game mechanic but the value of allies decreasing in importance alliances will be put firmly back within their own borders and space rather than making trips that should require flying straight accross empire to assist you they wont have the time to make that trip or will leave themselves vulnerable to assist youedit for referenceprevious post
just got killed by the nc using jump bridges to set up multiple camps when people manage to slip away from themand i can see why finnagainzero is so anxious to keep them and prevent this game going to i mean if you couldnt hop around your space in an instant you might actually have to think about where your fleet is and maybe all those empty systems might actually have people in them instead of leaving half of 00 a barren wasteland i shudder to think of the implicationsthat man is a hero
remove jump bridges absolutely not this is by and far the worst idea ive heard that came from the csm this even beats the awful replace titans with monster trucks issue brought up by mazz
yea he was considering turning them into logisticssupport platforms for fleets by restricting fighter usageguess what has happened a few years after he was treated insanely badly by the null crowd carriers are used as logistics in 95 of all cases and only some even carry fightersnull failed incredibly hard in their assault on him zulu was right on the money 2 years ahead of the oh so holy player content  wonder if it might be that ccp knows what they are doing at least some of the time
these issues have nothing to do with sandbox the choice will remain with the players whether to be part of a super coalition or look after their alliances intrests your particular decision does not reflect a lack of choicei fully support additional gameplay value in 00 the removal of jumpbridges and any other changes that provide more risk and pvp to 00
the eagle being useful would be nice
whats the root of problem  ccp hate gallentean  how about caldari rail boats as for diversity make railguns rapid fire long range weapon problem solved its rapid use of charge make it different from lasers and its rapid use of cap make it different from projectiles itd also be unique in that it rely on long bursts rather then alpha or sustained dpslaser  no reloads highest dpsprojectile  large alpha slow rof and no need to reloadrails  fires 20 shells in 10 second bursts then spend 10 second reloading highest dps during burst second overall dpsunique enough for you for details on this idea
is this not obvious it is blob fights everyone wants more range or more dps on ranged weapons however fights need to be moved closer together and not more dps given to ranged weapons or more range to highdps weapons the core philosophy was and is that range is bought for dps railguns are fine blob wars are not fights need to be more 11 so that pilots can distinguish themselves through excellent skills fitting and piloting blob fights turn players into puppets and will destroy pvp when every fight is not more than a game of who has got more numbers in mass 11 fights can the best players come out on top in blob wars is success and failure based on random chance at best does blobbing kill the brave and supports the wimp this is not what you want
tottaly suport the idea i was impressed how much ccp forgot to allow reps drone to heal their mothership
please god yes
agreed
i support the idea of doing somethingthe goon is right that bot programs will take like 30 seconds to adjustplus i have to wonder if the op has ever even mined in nullsec because any hulk out there is going to be set up to permatank double or triple bs spawns  youd need more than 1 bs to pop in to cause problemsrorqs already provide monster bonuses i do support requiring them to be on grid to provide the boni seems to me this should be the case for all gang links pretty dumb having unprobeable lokis boosting a gang on the other side of a systemanyways there have to be 50 fix mining threads over the past 5 years since it was created and has basically been unchanged if ccp gave a  theyd go thru them and brainstorm and workshop the ideas into something good but theyre tired of this game and more interested in wod and dustso it goes
i like the adaptive belt rat ideaeven putting the bot part of the issue aside it adds an interesting dynamic to the game double points because its added to a mindcrushingly dull but necessary part of the game
im in on this and i would like to extend it to include whspace making it a good idea to have guards on hand for those too
not bad overall a good ideathe only problem i have with adaptive rats would be newbies a couple week old character mining in a frig would have some issues with ratsother then that i love the idea of actually being able to pull off a low sec mining op i think if you where to take your ideaand merge it with my idea the mining problem could be fixed for the sake of gratuity heres a link to my ideafor a quick summery i suggested a more interactive form of miningpossibly even a new mining barge classsomething like a dread that can lay seige to asteroids what if these seige miners cause incursion spawnsmega bucks for pvprs and escorts as well as mega minerals for miners1 man awesome concept
this would do nothing to combat macro miningif the adaptive spawns were worth enough they would just add a macroed drake to kill them if they werent they would just be programmed to warp off when they spawned and return later worse case they just refit the macrohulks to tank the spawns
having bots scramed even if for a small time increases the chance for them to be caught by roaming gangs supportedofc they could fit wcs but at the expense of mining upgrades so it would still hurt botters bottom line
1scrams and faster stronger npcs must be a part of the solutionif nothing it will make them to loose some mining upgrades
proposal is to add remaining game time counter no matter what method you are paying withpreferably down to the hour
i am of course talking of thisi liked this feature a lot on sisi and it seems to me there are many likeminded people similarly disappointed with the lack of it in the 3rd part of the incursion deploymenti for one would immediately switch to using it and playtest the  out of itit was on sisi a few weeks ago so the code should be ready for deployment as it waseven if it wouldnt get many updates for some time being i am convinced that ccp really wants to overhaul the ui completely why refactor the ui background else so i would love to be able to playtest give feedback and supply you guys with bugreports to that endanything to get a nice looking usable customizable ui
supporting myself
they have to fix the obvious mistake they made first predicting its arrival in the summer patch
im not so sure cause all we have right now is an statement in general discussion that it was pulled for some reasonat least they could have updated the topic about it in the information portal
signed
confirming i would be much more likely to give money to ccp if they updated the ancient ui
it was removed as it had an exploit in it that would give an unfair advantage to people using it over people who didnt and yeah some information would be nice but just like their known issues page its devoid of useful information
i wanted to use that neocom so bad 
didnt know that but if thats true it kinda is understandable why it wasnt deployedstill some dev communication would be very much appreciated id hate to see this go the way of engine trails and cyno effects
throwing my support in here if it was indeed removed because of it being exploitable or a similar valid reason beyond simple complaints what should be done is find a way to fix it put it back on again as an optional feature and allow us to test it farther obviously if the exploit is simply because the new neocom is superior then it would have to be put back on sisi or applied to all players mandatory on tranq neither option is very good for proper testing but the eve ui needs a revamp its clunky and outdated
whoops forgot to check the support box
guys what are you guys whining about i just saw a ccp post yesterday saying that both the incursion code and the new ui is in this patch its just disabled because its still very experimental and they wanted to delay it till the 25th i dont think this thread has any point
supported
oh never saw that itd be nice if it was an official announcement maybe a link please
yeah link pleasei only saw thisso is it there and not activated or was it pulled its a very ambiguous statement at besti understand it as pulled which makes me afraid we wont hear of it again for a very long time if ever
definitely need proof on that ccp has already said the feature was pulled
i wrote recently a topic about a similar thing and that i have received me has surprised and very much it was pleasant to meread this post and open screenshot in it i think that changeable models of the ships would be the big loading on a server and client part of game but it would be magnificent possibility to change model of the ship we see now on an example of the t3 shipsi think that it would be better to put such tool in hands of productionrole playersto give new level of freedom and happiness for industry characters consisting in possibility not only to fill with the production the market but also fill it with unique production with own design  unless it isnt beautifultimes change it will be all the same game about spaceships but not only about them it will be also about pilots who control them 
i agree with your take on the matter and i like your ideas you posted i think your system would work and is indeed how many of the systems that do allow configuration work
customization 1alliance andor corp logo on hullsthat or text ill be honest i just want to see an oeg rokh with my other alliance is a red alliance on it
if all ship customizations are done locally on your own client based on your own locally stored settings then it will not add to lag in any way forcing other people to see and load your custom ship will add to lag in one word you can see the customisation  others cant see your customisation unless you make a screenshot or a video clip every individual can enjoy his own custom look while at the same time not creating additional server loadif its all done this way i can support ithowever some of the customizations mentioned are not such an easy task for example i can assume that changing turret positions or making every ship modular would require some major changes in the rendering engine so dont expect it to be implemented any time soon corporationalliance logos on ships and custom predefined paint jobs could be much easier to implement
speaking of the new character creatorlet me take my pants offwhen you go through the new character creator it wont let you take a picture unless you are wearing pants and shoesi want to teabag the universe and these pants are in the way
if ccp doesnt start fixing content that was hyped only last year then dumped for the new shinnythen well all end up on some pirate server somewhere playing apocryphacommit to fixing your broken releases
actually if you try to activate a remote repair module on a mission rat in high security space on tranquility today youll get a concordokken warning requesting confirmationthere have been a few times when i almost lost my mission because i targeted my remote repair modules on a rat instead of a fleetmate and the game asked me for confirmation
qft go ahead ccp make a decent change to the game
not supportedneutralrr are one of the biggest exploits currently ingamemake anyone ading a flagged even neutral rrs criminel or criminal npc go pouf instead
neutral rr dont get concorded to begin with changing it to concord them will break the game as you will then be able to get rr concorded without even getting yourself concorded people like you need to use your brain more and open your mouth less
supported the way it gets implemented will be open to abuse as ccp dont really have a clue
agreed
this could be carried over to all nonaggression defensive maneuvers in my opinion such as tracking links player assisting ewar this provided aggression counters are set and they become targets capable of being attacked but not criminal targets to be concorded i see it as a possible solution the reason for this is wardeccing fleets with nonfleet noncorpalliance rrewar assist which will then be leveraged to advantage in a given situation without the potential of being concorded direct aggression ewar would then be considered potential for concord but on the sent home level without ship destruction this way players could assist other individuals without directly being involved without being concorded for their efforts and losing there ships destructive aggression should be concordable not that which simply assists an attacking or defending ship concord should break up the fight and destroy the original attacking party not destroy everything on site with exception to the guy being ganked or the industrial wartarget being obliterated chances are hes not going to survive anyway if the target is the subject of a wardec they should be able to receive assistance this might save the wardec mechanism to some degree where as it stands its a freeforall griefing mechanismsupported
emphasis suppliedno these threads are ridiculous ccp is the one receiving subscription dollars and they are the ones who need to solve this problem
1this could be nice base for solving the problem
im fairly certain youve never been able to eject from a pod and in either case you can still selfdestruct it if you want to pod yourself
you could with incursion 11 it was an unintended feature
alright we all hate blobs hotdrops and just generally funsucking pvp many players hate pirates but everyone that pvps wants more tactics and skill to be involvedso here is the source of every pvp problem eve has ever hadkillmailsnow some of you are going to say how could killmails possibly be the source of all this bad pvp and my answer to that iskillmails encourage blobbing people dont want to lose people want to let other people know they lost even more so their solution is to bring anyone they can to every fight they attend so that they arent the one blowing up many people assume this is some aversion to losing ships and isk that leads to this mentality but what it is an ingrained idea that being on the killmail for something is a good thing no matter how many other people were also shooting at that same targetkillmails encourage gate camping gate camps are one of the oldest forms of piracy in the game and are still very popular gate camps are what happens when you want lots of killmails to bolster your killboard nobody ever really looks at how lame or onesided your kills are so you can be proud of having a hundred shuttles industrials or solo pvpers on itkillmails encourage jamming i was in a fight 6 to 1 recently myself being the 1 of course even with 2 eccm iis fitted i was still pretty much permajammed throughout the fight people use ecm and other ew to compensate for a lack of having an even bigger fleet would they have killed me without it absolutely but i could have taken one or two with me again the killmail whoring is to blamekillmails encourage hotdropping for much the same reasons as it encourages blobbing people want the easy killmail and bringing overwhelming force is the best way to get themso what are the benefits of keeping killmails being able to use them to generate a pay system for your security division is that enough hardlydo your part to bring fun back into eves pvp and support this move to completely remove killmails and anything like them from eve there is absolutely no reason to keep them and they take away what pvp is supposed to be abouthurting other playersi am valdore and im a pvp addict standing up against killmails
perfectly stated
kill mails are hardly the reason for blobbing and the use of the over powered ecm mechanicnot supported
what a well though out argumentseriously you use a negative of the argument as your pointon the op i dont see a problem with this if your a lowsy pilot and you lose a ship a day yet still manage to make ever op with guns blazing i really dont care what i do care is that some one sees your ship loses and gooes  ha ha you suck dude well what if that guys been flying the black bird for the fleets and is generaly one of the first ones to go
supported before kms the process of the fight mattered not just the outcome pvp was done for fun even if you lose now its about km farming in blobs and extreme risk aversion because itll mess up your kb record it sucked the fun right out of pvp pvp is now more like work youre farming kms in a campblob instead of farming isk the only difference is you kill a lone noob once per hour instead of a few rats per minute and is thus more boring than pve
you may have a point but you may not overall i dont support it the real factor in eve pvp is iskdamage at the end of the day you could delete all the killmail boards and tatics would still evolve to allow you to prevent isk damage to yourself and your corpalliance while maximizing isk damage against your enemiesthis includes gathering your fleet to be formidable against all kinds of situationsbecause when you warp in on one hostile you never really know if they are all alone in fact when youve got a nice fleet together you hope they arent but they usually are which is kinda sad even without a kb history a corp will quickly come to realize who the bestworst pilots are within their ranks based on participation and effectiveness in pvp situations with a kb history you can evaulate recruits before you accept them and gain intel on enemies before you fight them so i like them i do agree with you that gatecamping is kinda lame but thats about protecting borders and turf and the industrials and destoyers who get killed there are like civilians who dont understand they shouldnt haphazardly enter combat zones just because its a frakken combat zone they even get a warning if they havent turned it off because lowsec and wh and 00 are dangerous enviroments the groups there would rather get opposition and are expecting it but since they dont get opposed frequently they are prone to shoot at anything that moves at the end of the day i think kms are nice to have but arent everything the real driving force in eve is a desire to inflict iskdamage and prevent iskdamage and to do both in ways that are fun to you and your allies loosing isnt fun most of the time and winning is so go out there and winwinwin and that sensation can be felt over and over again without the precision metrics of killboards
what kind of isk damage is farming noob industrals off gatecamp besides isk factor was constant before and after km got implemented yet the nature of pvp changed a lot this can only point to presence of kbs the only thing that changed
whelp your opinions can safely be ignoredwe have orcas serving as empire pirate carriers we have seen the death of old style doomsdays the rise of ahacs the rise of drakefleet the end of battleships the return of battleships fighterbombers bomb launchers the end of sensor damps and the inevitable march of time that expands everyones skill pool and grinds down the very souls of men with repetitionand you insist that the only thing that has changed is killmails
only this time ppl wont have to worry about taking even one loss on their killboard without the risk to the killboard theres no reason to stack as many odds in your favor and if really wanted good fights like u said thats whatll happen and the best part u can stick with a frigate and voilano isk dmg to yourself whats that u might lose one without a killboard what r u so afraid of if anything ppl evaluate by sp and what the recruit can flyfit no one cares about ability since most pretty much jumped on the bandwagon and accepted blobbingpve ship farming so killboard stats r irrelevant to recruitment unless they have bad stats because they dont blobfarm pve ships aka take risk another reason why killmails just hinders pvp so what exactly is a low sec gate camp protecting cause sovereignty isnt claimable by players there and on the contrary they do expect oppositionthats why they have scouts on the other side of the gate to run from anything that might put up a fightisk damage is irrelevant even if ships were free and in the case of frigates they pretty much r most ppl wouldnt bother using them cause itll risk a killboard loss in order to win someone has to lose and when both sides become riskaverse to the point where they will not engage each other and just simply gank easier targets theres a problem ppl chestbeat about their quantity of kills not quality in fact any pirate smacking in local will do exactly that
wrong it should be the main factor but it isnt pirates dont kill to cost someone else isk alliances dont go to war to cost someone else isk they do these things to pad their killboards with killsit is the fps mentality in eve a game as far from being an fps as you can get and still be a singular interactive entity it is a well documented fact that statistics based on quantity of kills usually ignoring quality only serve to promote play styles that facilitate the further obtaining of those statistics at the cost of everything else pvp in eve is infected with this plague the first question anyone asks after a kill iswho got the killmailfollowed bysend me a copy andor link itplayers no longer care about the actual fight itself they only care about their name being on the kill mailthe kpd high would be gone allowing players to feel more comfortable losing i myself have a killboard record that most people would consider atrocious mainly because i dont wait for the odds to be stacked in my favor before i dive in i play for the fight not the killmails if everyone who currently plays only to keep their killboard score going up was suddenly unable to do so what do you think would happenim not against fleets im against their entire purpose being killmail farming there are entire corporations and alliances that exist only to farm killmails that is ridiculousthen just engage with part of your fleet or is that concept too foreign in eve the idea that someone might wait in reserve instead of everyone trying to  onto the killmail where is the downside to playing to have fun rather than to have a slightly better set of statsyes and without hard statistics things like legends can be born or destroyed nothing i see on a killboard impresses me and i certainly dont go through individual kills to find the actual fights worth knowing about there are plenty of other and better tools to evaluate potential recruits like what their previous corp thought of them killmails dont tell you anything useful really other than that a fight happened somewhere and someone blew upactually in my experience most of the time they arent looking for a real fight when one comes they bail if at all possible or hotdrop a rescue in some people do have that motivation but many more dontalmost every fight i actually had fun fighting ended up a loss for mekillboards arent necessary
because of killboardwhen you fail to provide a solution or even insight into a complex and multilayered problem use convoluted logic to prove that a single item is the cause of it all so you can focus your rage on it
yerp good idea
it is simple psychology people are generally more afraid of looking bad than actually being bad the current killmail system doesnt really weed out bad players from good ones so bad players look better on a killboard than they really are which only amplifies the problem but you go right on ahead and think there is a more altruistic reason for all this its kind of cute
although i agree the system is not perfect i must admit however killboards are extremely handy in many circustances although it encourages a few sorts of bad behaviorid like to see a system that a non combat ship can be rewarded as well such as a cov ops that scouts ahead for targets among others or even someone that baits a gang into gcc
if those are getting intel on enemies or checking out potential recruits it isnt worth keeping them for it
nice troll ill give 210 not that it really makes any sense to blame the state of the game life in the universe and perhaps even your personal problems all on one single symptom killmails but im sure youll find some epic supporters as for me opposed sorry
the mere fact that there were times where pvp was more fun in spite of the existence of kms is a first hint that there might be other reasons has it occured to you that changes in mechanics balancing and demographics might have a much greater impact on the state of pvp what killmails represent today is a symptom of that not a causeof course picking a single item and putting all the blame on it has its appeal as you can avoid having to come up with a true solution
310 a destroyer can enter your trolli never claimed every player in the game has killmailitosis but it is not a symptom since pvp revolves around itmechanics only change the tools used balancing only changes the flavor of the tools used and demographics are already what im talking about pvp is the way it is now because it always has been this way on one form or another since killmails existed and they always have to my knowledgeanyone who has ever played an fps or an mmo with some kind of ranking pvp system already knows what im talking abouti put the blame on the players the solution is on the killmails
the complete removal of killlossmails is a bit over the top but changes need to be madeperhaps killmails should be limited to like 10 pilots or those who inflicted very minimal damage shouldnt appear on the killmail there comes complications when electronic warfare ships and tacklers with like 2 webs come into the kill as they may not deal much damage but they sure are useful this could be sorted out though
no they dont next suggestion please
not supported we use killboards as a first line of defense to weed out terrible pilots and trust mekillboards will show if an applicant is a terrible pilot maybe not with 100 accuracy but some accuracy atleastit allows you to browse the pilots fitting history and evaluate if he has any idea on how to fit and fly hisher shipofc more than kb ratings count each of our pilot must demonstrate a solokill combat record to be admitted how will said pilot be able to prove himself to us that he infact has 5 solo kills if no combat record exists
nah its those killboards that give you 100 of the credit even if you do 2 of the damage if you are a slacker in the fight then you should look like a slacker on the killboardthis might hose tacklers and reppers though and we need to give our tacklers and reppers encouragementalso ewar is the new cap neuting people do it because it works i dont think that has anything to do with killmails
well in that vein making it so only the top damage dealer and possibly final blow shows on the killmail that might do some good basically making them useless except as competitions to see who can get one of those two spots i still think nuking them entirely is the best routeyou are incorrectdont we allsorry this is evedemonstration of this perhaps the only way it might work that way is if you judge a fit from a loss but then not everything would be in contextso does asking him to link his fits history is never a good gauge for the present without taking the present and history in contextone 1v1 can prove everything you need to know about himkillboards dont seem to care where you are on the kill but then there are a lot of killboards and nobody is going to use or even make one that will lower their score there is a reason those killboards dont existi agree in principle but my opinion of getting rid of them entirely overrides any relevance to that as far as im concernedit has everything to do with killmails why risk one ship out of ten dying to the solo guy and thus making your killboard status worse when all your ships can just carry ecm drones and make it impossible for him to be a threat
do i get a killmail for killing them
some good discussions herewe judge a fit from a loss if the applicant is deemed a good pilot and there is an odd fitting there we might inquire about it our pilots must demonstrate some willingness to die and having a combat record with one loss is not enoughhe can link his fits does not show that he has ever used said fits as they can be imported into game also how can we tell if the pilot is telling the truth its always a two pronged approach first you verify that the pilot is capable next he must be a match for our current pilots and fit mentally into our grouperrrrmmm noour applicants must demonstrate a real ability an arranged 1v1 proves nothing and does not tell if the pilot has common sense and is clever we require a track record where the pilot has killed a ship bigger than the class hes flyingno way to do this without a killboard or a way to track a pilot combat record
im sorry but i disagree for one people use ew to have an advantage over another group whether its jamming or cap sucking second gate camps hapen because the group wants to blow stuff up there is no honor in having 100 shuttles on your killboard it was just done to blow stuff up
no falcon being op is to blame caldary ewar being op like  is to blame
before going on to why removing killmails would be bad lets look at your hypthosis firstdont you think its funny that pretty much every person some very smart ones among them agrees that what is making pvp less fun are the current mechanics balancing issues and demographics i mentionedpeople dont want to lose anyway in eve death has consequences killmails are not the reason people try not to die the largest blobs are made by 00 alliances which fight over territory moons and supercaps even without killmails theyd still be blobbing each other as much as possible because they are fighting over something and because the mechanics dont promote other courses of action oh but you have been missing out on a lot of good stuff that motivates pirates or gate campers ransoms tears fat loot or the sheer fun of shooting somebody in the facetoo easy that still sounds like 1 people dont want to die and 2 balance issueright it could not have anything to do with bigger alliances wanting to curb stomp small entities in their backyard while they are still weak ie strategical reasons nor would it have anything to do with the ease and speed with which you can currently drop cynos on people note the proposals on cyno changes in ahwait your alliance pays pvpers for doing what they dook now lets talk about removing killmailshaving played fps games in clans that managed to place players in the world cyber games multiple times i can assure you that comparing fps games and eve in this context is wrongin fps a single death is meaningless but rankings are a vital function in a competitive community in eve a single death can have a lot of consequences while rankings dont make sense do not officially exist and have zero influence on the game mechanics per se kilmails and killboards can hardly be called ranking systems even if some try to do it but rather activity and event trackers the problem with killmails is that they are the only token players get for being involved in a confrontation it is the only way for outside people to grasp the events that happened and the implied consequences you take that away and you lose a great deal of what details eves history your suggestion is akin to going back from written history to wordofmouth propagation past events get degraded to lore and are eventually forgottenthat is the meaning of killmails for eve as a whole on an individual level they are the only and i agree bad measure of pvp success and only lasting evidence of that event people are competitive by nature you have to give them something for epeen measurement some people only pvp for the killmail which i dont have a problem with pvp is what drives the eve universe and less pvp would be badso while i think the current killmail system has many flaws you cant take it away if you dont replace it with something better
i hate killmails personally because they give a very petty reason to pvp in this game i would like to see pvp to be more about isk power and every now and then for the lulz rather than epeen sizei support getting rid of killmails for this reason
1 agreed pvp should be about strategic control of territory not decorating a boardthe ego of a few people is so not worth gimping pvp
i think we should go back to the people dont want to lose part which is where i think you were most correct i agree that there is some aspect of your argument that is valid and that would be the whole killboard padding part of pvp how many of those killsfights would happen if killmails didnt exist im actually pretty sure almost all of them killboard padding is something ive always heard of in a mythical sense yet never been truly witness too in the real sense lots of people say other people do itthere are lots of reasons to pvp one of my best losses doesnt even show up on battleclinic because i was brought down by a gate gun the fact that i was engaging a target that had wardecd a friends corp isnt even on their as they never fired back or had a chance too i had them ecmd out with my scorp to allow their target to get away it didnt work but it was the most honorable fight ive been in orcas are incredibly slow to align unfortunatelythere were no blobs involved in that one and the brutix killed the orca and i get concorded for my efforts with the amaar gate guns help no blobs on either side even for the one that was padding their killboard going after a wt in an industrial in highsec after wardeccing an indy corp foolish for the orca to be flying of course but he figured the wardeccing corp only had one pilot it did but they just ran a locator agent regularly so they knew when someone was moving the interesting part is that the wardeccing party returned everything from the kill which with insurance just about cleared a new orcai think the actual killmail issue is a small one and one that will exist regardless if its smack talk in local or for the lols it will still happen with regularity maybe ive missed something there are still plenty of roaming gangs in lowsec arent there small highsec wardeccing gank corps nullsec ganksquads to be honest ive only ever seen a real blob once and that was because i went out looking for it everybody knew where to find it of course so i popped on my alt and flew into it i was unfortunately late to the party and the only thing left were coalition alliance corps from the other side of empire guarding the gates one of those gaste blobs blew me up in short order and podded me safely back to highsec where i belonged i suppose i never really saw the blob just the little one on the gate that little was some 6070 coalition ships half afk and half firing on everything that popped through not blues of course but everyone else they got quite a few kills that night most of them neutrals in shuttles and frigates and the likedespite what it may seem thats not killboard padding its preventative maintenance of a sort keeping the battlefield clear while their coalition allies clean up the mess meaning get the loot dropping ships coming in prevents losing loot to them its simple enough logic really and who can blame themso while i dont entirely disagree with you ill have to decline support for now
fully supported
and none of this requires the use of killmails require the applicant to fly with you for awhile before being allowed to join or even shadow him in a recon this works as good or better than killboard perusalit will be pretty obvious once you move passed the written test wont itthen use a trial period killboards wont tell you anything about thatnaturallywho says it has to be arrangedfair enough but this is only necessary because there are killboards for you to useso now you are going to tell me that killboards are enforcing honorable pvp troll muchi wont argue the ecm mechanics as it really isnt what this topic is about but i do think eccm needs an adjustment you might be surprised at how many people freely admit they use ecm only to maximize their killboard record though im not just making this stuff up
you are wrong i dont want to lose not because of some imaginary fear of looking bad at some faceless nobodies who would look at my killboard i dont want to lose because of the isk losspvp is fun but every time i lose a ship i know there will be a lot of boring ratting to earn that isk to buy a new ship
dont you think it is funny that i already knew the people who would be the most adamant about keeping killboards and killmails ingame are the same ones who are addicted to them im not talking about the reason big groups blob im talking about the reasons individuals blob do you really think the player base would tolerate the insane lag if there was no chance of ever being on a killmaili know what motivates pirates the real ones anywayas i said mechanics only determine the way people go about doing what they are already going to do what does curb stomping small alliances have to do with hotdropping nyx fleets in low secmy alliance nothis part is hearsay and grand standing tell that to kpd addicts they are rampant in eve too btwit doesnt matter if they officially exist if everyone on them knows about themmaybe that is another problem needing to be addressed separate from this issuei think you are overstating the importance of killmails for this none of the eve history i know has anything to do with killmails if history is so important to us we need historianseve is a sandbox or is supposed to be one giving people a reason to fight is always a bad thing in a sandbox let them make up their own reasonslike what what could it possibly be replaced with that wont just be the same problem under a different guise
it does happen it happens a lot more than you might think even and a lot of fights that happen now wouldnt happen if killmails were nuked because a lot of people fight only because of their killboardthat sounds like a reason to remove them all of those exist primarily to get fast and easy killmails nobody has any actual fun ganking someone else its fun for nobody but people will generally always go for the killmail if that is the choice they faceas before i didnt say everyone pvps only for killmails there are plenty of other reasons to fight i just dont think killmails should be one of them
then why are you fightingrisk is the name of the game
because i know that if i blow someone up they will lose isk and will have to deal with boring part of the game
dude seriously there are dozens of reasons one of the most important being that in eve fights have consequences and their implications so you do want your alliance to win a fight your alliance corp and friends expect you to help hell you might even be looking for the fight because you might actually have fun lag or not im really starting to have doubts about your claimed pvper statusoh so you classify them into real and fake ones good boy why dont you give examples of each when they asked bill clinton why he had his shenanigans with monica he replied because i could some goes for super cap fleets in low sec and because its a bit of fun to distract from the usual nonevents in 00 again what allows supercaps to be in lowsec are a game mechanic and mechanics can be changedi think your lack of vision is limiting your ability to grasp what your proposed change would cause it shows again when you cant see the connection between eves history and killmails as the only current account of what happened in battles which are the main events shaping 00 you lost all remaining credibility here you have no clue how 00 worksany better system would not remove the simplistic pvp goal of getting your small trophy for a kill it would address the issues of killmails as event reporting so you would still whine and all that is purely academical as ccp probably wont do jack about it
isk damage is stupid too hey lets lose 8 t1 destroyers but since we managed to alpha a pricey ship we winproblem isnt killmails or isk damage problem is ccp doesnt know how to design a game for crap and didnt give any meaningful objectives for pvp instead they dumped it on the players and called it sandbox gameplayyou want to fix km whoring put meaningful hardcoded factions in with stats that affect the world we have four nations at war with any number of smaller pirate and npc factions none of them matter for pvp not even their militias
so bascially if the applicant were to farm bigger mission ships or kill alts flying said ships hes fit for your corp
thanks for the reply valdorewe dont use trial periods the vetting process is a bit stricter for the tuskers than most others we do encourage younger pilots to roam with us but they will not be let in on a trial basis they can join our public vent and chat and roam with us but they have to be serious about it and demonstrate and prove their abilites by showing us their combat record you dont get solo aboveclass kills by roaming with other tuskers and the above class kills are strictly requiredmy point is for a small warfare lowsec pvp corp like us killmails are a measure of how good we are at the game industrialists and mission runners brag about how many isk and ships they have we gotta have something to brag about we dont have territory to measure our provess so we rely on the only semiunreliable scale to gauge our skills in eveits needed for us to attract the kind of people were looking for skille people with a knack for blowing up other people carebears ad pvppirates alikewithout a killboard and killmail i think many would lose interest because thats the only real measure to gauge ourseles as professional scumbagsevery game needs something to aspire for 00 have their territorial claims highsec residents have their isks and fancy ships lowsec people might aspire all of the above but the natural habitat dictate another aspiration to be the best sleezebag in the universe a game without any sort of measurable achievement is a bad game cs withut rankings wow without epic gear and massive mounts its akin to removing endgame content as far as i am concerned ive tried alot of different stuff in my career as a capsuleer and i certaily dont want the competetive gauge to disappear
this is a bad ideasupporting it purely for the crying it would generate
i am in favor of trying out a change to the kill mail system i would like to see the negativity removed from the system for it to be positive only i do think there is big psychological impact pvp suffers from because of kill mailswhat i would do instead of completely removing them is have it so you get points per kill add an in game 30 day leader board tweak the insurance system and an optional graphic to display kills on the nose of your ship
hi my name is hellokitty online while were at it lets remove explosions and ship death because it makes people sad
this is stupid killmail system must be improved if anyhting not killed wth if there is a problem burning records of this problem mails wount solv3e it
i hate blobs i hate ecm i hate logi blobs i hate gate campsi do not think removing killmails has any chance at all of changing any of this if i did i would support thisif you want to reduce these problems nerf ecm and add a stacking penalty to remote repping blobs and gatecamps are just a matter of learning to deal with them and frankly i like other people camping gates cos you dont need to look very far to find a fightthis is a really bad proposal and id love to see it stop here
no more killmails count me inliang
kill mails are and have always been stupid and not used for any useful purposethe only feasible purpose for them is dividing loot between a gang but i dont think people really do that just pass it or first come first take
not supported the reasoning is weak all you are saying is that kill mails encourage killing there is nothing wrong with that
im not really sure if i didnt explain it right or if you just dont understand to simplify  i support testing the removal of the pilots id of the ship which was destroyed to see if people who are currently disinclined to pvp would relax a bit about pvpat any rate i love pvp so if sacrificing the display of how small other peoples epeens are would lead to me getting more pvp im all for it i would think that you would be too
wrong thats not what hes saying hes saying it encourages riskaversion for fear of messing up kb ratio which is quite the opposite
wrong all reasons given are reasons to kill and not reasons for kill mails no one cares about kill mails in a fight players care for the killsome get it wrong and think kill mails should be farmed but so does the op and one cannot help all
if no one cares about killmails then they should be removed if they care about the kill thats good since theyre still getting the kill just without the killmails im glad we agree there
read again i wrote  in a fight
i dont like this idea very much some aspects of eve already feel like a job more than a game and i would absolutely hate it if more of that feeling crept into the gamei think ive already posted my view on bots and what ccp should do to get them out of eve it is to include security coding to detect botprograms and inhibit them force them to shut down and if they cant force those programs to shut down it needs to invalidate the eve client itself and force a repairreinstall process until the bots are removed if people are too busy trying to fix their clients or get their bot software to run they arent able to log into eve and then you dont have bottingultimately its that simple they basically need a programing security team to develop antibot softare and keep pace with rmt hackers the problemreason they havent done this and other mmos have is that they arent as big as some of the other companies but they are growing and i think they will focus on this once they are done with incarna and dust
do you have a bot alt tc
i cant say i agree with that and even if they are being flagged as a botter would pretty much mean they cant go into empire at all that would mean that they would need an alt account for transport and trade if they dont have one already and that means more money for ccp
i guess this was part of the new shortcut changes possibly theres a technical reason it had to happen but id certainly support ccp throwing some dev time into getting the overview sorting freeze back
response from a filed bug reportwe are already aware of this problem and have added your bugreport to the existing issue in our defect tracking systemthere is hope

hmmm good point you can effectively guarantee being within docking range of a station if you warp to zero on a bookmark right in the middle of the station but this would encourage players to start making large collections of bookmarks deep inside the outer boundary sphere of stations just like players in years past would make warp to zero bookmarks 15 km off of stargatessupported increase the range at which stations accept docking requests to 25km

hi i would like to see the 8 slot of marauders opend to fit in 2 tracktors and 2 salvagerssince the release of the noctis marauders dont make sense anymore becouse your faster with faction bs and noctisincreased speedrange for tracktors and success chance for salvager would be nice 2

id like to see their sensor strength unnerfed so they serve a pvp purpose but your idea is also decent as a supplement
10
not supported notics cant fight a marauder can fight and salvage at the same time saving you the ship swap and 2nd trip its not as good as a dedicated salvager for balancing reasons
who sais a noctis cant fight and if you ever had a marauder trying to salvage with 1 salvager for 8 cycles t2 salvager you know what im talking about
thats the point if you want fast salvage come back and do it after mission with dedicated salvaging fit you lose no time for salvaging while running mission so any large wreck you grab in the process is free net gain you just wanted to have the cake and eat it too
maybe change marauder tractor bonus to smartbomb radiusthis way marauder can really handle missions better then less dedicated competitors because they cannot be tackled
i support this
this may have a strong influence on their viability for pvp alsoi would like to see a powergridcpu buff as well as a base increase to their sensor strength
sensor strength should stay about the same
if somebody is scrambled they should not be able to use stargates to jump pvp at gates is far less fun than it good be because of this imo
since this is a scifi mmo most mechanics have an iu reason behind them so what would be the iu reason that a scram would prevent the gate from jumping the personalso would you like to make concord angry for you interfering with the gates operation because it is indeed the gate that is jumping the person
get a friend with a fast point to stay on the other side of the gate ping pong can be fun if done right by both sides
counterproposal make scrambling the gate prevent anyone from using it
have you pvped much
this is a bad idea it will make reduce pvp
bad idea if i ever saw one
i like all that is hardcoreit should prevent from docking and bubbles should prevent entire fleets from jumpingi see rivers of tears and the rivers start right here in this thread

hitting the rookie systems yeah i wouldnt do that but you are right about hitting the trade hubs i think that would definitely get people involved
the best thing they could do is make them hit all the ice mining systems to kill off all the macros that is what i would love to see all the hours i spend mining ice and other guys just turn on their bots it will make it fair again for a while at least
want to see real tears they should invade all those safe sanctum farming hubs deep in the blue ass of large alliances kill off the bounty disable cyno and make them run gated sites that dont let in caps

i strongly dispute that my capital philosophy is short sighted  though i freely admit that it is geared mostly towards fights where individuals actually matteri very specifically did not say that it would make everything above them obsolete what i said was that they would utterly obsolete capitals think dreads or be so utterly unwieldy that theyd never be where they need to be outside of preplanned capsupercap ganks truly your proposal is nothing but an eft warriors dream so unwieldy that it will a theoretical counter against supercaps unwieldy theoretical counters are worse than no counters because they remove hope that ccp can per persuaded to fix the problemthree things it is already brought to light that a supercapital fleet doesnt really need a support fleet doomsdays are a pretty poor counter to massed cruisers you went to considerable effort to illustrate how they would be immune to supercapitalsi am not at all saying that i want to simply bring a bigger hammer to hit supercaps in fact im rather arguing the opposite  adding the ability for supercaps and caps to bypass supercap ewar immunity would quite literally be encouraging smaller ships to hit bigger oneslet me know how that works out with swarms of ecmneut drones remote ecm burst and a pair of neuts going at you i think youre so focused on having 5000 people at your back that you dont understand the concerns of individuals fighting individualswe are hardly eve noobs  and all of us have a better handle on the game than you do i already addressed your system and how it provides a cycle i also addressed how i am in fact providing a cycleexcuse mewhy yes i agree capitals tackling supercapitals supercapitals tackling supercapitals bring more people to the fight and more will die a glorious orgy of destruction im not seeing the problem hereliang
sure i think any sensible person would agree with you however this was presented as a tweak to current gameplay mechanics  and as such i tend to agree it would be a good move i dont pretend it is the only necessary move though i will say that bobbehs suggestion is outright lunacythe root of that problem is that supercaps have enormous amounts of ehp  enough that theyre simply game breaking the arguments go that they need to survive multiple doomsdays or survive long enough to make a difference when the other side jumps in 100 dreads imo thats totally bull  supercaps should die when forced into overwhelming odds but enormous ehp combined with ewar immunity and fantastic damage projection conspires to make them i win buttonsliang
i predict there will be the day ccp nerfs super carriers and all super carrier pilots will have wished they would have supported this
agreed pvp should be about strategic control of territory not decorating a board
this is an reply to the remove killmail thread somehow it ended up as a thread on its own please delete

tldronly versioni appreciate that ccp dont want folk to fundamentally keep changing their toons at a whim yet when incarna becomes a reality please let us change the nonfixed portions of our character as much as we like such as hairdo  lipstick people do actually change those things in reallife too you know
this
the solution to that would be to have the ship only able to pick updrop off cargo while docked it would require some rejigging of the cargo system a la the primae with its pi materials and command centre bays but with that caveat attached i support this proposal
not that i am biased or anything sits on a hundred data interface blueprints but the idea that data interfaces can be reused does not make them great for the market since theoretically speaking you only need one and it will last forever selling them is not going to make anyone richwhen doing invention with them they should be damaged permanently say 5 with every use until they are destroyed as in tech 2 laser crystals barring the 5 part it would go some way for making data interfaces sellable as well as the items they are made from secondhand parts power couplings etc
they just need to reduce the drop rates of the bpcs to what they where and the price will go back up after a year or so
1  needs to be reworked

agreed
it alliance 2011please dont nerf our ability to run away 
hate to burst your bubble here but theyre not a strong as you thinkaccording to some brief calculations the sbus have some 40000000 ehp which ill admit sounds like an incredible amount the fact is it really is only a small amount when paired against a most formiddable adversary the dreadnoughtin siege mode a single caldari phoenix with 3 citadel torpedo launchers using rift citadel torpedos can strip down this massive ehp toting bad boy in about 1 hour and 45 min three of them could do it in a little over half an hour though that is realistically unneccessary overkilltheyre not intended to be dealt with by gangs or blobs theyre expected to be handled with the right ship for the job you dont tear down an office building with a lawn tractordeploying 3 defensive fleets with one phoenix or equivalent in each is the way to handle sbu siezure of a system it utilizes the fleet framework and various other game mechanics to help maintain and control sovereignity in a given system it allows for 3 hours on each sbu to allow fleets to move into position and takedown sbus it should take longer perhaps but the principle is there it is a solid mechanic that is easy to use
i dont think theyre too strong just boring the csm and ccp appear to agree if youve read recent minutes sitting shooting through unnecessary amounts of ehp is less entertaining than at fairly short intervals shooting far smaller amounts and doing something else in between be it interdiction skirmishing or whateverthe change would simply be a more dynamic and interesting mechanic the current one isnt broken just notfun
i posted this in ideas discussion a little back but there isnt a lot to be discussedbasically id love to see factiondeadspaceofficer turret to be given t2 turret textures with lights or give them the same lights in a different color simple illumination map swap the rationale is that faction guns are more expensive then t2 so they should be at least just as rewarding to look at this is also extremely easy to implement as its a simple texture swap
not a nerfthe removal of about 60000 mouse clicks a weekyour rsi and medical insurance will thank ccp
even if it was a nerf it wouldnt really be less output means that prices rise
sometimes i wonder if people really want a mechanic that would let them 1vit alliance and win i dont want that and im not even in a large alliance i agree that blobbing is unforunately human behavior that ccp is unable to counteract the very invention of alliances were something that formed first by human behavior and then as designed into the game and alliances have armadas and they lurk out in the deeps of sov space and they push the eve serverclients relationship to its absolute limits they have always made their own rules out there and ccp has to come up with something like the csm to keep up i think the absolute best thing ccp has done to limit blobs is the creation of warmhole space people still fly in gangs but its small fleets vs other small fleets because the terrian extremely limits large fleets from chaining wormholes and remaining intact if you havent tried it you should its the festivus for the rest of us
not true problem with eve at the moment is that there is no alternative objectives require focused firepower which leads to blobs as long as the most optimal solution is having more firepower blobs will continue blobs are there because of system making it possible up to a limit where everything goes to im not talking about blob when your enemy has more firepower than you im talking about numbers where game system starts to fail ccp has to take a stance on this sandbox or not eve is a system based on limited resources it cant never has and never will scale indefinitelywhat we have now isplease visit your user settings to reenable imagesefficiency is linear with number of players effectively no loss until limit is reached when everything breaks numbers are best tacticstrategywhat we need isplease visit your user settings to reenable imagesefficiency should grow slower with more players added it becomes more efficient to pursue multiple objectives tacticsstrategy wins over numbers
i would like to see mining drones taken one step fartheras in mining sentery dronestech 1 same as tech 1 mining lazertech 2 same as tech 2 mining lazeri know i know your going wtf right i just think it could be a cool addition as bs with large drone bays could field this giving differnt options to hulk for miningand mybe just mybe scs would be pushed into mining in there off time reather then hot droping every little ship they can find mybei am a max hulk pilot so dont get me wrong i love the hulk but hell man after a few years of mining in one i would like a change of ship with out feeling like i am totaly gimping myselfi also dont fly capts but do understand this would be a huge boon to them as well and when ever ccp dos neft sc as sooner or latter there most likely going to have to this could help with the sting alittle
ohmygod
itburns92472 clones and 45 cats where destroyed by the viewing of this post
ccp has mandated that no ship will mine more than the hulk reference the original mining upgrades fiasco keep dreaming but this will never happen
o kk nope i did not know that thx u  it was just an ideal no bs that i know of even with this would out mine the hulk just edge alittle closer it could be balanced so long as there not usable by caps some storyline that there advance drone procers are more tuned with fighterfighter bombers and there for unable to interface with mining sentery drones or something i dont know
wow i just ran some numbers a sc with tech 2 mining drones mines as much as a hulk with tech 2 stripersmax skills on boththe main advange of the hulk is it can get boosted but and check this if your using a orca and say 4 hulks thats 5 ships it is right about the same as 5 hulks or 5 sc mining you ether have to have the rorqual deployed or have more then 4 hulks geting boosted by a orca to out mine scs as isnow i ask you whats easyer to take out 1 orca and 4 hulks or 5 sc becouse they both mining at around the same speedthats some food for thought
fix this and youve fixed the macro issue
would do nothing botter would simply open one man corp and jump corp when wardecced
please allow us to disable the loading of character portraits as they jump into systemthis should include the readdition of the dont load portrait on click optionthis is obviously overhead that is not needed during the critical time of system jumpsespecially when more then 100 players are involved
im guessing team gridlock didnt know about this changeeither way get rid of it kthx
im sorry but this is not the source of your problems the character portraits do not all load when you change systems they load well as they please it seems there are plenty of times that i change from corp to local chat and several of the images havent bothered to loadfor that matter a session change to amarr 205 last time i jumped in took less than a second
thats nice i guess that loading images is not bandwidth or io they magically just appear
i would like to propose adding a temporary pass that allows members of a group to enter a mission that has an acceleration gate it gets really old when you are minding your own business doing missions and people come in to ninja salvage and try to bait you into a gank this measure would allow for those not interested in pvp to operate in relative peace no acceleration gate let them scan me down and play there games acceleration gate only members of my group that have the temporary pass are authorized through thank you for your consideration
i suport this idea
shameless pluga while ago i posted thoughts on how to correct some of the repeated 00 issues i think my proposal here addresses the following at least partially1 works towards taking the blob out of sovereignty warfare using incentives rather than fiat eg insystem ship caps2 makes it easier for small groups to claim space by shrinking the scale of sovereignty from systems to individual planets moons and asteroid belts 3 introduces an efficient pricing mechanism for sovereignty costs which takes into account the level of activity in the system and its perceived value prices for holding space can be made to go up by reducing activity via small gangs 4 introduces an escalating mining system which optionally extends the career arc for miners 5 disconnects pos from infrastructure and makes them much simpler to anchoroperate6 make 00 more selfsufficient below is a muchshortened version of the original proposalmake sovereignty contingent on control of colonies on the surface of planets moons and asteroid belts belt stations to be claimed a world has to be habitable based on factors such as temperature air pressure etc which are rigged with probabilities that make few worlds habitable by default habitability factors can be changed by alliances at great cost in isk time and effort to create new habitable colony sites however the habitability factors will revert if not maintained pruning feature to prevent proliferation the lowest level of sovereignty would be individual planets moons and belts rather than systems colonies populations would naturally grow given various circumstances which allows for greater and greater amounts of infrastructure that could either be restricted to alliance members or rented out to nonalliance players based on their population colonies would generate personnel in the form of colonists can be used to increase the population of other colonies or recruits can be trained into troops for sovereignty warfaretroops have cyclical costs associated with ownership eg daily weekly or monthly which would act as an isk sink troops are functionally active while on a colony even if no pilot is directing them to claim sovereignty on a given colony an alliance must control the majority of the population which means killing off the defending troops using troops they have transported from their colony via ship the rate of elimination of troops would be capped at some number thereby disallowing rapid sovereignty flipping unless the colony is poorly defended beyond transporting large numbers of troops and preventing enemy ships with interfering with the same huge fleets would be unnecessary for sovereignty warfare as there would not be a single target on which maximizing dps would be particularly helpful eg pos tcu besides enemy ships themselves troopontroop battles would decrease colonies populations based on the lengthsize of the battle thereby reducing the ability of the defending colony to produce new troops and sustain infrastructure infrastructure in an area would wax and wane based on player actions relating to things like exploitable resources and war the index system could be reworked and linked with minimal troop to population ratios for sovereignty claims in order to provide a strong financial incentive to use claimed space particularly if it contains highlypopulateddeveloped coloniesinfrastructure would take the form of satellites that can be anchored near colonies based on population which would take over most from pos leaving them with basics like mining and storage delinking infrastructure from pos would allow for greater variability in the former and simplicity in the latter pos could simply be sold as mining and storage platforms as opposed to towers with various combinations of modules
it seems to me that the current scheme of skills training is magnificent and doesnt need changesdevelopers of game perpetuum couldnt invent anything better than has invented ccp and have created an absolute clone but with movement on a surface of a planet and small cosmetic changes titles shop system overview an targeting method a tree of skills even the prices for timecodes at them on a site were identical to that on a site eveonline but are crossed and written hardly more low nearbyfor that game didnt seem an absolute clone the perpetuum developers it was necessary to change a little an model of skills trainingas a result has quitted almost too most but in my opinion inconveniently
i completely agree with point 1 its just simple common sensepoint 2  not sure about the remainder of the war but the repper should at the very least become a viable war target for at least 15 minutesas for point 3 does each station have a set docking range are do they varyfor example if you undock from a station at 30km will it be 30km everytimeif it is static for each station then i would leave things as they are its down to the player to research each station and know what the docking range is
go check out how its in low sec or 00 maybe
nah the 15 minutes is hardly effective simple thing is that when a repper choses sides in a war why only be flagged for 15 minutes there are certainly more than enough people who will have a pretty load of neutral reppers easy to cycle them thenyou choose a side your stuck with it as long as the restand no i have undocked at station where i could fly away from for quit a bit before the meters started to kick in whereas other stations i undocked and after setting course away from the station not much after that the counter startedow and on a sidenotei live in 00 and its pretty easy there when it comes to neutrals or hostiles both get shot no need for a timer

ya there are cats rye
fyi ccp have admitted that there is a bug currently effecting a large no of amarr characters which results in a hood being applied irregardless of player choice this includes yours truly other character renders are not working as players have saved i suggest wait until this patch settles down andor incarna is released in full before worrying too much about other character portraits etc
i looked at this a short time ago  about a week or so i came up with an idea but it doesnt appear workable with how i envisioned it to operate ill drop it here so you can see what i meanfirst  a new module that only fits on dreadnoughts drone supressoran ecm based module with a 25 strength enough to jam any fighter bomber but with a very limited range that works like a smartbomb 10 second jam 20 second duration  only 1 module fit per ship it provides extended protection from drones to dreadnoughts so dreads could be used to threaten super carriersthe problems fbs orbit range to target is 75km  big problem thats a large reaching ecm effect and i didnt want anything that needed major rework by ccp fbs rof is 15 seconds  with 2s lock times 10s cant lock  12s lost out of 20s net effect is 75 reduction in the dps a super carrier can deliver on a capital class target i estimated roughly 60 would keep a super carrier able to kill a few dreads that lacked logistics support 75 is too much of a damage reduction would have worked with 4s fire rates but not as slow as fbs seem to haveetca bunch of little things just added upit was a different approach to the super carrier issue not a direct gut it across all areas they work more buff something so it can face the beast and put a bit more hesitance into supercarrier pilots think how many thorax would be required to take out an ishtar as the theme cost wise  the differences are in the same range as dreads vs supercarriersi think the theme of buff here to threaten there is still a solid approach but my idea just doesnt cut it perhaps the theme can be taken up elsewherei really hate nerf it as the solution when that means the supercarriers lose massively anytime a pilot climbs into one better to have something capable of threatening the ship so that threat can be watched for and dealt with as it shows without making the main ship less in all aspects of its use
i have always liked the idea of dreads being able to use a new type of bomb launcher at a longer range but only in siege so each dread gets an extra high slot where they can use bombs in siege however these bombs would be used for antisuper cap rather than anti sub cap though this could turn out to be a little op it could be fun for dreads d
the size of the teaspoon is not my estimate it is the size reported by meissa anunthiel the so called target of the spoon soon after the nonevent took place you will find the url link below perhaps youd care to argue size with herpost 22 of the thread found here
ankh was advised by mynxee not to post on the topic mynxee was of the opinion that it would do no good and only serve to fan the troll flames higher given the history of the last six months mynxees advise was very good and based upon excellent observationi would expect someone of your bravery to roll with the majority on any given subject the great majority of people posting against ankh are trolling flamers excited by the spectacle of a good roast and do not care what the facts show or the observations of the people who witnessed the nonevent theyre more interesting in inciting the pitchfork and torch riotas for the rest of your wannabe act check out the bottom of post 687windjammer
not willing to come sit and in person and chat on the subjectnot willing to post with your main eitherwhatever your reply if it is not with your main or a private message to arrange a meeting then you need say nothing elseank is suffering what she brought on herself i do hope she loses everything she was using eve as a stepping stone for however i have no wish to see her go thru career deathshe needs to talk to a professional or two maybe even some antipsychotics i am not referring to spoongate i am referring to her posts about pvpers which i did bother to keep up on she deserves what she gets and it wont be a lawsuit in her favoryou are a troll you are flaming and causing general frustration nothing has changed with all your babbling misleading posts ank has said many things that show her to be unstable she had no business being in the csm now she is not and wont be againgo find another cause because ank is a lost cause
1 what damage im a software developer in rl i know what it is 2 pointing out that someones behavior in a certain situation is unacceptable is not slander which in this case would be libel not slander libel has to be proved to be false which in this case is an opinion on my part according to the laws of the netherlands i am allowed to express my opinionso youre one of those people who think you can claim that you were employed by someone if you worked with them on something in rl i work with multiple other companies on committees but i cant put all those other companies under my employment history its really rediculous that she put it under her employment history it shouldnt have been there if a potential employer sees ccp under her employment history and calls to verify she was employed by them they will say that she was not employed by them thus she should not put it under her employment history
why would i want to allow you the privilege of hiding in a private conversation i prefer to humiliate you where theres a chance others can see itits not convenientits not need that drives me i write because i wish toyou hope she loses everything and yet you have no wish to see her go through career death color me puzzled i dont understand the distinction you seem to see between the twosince youve been arguing spoongate ive offered arguments on spoongate if you have other information show me convince me the people who work with ankh have made statements indicating your belief is incorrect regarding ankhs mental stability and im more inclined to believe them than i am someone who hasnt worked with hereva does not deserve this perpetual thread of persecution it serves no purpose and has been going on for 6 damn monthsim not trolling im not flamingwell not for the most part im posting quotes within context and giving the links to the threads the quotes came from in other words the truth and presenting it in a way the reader can verify for themselves ie you dont need to believe me go read it for yourselfit worries me a little to think that i might be causing general frustration i wouldnt want to cause you or others mental anguish id hate to think of you gritting your teeth and banging your head against a wall i sure wouldnt want you to get so excited about this that you made a mistake that cost you your favorite ship in a truly humiliating fashion that sort of stuff would bother meif you dont want to read what i post dont if you want me to stop responding to your allegations against ankh stop making them or come up with something i cant refutewindjammer
well crud i think youre right it would be libel its printed rather than oral though im sure theres been plenty of voice communication1 damage through loss of potential revenue could be a rough case to prove but its within the realm of possibility if one can afford the attorney2 if you and others limited themselves to opinions such as that was unacceptable sure maybe repeatedly advertising someone as mentally unstable insane and characterizing what she did as an act of uncontrolled violence knowing full well theres no proof of that yeah that might work in a suithowever it would be ill advised of ankh to pursue a lawsuit against people who have been doing this the first thing an attorney is going to consider is is there enough money here to make the case worth pursuing something tells me the answer is no that having been said an attorney would be much more likely to go after ccp if heshe thought they had a fair chance at winning or getting a settlement argument could be made along the lines of ccp providing a venue for people to attack ankh etcby the way when i was writing what you quoted i was thinking of zero rather than yourself you havent been doing this for six months have youwindjammer
i can see some of your point on this one but the csm is somewhat different than what i think youre describing as your own work experienceif i understand you correctly you work for one company and interface with others towards a goal that mutually benefits your company and the others in that case the company which is employing you is paying you to work on these committees and thus you have only the one employer instead of being considered a contractor doing work for a number of companies do i have that rightthe csm on the other hand was created by ccp and works exclusively for ccp and it is a lot of work ankh also gives explanation of the csm in her cv immediately following the employment section though she does not indicate it is a volunteer positionif youd worked for the peace corp for a year or two youd put that on your resume wouldnt youwindjammer
your link went to 8th page of an 11 page document i took a quick look through the page but couldnt find the quotes youre showing could you cite the post numbers and page numberswindjammer
post with your main trolls will play the i havent read it but im prepared to dispute it card as you did with anks spoon chucking before you found information that you justsohappened to distort to support you claims all these quotes were pointed out and cited during anks campaign and not one was ever shown to be false i know youre trolling about lying and what not but sorry theyre true lying about me having lied thats metatrollingcool again you lie in order to troll me claiming that i lied meta also should be noted that despite your trolling about providing links you just failed to provide a link and yet youre still lying about how the context justifies the quote of course you were caught lying claiming that ank didnt want to end pvp anywhere i provided her own words showing that yah she wanted to end ganking in highsec you then lie some more and claim that removing something is balancing it when faced with her own quote saying that concord and the insurance companies take drastic steps to stop you parasiting scum you pretend thats balance and reducing insurance and blah blah blah youre not a very good liar her own words say stop not alter the dynamic for not change the profitability for not rework game mechanics regarding stop as in end as in eliminate as in get rid of but of course youre trolling for a disgraced crazy girl so all you can do is claim that really stopping something from happening at all is balancing it i need my car fixed its making a grinding noise when i turn the wheel too far to the left or rightno problem well just put it in the car crusher and no more problemwait what i want it fixed not destroyedyoure lying youre lying i just said id fix it by destroying it youre lying that is naturally one of the common bits that anks alt troll supporters used during her campaign when proof was provided that she or at least a trolling forum persona she created to win votes was rabidly opposed to pvp and ganking people would claim that really it was balance which reminds me post with your main hrm let me predict the trolling on thesecontext context context sure she was evincing the fact that shes mentally unbalanced or pretending to be in order to win votes and couldnt differentiate reality for a video game and thought that shooting people in a video game really mean that someone needs to be locked up in a mental asylum but um someone was mean to her first and so she was respondingas for all this nonsense about the truth being libel i wish the trolling internet tough guys would put up or shut up even the fabrication that spoonchucking was gentle wtf the trollrage that people dont find that conduct acceptable is hardly libel you must find this to be a nonissue or i sue youuuu is kinda funny as for ank being mentally unbalanced all someone would have to do is quote her own words showing that she didnt understand that people who play cops and robbers arent really officers of the law and killers the defense against libel is that what youre saying is true as normal people arent trolling because they support a disgraced crazy videogamepolitician theyll actually recognize and acc
the recent exchanges have allowed windjammer to systematically pick apart the canards about ank and i like his style  calm reasoned and well evidencedildryn you just dont get it trading on previous threats by making oblique references to them is still threatening behaviour ive reported you again perhaps yours is simply the bravado that future years or sobriety will cure perhaps there is something wrong with you something that comes out in the anonymity of an online forum i freely admit i do not know but in any case there is a record for he authorities to trace might be worth thinking about before your next entry now please dont let me interrupt this enlightening exchange of ideas cheers delilah
i never threatened anyone if you wish to continue to report me it is within your rights i suppose would you like to sit down in person and have a nice chat about all this might be able to come to a better understanding when you can see facial expressions
i agree ildryn has not made any threats toward any person in this thread if you delilah have been reporting him and those reports have been reviewed then had he made threats as you claim he wouldnt be allowed to post more of his claimed threats the fact that you delilah did report him and nothing happened is more proof that you are lying about him that is considered libelanother instance of your libel toward ildryn by your above statement he is either immature or a drunk since you dont have proof of either you are making false claims thus libelas far as i can tell you are the only one who is making threats or at least insinuations of consequences to ildryns posts and finns post for that matteredit add delilah to clarify who is threatening who
thank you i appreciate the courtesythese quotes youre using come from the crime and punishment section of the forums on a thread titled goonswarm podding activities and occurred in the early part of 2008 there is no section of the forums other than caod where smack and counter smack are more often seen its almost come to be one of the defining characteristics of that section of the forumsthe discussion covered suicide ganking the penalties for ganking that were in place at the time and the need for stiffer penalties this was during a time that goonswarms so called jihadswarm their name for it not mine was near the height of their activity it should be pointed out that goonswarms over use of the mechanics were largely responsible for a change by ccp to what we have today this supports ankhs view that stiffer penalties were needed to balance the game ie ccp agreed with the position ankh advocatedthe following quotes are from the thread
unlike yourself ive provided links to the quotes i use so that the reader can verify both the accuracy and context of the quote ive also provided links to the perceptions of the witnesses of the nonevent as told by them as well as their observations of the incident weve even had a recent visit in this thread by one of the csm delegates who witnessed the spoongate nonevent and he disagreed with you my efforts are to show the truth in a way the reader can easily verify for themselvesin contrast you make quotes out of context and then attempt to manipulate the interpretation of the quote you refuse to link the quotes so the reader can easily see the context of the quote argue with the witnesses to the nonevent and tell outright lies to support your claims your efforts are to distort the truth and make it difficult for the reader to see the truth youre not particularly good at it though you seem to be trying to make up for that lack with sheer volume nope youve lied in this thread plain and simple youve even lied when accusing me of lying in such a transparent way its laughable gosh i didnt really think it necessary because of the transparent nature of your lies but if you insist heres just one example from your post 682 of this thread here you first quote me accurately then tell the reader i said something entirely different i said you argued with a csm delegate you did yet you claim you didnt saying i made it up you lied there zerothen in the same paragraph you admit to arguing with a csm delegate and say i was claiming you disagreed with the csm delegates version of events and you claim thats a lie by me since i did not say that or insinuate it thats two more lies the first about what i said and the second about me lyingyou lie three times in a surprisingly short space and you provide the proof of your lies in the same breath this is just one example of what i mean when i say you lie very poorly i dont know whats sadder to think that you are unaware of how badly you lie and actually believe yourself cleveror that you think the readers are so ignorant as to believe your lies regardless of how poorly your lie is constructedwindjammer
ive just finished covering this in post 717 of this thread if the reader is inclined they can read that post to see another example of how zero has distorted the truth and outright lied however simply put ankh did not want to remove suicide ganking merely make its penalties match its impact instead of being the free ride it was back then thats balance not eradication proof of this is witnessed by the fact that a lot of suicide ganking still occurs despite ccps having made most of the changes ankh happened to be advocatingwindjammer
ah ildryn perhaps you have forgotten your earlier post with its not so subtle threat to windjammer allow me to refresh your memory this is from your post 684 and is documented by windjammer in his post 687 note to that your threat was edited out of post 684 by the moderators shortly after i reported you the first time as for troeg perhaps you were not paying attention to ildryns antics as documented above be that as it may your claim that by reporting a threat i am somehow making a threat is nonsense such selfserving rationalizations that would absolve you and others from bearing responsibility for your words and actions speak for themselves your argument simply cannot be taken seriously still im pleased ildryn is now trying to make it look like his original threat was a joke that means my point whether acknowledged or not has struck home cheers delilah
troeg not only are quotes best read in context so too is the meaning and interpretation of any communication for example here is what you claim i said here is what i actually saidwhile i grant the sardonic humour carries the appropriate contempt for people acting like curs it is also clear as a ringing bell that maturity a lack of sobriety or some other factor are speculations on my part given your collective behaviour i may not be far off the mark then again i might ill leave it to ildryn to share his intentions when he wrote that post he has yet to do so troeg you might also want to share your intentions in continuing to defame ank why is it that making claims about her mental health claims roundly refuted by people who knew and worked with her is so very important to you this is a serious question think about it for a moment is this about ank herself are you really that hostile to someone youve never met and is no longer in eve i think you said before that you are a programmer does that put you in a position to assess anks mental healthor is it something else that ank represents that has you troubled is it her policy positions about rebalancing do you fear the end of pvp as some have claimed is it something else look you dont have to be a cur to act like one on the forums or in eve whether you do so or not is as much an ethical choice online as it is in real life trashing ank is hardly praiseworthy and doesnt reflect well on anyone do you really want to be a part of this attempt at character assassination if there is some policy position you would like to debate about balance pvp or something else can we not discuss those issues in a more respectful way i know there is plenty of room to disagree but please do not make ank a victim in a policy debate over internet space ships cheers delilah
ok updating slowly as there is a ton of crap to sort throughadded in more about pos towers and flogging that dead horse into something more deadblack ops are already on the list with proposed changesyes gallente need a buff thats why the rail guns and blasters are listed and yes gallente ships do need a buff i agree but when making these proposals a lot of thought and detail needs to be put into them as for detail sometimes you need to talk about each ship individually for these changes example deimos is supposed to be a blaster boat but its super slow so when talking about a buff talk about how to improve the each ship individually using the deimos again say give it a bonus to base speed and give it a mwd bonus but also consider when making ship change proposals how would it compare to the others using the deimos again comparing it to the vaga zealot and cerebusthe more detail in the proposal the more likely it will get passed plus it allows room for change and better feed back rather than fix the ships
id fly black ops in roaming pvp if they added 100 ms to base speedjust one of the many possibilities to make it desirable
is this the annual raise the black ops thread
no
cosmetic onlyreally ccp shouldnt have even let the players decide on this just implement payed cosmetic changes like racebloodline changes for your worthless avatar or maybe even a new hat
this
they say the reason they removed it was due to lag issues but if anything lag has increased since its removal go figure
it agree old cyno effect looked better than this small wrinkled stupid red ballold effects of capital jumping were capturing and causing desire to hold breath and to tell wow present effect of capital jumping with spit out from a bubble looks ridiculously and not suggesting high feeling of powerful of the jumpdrive technologyjust as earlier a stargate published a sound of accumulation of capacity for a shot which was heard by very powerful overloadpstry to recall serial babylon5unless the output of the ships from the hyperspace not perfectly well looked accompanied by bright flashout and appearing shone swirl from which the ship sharply fly offwhen the hyperspace was quitted by set of the ships each of which took off from own swirl is looked capturing
supporting again i am still waiting for the old cyno effect and the pod squish sound to be restored or replaced with something better
supported please let is chose at least a new bloodline
yes please my avatar was caucasian before incursion now shes asian i already have two asian characters thats why i made a whitey in the first place
totally agree how do asians go caucasian maori go asian etc
race change is a must the new avatars look so different from the original my characters look nothing like they did before and frankly my race looks like so supported for race change
i would definitely pay up to 50 in real cash to be allowed to do this otherwise my character is pretty unplayable
when you look this good you find the boobs take care of themselves
bump
supported current missile graphics are a bit dissappointing
i do not know what to tell about all remaining but it would be healthy to see that rockets arent simply materialized from emptiness about ship casing it would be very good to see their take off from rocketlaunchers which are displayed on the case only if they are installed on the ship just as it looks with turretsi have no claims to a flight of rockets graphics and explosions
there a reason why drakes have missile launchers on their sides supported
then need to cut this rocketlaunchers from drake model having made the ship bald and make from that cut off rocketlaunchers separate which will move a little and will be visible only when they are fitted on to ship
well the macross frontier missiles are a bit too unnecessarily swirly for my taste having missiles not appear ex nihilo however would already be a good start
supportedthis only needs to be a graphic change which means client side only just make the mechanics more like a turret basically so with this change there is little or no change to the games missile mechanics at all it just looks different on the client side
you suck with your bumpsas for your idea  it definitely supported
yeah first thanatos i saw was definitely a surprise now ive had the chance to compare dreads and various others and i still think theyre mostly small nothing threatening or even imposing about themdreads should be at least 15x the size of the largest batleshipcarriers should be at least 25x the size of the smallest dreadsuper carriers should be at least 3x the size of the smallest carriertitans should be no more than 2x the size of the largest super carriercall em whatever you want im not given to nostalgia
1 for boosting gallente ships but i want to see drones boosted specifically allow once again gallente ships to launch more than 5 drones this way boost is confined to gallente ships and it will add to their distinctive fighting style
support and bump to the top of this hell
yes i tottaly agree ccp failed not to add this option
one of those must be features in eve online asap
im actually surprised this wasnt available in the first place its kinda common sense ur own drones repping urself
if this is implemented hope its not a general you can target yourself with drones mechanic appearing on your own lossmail with your own attack drones to minimize killboard numbers would become the new fad 
you can rep yourself with your own drones alreadyyou just cant target yourself to issue the command why would anybody invent a sensor that can detect itself
get rid of jump bridges because its not challenging enoughapparenlty ccp employees dont have to worry about roaming gangs of neuts or reds up in there jovian empire even with jbs your rolling the dice flying even to other parts of your alliance holdings jbs are a stratigic asset help player run empires grow and provide a way to out smart roaming gangsand on the similar subject i know alot of capital and super cap pilots that like to keep there ships safe in cyno jammed systems how does this apply to this thread well after an operation how does said capital get back to his or her semisafe home system well a jb or course since they cant use the jump gates because ccp has fail to solve the bumping issue so if capitals cant access there safe systems it forces them to either a stay logged off and really ccp u want accounts logged off leave null sec alone and focus on more important things like sov r somethinnot supportedps this is what happens when high sec carebears get to decide whats going on in null sec
after skimming this topic i see nothing but 15 pages of tears tears from the ohsomighty nullsec holders hello 00 is nullsec as in no security its as risky and as safe as you want to make it but oh no were not going to be able to hold huge expanses of space anymoreoh no logistics is actually going to be difficultoh no distance to a fight is going to actually matterccp do the right thing make space big again make 00 holding risky again make some room for the growing powers in the galaxy death to jump bridges nerfs to supercapitals and jump range for gods sake bust up the gigantic power blocs
this is an mmoif you think blob fights are a problem then regulated tournament style pvp would be more appropriateregardless it doesnt matter to have 2 long range weapons that work better the the third
 this would be nice
good ideas must be closer to top
when i first heard about incarna the combat potential is what got me excited killrightsanctioned shootouts fisticuffs duels hangar thievery and dangerous guards that can be boughtupgraded sabotage boarding derelicts  dead poses for extra salvage and battling whatevers infested them in the meantime  rogue drones etc hostile takeovers where you walk into the enemy corps station office and hose it down with hot plasmaheres hoping incarna doesnt end up being just a seeandbeseen scene we can already dress up and go out irl we dont need to pay money per month to pretend to be a space pilot who dresses up and goes out 
big no to this proposal1 every action in stations should be mature and thoughtout social interaction not running around and shooting like in action games2 space should be the only pvp orientation of eve as all of its vast and complex pvp resources and tools that make it stand out have been created recreated and iterated for space during all these 7 years shooting in stations would make it another and worse than many current action game
nounlessstations are split into 3 sections  high low and nullhigh  no combat permitted of any kind not even killrights security scanners check for contraband as you pass through doorwayslow  noweak security scanners killrights permitted unprovoked combat tags you as a wanted criminal capture results in immediate executionnull  anything goesleaving your ship always gives you direct access to high plus access to low andor null
i fail to see the point in pvp in a station i figure a station is a city so you will have working areas offices housing for the rich and a slum area for the poorsince capsuleers are like gods and a few isk is worth a lot then why would anyone go to the slum areai figure a high an low security area but no guns in high slums will have fighting but no killing just beatdowns ad general thug failures running around maybe put a  of isk in an acual wallet when u go into station so you can be pickpocketed or robbed in the slum area but you can also play cards bet on slave fights or buy a female escortanyways op idea is pretty bad and would recommend bio massing character immediately to spread the stupid virus

one more thoughtas i understand for the characters which names consisted of two words divided by a space the first word becomes a name and the second word  a surnameand what to do by that who didnt put a space in the nickname and wrote it for example here so annalucia superbaby gordonnailcatcher etcon the one hand it will be not good if it will be possible to change the nicknameon the other hand somebody will want to divide these two words and to make of them a name and a surnameprobably it would be necessary to think of possibility to make a name and a surname from current nickname by means of the same space but without possibility to add delete or change a letters and other symbols to put a space in the beginning and in the end of a nickname the space can be put only oncewhen i have recustomized the character whether me havent asked i want to select a surnameit also isnt necessary to me but nevertheless it can and be necessary for someone

now before we start id like to say that i like ecm drones i think that they work perfect and do not wish to see any change in how these drones are balanced i will make references to the power of ecm drones vs other ewar drones though however sensor damping tracking disrupting energy neutralising and target painting drones always appear completely underpowered when compared with the dreaded ecm dronenow just for comparison5x hornet ec300s are just as effective as 1x racial ecm fitted on an unbonused hull with max skills no implantspros of dronesecm drones do not require capacitorecm drones effectiveness is not skill basedcons of dronescant be overloadedcan be destroyednow when it comes to the other ewar drones we see some very large differences in performance vs ecm dronessensor damp dronesbecause these drones cant be scripted to either range damp or scan res damp they are already suffering heavily in performance the next issue is that stacking penalties are so harsh that using more than 3 of these drones is pointless also only ogre sd900s are powerful enough to consider using and with how underwhelming sensor damps are in general even when using them on hulls with a bonus you would never use these dronestracking disruption dronesthese drones also suffer from the same problems as sensor damp drones although the strength of the drones is good enough the stacking penalties are crippling and using more than 3 on a single target is pointless target painting dronesuseful when using torps but again stacking penalties and small bonuses cripple these dronesenergy neutralising dronesthese drones should be fantastic but sadly the amount of cap drain from these drones is so small its pointless you might say that this is balanced because it costs you no cap to use these drones but when you look at the figures which are11 ev300s  1 t2meta 4 small neut18 ev600s  1 t2meta 4 medium neut24 ev900s  1 t2meta 4 large neutwhen you compare that to the fact that 5 small ecm drones are as effective as a single racial ecm module on an unbonused hull ev drones are a complete waste of time one positive thing though neuting doesnt get stacking penalties so thats a good thingi would like it if the other ewar drones were brought into line with the ecm drones1st would removing stacking penalties from the drones be a really bad thing2nd being able to rclick and set mode for sd and td drones be a viable option3rd by how much should the ewar strength of the drones be buffed to make them effective but not overpowered
they should just remove all ew drones till they figure out a replacement for ecm
there is nothing wrong with ecm it works perfectly yes it is annoying but it works and you can counter it
i agree as for how much the nonecm ewar drones should be buffed id say make them 50 more effective and halve the stacking penalty for balance neut drones should probably get this new stacking penalty applied then
evxxx drones are actually pretty good just situational in the extreme and only really work in conjunction with an actual neutsdsdtpswxxx on the other hand have no use whatsoever mainly due to stacking penalty system removing stacking is not an option though as it will make swarms stupidly powerfulincrease the effect of the drones at least one whole size ie lights get effect of current mediumsincrease their orbit speeds and hitpoints to give them more survivabilitydouble at least their activation ranges so that a single mwd burst is longer enough to escape the effect entirelyecxxx should be changed to being lockbreakers instead of full cycle jammers considering overall locking speed that would make them pretty fairly balancedcycle time might need to be decreased to 15s or so  need to test in cruiser down environment where they are currently opdo you really want to open that particular can last thread that did so ran way off topic with page numbers in the double digits
sensor dampening drones are the most worthless drones i have ever seen in my life fix needed
have all the drones from a single ship count as a single module for the purposes of stackingthat is all 5 sensor dampers from 1 ship add with full strength but 10 drones from 2 ships has a stacking penalty this stops huge swarms from being stupid powerful but makes it so that you can actually use themthe actual numbers of the nonecm drones could probably use a boost in addition to the stacking modification i mentioned in particular the sensor damper and target painter drones need the biggest boost i think
well it is my opinion and i could be very wrong but i do feel they work well i do also like the idea that ecm drones become lock breakers not heart breakers see what i did thereat least a reduction in stacking penalties for sdtdtp drones so that they are effective in a wing but not in a swarmev drones maybe dont need stacking penalties but to just not be as strong as the shipboard modules themselves maybe 50 stronger than current drone neut strengththe biggest problem with sd is that even shipboard sd modules are a little underpowered the whole sd ewar needs a little look intowhat do people think about having a mode selection a bit like scripting for sdtd drones
1nonecm ew drones have been broken almost as long as rockets used to be
i think the ecm drones should be nerfed to the ammount of 5 drones  a multi jammer not racial
with all the suggestions regarding blasters railguns and now ewar drones am i glad that i am a gallente pilot my uberuber ships will be feared in all of eve soonbehold the sarcasmnot supported  oh wait it is only a discussion
imo the way to make mining less boring and simultaneously remove mining bots would be to make mining into a minigame eg you must solve tetris blocks or something which represent your ore processor machinery in realtime to get any ore while your laser is on
i disagree slightly it may not stop the macroers but it will help to combat them eveor any economy for that matter is all about checks and balances the system is simply out of ballance right now in favor of the macro i honestly dont blame them mining is boring with respect to your hard core miners that can chew on a rock for 3 hours chin up and keep hope were fighting for youto corectaly combat the social distress that is macro mining you need to balance the system again right now its more profitable to macro minesimply becuase you cannot mine in 3 hours what you can in 23 change that scale and make the new system complex and adaptiveand hopefully void of exploitationyou not only increase player interest in doing it the right way but its one step closer to decrease the value of a macrohaving nasty spawns wont stop itbut its one gold nugget stacked back on our side of the scalei still give a 1 to op
even if it doesnt stop bots it is a decent change
i would agree that ratting in low sec  belts or plexes  are equally or more dangerous than in 00especially if you are in friendly 00 alliance the danger is much less than in low sec in 00 whenever a single hostile enters the region his name is reported all over the friendly intel channels so you know whats coming for many jumps not to mention all the super safe jb travelcertainly low sec deserves same quality rats and plexes as 00or make 00 dangerous again nerf jbs nerf local chat nerf cynos
pos structures are clunky and old management interfaces are awkward and provide for a poor interface the anchoring and onlining time required for poss leads to many headaches for individuals setting them upid like to see all this changei think we should have a new pos design and a new management sytem not to replace the old but to coexist with it for a time this will allow for players to make the change at their discretion and as cash flow is available with all old pos modules being purchased back for recycling by various npc corporations in the gamethe new pos structures will see significant remodeling and undergo a vastly superior change in functionality initially only empire pos will be available though over time pirate faction variants will emerge these will not be superior with regard to cpu and powergrid but instead will see changes to pos bonuses and appearance shield armor and hull will remain the same in most respects though they may see changes to patterns of resistanceall new pos structures will have hull armor and shield resistances reflecting the differences in the factions from which they originate pos will no longer have seperate structures as before and will no longer enjoy a projected shield effect as before instead they will apply their shielding effect to any nearby friendly vessels in need of its protection firing on these vessels will of course relay its effect on the pos shields rather like a shield transferring array that draws its power from the operational shields of the tower the projected effect of these shields and the shields on the pos structure itself will be similar to that of a ships shield hardener in almost all respects once a poss shields are gone so is any protectionof that natureoffered by a posthe new poss will have structural hardpoints for mounting their various modules on there will be a maximum number of these hardpoints available allowing for only so many structures to be anchored to the pos anchoring times will bevery nearlyas usual with some slight reduction where onlining times will be reduced to reflect the fact they are connected to and powered directly by the pos new options for pos modules will become available some of these will include bridge structures that allow for additional hardpoints such a brige would take up one hardpoint while allowing for three additional hardpoints this would allow for pos expansion making for large pos structurescorporate hangar array modules would mount directly to the pos tower itself requiring a base level hardpoint as opposed to a secondary hardpoint they would also extend the hardpoint to which they were mounted allowing for a secondary hardpoint for which to mount other modules ship maintenance arrays could make use of these secondary hardpoints while not being able to connect directly to the pos itself moon harvesting arrays would require two tertiary mounting hardpoint as would assembly arrays and similar structures tertiary structural hardpoints would exist as extensions to reactor arrays and the like which would then require a secondary harpoint in this way a pos would be required to build outward while relying on its full powergrid and cpu capabilities it would also see the addition of capacitor requirements allowing for variations in the way its modules functionoffensive hardpoints would be another additional pos module each capable of fitting various weapons andor ewar modules these would mount to secondary or tertiary structural hardpoints or to hardpoints on the pos structure itself giving some flexibility they would utilize weapons much like those used on standard vessels and each would be visible mounted on the surface of their respective offensive modules additionally the new pos could have free floating dronelike weapons with their own respective control unitmore
these dronelike weapons would require bandwidth as normal drones and would potentially be freeroaming to a specified range or stationary free roaming drones would dock up until aggression then deploy into formation to asail the aggressor and any allies stationary drones would act much like sentries attacking any aggressable targets within rangeship maintenance arrays would of course be sizeable and appear capable of storing thew vessels in question for this reason they may require as many as two or three secondary structural hardpoints two would be a reasonable number with the structure extending away from the pos weapon platform modules would effectively be anchored vertically horizontally or diagonally and resemble anchors in appearance with smaller shafts which act as the interconnection point weapons would be arrayed on both sides of them along the anchors hooks with 46 weapons total silos would mount as additions to structures which require their use on specialized hardpoints used for only that purpose with optional configurations once a requisite number of silos is reached no additional silos would be mountable to that structure poss would gain internal slots which could be used to buff powergrid shield resistances cpu and the like while allowing for player configuration of their pos for any intended use these would of course be similar in functionality to high mid and low slots on ships specialized survey probes could be designed to determine exactly what modules are deployed on poss these would function much like ship scanners though would require deployment in a fashion similar to moon survey probes potentially they could be one use items or would return at the end of their scanning duration they would be detectable by ship scanners and potentially be vulnerable to disruptionstructures would no longer require manually ferrying around cargo fuel resources or the like but instead would be capable of internally moving any and all resources save ships for the purpose of ship construction additional modules would be required to connect directly to a ship maintence array capital ship maintenance arrays would also become a tertiary module requiring a minimum of 3 tertiary mounting hardpoints for their use an appropriate assembly array could provide these hardpointspos management would be simplified with all modules and linked substructures accessible through a 3 dimensional interface representing a map of the pos in use simplying selecting a primary pos structure would allow for it to be manipulated as needed this would allow for individual manufacturing arrays to be operated with all linked substructures available in a single popup window weapons platforms would be capable of being mounted loaded and grouped as well as capable of receiving targeting commands or being controlled targeting commands would be simple in most respects yet still allow the players to control the ai for pos defense mechanisms an organizable list would appear with primary targets being at the top this would function in a similar fashion to the players overview settings menu with up and down arrows to move objects and the like it would be an interface capable of setting up a programmable defensive ai players cant be there all the timeim thinking this is a good enough base for this idea for now so let me know what you think through your comments support and criticismkelanoein out
incidently this would also remove all that pos clutter from your overview given the station would be one structure save for the dronesof course im supporting my own idea

the map knows many filters all of which have a use to some if not all players mission runners can see where their next available agent is pvpers can look for kills traders can look for player hot spots  only to list a fewwhat it needs is a more direct support for minersbesides the number of players active in space is there little more help available the map offers little in trying to find a good system to mine in instead the search for a system with big rocks and untouched belts is just rudely seen as part of the miners choresi propose to add a filter to the map which shows the number of asteroid belts and ice fields in each system an indicator for the mining activity over the last 24h in each systemthis will make mining more awesome one can spot overmined systems possibly caused by macro miners who just mine the same belts day after day and move to a system with less activity it allows miners to spread out more easily and makes planning of mining operations easier and morepvpers can use it to see where there is mining activity where the enemies get their resources from etc and adds overall more strategic information to the gamethe load on the server nodes will be more balanced due to miners more actively spreading out into untouched systems macro miners will be forced to move around too or their activity will become visible to allthere will be many benefits coming from an additional filter dedicated to the mining profession and it is time for the miners to get a bit of love from the map too
giving it my own support
having been doing this as part of the whitehound corporation since i have joined i have found it to be greatly beneficial for everyone that takes part it is all operated under fair terms and everyone ends the op witha smile on their faceso by giving others an opportunity as such would be very helpfulli strongly support this
i like this proposal as ive enjoyed the mining ops we do having the abilty to see and better prepare for mining ops sounds like a bonus to me and other miners and op makers alike and having the abilty to avoid the cases of destroyed or over used belts makes mining a whole lot better and more enjoyable for all thumps up
i would be happy to help white
doesnt seem to be a feature that can screw up many things altho might be somewhat tricky to implementgiving my support anyways because it seems a good feature
the implementation should not be our concern as it is ccps business however asteroid belts respond to excessive mining and spawn smaller sized asteroids the next day so there has to be some gathering of mining activity by each node already in the game all it needs is to send it to the client and to cache it there for 24h like any other 24h data of the map
it is kinda our concern since it might or might not be feasible to introduce
no if you let it influence your decision then you might deny yourself a new feature which can be easier to implement for ccp than one anticipatesthe only concerns one should have is am i going to look like a fool when i support this proposal
only concern i have is can ccp really do this and if it can that usually ends up with how the heck did ccp broke it so bad
i actually thought they already had something like this in the game already last op when you and grim were trying to find a system i tried too look it up and found that it actually did not exist i would be glad to see something like that integraded into the game
hey thats a great ideai mean imagine in alliance wars actually being able to see and to effectively cut off enemies supplieswouldnt that be something talk about a whole new lvl of pvpingmix it with mine and we got us a new and funner carebear economysupported 1
at first this idea struck me as easymode for miners but the strategic point is a good one as an orca pilot myself finding a place for my crew to go can be a pain sometimes this sort of feature can have far and wide effects though while it is strategically useful for pvp purposes piracy warfare and such it has another effect more ore on the marketthis feature increases the efficiency of the mining career and will inherently increase the amount of ore on the market which in turn affects how much miners can make from that ore potentially more or potentially less depends on supplydemand as always whether you think this is good or bad is in my opinion the core of this threadi personally like the idea because i think it benefits mining and well i am a somewhat lazy leader
ive submitted other posts asking for a bit of leverage here or there in support of the miner as sometimes i do feel we get a raw deal im showing support because sometimes like reading in local its nice to have a headsup both for when  hits the fan and for when times are good for mining o7
yes i want it now dont make such a huge deal out of something your just going to get rid of before the release at least get some player feedback from it first
yes please bring it back also great to see only two people not support so far as long it was optional it was awesome and if there was an exploit someone needs to sill the beans
not sure why a minority opinion was excepted as the de facto opinion when it came to the new neocom why are more choices a bad thingthe current ui is clunky and old time for a change
these are all good ideas and pirokobos idea is long damn overdue
here another screenshots from server multiplicityscreen1screen2screen3screen4screen5screen6if i have correctly understood idea the given possibility will be accessible for plexcredits just as piercing and hats for characterit is a pity that multiplicity it is closed for an login i with pleasure would play with this feature
apsidia you have made my whole week
supportedyea give us the ability to represent our corps and alliances by taging the logo on the side of our ship and we can already change our ships name so let us tag that on the side of it
corp and alliance logo on patches we can put on the avatars clothes would work too or tattoos of them heh
op updated to reflect this long needed option
incursions coming tomorrow with bigger sites requiring 60 ppl due to reward curve we may be seeing public fleets forming and subsequently chainconcorded from rr
ok perhaps but can we please enjoy a few dozen tearful threads first
i like the idea of making mining and ratting more dynamic it could make the job more interesting but its not going to solve macro problem a more effective and perhaps radical way to solve the problem is to allow mining barges to run autonomously then players can directly compete with botters and drive them out of business this way most botters will quit players will have all of mining and they will be saved from drudgery of mining at the same time dynamic mining op suggests should be implemented so that mining outcome depends on player skill too many people mining you say the market will take care of it people will stop mining if its not profitable enough mining as a profession will be different but the root cause of todays problem is the boring nature of the mining profession
1 eject from a capsule  very much isnt logical2 selfdestruction  logical function also should be alwaysyou press the right button on pod you select selfdestruct you confirm the choice and in 2 minutes your in the cloning station it was always existed soit seems to me that to eject from capsule it should be problematic without the special equipment in station dock or station medlab
also aaaaaaahhhhhhh
i was being sarcastic if you didnt get it you really think all that long hours of gatecamping or blobing farming loner killmails isnt actually for the purpose of padding kb
are you trying to give killing a moral purpose by saying that kill mails are immoral
absolutely 100 agree with this proposalbut keep lossmails i enjoy seeing how many ships i go through  it feels good to know im singlehandedly stimulating the entire eve economy
morals have nothing to do with this its because of killboards that everyone is faced with the dilemma of wait hours for fish to bite for an easy blob kill or dont wait jump into a losing fight and get blobbed theres no actual tactics besides numbers numbers and more numbersit trumps everything else in the end the only person who loses is whoever isnt willing to wait forever or is willing to take risks long story short blob  all reward no risk
yep extreme risk aversion in fearing that losses will shrink your ep3n0r5it used to be about the rush of a good 1v1 fight now its just another form of farminggrinding for kms instead of isk
ive just stopped reading right there because for me its enough to support your opinionwhenever you reward people with ranks everything goes to be at the top
i stand by the premise that killmails only add negatives to eve pvp and no positives i am not going to argue about whether killmails are to blame for all pvp happening or notreal pirates are in it for the money fake pirates are in it for the killmail guess which one outnumbers the other by a massive margin of disparityi dont think capitals super or otherwise should be removed from low sec i just think killmails are the reason entire fleets of them would be sitting in a system waiting for the jump call to come out over comms when the bait gang is engaging a hostile gang if i was a supercap pilot id like to think id have better things to do than jump in to kill lone bses tackled by a bigger gangif the event is so important why do you need a killmail to tell you about itbecause i dont believe killmails should be a reason to fight other players or because i think players should be coming up with their own reasons to fightif all you want is event reporting i have a nicely designed generic battle reporting system that might interest you
and thanks for taking the time to actual debate things it means a lot to see people forming coherent arguments without trolling even when they disagree with mefair enough if said combat record was something you had to request from their previous corps and not something allowed for public consumption would that be acceptablefair enough not entirely sure why this is necessary since above class kills are usually easier than a more matched fight but that is for a different threadwell if people remember your name that is typically more effective than killmails for actual infamy if anything id think hardcore pvpers would hate killmails because they make it far to easy to find out what where and who with you fly i know i despise them for that reason among the others stated in the opdo they i never noticed even if they do they dont have anything like killboards to rank on or do theyhonestly id say if you are that good bragging is pointless everyone who matters already knows and those who dont will soonterritory isnt always a good measure either some alliances control a vast number of systems they pretty much only have because nobody else wants themid still say your reputation should do that and if it doesnt it wont matter what your killboard saysexactly the reason i think killmails should be removed people who pvp for killmails are doing it wrongunfortunately i think eves best sleezebag is executing a 00 allianceif you are flying a ferox and kill me flying a hurricane isnt that already a measurable achievementi still think there could be a far better system without all the inherent weaknesses and complications killmails bring to the table
although i would love to see the end of blobbing and cap dropping and so on im not sure removing killmails will do it round my area in eve there are plenty of people who blob up purely because they dont want to lose moneyplus i like looking through my lossmails and thinking from ages ago and thinking wow how did i not notice that was a bait ship when i shot itmaybe find some way which makes exporting killmails to external boards impossible so people like me can reminisce about the times we got drunk and took our faction ships for a spin
i definitely think killmails affect pvp in eve take carriers for example currently its suicide to have a lone carrier anywhere further than 2500 m from a station in low sec if a carrier gets pointed people will come from far and wide to get on that killmail and the carrier is screwedif there were no killmails people would not at all have the same urge to come though im not saying a few people wouldnt come anyway but i think the random guys just looking for killmails wouldntif you absolutely must still have killmails just let the one who inflicted the most damage get it and possibly only if he surpasses a certain threshold like 50 damage by himself ie hes so good he can take on people singlehandedly or with little backup he should also always be the one who gets the killmail not the one inflicting the last hit
problem with having highest damage only getting it is people would just start farming kills using falcon alts they would be able to brag they were l33t cause they killed loads solo due to the falcon not showing
that should be simple enough just add the number of participants to each killmail without actually saying who they areedit actually you could keep killmails exactly like they are today but remove the name alliance and corp from all but the top damage ship and always give the killmail to the top damage ship having it like this would almost avert people from using killmails because it would be very clear how useless they are individually in a blob
i was toying with something to replace killmails but it seems unlikely that it will have the desired effect if anyone but the victim gets the killmailnow many people are going to trip over the idea that killmails only get sent to the victim which will definitely kill killboards as almost nobody likes to publicize their losses but a loss record is far more adequate to the task of helping an individual and a corporation track problems without clouding them in a sea of statistics fueled bloodlust
idea not supported there are a number of reasons removing killmails wont do anything to address any problems and killmails do have some positive effects on pvp that people like to ignore heres a rundown1 some people use killmails as a form of recordkeeping okay at this time we went here did this and killed these guys we lost these ships you can document an entire campaign this way and in fact its pretty much the only way to document a campaign when i want to tell someone about a truly epic fight or reminisce about an old campaign finding the battle summary and linking them to it really adds a dramatic flair to the storytelling when they realize the true scale of the battle  especially if they dont play the game how else would i be able to brag about this sure it wasnt a real carrier kill but that doesnt take away from the fact this noob corp alt was only beaten in damage by the npc navy out of 112 people2 killmails are a valuable form of intelligence want to know something about a potential recruit a forum jerk or a new wartarget look em up on battleclinic or evekill and theres a mostlycomplete record of their pvp career though some people know how to keep their kills off the major killboards thats how i am suspicious of your claim to be a true pvper  the fact that you hide your main characters combat record from inspecting eyes by posting on an alt with no record at all suggests that youre not as good as you claim whether its true or not when you kill someone and receive the killmail you can usually judge the pilots level of competence by the fittings they had and the way they fought the guy in the apocalypse with t1 guns rainbow crystals and a shield tank is not going to be a high priority next engagement unless you just want to kill him first to get it over and done with but the guy in the t2fit remoterep tripletrimarked fleet geddon might be of course anyone who develops a reputation for using faction deadspace or officer gear will be extremely high priority without killmails you lose most of this intel3 its not going to affect fake piracy the kinds of people who camp gates in lowsec and pop haulers all day will continue to do just that padding their killboards is just a side benefit the main reason they do it is because they like to make people upset and this is the easiest lowestcost lowestrisk way to bring the most grief to the most people these are the same sorts of people who play fpss to teamkill or the guys in wow that go out of their way to kill enemies half their level getting rid of the record of their doing it isnt going to change the fact that they do it4 winning is paramount the killmail is secondary this is why you see huge amounts of ewar and supercapital hotdrops on minor gatecamps people want to win and theyre going to pull all the stops to make sure they do losing in eve has repercussions for all but the richest or cheapest of players so people will do all they can to minimize the odds of it happening this is normal human behavior removing the killmail farmers from the equation might reduce the size of the gank by 5 at most note that who got the kill and link it only pop up after the fighting is over and is mostly provoked by a curiosity to know what exactly they just killed what did it have on it how much was it worth how did i do relative to the rest of the fleet these are the questions that prompt people to ask for the killmailall in all removing killmails will remove them as a source of records and intel while not really affecting anything else removing the name of the victim removes the intel value while keeping the killmailfarming perfectly intact making it a worse solution im not all in favor of killmails but the answers im seeing here just make the problem worse
ohh yes morals is all this is about you question the moral behind killing for kill board stats and you choose to see it as immoralthe consequence of this will be that killing itself is morally right while killing for killboards is morally wrongyou know what this is called it is called stupidwhat will your next proposal be to stop hulkageddon because killing players at random and for fun is immorali am sure this debate will end with you saying that killing is morally right only when you do it to others not supported
wrong again do try and keep up its not a moral its an excuse the excuse ure trying to keep to maintain the status quo of who wants to wait the longest to keep his epeen intact for some stupid reason u think killing by itself is the issue being discussed but of course ure incapable of realizing that its whos not being targeted for killing and how long a nonblob has to wait for a remotely winnable fight in other words its the problem created by the killboards as for the hulkageddon part u might wanna do a little research before saying something that stupid and fun isnt waiting hours for seconds of gankingrunningits a result of ppls fixation of being internet tough guys hit the problem at its source problem solvedanyway ill bet all that was way over your head so feel free to post something irrelevant again id love to hear it
if anything ccp should add a killboard as part of evegate for nice and accurate statsthe reason people blob is becuse they like to win not because their stats might look horrible if they suck
not going to happenyou only think you have the higher moral ground but you have no ground at alldo you actually have a killboard record before you ask for kill mails to be removed
figuresignore and pretend u dont understandor maybe u really cant understand like i said and knew u wouldnt as for the killboard record how hard is it to spend a few seconds looking it up r u this lazy with your kills as well oh well once u look it up maybe then ull see why your comment on hulkageddon was just plain stupid but plz continue with another digressionid love to hear it
oh i do understand very well anna you are proud of your killboard stats and do not want others to feel the samenot supported
if that was case and if killmails were removed there would be no killboard stats for even me to be proud of as well if ure gonna try to argue at least try harder and maybe engage that mod in your head your turn
you want to remove what makes you proud you suck hard not supported
i also hate killmails i hate that they discourage people from using nondirect fire ships in pvp
i never said i actually was proud or wasnt u just assumed that i was and i simply tested that and what would happen and of course ure wrong try again plz
no i can read thank you anna
no problem
this is the only valid concern about killmails in my opinion as an occasional proberforhire i sometimes profit from this that said your better more professional groups can get past the urge to get on the killmail somehow and thats when they turn into a properly scary fighting force
just yesterday i had the same ideawith it being directly from ccp it would be acurate for once showing every single kill and loss  this would also give people a reason to actually use itits kinda funny if you look up characters who only use evekill on battleclinic for example for some reason all their losses are to be seen but only a small fraction of the kills will be there anyways op is not supported
first off saying kms cause gatecamps blobs and ecm is like saying chemo causes weakness its not the intention of it the intention of kms is to provide a record people use gatecamps blobs and ecm because they are effective tactics to win fights doctors use chemo to treat a patientthese tactics will continue endlessly as long as there is any reward for pvp be it space resources or lulz if you want to change the way these tactics are applied make them less viable reduce the ecm jam time and keep the ecm module cycle time the same reduce the signature of ships being locked by more than a handful of hostile ships stay awake when ratting in your carrier in null if you dont like hotdrops killmails are a side effect of what you choose to call bad pvp not a root cause you blow up your argument with one sentance people dont want to lose thats it right there the root cause is that these methods work and work very well an alliance fighting to defend a serious asset be it a system a supercap or even a capship for some of the smaller folks out there is going to bring everything it can to save that asset by the same token removing killmails wont make people want to stop winning fights it will simply make it harder for leaders to keep track of what their people are doing and to gather intelligence on future opponents would some of these methods become less frequent possibly gatecamps and hotdrops are as much about killmails as they are about getting loot so certainly you would lose some people but what do you gain in its place those people are more likely to become discouraged with the game because they considered killmails as a measuring stick for their prowess in eve take this away and suddenly their motivation is gone not supported
well said nice argument
im sorry i cannot support the ops initiative eithersubjectively am i vain about my kb stats perhaps slightly  certainly i dont think i have anything to be ashamed of  but neither are they any sort of driving force and nor have they been i think all of that shows in the record but that is entirely aside from the most important reasonsprimarily as a corp and alliance exec kmskbs are a measure to tell me many different things about how my people are doing things i cant always have an immediate grasp of otherwise it shows whos active in pvp terms and whos not and also where perhaps a little help for some of my pilots may be needed it can help determine specifically where my pilots might need such helpequally importantly they are a primary source of intel of many types anytime im researching an enemy  whether potential or already active  the first stop is always the various kbs where i can find a presence for such both to gain an idea to see what they fly quickly as well as the relative skill levels involved it gives an idea of how active a target corps or alliances pilots are and even a little as to their tactics the same is also useful in gauging potential pilots and corps for recruiting purposesi know im stating the relatively obvious but i think it cannot be emphasized enoughare these the only such tools no of course not not for every one of these metrics  but they are very solid and couched in the various replacement proposals i have seen nothing that provides a truly adequate substitute i would if anything want something that actively improved my ability to engage in these various duties and responsibilities not hamstring that effort before i would support doing away with the current toolsin addition as many have stated i am by no means convinced that this drastic cure is treating the actual illness but simply rather a symptom perhaps there would be some small adjustments here and there  but i fail to see proof that this will in any way correct the most egregious issues surrounding pvp as many have already spoken of them therefore i cannot agree that is truly a rationalization to offset the harm i would suffer in losing this class of metrics
i disagree that killboard rankings and information from killmails are meaningless to skill at pvp i think you can get a decent sense of how good someone is at pvp from looking at their killboards if you look at battleclinic rankings a player rated 1000 is likely to be better at pvp than someone ranked 100000 at least once both get a certain amount of kills under their belt but of course you cant just look at the ranking but also look at what ships they fly who they are killing etc the killboards even tell us who only joins blobs if you never have a kill with fewer than 20 people joining you on the kill then the killboard proves that if there were no killmails there would be no way to easily prove this or that pilot is only a lemming in a blob if you think the whole thing should be about isk loss and not about killmails then you are actually going to encourage blobs i think killmails should simply be improved remote reps should show on killmails if one of parties on the killmail receives remote reps then the logistics ships should be on the kill mail there are other improvements that could be considered as well both to killmail creation and to rankings as far as people being afraid that others will see their fits or that they lost a ship im sorry that is not the type of person i want eve to cater too thats just ridiculous we pretty much all have stupid fits that we fly before we learn how to pvp i flew a lot of bad fits and no doubt still do because i am not a great pvper do i care that people know the truth no because i have no interest in hiding the truth the people who want to hide the truth are the type of people who join blobs killmails are not a perfect system but it has some value see you want loss of isk to be the only risk in the game that will lead to much more blobbing killmails at least help prove this i pvp because it is a very challenging and fun part of eve the killmails and killboards help demonstrate how i am improving or not in this game over time yes there have been times when i dreaded the fact that a loss mail will be posted but if you dont take internet spaceships too seriously then you tend to get over it and after time have a good laugh about it there are also some loss mails that i love and am actually sort of proud ofno killmails means no epic news for eve like the kestrel with over 40 plexes or the 20 billion isk paladin so i answered why i fight now why do you fight if its not to get a better looking killboard which by the way means you blob less not more then what is it if its for sov then your best bet is blob if its for isk wars then absolutely you should blob if you say its just for fun then ill ask what makes it fun here is the thing eve pvp is fun in large part because 1 its challenging and 2 there are consequences not only isk but kill and loss mailslossmails are part of the risk and killmails part of the reward if you want to remove risks and rewards then eve is not so fun
if you are going to propose an idea like this at least have the guts to post with your main so we can see if you have a clue what you are talking aboutof course i suspect the reason you didnt is because youre afraid rightly that wed change the argument to be about how fail you are as a pvper based on your killboard historythis is the general trend ive seen on all these kill the killboard threads the vast majority of people supporting have little or no record of pvp activity generally because they post with alts or outright suckim an total killmail  the only change id like to see to the killmail system would be for ccp to build it into the game so people couldnt hide their losses or pad their boards with fake killmailskillmails are the only record we have of a pvp interactions in the game they are the only indicator of competency and level of risk aversionoh and if you think that removal of killmails would do anything to reduce the amount of blobbing and ganking you are living in a fantasy land people blob because there are consequences to loss far in excess of a stat on your killboard you have to spend time or money to replace a ship you lost thats why people are risk adverse and blobor in the case of null you could lose sov which means a loss of resources far in excess of the ships risked in the engagement no one thinks poorly of someone who lost a ship to a superior force on their killboard we might think poorly of them if their fit was particularly heinous but most the people i know who pvp understand that you are going to lose ships sure its not perfect and it doesnt give one every bit of information about a pilot it doesnt tell us who the good logistics pilots are nor the good scouts then again it doesnt tell us who the good station traders are or scammers or spaisits not supposed to it gives us data on one aspect of a pilots career it provides information on a pilots pvp prowess when it comes to direct ship to ship engagementdo some people misuse them yeah but the same can be said of jumper cables doesnt mean that it would be a good idea to outlaw them oh in case it wasnt clear from my commentsnot supported
and prove me right absolutelyim not afraid of anything and my killboard record shows that but that doesnt mean i like total strangers knowing everything about me before i ever see them ingame it takes all the surprise out of pvp which incidentally is what makes pvp funyou can think what you want the op is what it isthat would kill the pvp side of the game completely finding a good fight would be impossible right now it is just very difficultno they arent id rather people remember my name after i kill them if they dont then it wasnt an impressive featill reverse that and say you are living in a fantasy land if you dont think it will or more precisely the frequency of blobbing and hotdroppingcowards die in shamewe arent discussing the other reasons people blob just killmailsoh i dunno most people seem to think im bad at pvp because i lost a geddon in a 6 v 1 after being permajammed while having two eccm iis fitted or when the pirates of mh blobbed to take out a dark rising gate camp a notorious hotdrop corp but they didnt end up hotdropping people look at the km and think whatever they want but they never know the context of the fight itself or what actually happened to get that resultkillmails only promote bad pvp period the side benefits of having them are pathetic compared to the problems associated with themnot at all killboards dont tell you the most vital information to make a judgment about prowessnaturally but if killmails are so good why can they be misused at all
sometimes i hate some behaviors that are encouraged by killmails but the killmail itself is always interesting to read and keep track ofi believe this score keeping is an essential part of this game a pvp gamewithout these records things would just get more boringkillmails are like cake cake can make people fat and unhealthy but its not the right thing to ban cakes from being madealso more seriously the pvp tactics used in combat are not influenced by the killmail records killmail records only influence peoples attitudes politics smack talk but they have no impact whatsoever on what actually works and what doesnt in combatif blobbing works it will be usedif jamming works it will be usedif hotdropping works it will be usedto address those problems we need to change actual game logic
but as i mentioned killmails at least put a check on blobbing you can see if someone never got a kill without 50 other people on the kill as well it also shows if you took down a large ship with a single smaller ship  and how that larger ship was fit without killmails the only consequence of pvp is isk if that becomes the only consequence there will surely be more blobbing the only people who want this are those who never pvp or only pvp in blobs killmails prove that is what they do and they dont like it
well there are other ways to fix that like battle reports which have none of the downsides of killmails
the only kms are worth looking at are the big fleet reports of lots of people vs lots of other peopleyou dont know how that 1v1 or 2v1 happened one of the people might have been afk or somthingtoo be honest i dont care about how many kills or deaths i have as long as i make more money then i lose it doesnt matter because in eve plex  money for ships fun
this is the best you come up with you are exactly the type i was talking about fail pvper crying and blaming your suckage on killboards29 kills and 30 losses over what a 3 year period thats 12 fights a month and you want to try pretend you have some idea of what motivates pvpersyou claim to not be motivated by killmails yet it didnt stop you and 6 of your pals from ganking those 3 provacatuers on the 22nd or where those kills simply motivated by a hunger for killmails were you looking for a good fight when you popped that guys rifter with your battlecruiser on the 13th believe me there isnt anything in your kill history worth noting and the only thing id be concerned about engaging you is whether you have a gang of buddies in reserve to shift the odds in your favorfull reporting wouldnt change a damned thing in regards to finding a good fight just like the removal of killboards wouldnt its hard to find goodfights because pvp in eve has consequences you want goodfights join rvb they have lots of them outside of that though people are going to do their damndest to maximize the damage they cause you and minimize the damage you cause themif you want even odds consequence free pvp eve is not the game for you people here play for keeps nothing you fly is that special no fit you come up with is going to be that amazing that you need to worry about it becoming fotm in general unless you are fighting on a relatively stable front or war deccing industrialists in high sec you arent going to have time to research individuals killboard history sufficiently to change the outcome of a fight most fights in this game are kills of opportunity and if you take the time to research somoenes killboard prior to every engagement you are going to miss out on your opportunity to kill them or theyre going to kill you while youre reading their kb as far as people remembering your name it aint going to happen you are just one more anonymous dude out of the thousands of anonymous dudes playing the game and the odds of you or anyone for that matter doing anything impressive enough to gain sufficient notoriety to be remembered as just some random dude someone shot at is remote to the point of vanishing hell im an admitted killboard  and i couldnt name off more than handful of the top 20 on battleclinic in fact for the most part the ones i remember are the ones ive fought in the past and the only change id make in knowing them is that im not going to hang out anywhere lukka likes to haunt alone in a lightly tanked shipand if i land a point on him im gonna do my damndest to kill him then toss a gf in local when he kills methe really ironic thing about killboards that ive found though is the less you care about your losses the better your killboard tends to look because what gets you killed more than anything else in the game is indecision if you are busy fretting about what your killboard is going to look like you are going to hesitate and the other guy is going to get free damage on youthe only thing you should be thinking about is can you take em if not you escape if not how can you cause them the most damage before you diethe killloss mails are to look at afterwards to evaluate the engagement to learn what can be learned and marked up on your score cardreally the idea of taking the ability to keep score out of this type of pvp is asinine combat pilots have been keeping score since the wwi guys started putting tick marks on their biplanesif the killmail system hadnt existed wed have had to made one up and then wed be stuck with nothing but non api verified crapoh and thanks for reinforcing my point about the types of people who whine about killboardsstill not supported
no all of that is from when i came back after the new killmail system was added i never posted kills or losses before that on any characteri dont even rememberas my killboard clearly shows that never happensi thought about joining that honestlynever claimed to want anything like thatyou never try experimental fitsthen i havent killed enough peoplenobody knows your name like you know lukkaswhy would you do anything lessthat must not be true if you concluded im a fail pvper and am crying or whatever you said about me based entirely on my killboardi never hesitate to act sometimes i make the wrong choice but i dive right in regardlessi do that during the fight killmails tell me absolutely nothing newthen keep score you dont need killmails to do thatyou reinforced mine more than i reinforced yoursgf now gtfo
the kill on the 22nd was 2 days ago its right there on bc you and 6 others ganked 2 command ships and a drake its your most recent pvp activity and you dont rememberon having backup killboards cant show that it never happens all we see if the fact that you engaged 3 ships with a superior force there is nothing to indicate other than the fact that you got them to engage in the first place whether they chose to engage you knowing the force you had available or if you baited them by showing a lesser force to begin withrvb is good fun  and i recommend it but its not general eve combat its a semicontrolled environment about the only place youre generally going to find a high proportion of more or less even fightson fits i fly experimental fits all the time but i dont pretend that im somehow so special and creative that im going to think of something that one of the thousands of other people play this game havent thought of already nor on the off chance that i actually happen to come up with such a fit do i think it likely to be picked up on by the greater community and even if it did i suspect it would take all of a week for a counter to be dreamed upit is unlikely that you will kill enough people to gain any sort of notoriety particularly if there arent kill boards to document it the only reason i mention lukka is that hes one of the guys on the top 10 on bc hes more noteworthy for the pita he caused rvb any notoriety ive gained is from my activities on these boards not for my pvp prowess i dont consider myself a great pvper im competent but im no lukka or loren or willl adama the only reason the killers who are notable are notable in this game is because there is a record of the carnage they causemy inferences about you are based on more than just your killboard though that does provide some clue part of it comes from the fact that you created this stupid thread in the first place your killboard just confirms my point that the majority of people who cry about the killboard system do so because they dont like having their failure broadcast to the whole universeim sure there are some kick ass pvpers who also dislike the killboard system but they are definitely in the minority most successful pvpers i know like it just fine and use it as a tool to improve their game play and monitor their progress the killmail system is the only record available to objectively evaluate a pilots combat performance whether the person is a corporate recruiter or the pilot themselves the smart ones use it as such a tool properly and draw those conclusions that can be drawn from it and avoid those that cant as another poster pointed out you can tell who the blobbers are from looking at someones killboard pilots who generally show up only on kills with 50 other people dont get as much respect as the one whos generally engaging in more or less even fights particularly those engaging solo or against greater oddsthe ranking system on bc even rewards it those who solo combat craft get more points than those who blob all the time or spend all their time ganking industrial ships you lose a rifter to a blob you dont lose as many points as if you lose a jaguar to a ibisyour argument that km cause any harm is predicated on the idea that the only stat that anyone cares about is killdeath but there is a hell of a lot more shown on a killboard than that and people are going to look at other things like pointsranking and efficiency how blobby you are do you fight people who can fight back etcthe reality is that killboards discourage the activities you try to place at its feet its just that for majority of pvpers killboards are a secondary concern
dear op your fail logic is failfirst mails dont encourage blobbing people bringing more ships to a fight encourages others to bring more ships to the fight next time until it gets out of controlsecond killmails dont encourage gate camps people flying expensive haulers full of goodies wo an escort encourage gate camps and also helps block supply lines to and from high secthird you were in a 6 v 1 fight well hell you were screwed even wo the ewar sure you might have taken 1 or 2 of them down with you but you still would have diedforth killmails dont encourage hot dropping as stated before if you are flying an expensive ship by yourself with no one around you are a target for anything that comes your way if you dont like hot dropping blame reckoning and pan legionconfirming that op is an angry carebear alt and before you talk about blobbing you should really remove those kills about 20 v 1 with your corp on there from the public killboards just sayin
what so we are to type up a battle report for every engagement based on the battlelogs that we can demonstrate we are not blobbing of course everyone will then say they were blobbed yet there will never be any proof the killmails are the proof you want to do away with all the evidence sorry this is just a horrible idea again if you never pvp or only pvp with blobs it might sound pretty good but for everyone else its horrible
hello timestampsthe raven and belicose were kills half an hour before the other 3 so i dont consider them a part of the same engagement still ill grant you that the battle may not have been as lopsided as it would appear simply looking at the battle clinic reportwhich reinforces the need for an official killboard so one wouldnt need to check multiple boards to get a good picture of an engagementid also like to note that you were able to defend your actions in that fight by using a killboard
the proposal remote repairing someone with aggression the kind which prevents you from dockingjumping copies the timer that they have left before they can dockjump objectives same objectives as the remote repair causes agression proposal only modified so that it doesnt cripple rrbs  logistic gangs by copying the current agression timer rather than simply giving a full one this means that rrbs can deagress together while repping each other which currently happens on tq this was the major concern with most people not supporting the proposalprevents station games with unagressing remote repair ships such as carriers logistics rrbsprevents the current carrier remote boosting but never agressing eject from agressed ship and scoop mechanicslogistics have to commit to fightsreduces stalemates mostly highsec where both sides have more unagressed remote repair ships than they have dps also means more ships die and people need to take more risks when using logistics at stationsgates dock hugging remote repair carriers cant instantly redock which gives more opportunites for them to be bumped off and killedexample im fighting a battleship in my battleship i deagress and wait for 40 seconds my friend then comes and reps me he gets a 20 second agression timer same as me
fully support
 are you sure
yeah sorry but im not to fond of your lingo either sounds like nonsense to me and i feel it should be removed from the game kthnkx k thanksone letter wth does that make you cool or something stop itanyway back on topic i never really used overview freeze and i know they keep bobbing about but its not really that big of a deal in my opinion how did you freeze it anyway i just have my overview set up so i dont really have to worry about it most of the time i dont blob warfare though either so it probably wouldnt concern mesomebody seems to think its a glitch though so maybe youll get it back when they fix the rest of the graphical glitchesspeaking of which not a graphical glitch but anybody else had all their places folders dumped ive still got to go back and fix them so everything is organized as it should be hopefully thats still possible didnt really check just closed it in annoyancealso where did the damn portrait option go
much needed
i would not only like to see the overview freeze come back but i want a targeted picture freeze as well
crossposted from this thread on features and ideas on the request of alias 6322aright after a long and somewhat productive conversation with a senior gm this was what he suggested make a very clear straightforward post on the features and ideas discussion assembly hall forumccp please release the racelocks on character creator art assets such as hair and clothing and allow all races and bloodlines to use all currently available assetsthats pretty much my only beef with eve right now
tldrmake a third primae hull called primae mk ii think badger that uses the ore industrial skill to bonus the accuracy of scan on planet linked to the planetology skills as well as bonus the ly range of interacting with distant planets the ship will have a small cargo bay but large specialty bays for ccs and pi materials much larger than the original release these attributes will make the ship worth using for pi over standard industrialsi dont want to change the original primae as that might upset collectors and such instead as i was going about my pi business its too easy of income to pass up i wondered what the primae could have been here is my ideaprimae mk ii same hull idea potential small differences and color0 high slots4 mid slots4 low slotsstats  whatever devs think is balanced i wouldnt have a cluecargo  100m3 cargo hold  4000 m3 command center bay  20000 m3 planetary commodities baywhythe slots are so the ship can be tanked relative to any players skill though it lacks offensive capabilities i suppose someone could get silly with ewar the small cargo bay renders this ship not worthy of typical freighting ie cargo expanders dont make enough difference however the specialty bays allow the carrying of 4 command centers as well as an entire customs office worth of goodsnow the cargo stuff is nice 20k being more than most tech is can reach but it limits the ship to its intended purpose as a pi ship the other half of the coin is its bonusesrequires ore industrial skill ti fky level 1x bonus to planet scan per leveladditional 1 ly to remote sensing skill per levelthe idea is that the ship should be useful during construction and use of planetary facilitiesthough not necessary the ship provides a bonus for more accuracy during the placement of the structuresextractors for your desired resource as well as provide a bonus to the interaction range though i doubt anyone has facilities spread 10ly or more apart its another relevant bonus the ship can have to better set it apart as a pi shipas a final note i think the ship should run a little less than the noctis in its inherent mineral value but not by much the large cargo capacity is a big bonus as is the planet scan bonus the book itself runs at 14 million as it stands so this is not a newplayerfriendly shipcomments and ideas are all welcome i think the ship should be fairly easy to create and require little dev time effectively i just dont know the actual stats to be used or how the accuracy of planet scan is gaugededit  separate from this proposal i have also submitted a pi command ship idea in the features and idea section while this proposal requires minimal time on the devs part the pi command ship is from scratch and will take some time to develop if it gains any ground at all still anyone who is interested please have a look and comment on it planetary command ship thread
aside from the original primae not requiring skills whats the point of creating this instead of using an iteron vplanetology v with advanced planetology v will give you 100 accurate scanningnow lets talk a blockade runner primae and youll be onto something
i like the idea but since update the primae now bit pointless as you can only put 1 command center in it command center hold  least to get beginners going that needs to be bigger and as for the mk ii i think if trained up as thats what your going to do a t2 copy of the ship like all other well most ships would be a way to advance in the game like trying to pi in low sec but please do something about the orginal primae 1600m3 command center hold but each command center is 1000m3 mmmm dont quite work out for some one who likes to save space hahaha
the planetology skills take a long time to train to level 5training a racial industrial skill for a nonracial career to 5 is a bit nastybesides that you have a good point on the 100 accuracy perhaps that would be nerfed to 80 accuracy allowing the ship to provide the final needed 20 at maximum level of ore industrial thats tricky territory and im trying to avoid thatas for your br ideathats what blockade runners are for if you want the relative safety of a covops cloak then you use that ship over this one if you have friends to protect you or the place is empty like so many lowsec systems then this ship works just as well
the original primae is a specialrelease and it is highly unlikely ccp will touch it youre certainly welcome to try thoughi agree it was a relatively useless ship but most specialreleases areas for a beginner pi ship thats what a tech i industrial does for so many different careers since ccs are only 1000m3 with only level 1 indy skill a brand new player can tote around 3 or 4 commander centers you can as a character only control 6 ccs at most anyways and now they upgrade on the spot making hauling them less importantlike all things lowsec pi is dangerous there and this ship has the slots for a basic tank just like miner ships pi in lowsec should be dangerous just like everything else but you must remember like the ore in lowsec the planets are higher quality tookeep the comments coming though im interested to see how many other folks would like to see a pi ship that works
i would like them to have a little damage buff so they do a tad more damageedit you just want more slots to fit heavy neuts on so you might be able to cap out that rook before it jams you
in most situations the rookfalcon has much faster lock time and most likely sit at 25 km rangethe main disadvantage of using marauder for pvp is lack of agility and speed but thats problem of most bs thats why you see so few bs in pvp unless its sniper fleet battle
marauders already see a 100 damage increase equating to 8 high slots filled with weapons never mind saving isk on ammunition now you want an 8th slot over and above what they already have noctis debuffed the marauder are you serious im pretty sure i wouldnt place this high on my priority list and you dont pvp in them because of cost same for widows and a dozen other ships while caps at least have the ehp to stay on the field awhile
1the general bss problem is right therethe only thing you can fight against and think for a moment that you are flying a real ship for your time spent training is against mission rats fakegive them 25tracking and falloff per level its better tha
damn someone beat be to the smartbombing ideaanother idea is a bonus to damage against capital ships vov
i support this too
i would buy a couple marauders for pvp if they had a smartbomb bonus either 5 range or 10 damage lets face it 5 damage on smartbomb is hardly noticeable
increase sensor strengthdecrease signature radiusincrease scan resolutionincrease power gridthats all you need
buff marauders but not the sensor strength that should be their achilles heel so to speak if cost ever go down they will be used more in pvp no matter what i think instead of smartbomb or tb bonus it should be either a rr or tracking bonus if is has rr bonus it will be a good spider tank ship but remember low sensor strength means jamming and there is sure to be cap issuestracking bonus will make the marauder better vs smaller ships
i really dont believe that spider tanking is the answer it can already be done effectively enough due to 3x high utility slotsaside from agilityspeed or more damage the other alternative is increasing buffer tank like doubling of the shieldarmor hp that would also make them attractive for pvp
i thought this is about what about those 3 slots and the tractor bonus if rr modules got a bonus it would also increase survivability but not enough to be as good as logisitc shipbuffing ehp helps too but it would still have the now worthless tractor bonus
the ehp buff could be done by replacing tactor bonus
given the trend towards more pvpderived ai sleepers and incursion rats i think the whole class is for the chopping block honestly
ill support this
yes the noctis has killed the marauder class it is far far more efficient to use a navypirate bs and a noctis than a marauderthey need something to make them appealing again the first buff needs to be to the active tanking bonus and all active tanked bonused ships to bring them in line with resist bonused ships if the 75 repshield boost was extended to include 75 bonus to rr recieved that would be a huge boost to fleet work pve and pvpthe next thing to look for is to change the tractor beam bonus to something usefull no idea what or whether just doubling the bonus and giving the ship an extra hi no more pg though and a salvager bonus would work
no reason to change it imo you can either salvage as you go in the marauder or choose to spend a whole lot of time docking up warping back and forth to the mission to salvage with the noctis
wouldnt this break the regional trade i dont like it  i support the idea of travel with certain items to another region to get more per itemi think it would be better if certain racial regions had diffrent minerals like lets say amarr has lots of veldspar meaning mining will have more tritanium give gallente more of the mixed mineral asteroids caldari would get the scordite and plagioclase for pyerite while minmatar would get small roids of everything from the other highsec areasthis would mean money would be made shiping from gallente to amar and backhave a long highsec route through all the factions with a faster lowsec route if there is no highsec route idea fails the lowsec route means fast travel with increased risk
this is already the case pyroxers and omber are in different regions as well each races control towers require fuel which comes from mining the ice in their particular region
supported right now lazors are the only decent looking weapons to use railguns look like little peashooters and dont look or sound even remotly like spaceship cannons the size of a 2story buildingthis is quite pathetic this game has done a terrible job at making you feel like your actually flying a spaceship it feels like im flying a remote control toy like comon ccp the ships in this game should have this massiveawesome feel to it even just sitting inside a station or even orbiting a planet
supported1
the flagship t2 bs would be a direct step up from the field or fleet command ship and make use of the newest t1 battleship models such as the hyperion and rokh these ships would have the best in class armor and shield resistance buffs as well as deal the most damage for any t2 battleship which will be reflected in their cost which will equal or exceed any navy or pirate faction bsi wont speculate or even attempt to start assigning stats and the like its the idea that needs to be moved along and i want to see those new bs models get some more loveextra tidbit while were at it ccp lets see those newer battlecruiser models like the hurricane and the drake get some ultra hac love
a flagship should be a step up from fleet command ships and t3 it should not be some uber pwn mobilenot supported
think up some kind of useful and interesting role for tech 2 tier 3 battleships then post ita command ship on a bs hull is neither of those things and inventing ship classes just for their own sake without coming up with a reason for them to exist is a pointless exercise
i suport this its a better then most ideas out there
supported gal ships face enough disadvantages as it is
i have a better idea why dont ccp just give you free kms
so ure crying because your gate camp cant kill easy prey u know what would be more fun rather than sitting in one place roam or r u too scared of running into someone who will shoot back whats next u want them to remove your lossmails
a little dramatic arent we its worth a chuckle at any rate but i think you missed the point it would be an exploit an in game mechanic designed to be an exploit a sure kill guaranteed killmail it would effectively destroy skirmishing maneuvers and make deaggressing completely pointless it defeats the purpose and is far from hardcoreof course im pretty certain your support is dripping with sarcasm correct me if im wrongedit i suppose it may be hardcore if youre on the losing side but people adapt and pretty soon it would be a trap
no the proposal is great you are only afraid of a major change to pvpthe proposal has many hard consequences all of which i embracewhen you undock with an enemy outside will you be forced to fight there will be no turning back any longer you better mean it when you undock or stay dockedyou want to jump into an unknown system for some good fun but want to have the option to always burn back to the gate not any more here you will have to think twice too because with the change you might jump into a dead endit is a wonderful proposal it finds a lot of opposition right from the start this is a great it will drive all the dodgy pvpers away and back into highsec and into their alliance home systems i expect much more support for the proposal the assembly hall is all about dodging is it not
and with this change and a garanteed kill for the gate camper how do you propose getting noobs to enter losec if there is every possibility that the very first time they enter they get ganked and cant get away at them moment there is at least an opportunity for them to get awayits a dumb idea
nothing is guaranteed and the noobs die before they manage to get backdumb is only the resistance to a great change
while we are here coming up with rediculous ideas how about a nerf to gate camping instead have the scrambler and stargate jump cause a catastrophic overload in the scrambling ships there would be a 33 chance for every active module fitted on the ship to burn out immediately and be destroyed this would add little risk to what otherwise amounts to low risk ganking naturally bubbles wouldnt cause such overloads
interesting but sadly the wrong thread
as corina jarr brought up in the 1st reply how does this truly fit into the game mechanics the way i see things working is a communication occurs between your ship and the jump gate once you are within proper range of the gate the gate then takes over and sends you to the other side scramblers and disrupters would not be able to prevent this from happeninga possible why to achieve this would be a some sort of a radio jammer this could stop the ship from communicating with the gate or even prevent the pilot from being able to call his friends for helpalthough i mention it im completely opposed to it
woh woh woh come one dude not so fastdo you really imagine  carebears have scan cloak acceleration gate local chan show info on entries probes on scan now aggro timer on gate sentries all of this to escape and to farm safely provided by ccp do you really imagine if ever they couldnt jump through the gate while disrupted  that would be such a hard game oh my god you would have to think twice before reaching a gate no no no too hard lets stay ed lets keep the carebearing spirit so the game will get so much fun  woohoo 
i support this only if gate guns get put on every gate and go a minimum of 20000 damage per shot and have 100 tracking guns of course will need to be put in nullsec as well also they will need range so 300km like large pos guns will be good
you are a carebear you care for carebears
bad idea a proper gate camp can pretty much catch everything already and too easily if anything gates need more guns which focus fire and warp scrambling batteries the current system is a joke this change would also be the final nail in the coffin for solo pvp
sure sure i cant understand why we should play an online game in a sand box with other players if its not in order to spend all our days farming everyone on his own side i mean figthing each other without losing anything real for just having fun has no sense
nvm all vote needed d

do you realy belive what you are sayingi dont if some big and nasty incursions should occur is there where the big firepower and brave honorable warriors are abble to counter themthe game will not be better with jita or another trade hub invaded people will just log off or go to another system wait untill its clear but this will not have a great impact in their economie other than sell more ships and mods to you out therewhile in lownull this will have an impact
so the new lofty scam will be getting people to rep your mission boat at which point you are free to shoot them until you stop declaring war on your alt corpits bad enough that the guy youre repping can shoot you and by consequence flag you with gcc for aiding a pirate and bring concord upon your own sorry arsewhats wrong with simply giving neutral reppers an aggression timer so they cant dock for 15 minutes and their ship will stay in space for 15 minutes after theyve logged off
eve is a harsh universe you are forced to rethink every action if you want to go rep someone who isnt in your corporation you aid them plus i am talking when you neutral rep someone in a pvp situation repping outside a pvp situation is a whole other ballparkdont rep people whom you dont know repping a crappy unknown frigate with your logistics just is asking for being gankscammed you wont see someone in a macharial pull that scam and if someone in a frig asks for a neutral rep just tell em to dock and repair if you feel so in need to help you can even send them some isk to cover the repaircostas stated before 15 minutes just dont cut it make the penalty for chosing a side clear
this has nothing to do with the csm its at ccps discretion to exclude former csm for breaking the ndathe csms sole duty exsists in giving the community a voice in regards to the game whether someone is excluded from the future csms however has nothing to do with the game as it is
what purpose does this serve are you under threat from a previous delegate it should be at the discretion of ccp and them alone to make a ruling of this precedent last i heard it was a breach of eula for players to form a witchhunt against individuals
dreads arent useless republic alliance just used them to take out 12 carriers and 2 super caps of white noise in 1 engagement worked pretty well
actually something did happen a ccp moderator removed some of ildryns post 684 you can see the result at the bottom of that post in yellow text they did it quickly but id already quoted it in my post of 687 where i give him a reply at the bottom of that post until just now i was unaware that delilah had reported the issue i hadnt thought the veiled threat was important but apparently ccp agreed with her windjammer
collective behavior im agreeing with ildryn and finn about ank although i didnt say she had mental issues only that she had a lack of common sense on numerous issues such as her inability to control herself in a business setting her lack of good judgement to name a few before you stated that ildryn was either immature or a drunk now you are saying the same thing about me in a backhanded way if fact i have yet to refer to either you or windjammer in a negative way you are the one who started commenting about meagain i never stated anything about her mental health beyond saying she lacked common sense i dont care to defame ank what i do care about is that someone with her behavior getting on to the csm you probably wont believe me but i too am a carebear ive done pvp for a time but i was also a director in an antipirate corporation i dont care about suicide ganking but i do think its a valid tactic and should not be removed from the game by implimenting harsh penalties for those who do partake in it which is what ank stood for if someone else comes around who has the same ideals and behaviors as ank i will be just as vocal about that person and i will point to ank as an exampleim not hostile toward her but i do think she lies see my earlier comments about her misleading resume and i do think she is unfit to handle responsibility per her breaching of the nda again i never made a claim about her mental health but yes youre right that i am not in a position to assess her mental health i am in a position to say that she lied on her cvsee above comment regarding her gaining a position on the csm youre the one who is calling me names by calling me a cur again i havent made any comment about you so why are you calling me namesthis forum is to discuss debate and generally disagree on different aspects of the csm when ank entered her name into csm politics she had to expect people to disagree with her and make judgements on her past present and future actions that is what im doing here i am stated my opinion of her public actions and statements i have been respectful to you yet you call me a cur who is being disrespectful
ah i did not see when he wrote that yes i dont agree with that type of threat now that i see where you quoted him im a big enough person to admit when im wrong and i am wrong about what i stated in my quote above
just offered for you to meet me in person to see if i was a wannabe or not the offer still stands i do have a few trophies i was going to offer to show you along with a picture of my trainer i was going to show you so you could see for yourself in person that i was not a wannabe then i figured we could go to the coffee shop and sit down and discuss the details about ank in personof course since a couple of you were intimidated even secretly you immediately jump to the wrong conclusion that it was a threat next time ask someones intention before you invent them in your paranoid mindthis is possibly why you are protecting ank from ank and the other posters on this forum you perceive them as threats when really they just genuinely wish for her to seek helpoffer still stands to meet in person
troeg if you would like to disassociate yourself from the smears about anks mental health i welcome that for this i happily stand corrected as for cur curs are as curs do there are many meanings of course one is a snarling street dog used as a metaphor for vicious and unprovoked attacks being curlish is acting like a cur ill make no apology for identifying the outrageous behaviour of those trashing ank as curlish and thus curs whether one is a cur or not rests on a moral decision we make both in eve and in real life nonetheless i say this gently and with respect i appreciate you standing corrected with respect to ildryn and that communicates well of your intent i also respect your right to differ with ank over questions of policy whether we agree or not i think there is room here for legitimate debate and difference of opinion if we could depersonalize these debates and talk about policy issues not people id be very happy cheers delilah

it was a veiled threat you know it i know it other people see it and know it ccp apparently knew it and acted upon it by removing some of your post ccp didnt think it was a big deal since they didnt ban you i didnt think it was a big deal i wasnt intimidated by it and i didnt report it the veiled threat police are not going to come knocking on your door your best course of action is to ignore it let it drop and not bother with denying it alternately you could fess up and defuse any potential flamers your call your businesstrophies and a picture of your trainerjust what exactly do you think defines a person who is toughankh doesnt need help of the kind your insinuating i dont think you believe that anymore but if you do all you have to do is read some of the links ive posted to see it isnt sowindjammer
dont worry about it it was an easy thing to misswindjammer
there is no way to effectively discuss such a set of farreaching changes with the current tools available to us eftevehq or any of the homegrown equations and algorithms that people have come up with in these discussions do not take into account all the factors involved in actual gameplay and it would seem even ccp does not perform rigorous game balance testing unless a dev feels the need to jump on and personally champion an alteration this hybridgallente issue has no such championreading these discussions it becomes clear that pulling number out of the air about 80 of people agree something needs to change with hybrids andor the gallente faction but nobody can agree on what so nothing gets done and 14 of the games assets become nearly obsolete that sounds like a waste of time for everybody involved not in the least ccp having already put in the work to create those assetsso apparently its up to us but we dont have the tools we dont have the ears of the developers because there isnt time or interest on their end to actually sit down and discuss this agenda in depth and we get very limited involvement from the csm who are trying to juggle a number of other different issues to bring to the attention of ccp all of which matterif i had my way wed get a couple of devs in on a few masstesting esque singularity sessions which would be advertised and we could simply run through a set list of ships to modify and try to crowdsource a balance that way but given this kind of masstesting has only been approved for incursions and lag testing which affects every player in the game not just 14 of them i dont hold out much hope of course such sessions would likely turn into fests of one form or another as there would be no way to enforce any level of civility or professionalism on a gaggle of 500 neckbeards each with their own pet theories on how to proceedthe root of the problem is this exactly how we are supposed to come up with a detailed proposal when we have no way of testing any of our assumptions the purpose of this forum is to identify a problem and bring it to the attention of csm csm then brings it to the attention of ccp  hopefully effectively we cant provide a solution to this problem but we are clearly all very unhappy about the current state of affairs we can throw random ideas out but without a clear understanding of either ccps vision for the game or the underlying mechanisms through which it operates random ideas is all theyll be
its been longer than 13 months notriple the range buff their tanks so people actually use them in combat instead of using them as minititanshow many more threads have to be posted about thisim sick of begging ccp to fix their game while they waste my subscription dollars on vampires and console games
his is why im closing this topic when i havnt heart about ccp in a week if they are working on it or not this subject is running for 14 months exellent prove that ccp dont even listen to csm and that needs to be propaganded in a shot amount of time
bump
i fully support this topic but you realise not being interested in people who say no will screw with your resultslook 100 of people x number support my topic but i didnt include anyone who said no
even gallente avatars are underpowered the optimal  falloff on my portrait does not come anywhere near justifying the small dps increase my awesome beard provides supported
i agree and would add that there ought to ba a small rotating team that is checking the number crunching for all races after each major patchm

id much rather see a bigger hipbooty options sure whats there now is decent but i have friends whore much more endowed than that
for that you would need some kind of elementary boobass physic you can get away without one with cartoonish models heavy armor and flat chested characters but with realistic body models in clothing a large solid chests and asses will look very out of place with pictures it doesnt matter but when we get to animations with realistic characters and realistic physics with everything else those solid parts will stick out like sore thumb in a bad way its also pretty standard feature with modern games so i cant see why some get upset over such a simple thing it seems boob physics are taken for granted these days and ass physics are the new boob physics in gaming i can certainly see why since the added realism and better looks attract a lot of positive attention i havent heard anyone ever complaining about having realistic boobass physics in a game they complain it is unnecessary at times but no one ever wants to get rid of itit might be better to make and use the same basic physics for all such soft jiggly areas breasts ass fat belly could all use some jolly jiggling and as long as you are making it for one part you might as well alter some parameters and use it for the others too
now that i agree with
jigglelets 
in this case ccp is provably wrong as has been discussed on this board many times before because blasters cannot apply even a fraction of their dps unless both attacker and target are completely stationary i understand railguns are clearly a gimp weapons system and were designed to be a pointless afterthought from the getgo which leaves gallente without a longrange engagement option but blasters are clearly referenced many times as the primary weapon system of the gallente next to drones which are also terrible in their current statethere is a problem with the weapons themselves and there is a problem with the ships and there is a problem in the interaction between the game mechanics and the entire factions engagement philosophy that is why there have been at least two fix hybridgallente threads on page one of the assembly hall features and ideas and ships and modules forums for the past four months
as an example the vagabond flies much faster is significantly more maneuverable and its guns have dramatically more range than the deimos not a fair trade for a slight damage and tracking increase between ac and blastersthe boats need a bonus that negates the impact of armor modules directly by changing either the ships maneuverability andor their ability to accelerate i think they are currently one and the same modifier minmatar should have maneuverable or high speed not both gallente should have one of these perks to fix their shipsthe blasters need to have the sig radius of the weapons decreased and the tracking increased or just a straight increase to damage the negatives of the weapons do not balance the positives either decrease the negatives infringing on other weapons niche or increase the positives
omgwtfbbqbumpofoblivionessok so oblivioness isnt a wordbut he said my bumps suck
dont worry about that blasters thread exists now for more than 2years and they dint even take a look at itsay something or they have s hit at the eyes
personally i think it would be a lot better to make alliances do convoy ops it gives people more to do so i totally support getting rid of jump bridges
it is about both thats the whole bit about altering game mechanics to allow small alliances to be independent even if playercreated politics wouldnt lean that way and potentially causing coalitions to tear themselves apart as ive pointed out many times while i see no valid reason to remove jbs the major problem is the precedent that altering game mechanics to alter playercreated content sets the topic would be significantly different if ccp simply kicked around the idea of changing or even removing jbs without explicitly tying it in to altering playercreated content so small alliances can be independent and large coalitions are more likely to disintegrate and shoot each other i wish folks would avoid this sort of obvious nonsense i clearly state that everybody should be allowed to determine how playercreated politics get sorted out by the processes of conflict and cooperation between and among themselves and that whatever happens should be the result of 100 of eves playerbase getting to choose others claim that their specific playstyle should be supported at the expense of how others like to play and i need to be reminded that the game isnt only about me i just got ganked by people using game mechanics to beat me and someone has argued against removing them that just shows why he is arguing the way he is what im the one who got ganked i dont understand what youre getting atjbs made for great pvp and made cvas providence one hell of a fun place to hunt i suppose thats because most of us didnt cry about being blobbed or how unfair it was and how much we needed ccp to change things to help us when cva brought a bigger fleet than us and boxed us into a system by jump bridging back and forth we just went for the fights and here you were trying to avoid combat and jbs allowed a gang to catch you but jbing in your telling of events at least prevented you from avoiding pvpremind me again are you on the more pvp is good by definition side of the discussion
honestly i dont think you have any idea what a sandbox game is finnagainlet me help you out a sandbox game by definition is a video game with no linear storyline or specific goal the player deriving amusement from a range of openended interactions or situationsas it is no one is stopping you from joining a super coalitions or joining a small roaming corp  allianceshould these changes go through that choice is unimpeeded by any potential changes more to the point this game was a sandbox game before jumpbridges or titan bridges were ever used so suggesting that their removal would somehow stop this game being a sandbox game is verging on mad panic
ccp put jbs in and some time later theyre wondering if jbs arent actually turds polluting the sandbox and ruining the experience for everyonejbs themselves arent necessarily so bad cyno transport by itself isnt necessarily so bad perhaps its not that jbs and cynos are turds in the sandbox as much as gravel a concept in line with the rest of the sandbox just poorly implementedsome simple changes would be enough to balance the issue out a little reduce the maximum range of any cyno jf bobs capital jb and add a jump drive spool up time or as per one of my suggestions have an intensity which is incremented for each cycle of the cynoprojector with larger ships requiring more intense beacons bring the sport back into huntingattacking the cyno ship must be a viable option for those ongrid when the cyno is lit
any change to the game alters the playercreated content set your argument is invalid and absurd you dont like the idea of removing jbs because youre more interested in your own personal security rather than the good of the game but this is obvious
well no not for everybody for those who dont like them there are evidently 10s of thousands who do but be that as it may again the problem isnt so much that they found a mechanic that was working a way they didnt like but that its being done specifically to reshape playercreated politics and break sandbox play why should small alliances be independent seriously eve is a sandbox game and we determine our own political arrangements the only way anybody should be independent is if they can convince others to leave them alone thats the whole point behind playercreated political content you are deliberately ignoring that the word i used was to and not and yes any change alters how players will play the game creating changes specifically in order to alter playercreated content and break sandbox play on the other hand is quite different tune in next week for another episode of internet psychologist same time same channel
seems there is a lot of people that are very unhappy with the minmatar races being very asianis this being discussed by the csm if not why not toon appearances are very important for walking in stations and central to an mmo as you live in that toon for your entire game
i like how val turned out but i wouldnt mind a bit more of the mongol look from before
vherokiors and khanids are a bugger to do much of anything with vherokiors look drugged or asleep altogether their eyes are slits khanids look bugeyed at best i had two tries with this khanid and she still could use help i agree that the looks of your character are important just as stats training and ships are they are all what makes your toon unique if we didnt care about any of that wed be playing carboncopycharacter shooter gamesi vote for a race change option too nowadays there are no stat differences so what does it matter your training corpalliance choices and mission faction decide your path not your original race choice how about calling it witness protection surgery and offering everyone a shot at it

am i really seing csm go on about character creator tweaks half your tweaks require rebuilding the entire system sure a stop fidgeting dammit might be useful for taking pictures but then you lose the whole animation part of the character creator not a major tweak though it just has to shut off animationschanging the methods of tweaking the characters nose or pinching his cheaks is contrary to the purpose of the model and would require a complete rewrite of frontend code not to mention various animation features some to be replaced and others to be removed given the amount of times you will actually be generating portraits of your characters do you really think it neccessary that ccp scrap their idea for yoursplease csm get your priorities straight
first you gotta ask yourself why is the whole animation part of the character creator there to begin with it looks cute but its not really functional to answer the question myself i think your model inside the character creator is animated because ingame the animation cant be seen anywhere else yet and ccp still wanted to show off their cool animatronics inside the character creator it isnt all that useful thoughnonsense tweaking facial and other aspects of your character is the express purpose of the character creatornonsense adding a few extra tweaks is precisely that adding a few extra tweaksdont look upon it as changing so much as completing an unfinished product the character creator is at the basis of a whole new 3d experience you want to get that right
i dont have to ask myself anything to be perfectly honest about it i know why its there and it serves its purpose without it the characters would just be plastic models where the animations actually bring life to them you may not see it or even need it but im sure youll remember the old system it was like pushing silly putty around this allows you to see how the characters appear with full animations and really it doesnt offer that much distraction for me i think you missed the point i was referring to using arrow keys to move the features around which would require at best clicking and holding while tapping the keys either way when i referred to the model i was referring to the design of the character creator not the actual animated character you see when you are adjusting your facial features mousing over an area clicking and pulling left right up or down is all that really needs to be done to shape the face they even include a graphical front end which indicates the direction to sweep your mouse pull it tweak it pinch it sculpt it as intended thats the modeli wont claim to know a whole lot about coding but i am fairly certain this is not what you thinkadding features from the old character creator to the new one is not finishing the product which while slightly lacking in ammenities is quite polished as it is so maybe there isnt quite the option of clothes you might like but having thousands of possible appearances for each racegender combination is well beyond unfinishedjust be happy that ccp has given you the most advanced character generation system in the world and be done with your squabbling and bickering over what you consider to be missing features it is very well done and exceeds every standard marking it as a most excellent accomplishment just be satisfied with that for now
excuse the alt hes new and doesnt know betterspeaking of which i made a character creator tutorial video and uploaded it in two parts its the first time ive done this sort of thing so dont think to poorly of my effort you can find it hereeditand here is the second part
i do not argue with that job is fulfilled very well but it should be better than at others and i just as also many other players have already noted that faces of same races on avatars very much and are very similar against each otherdivide muscles of lips make more mobile parts of the face on a step of portrait creation and add hardly more possibilities to move and change a part of the person on a step of customizationnevertheless it seems to me that body parts change very badly and the mimicry is held very down
ill agree that the facial animations could be more mobile when using the portrait features certainly its hard to make a reasonably decent toothy smile and you cant lift the cheeks to represent a smile that shows in the eyes the only thing you really can do there is push the lower lid up on the side that you happen to be smiling it is some semblance of it at any rate and enough provided you dont push it to far a little overboard on that lower lid and it looks like your character means to tear somebody apart savagely its a fine lineif you watch the second part of my tutorial near the end youll notice i push the bottom jaw up to close the mouth this is because i noticed fairly early on any smile showing teeth looks a little slack jawed lips are pulled up in the act of smiling jaws dont hang open that way of course i dont really think that was the intent as im sure theres an expression it appropriately fits which i havent usedthere is allowed some exageration to the way you can move things around and i believe this is entirely reasonable as it allows for some interesting characteristics the lantern jaw sloped brow overdeveloped cheekbones and the like which ive seen occaisionally among real people generally not all at once but thats all in the choice physical characteristics of the body have similar changes allowing for sagging buttocks pert breasts underdeveloped musculature and various other features which could be carefully appliedi do have one small grouch i like women to be fit and well toned something which doesnt seem to be available from the one experiment i tried on sisi the musculature just doesnt show no matter how its applied sure the women can look fit enough but not athletic or sleekly toned and muscular truth i rarely see any women that actually fall into that category but that doesnt mean they dont exist by any means im rather disappointed you cant model a character in that fashion as its perfectly reasonable to expect to be able to do sothere are certainly options though thats just the one thing missing its all covered up for now anyway so its really not that important sure i mention a few things in my videos but i consider those personal opinions something not shared by all as maybe that last may not be its just a preference theres a lot of people playing this game and im sure half havent considered it quite a few would likely disagree with me on many points which is also perfectly acceptable and alrightsorry i tend to make wall of text posts in conversational fashion with regularityregardless sure it could see some changes and become better but then nothing is ever perfect and we cant expect that for all that i just dont see it as a priority and think time could be better spent on other things
hello guysthe new guiview of autopilotroutes is funny but i wish it had a little upgrade now you can get informations by hovering and rightclicking on the dots there you can get system information and other stuff  and you can remove waypoints but if i have a lot of them travelling through the galaxy and my plans have to change i have to rightclick each of the dots to see if it is a waypoint or notwhat about some visual addition to those waypoits somewhat like a shiny border more height slow flashing or something else that wouldnt be a great jump forwards in playing but i think it would be nice yours haef
had the same thought myself
there are a couple groups that are barking up the wrong treelocal removers want ratters to not run away at the sight of single hostile in local therefore they want to remove local this group also includes all the anticarebears even if they oppose local removalmacro haters everyone hates macros so they propose various solutions that would make ratting suck for everyone except the macrosratters are in ty fits are only usable against the npcs so its no wonder they dont want to engage playersmacros are fighting against predictable stupid npcs its too easy to make a macro for such mundane activity i cant even blame them its really boringwhat the eve needs is complete overhaul of npc aii propose these changes1 make all the rats have omniresists2 make all the rats have omnidps3 make all the rats run away when losing if not warp scrambleddisrupted4 make all the rats drop better loot and have higher bounties5 make all the rat spawns smaller6 make all the rats switch targets7 make all the rats use capacitor and let us neut them and turn off their modules if they run out of capthere may be other changes but in short i want to use same fits for pvp and pve and i want rats to be less predictable than they currently areccp please make ratting fun 
i agree with 37 however 1 and 2 need to be rethinked 2 instead of omni why not just have the spawn with random ammo for br and sansha this would change the ranges and amount of damage for angels it would alter the damage type done as well as range and amount as for 1 there tanks should be made close to pvp as possible to reflect that they arnt as powerful as us players maybe all t1 fit for standard rats with the meta going up with the ranking of the rat faction rats would be fit with all faction mods etc thats a balance issue and best left to ccp and tests on sisii would also add one 8 have npcs use dronesthere ships have drone bays why arnt they using them
all races can use drones thoughyeah some more than others but i would love to see more variety on the field now its a case of either ecm drones or combat drones
maybe make drone boat bonuses apply to ewar drones as well ie the dmg bonus would also apply to the effectiveness of ewar
think of it a bit like a t3 in that all the modules would fit together seamlessly being designed in that fashion and potentially scalable using the same technology as the character creator pos modules would alsoidealybenefit from having their textures auotassigned based on the primary structures faction there would be no need for multiple models of any given structure except the base pos structure the interlocking mechanism of the primary structure to the modules would be the same for each faction pos that existed all that would change is the design between structural hardpoints and the textures applied to all structures as a wholeconstructing the pos would be relatively easy and semiguided as a result of there being only so many variables available instead of dropping structures in space and attempting to maneuver them into the right position from a skewed perspective packaged modular structures would be dropped into a construction hangar and deployed from the 3dimensiol management and control interface in this way you could easily assemble your pos with a simple pointandclick interface ignoring the scalability for now as that might be difficult to merge with the 3dimensional command interface the reason being that the nature of the command interface would require predetermined structural regularities scaling and stretching models would be hard to integrate with this sort of model potentially impossible at this stage interesting idea thoughheres an example of how one might approach pos assemblyfor the example well use a basefaction unknownpos structure and well add to it a 3point bridgeway and a hangarstructural hardpoints nodes will be visible as small hemispheres on the surface of the 3dimensional interface structure well click on one of those nodes to access a drop down menu which will then display the various structures which can be connected to that node the node currently selected is near the base of the model and one of 6 identical nodes in a ring around that part of the model the node has only one available option that being the hangar array which is highlighted the reason it is highlighted being that we have dropped 4 such modules in the construction hangar we also have placed a 3 point bridge in the construction hangar but that is for later so well move back to the fictitious modelselecting hangar from the list we get a popup menu it is asking us if we wish to assemble the structure in this location we click yes to begin the anchoring process and recieve a warning indicating that we have a 5 minute anchoring period do we wish to proceed yes this begins the anchoring stage a 5 minute timer begins counting down and we can now exit the interface window looking at the pos structure in space we can see the hangar array begin to take shape extending outward from the pos with a basic framework and resolving into its eventual shapereturning to the command interface we decide wed like to begin anchoring another array which we can do nowwith this new posunlike those old poss which required waiting for each individual structure we continue with our anchoring process and soon have an adjacent hangar structure as well as twoalso adjacent to each otherstructures on the opposite side of the tower we have a new command available now clicking on two adjacent structures to highlight them we rightclick and bring up another menu this one has one feature which says merge hangar modules of course we want to so we click on that selection and affirm that we yes indeed do want to merge these modules the two hangars will now effectively function as one granting twice the storage space of one individual hangar this will be much more effective for storing all those precious resourcescont
you mean kinda like this i compiled these ideas a long time ago but ccp is hesitant to touch the pos code due to the spaghetti code which theyre just now trying to get straightened out and updated to take advantage of new capabilitiesccp already knows about this i brought this up during my term on the csm now it comes down to when they can allocate the manpower and audacity to make it happen
moving on with our timer slowly ticking away the seconds we notice that it has 18 minutes 45 seconds remaining on it checking the bridging structure we see that it has a 2 minute 50 second anchoring time clicking on a node about midway up the 3dimensional inbterfaces model we see that this one will allow us to connect our bridging structure as well as a number of other things among these are class i offensive platformsthose not involving drones pointtopoint bridging structuresfor extending a single structural node away from the base structure and bridging pylonsa structural brace which also acts as a secondary structural node arm two of which are required to connect to a lateral bridging array the lateral bridging array has two secondary nodes on it which you can connect larger assembly structures too there is also a bilateral bridging array for connecting even larger structures which requires the use of 3 bridging pylons but i digresswe select the 3point bridging structure of course as it is highlighted and confirm that yes we want to anchor it in this location this adds 2 minutes 50 seconds to the timer and we find ourselves with 15 minutes remaining my little digression took a little time so now we click on the individual structures which are now in the process of anchoring and from the dropdown menu select online when anchored we do this for all the structures save the bridging array noting that the merged hangars now select as one module this adds a secondary timer below the first in the command interface which will begin to count down after the anchoring has completed it says 5 minutesall structures will of course complete anchoring at the same time and will likewise complete their onlining process at the same time remarkably we do not have long to wait so its time to go pick up some more modules for our posand so on you have it thats the general idea i hope you like it
i wont say it isnt similar but its certainly not the same i resolved to leave most pos mechanics the same and simply redesign the pos and management interface there is some additional stuff which i have mentioned but its more for customization than any major modification to final function in the end you still cant dock on a pos or have it repair you vessel and it does not have any of the functions of a real station a lot of what youve suggessted can be found in the larger player stations and has more in common with those structures than with our typical posi have no idea what spaghetti code is honestly i rather like my idea but then thats only natural i was also considering the potential for upgrade modules with their own particular structural hardpoints which would replace the need for more than one size of pos these would allow for individual increases to powergrid cpu shields and armor while increasing the number of structural hardpoints with which additional modules could be mounted to the pos these additional structural nodes would be on the individual upgrade modules which would connect to upgrade nodes on the main pos structure one for each with only a few available configurations to allow for additional options in pos setup should 8 upgrade hardpoints be available overall still only four of them could be used an upgrade to what would effectively be a large pos would require an extension to the upgrade which would just increase its sizethese are only ideas of course
yes it would be nice but lots of planning will have to be donebut i do support this one here
we will sit the whole days and to destroy stations as in a series of south park about worldofwarcraft no waybut interaction of players with stations is necessary for reconsidering for more realism than we do a very strong pewpew in to station during an 15 hours and the station became ours it has bothered for a long time already and became stupidgive to us some more to hear about particulars of a siege of station about details of concerning its capture about errors failures during it about risks and an amount of the spent resources about real damages which were received by station about ruined stations and ststions recovered from ruins and to result in working state give more detailed story about corrupting and repairalso stop to feed us with any repairing beams and rays yes it is sciencefiction game but an amount of beams and rays in it can pass line of marasmuspsthe variant with repairing through normal expenditure of isks  seems to me same inappropriate as well as a large quantity of rays of different colors which do anything you like in gameit is possible to invent something more interesting than simply expenditure of isks  something that will demand to move and something to do in the interesting form

im gunna go ahead and put my 2 cents in on this i understand that ccp is under alot of pressure to do something to combat the frequency of high sec war decs as the outcry against us griefers has reached epic levels in the past few monthsnow whether or not this was an intended nerf to high sec war declaring corporations or not this is an incredibly detrimental new addition to the game prior to the patch it was possible to not display pilots in your overview unless they were set red blue or were war targetsthis latest patch changed the definition of what a neutral is and subsequently the overview will display all pilots in your overview who have no standing to you to get these pilots removed from your overview you would need to set them their corporation or alliance to neutral something which for 7 years has been a default standing if no other standings were set and then go into your overview and select to have neutrals removed from your overviewhaving said that the defence to this argument is going to be yeh but ccp just increased the amount of contacts your address book can holddoes ccp really wish for us to strain their database with 1024 address book entries just so we can ensure that our overviews are cleangive us back the old overviewsdo not let this go untouched like the cyno effect and engine trails

a couple comments simply being on a killmail doesnt make you good at pvp i would argue that being on 10000 killmails with 50 other people is proof positive that you dont know anything about pvp some of the best pvpers i know are very rarely on killmails i appreciate the ability to post fake lossmails to throw people off its so juicy when they try to research you and think youre a nubcake  i find your opinion totally irrelevant because you are more motivated by getting the killmail than getting the fight the fact that you claim to know what motivates pvpers is mindbogglingand if youre looking for liangs recent combat history  so sorry i neglected to set up a corpalliance killboard we do occasionally share killmails on battleclinic though  so youll have the best luck therelianged while liang is one of my 6570m sp mains i do want to point out that i do the majority of my pvp on other accounts mostly so that people will get their mind off the ing killboard and on the point im trying to make
without killmails there will be no reporting of what happens with respect to pvp in the game except from ccpscreen shot or it didnt happenright now we get to hear about vast fleets of ships from players that fight each other in nullsec we hear about gangs roaming around other places chewing up large amounts of ships all of this with links to killmails to back up claimsits not perfect but it beats the hell out of dead silence with gossiprumors attempting to fill it all in we get that from most other aspects of the gamethis at least lets the players see the numbers and decide for themselves if they are accurate or not
skex relbore moronanubis thinking person to not support this you are one of the guys who think they are pros from whooring the crap out of killmails all day camping a station all day and using boosting alts and whatnot does not make you good at pvp doesnt make you bad either but because of their killboard the reason they try so hard to camp and not die they think they are top dogs and so do other people buy a spaceship no implants no alts whatsoever fit for pvp and go roaming once in a while that is for the true pvper the one you dont  with solo pvp is dead because of killboards and its the truthedit if you want proof there was a huge fleet battle goddamn get someone to fraps it its not hard hell press the button that says prtscrn on you frickin keyboard people
there is also no point in solo pvp if i dont have a killmail to prove my ability killboards already award less points for blobbed kills and in the case of battle clinic exponentially less points for blob kills but overall killboards do not emphasize the point aspect as much as the iskkill efficiencies which is where your glorious epeen arguments probably stem from
really thats a rather myopic viewpoint all i have to do is undock
why is there no point in solo pvp without killmails what about fleet pvp that can work fine without them too of course they both would work very well without killmails but what exactly are you trying to say the idea that killmails are the only reason to pvp is pretty weird
let me tell you some storiesi remember a long time ago i was flying a drake  back when the drake was the worst pvp ship in the game it was a hml drake and i warped to a gate a gank mega the best pvp ship in the game landed on top of me and proceeded to kick my ass except that i one volleyed his drones and then proceeded to kick his ass he did get away in structure and i didnt get the killmail but that was a good fighti remember a while back i was flying around in a thrasher and came across an older player in a vexor sporting t2 drones im a bit crazy so i engaged him and focused on primarying his drones it took a while but i did eventually run him out of drones and then i ransomed him for 10 mil that was a fantastic fight and one of the best 10m ive ever earnedi was flying a drake when i got engaged by 2 hurricanes and a myrm i fought them to a stand still and missed out on the killmails of the two canes as they died to sentry fire on the other side of the gate i didnt miss out on the loot though a while back i was flying a brutix i engaged a drake and took him to armor he ejected and i missed the pod but i bookmarked my free drake no killmail awesome kill i was flying a cyclone and engaged an af he tried to do the abscram thing but it didnt work out too well for him got him onto vent to for the ransom eeeppppiiiccc killmails dont mean  the fights are what matterlianged not many recent stories because im afraid i might out an alt 
well i think killmail is a waste of broadbandbut if that is what the kids want screw themif we can we will just jam the killmailill send someone over to pop up the station nowremember this is a game
oh look would this be another anubis alt wouldnt surprise me since were talking about someone who used their own sock puppet to bump their own stupid ideaoh and once again another person with crappy killboard status just reinforcing my point that most of the people who want to get rid of killboards are doing so because they sucksolo pvp is dead because the game isnt built to support it but you know what there are plenty of solo pvpppers running around who do just fine im not one of them and i dont pretend to be im gonna take what ever i need kill your ass and killboard ranking be damned different people play this game for different reasons with different motivations some play it for the challenge of building an empire some play it to shoot rocks and mine  some play to cause grief and yes some play to  onto killmails at the end of the day the killboards only cause you grief if you let them you are trying to define pvp as something far more constrained in this game than it is oh let me add one to your little listtony soxai another fail pvper whining because the whole universe can see how fail they are
no i like my killmails what else will my double sb zealot be needed for btw there isnt anything wrong with km its human nature its a game for freaking sake treat it like one
this thread was stupid yesterday and its stupider todaywe have a bunch of people who have almost no real experiance in pvp telling us why it is we pvpas it is most killboards have a point system which distributes less points for blobbing  ecm ships  logis ships etc etc this in a way encourages people to play solo  honorablypeople blob  ecm  gatecamp for many reasons most of them boil down to people dont like losing removing kms will never stop people wanting to win if anything you will be left with less people who care about what their rank  stats look like and you will most likely boil pvp down to enourmous fleet fights over moongoldbut hey if thats the path you want your pvp to take
you are arguing against a strawman here liang ive never claimed that just being on a killmail makes one a good pvper in fact i very specifically pointed out that one can tell the people who only blob from those who dont by looking at their killmail history i had always assumed that you did most of your pvping on a different character from liang so i dont expect you to be represented on killboards most of your arguments dont ring false so i dont call bull on them ill also point out that i said most people who object to killboards are fail pvpers and specifically noted that there are always exceptionsi dont appreciate the ability to post fake losseskills it undermines the ability to have a good record of pvp historythe bit about being a killmail  is called sarcasm i fight because i like fighting the killmails are just a record that i use to track progress to see my gradual change from sucking more to sucking lessoh i never claimed to know what motivates all pvpers not like the op who claims that all are motivated by nothing but the desire to gather killmails what i said was that killmails do not encourage blobbing the consequences of loss are what cause blobbing killmails actually provide a disincentive to blob because of the way points are assigned by most killboardsof course i laugh at people who try to stay off killboards because whether you post or not eventually someone you fight is going to post it even if you dont hell i even makes sure to post my losses to ensure as accurate record of possible exists plus i like to know exactly how a particular fit performed
not supportedi have a better ideaif you dont like killmailsdont look at them problem solvedthread
then it appears i misunderstood youoh man but its awesome you can make yourself look like a total ing noob and it makes the kill ever so sweeter when theyre completely dumbstruck i dont really agree with that many killboards still still rank people off of the total number of kills and really even 10 points for a blob kill is better than no points  or negative points for a lossyoud be amazed how many people dont post lossmails liang
no i have exactly one alt and she only exists to play lotteriesi always post mine even when it only gets me attention from smackers and trolls for it
ok im not saying this is proof positive but i would agree that this would make me think its quite likely this person does not really know how to pvp but this is the important thing the only way you know that they only blob is by the killmails killmails are the only consequence to pvp that does not encourage blobbing every other consequence to pvp encourages blobbingpvp for isk then your best way is to blobpvp for sov then your best way is to blobpvp to get killmails that demonstrate some skill  dont blobpvp for fun of course we all do that but one of the reasons its fun is the consequences if you take away the consequences it wont be fun long first you can fairly well much tell if someone is a decent pilot by looking at their killboard no you dont just look at the ranking if you just look at the ranking then you are an idiot but that is not the fault of the killmail that you do not know how to read them the killmails and killboards are still very helpful in determining if someone is a decent pvperat least solo or small gang pvper second the better killboards like battleclinic do not give 10 points for a blob kill im not saying the ranking is perfect but with it and looking at the fits and the kills the person has with them you can get a sense if they are good or not are pandemic legion and genos occidere pilots good pvpers if you say yes then it should be no surprise to you that they do pretty well on the battleclinic rankings without killmails to call out people eve pvp will get much worse
why am i not surprised the op doesnt have a battleclinic recordyou know kms are a tool we use these to evaluate a fight after the fight sure a little smack here and there but an experienced fc will look at the battle report afterwards and see what losses could have been negated and why who isnt using standardized fits who gimped their fit so they could  on the mail etc etc so forth and so onalso aside from ship scanning a fleet before rolling out kms are a good way to determine the experience of people applying to your corpalliance or offering to kill people in the name of whateveryou say kill the killmails i say fix them with everything else thats messed up in this game its pretty sad that this is what you came up with to try and change all i want is an overview that works
i never use battleclinic so anything that would be on there would be inaccurate anyway
your post is so completely full of epic fail that its hard to respond to it constructively i will try anywayyou utterly misunderstood my point about 10000 killmails what i was pointing out is that your killboard score  no matter how its scored  is not a useful metric for measuring how good your pvp skill is when it continues to give any points for blob kills furthermore there is no way at all to know if it was a good fight or a blob kill  afterall it isnt uncommon to only get a couple of kills when engaging a vastly superior force against the oddsconsider a battleship kill with 5 bcs on it two cruiser kills with 5 bcs on themhow do you read those killmails who blobbed  and who got blobbed whats the story there oh  thats right there is insufficient information to answer even one of those questions yet you feel that you can somehow evaluate someones entire pvp experience and worth using only an arbitrary scoring metric based on insufficient information to give you a good idea of what happened if you were thereyou say that the best way to get isk when pvping is to blob yet thats patently false the fc gets the isk and you might get a 100th of your ship value from the loot you say that the best way to demonstrate skill is to not blob  but thats not really true because killmails dont tell the whole storyspecific comments people pvp in lossless mmos all the time and have great fun in doing so some of the best and most fun pvp ive ever had was in tier 12 in warhammer online and i didnt lose anything at all when i lost you seem to be claiming that the lossmail is a consequence of pvp  and that giving someone a loss mail to report is somehow what drives you to pvp in eve what the  manfrankly people like you are what is wrong with pvp in eveliang
there is more to reading a killboard than just reading individual kills sometimes you need to look at the battle reports for other kills in the area at the same time it doesnt change the fact that you can tell really quickly which pilots tend to fly with the blobs and which dont as far as it being a useful metric or not that would depend on just how active a pilot is admittedly its not going to tell you much about a character with only say 10 or even 100 kills but once one crests 1000 well at that point patterns emerge is it a perfect metric no of course not there are no perfect metrics they all rely up on context there are any number of factors to determine what level of confidence one has in a given metric so a smart person recognizes this a killboard for a pvp character is a bit like a resume just because you have 10 years experience in your field doesnt mean you are particularly good at it however the odds of you be better at it than some random  off the street are fairly good which is why recruiters and managers use resumes to screen potential candidatesthey can be padded of course just like killboards and everyone tries to put the best possible spin on them but they do serve a useful filtering purposeyou check these people you know who are really good pvpers if they really are good their killboards will show it unless they are good at a noncombat role such as logistics or scouting but anyone with any sense understands that those are different skills from picking and winning fights and those who dont will miss out on good recruitsbut for all its failiing killboards are not only the best way to get a quick read on a given characters combat experience and capabilities its the only way to get that quick read i see all kinds of people on these forums all the time who can talk a good game but there is a huge gulf of difference between knowing what to do in pvp in this game and actually doing it im much better at theory crafting than i am at live pvp myself so i dont give much credibility to people who simply talk a good game anyone can read a pvp guide and sound like they have half a clue not everyone can take that knowledge and translate it into actual kills once again killboards arent perfect but they are the best but also the only objective measure of a pilots pvp competence in this game
i think the main premise of this killmail discussion is invalidwhether one is good or bad at pvp is not influenced by presence or absence of killmail removing them will not make people better or worsewhether certain pvp tactics are effective or not is not influenced by killmailsit is true that some peoples decisions in battle are influenced by the presence of killmail those who let thoughts of killmails interfere with good tactics will be punished with lower performancetherefore letting killmails stay is the hardcore thing to do only the weak suffereditthis is a true statement all other measurements are subjective

you seem to be implying that killmails kill pirating and small gang pvpi happen to be a big supporter of promoting small gang pvp but i address the real issues not this silly dramathe real issues effecting small gang pvp the great nano nerf  reduced speed tactics ability of smaller forces to engage larger ones successfully gradual rise in defenseoffense ratio due to numerous game altering patches such as rigs boosters faction mods being much more defense than offensive hp buffs gang links stacking nerfs 00 made safe for alliances with jbs jump freighters titan bridges  less small scale traffic thru stargateslow sec suffers because of riskreward ratio being totally screwed where 00 has less risk than low sec yet more isk making stuff than in low sechigh sec being extremely low risk yet very profitable with level 4 agents balance that and you are half way solving the problemskillmails are nothing but a distraction from the real issues
you seem flustered it appears you didnt readcomprehend what i said and you are not making sense the bottom line is skex is correct in saying killmails provide the only objective measure of pvp skill they also provide allot of other helpful information im not sure what you mean by the fc gets the isk i have never flown in a gang where the fc gets all the loot but from what i understand about 50 of fit mods on a killed ship should drop so no pvp in general is not a good way to make isk but you are in general going to be better off isk wise to the extent your gang is bigger than everyone elses you dont actually doubt this do youso if your intent is to blow up your enemies isk and save your own the best strategy is to blob the above statement doesnt make any sense how would a killmails ability to tell the whole story effect whether non blob pvp is the best way to demonstrate skill killmails dont tell the whole story and no one in this thread ever said they did but by looking at rankings and other things such as how many are on each killmail what are they fighting what fits are they flying in and other information we get from killmails you can get a decent idea if someone knows how to pvp no doubt some people can endlessly play games with nothing on the line but if there is something on the line the game is always more excitingim not just claiming lossmails are consequences of pvp im stating a fact i wouldnt say giving people a loss mail to report is somehow what drives me to pvp but trying to give more lossmails than i receive is something i certainly strive for and certainly if there were no killmails i would quickly get tired of eve not only do they give some more consequences to battles and to some extent measure your success but they put some check on blobbing and lame tactics by at least helping identify when they are used this is a game liang every game is better if there is some method to measure your success it helps people strive for whatever they want you want golf without scorecards and to tear down the scoreboards in football baseball basketball and every other sport why because they do not perfectly measure skill at that sport and keeping score might prevent some people from playing that sport a single game does not perfectly measure a teams ability at a sport nor does a single killmail or battle report based on killmails but over time you can at least reach some conclusions about pilots skilleve as they say is a sand box people can decide what their goals are if you want to make lots of isk you can and you can measure your success by your wallet if you want to schmooze other players and run a big alliance you can and you can measure your success by the number of people in your alliance and the territory you own if you want to be a good pvp pilot there is only one thing to measure your success  your killmail stream no one says they are perfect but they are a lot better than nothing you can tell if someone is just killing pve ships and industrials if they are always outnumbering the other side how they fit their ships etc they should be improved no doubt i think ships that give boosts and repps to the killers should appear on killmails this would make them even better but of course still not perfect but doing away with them altogether is really just a bad idea
do you have any idea how long it has been since ive seen a real pirate almost five years i think veto still does legitimate piracy but i dont even know that for a fact eitherhint piracy doesnt involve blowing the victim up unless they dont pay the ransom or toll which means no killmail killmails killed piracy
yes purely because in large alliances ppl ninja on so many killmails when large fleets battles assume they are epeen when infact all they did was orbit and shoot wow uber pvper
yea i wanted this for a long time makes it nicer also the game a bit like 3000ad  a real crew on your ship engineers marines officers commanders military doctors what ever all that is needed to run a real ship you can hire them on stations and 1 has more options than the other and also you need the correct skills for that to get a better crew on your ship  i think thats wayyyyy cooler and wayyyy better than just 1 person you as the only all managing crew it gives an extra dimension to the game also also what should be great is boarding ships to board a enemies ship you dont have to be able to fly them your specialty crew can do that for you for just a moment till you are at the station and dock all those things would be great hahah also what would be cool is the resources needed like food and water  just like a station
if i can sexually harass my yeoman just like i do in mass effect 2 then i fully support you for this reason aloneother than that crews are so outdated p
read the chronicles every ship but frigs has a crew but life is so cheap in new eden theyre ignored with game mechanicsto make it easier on you this capsule proves we still have crews all these lives fit to ruin
i was thinking about this same thing but have where you can plan a normal not podder character you will have different skills you can learn and you can pilot ships but in a different way you dont get all the bennies but on other stuff you can get bennies like some of the markets
nah its not outdated its a nice option i mean it does not mean you have to micromanage the ship there you have the crew for  to make it even more nicer is to have a real bridge i mean they are busy with dust now and also there you have a bridge on the command ship so why not for us in eve and some monitors like in dust to see what we see now just from the captains chair  damn than it would even be nicer but i think that ccp is thinking more about the  however i do think they are going to implement more things like this because of dusti mean soon we are able to walk in the space stations and interact with each other thats already a step closer 
i played sto for little while got bored because in 3 12 months i was a vice and ran out of things to do well it was some nice features like walking around your ship and walking on station plus planet side i also like some of how you can control your ship little but i dont think that they thought out their plan i mean i watch star trek all my life and i dont member that many vice ads walking aroundso i was happy to come back to eve more to do plus if someone gets in your way or es on you you can pop them yes you can but i know ccp has lots of stuff coming but i have things i can do before they get hereso let ccp do their job for they do listen to us and btw sto didnt really listen to its players too much
supportedrelevant links ships crews and imho freed slaves
spiru slaves forced to crew my ships i like the way you think
same here
crews should get better at their jobs the longer they do them then die when the ship dies if i have a ship that survives a lot of confrontations it should be better than a ship i just replaced
absolutely this is a fantastic mechanic to add some weight to pvp activities it will discourage some people from flagrantly throwing away their ships whilst still providing a benefit from actually engaging in legitimate pvp activitiesnote i dont think ships crews should get anything more than a basic effectiveness boost from npc interactions it should be limited to pvp and even then should be skewed in favor of attacking ships that fight back this means ganking hulks rookie cruisers and freighters wont be of much value but hitting a roaming hac gang would result in a significant boostultimately i wouldnt want to see crews making the ship more than 10 effective in any particular direction so as to avoid solo pwnmobiles also crews should not transfer with the hull  if you contract or sell the ship you dont get the crew with it this would simulate how the crew would learn to work well together or not after becoming more experienced sell the ship you split up the crew
the all these lives are fit to ruin chronicle is pretty deep having crew members would be pretty deep1 in general 2 if you can have erotic dancers as crew members 3 if you can have both stated and you can change the name of the crew members  modify them
i like this idea and have ever since i started the game it was one of the things i talked to ccp about during my term on the csm but theyre afraid to give ships any more bonuses no matter how slight after rigsmy idea consists of an expansion to both ships and poses using pi i originally wanted to remove all trade goods from the market with this idea and it still may happen that way but i dont want to elevate the proposal to unmanageable levels at this timea basic writeup of my idea is here i will continually update the linked document as time and creativity allowfor now though supported and please edit your original post and click support if you do support this measure
we are immortal posthumans starship crews are little better than cattle compared to usso bad idea imho spaceships have enough bonuses as is without introducing yet more hard to balance stufffor all other rp purposes ships larger than frigates still have a crew so you can pretend to interact with them all you wantnot supported
very much like these ideas tho i think ccp sees that itd add soo much complexity and balancing issues its a balancing minefield im afraid to saybut as an academic discussion theres 1 thing id love to add for u to consider including it would be for the crews to be consisting of trained personnel for an added bonusand the trained personnel to be an item swapped for an equal amount of normal crews  faction lp in an lp storeyou can add slight bonuses to ships dependent on the racecorp lp store the crew are fromone example would be a rr amount bonus for ships fitted with sisters of eve crewswould also mean theres another income avenue for mission runners and an incentive for good mission runners corps to be linked to null sec alliances helping hisec newer players network with null sec playersi do understand thered be another balance issue with lp amount per say 5000 crew and amount of crew per ship type amount of crew should be directly proportional to a ships average cost
1 we need this back please
ffs the scrollable windows simply need to stop jumping to the top or bottom every time something changes if i have it sorted by ship type and am locking vagabonds please dont pop me to the top of the overview because someone showed up or died the same for fleet if im looking at wing 3 dont pop me up to the top because someone dropped or joined fleet when im ratting and shooting bs please dont scroll off them because 20 frigates just spawned in that is highly annoying i dont want to have to have a tab for every single possible thing i want to shoot at any given time id end up with tabs across my entire screenlet me pin the overview to a certain thing
fast twitch speed how good your vision quality and relative processing speed of computers should be a small aspect in combat advantage  outliers on the poor side of a standard deviation or too can be discounted somewhat thinking and responding relatively quickly is a fine metricits one thing for a quicker person to get the advantage to the degree theyre faster its another thing where thats accentuated to the point where a split second speed difference or aging eyes results in many more seconds delay because of needing mutiple attempts
this bull just cost me a juicy killmail and 1x warp disrupt probe fix it now ccp
supported 100 dont let them have structures that supportrequire sovereignty id love to have this to make researching bps so much easier and id be able to operate easier out in null if i had my own production slots i could hog
hell yes and while your at it revamp it completely it needs that badly yup i heard that too indeed ccp needs to htfu with many things balancing for example
or at least have a poss player own sub station1 have it where you can put up to three poss around the one moon different players so they can help each other out some2 maybe they can only be set up in 04 or lest sec or if you can let us have them in up to 06 sec3 restrict what all can be done their like you can repair and some rd but no building or just repair ships and store themmy thoughts on the subject
i my self have my own poss in my corp in null sec to make sure your the only one who can enter just unselect the corp and the alliance use check box make a personal password do this first btw dont forget your passwordproblem solved only you can get into your posthe real problem is that to maintain your pos you need rights that could be a big nono if a spy manages to get those rightsso corps are going to be very reluctant to hand those out to every tom and jerryrather than a pos for yourself perhaps rights for only a single tower fuel tech and star base config managementstill going to support this thread cause its going in the right direction
and how do you propose you get around the swarm of npc corporation towers that will spring up everywhereit is iffy enough as it is with the wardec system when trying to get rid of a tower making them npc towers will be deathknell for many a honourable griefing corpsupported if and only if it is possible to exclude npc corporation employees from the proposed change
until one of your corp mates with pos roles decide they want in and change the settings
please read the entire post next time perhaps i was a bit unclear
personal standing poss should be in gamethe current corp only pos is dumb imo
they could make it kinda like housing in other games instead of a monthly rent fee you could have a monthly fuel fee they should make it so you need standings or whatever with whoevers space you are in like to anchor a tower in highsec and furthermore it could be something that you could warp to in whatever system is your home and it could be off grid or maybe in a multilayered instance type setup i dunno now i am just rambling could create a whole market for personal pos stuff for example a personal refining array or personal manufacturing thing etc etc of course restrictions could be 1 job at a time or something like that anyways still rambling but stopping now
im sure you know about the tuck options for the character creator but maybe you just want that certain jacket its just for the pics and i cant recall complaints about the first art assets so why are you bothering to complain now when theyre so much betterwhen ccp releases incarna and you get to walk around in stations perhaps youll have more options available personally i figure as long as you stick with the basics itll be enough at least until the style of your jacket matters more than it does currently im assuming its the jacket as their are only really 3 options funny looking admirals coat funny looking motorcycle jacket or a vest in one of two optional colors as a minmatar i get lots of options with the vest for some reason the motorcycle jacket seems to be the popular trend with the gallente i presonally hate trends myself and generally stick with blue jeans and tshirts even going so far as to avoid any and all printed clothing striping patching and the like bunch of nonsense if you ask me
if i could upvote you i wouldyour third paragraph made this an absolutely fantastic post well done
clearly you do not understand what im asking for im complaining that all races dont have access to all art assets and i want this to be changed
i expect its coming probably with full incarna release possibly involving microtransactions
below is a list of issues with the new character creator that need to be addressed before it is fully released these have come from both personal experience and from complaints from the sisi forumsthe new character creator was implemented in the main stream client long before it was ready and thus is missing allot of clothing as well as the facial decorations that were available in the original character generator inconsistencies with bloodline and racial appearance have yet to be resolved there have been many requests to allow characters to select a new race and bloodline however neither the reselection of bloodline nor the fixes to appearances have been implementedin all the character creator is not ready for the mainstream release and the only way to get cp to actually revoke the patch or to fix the creator is a full boycott of the new character system until the proper clothing and facial decorations are implemented and until bloodline appearances are either restored or the ability to switch bloodlines is implemented i will not recreate my character and continue to play the game with a blank portrait if you believe that the character creator has failed to capture your personality and failed to live up to the demands of the eve population than sign here and proudly display your blank character window in game i have only posted the two major complaints if there is something i missed please add it with your postsigned
perhaps this was working as intendedand even if not almost none of the clothing is all that evident in our character portraits so why do you care so much if you want to dress up dolls i suggest you do just that the lore and bloodlines are ccps to do with what they want besides most look pretty much the same if not very similar this is merely a whine perhaps you should play eve for the space combat trading and manufacturing that it offers you know the prime reasons the game exists i think it works and looks just finenot signed

tactically this would be a godsendsee the obvious fitings where is he aligned to are my drones there yet which way did he warp out is he pulling a crazy ivan or straight runningit would almst allow for slightly more skill coming into play for dogfights of the frigate varietyhell yes pleasem
i support
i would rather see only pilot name and ship type instead of icon which takes unnecessarily screen space screen is already full enough without useless ship pictures
i can see this adding tons of lag to bad comps perhaps an option to turn off maybe even no pics at all but what the hell the lag cant get much worse
to those suspecting this will cause more lagit wont its a clientside thing essentially itll slow down how fast your computer can render things so for some people they might have to turn the texture or resolution down a notch but generally it wont be too bad in otherwords theres nothing that has to go across the network for thisits already rendering the object once out in space so all it has to do is do it again in a certain frame which already exists from a programming perspective this is almost as easy of a cutpaste job as it gets the payoff for the work that goes into it will be well worth itthis idea has my full support and then some a checkbox in options for portrait or 3d would be best solution
like
very much supported but only so long as the feature can be turned off via the general settings under escape menuit shouldnt induce too much lag depending on factors outlined below but there would be a pretty big performance hit dependent on how many ships youve locked which is capped to a max as far as i knowbear in mind the tech is there weve all previewed ships from the show info menu whilst in space ourselves and weve all looked at ships whilst in spacethe question is how much information should be visible when having a dynamic lock preview as this would affect combat and the amount of lag and hit on performancei very much like the idea that the trajectory of the targeted ship relative to your ship should be the max and that it shouldnt change if you move your view and zoom on your ship or any other ship that youre looking at reasoning is to understand your trajectory relative to your enemies this would not induce any lag as the dynamic preview would be of basic ship modelsthe question id love other peoples opinions on ishow much info should be visiblebearing in mind you can determine gun type active or passive and buffer shield and armor setups from a true look at lock preview that kind of info readily available can turn the tide of a fight1 btw 
the only other thing id have to say about the preview is it should not have a fixed camera distance from the ship it should always be set for each specific ship and locked like the default view on the preview feature in the show info window otherwise locking say a mom or a titan would mean the camera would be inside the ship model which would be useless and prompt a shower of abuse on forums tho if ur in a fight with moms and titans u really should be minimising potential lag and performance hits anyway

supported i have seen this problem with gates many times one warps to zero and the game manages to land the pod 2550m away from the gate it is a tiny issue but annoyingit is possibly a problem where the objects size is taken into account and then matters too little for a pod and it ends up outside the desired radiuswhat it needs is likely not a larger radius but a bug fixyou might also want to create a bug report
noctis salvage is nearly instantaneousmarauder tractor bonus doesnt make sense right now
well loot of good ideas here right now flying marauder in missions is not as effective as faction bs and noctis so what is it good for its not realy meant to do pvp with marauders right now so its a useless expensive ship thats takes a lot of skillpoints marauders are t2 bs and should be good in my opinion i see many people want to have them more pvp usablei would realy love to see a second type of marauders meant to do pvp why not its time for a new t2 bs
ccp leave marauders as is but add 1 turret for kronos maybe 2 turrets 
72because out of 8 possible slots this would give you 9 adding a turret isnt the answer almost every ship in eve barring a dreadnought or supercap is realistically capped at 1200dps and even then you have to make massive sacrifices in tank and utility to push that number this is a deliberate cap in order to put brakes on isk generation from ratting and prevent dps fit ships from overpowering logistics they already overpower active tanks generally speakingmarauders need to be rethought from the ground upas for the poor kronos the sin should have been the kronos and the kronos should have been the sin some idiot got them the wrong way round
marauders are not pvp ships for a lot of reasons price isnt one of them else nobody would pvp in vindis or macharielsi am in favor of an assault battleship though with a resist bonus instead of active rep bonus but this is a different idea for a different time
marauders just got 4 weapons eachwhat the kronos really needs are 50mUFFFD more dronebandwide and dronebay to be able to bring 5 sentry drones with you the core problem is simply dps output what makes it weak compared to other marauders also a bit better railsmostly tracking and a bit dps
ive got mixed feelings about this on one hand it would be easier to get around highsec one the other it could vary well mess up the economy for a while making lifeinteresting while everything settles down i dont support this but im not against it either
its remarkable how terrible anubis xians ideas are even tho hes trying hardeve needs the exact opposite of yulai superhighways  separation of 4 empire territories with new 00 systems  in a grid pattern so theres no major choke points
yes but should their be a toll on it that way not just everyone uses it it will be mostly for traders and such hate to be cure but i hate to see eve become a kitty game like wow
i wouldnt say my ideas are terrible just terribly received i usually put a lot of thought into them even when i know eves forumbase will just troll it to death
i am not a fan of this idea because it would break regional trade and further encourage market superhubs furthermore im not a fan of anything concord related the concord systems are such a pain in the assliang
i would think that perhaps some sort of slingshot mass based isk cost fires you in a general direction say rensward or amarrward and you might even land in the right system or you might not and it would cost 1m to fire a frigate hull there and 50m to fire a freighter therei made those numbers up if you dont like those numbers pretend i put some you do like
a fee based supergate that could be interesting have one in each factions capital system and have them all interconnected with each other
i admire the effort and you got a few but lets try to remember lag issues what do you think is going to happen when you start cycling damage skins for every ship in a fleet battle each adjustment to the damage skin requires all possible viewers to see it and requires those adjustments as it is taking damage why do you think they turned bombers into fightersits a nice idea but more appropriate to a single player game where only one person is looking at the ship from a single perspectiveediti should really cover the other bitsnebulae and cloud effects yeah they could use some work but theyre not really that important i do have to comment regarding wormhole life its shoddy having all wormholes of a type look identical first pilot oh look another pulsar awesome shield effects ehsecond pilot looks exactly the same as the last one we were in matefirst pilot right makes em easy to identify dont itsecond pilot yeah but im sure that great blue pulsing star blinking like it is would do that too wouldnt itat least travelling across empire or finding your way through null you have some time between seeing these again in wormholes its daily rhetoricremodeling ship debris its cool with the orcas and titans but im not sure its needed elsewhere theyre too temporary as it is as has already been mentionedhit spots or whatever you called them this is cheesy right along with damage skins everybody im sure can recall a game or toy that showed damage where it was this repetitious skin displaying the effect those old hot wheels toys where the side flipped to a smashed in scd up version this was cool when we were three but eventually we recognize the repetition those laser scorches are always going to be in the same place and theyll look the same as the last time they were thereim probably not the only person here thatd get sick of that right quick im happy to say im content with smoke blowing out my tail and the occaisional flames lighting up my stern
a suggestion of pure awesomeness i have been flying the same came in fleet for months now due in part to amazing logistics with this i could fly a ship of scars and bruises from battle it helps the emersion into an already rich world of space fictionsupported
they didnt turn bombers into fighters they altered the graphic because the missile code is arguably too elaborate for the gameplay vovim not familiar with the infrastructure nor the code that the eve devs write however the lag issues are going to be there regardless weve seen from recent devblogs that the biggest lag problems stem from clientserver notifications so the easiest way to implement this idea should arguably be to leverage the power of the client side for the server end all youre looking at is the addition of another field with a 1byte value ranging from 04 or more for each level of damage skins it would not need to be updated very often at all so i disagree with you there would it have some effect on lag of course but the effect would be negligible compared to the example you gavereally the onus here would be on the art team more than anyone i disagree that its appropriate to a single player game and especially as eve is supposed to be more visually engaging than other mmorpgs im well aware fleet fights degenerate into clicking on a name some dude calls out over teamspeak and then mashing f1 over and over which is why theyre boring as hell as far as gameplay goes personally im there for the intelligent and engaging conversations in local this is not what i was referring to for that subsection i was referring to the way the graphical effects for turrets always hit the same spot on the model regardless of whether it missed wrecked or glanced off this proposal would result in a missing shot being graphically represented as a complete miss a glancing blow being represented as zinging off the shieldhull on a tangent and a hitwrecking hit as a direct strike or a strike on a sensitive area of the model it would also mean that in the case of artillery youd no longer be seeing that silly effect where the arty trails track with the target the only weapon that should do this is a laser due to a constant amount of damage applied over timei hope that clarifies 
so yeah black ops are basically just mobile jump bridges right nowmy suggestion1 give black ops ships a ship bay like the carrier but can only hold a very small number of covops stealth bombers andor recons2 pilots in black ops ships and pilots docked in black ops ships do not appear in localthis makes them much more black opsish they can now actually get behind enemy lines and disrupt things they can participate in really nasty traps they can be used as super expensive but amazing scouts it also makes them kings of murdering bots but i doubt anyone is going to use such an expensive ship for thatpreferably this would also come with a numerical buff so they arent straight up worse than t1 battleships in a fight
eve does not need thislocal should be nerfed the proper way for all
no sorry black ops are still in a battleship hull this is like a mini cap shipand local should be sov upgradegood try tho
well a good reason for their existence is that the ships im suggesting using have no t2 variants as of right now and need them now im not against a different possible t2 variant for them and id like to hear some suggestions from people who might have those ideasthe ship im suggesting isnt an uber pwnmobile at all its just a best in class ship and some ship has to be that im not interested in creating any iwin button either many of the t2 ship variants are progressions of lower class t2 ships the hac is a higher class of ac and this would just be a higher class of fleet command whats wrong with that besides my idea for a flagship is just a random idea to get the ball rolling if you would like to present a better idea than mine feel free but dont just come in and tell me i have no good idea and then not give one thats betteras for a t3 bs that would be great and id love it but thats been discussed countless times and expense is always the killer also it does nothing to help use the current tier 3 bs models that need some faction or t2 love badly
i see your ideal maybe if called something beside flagship for when we are fleeting we need different types of support ships even so that eve has lots of ships we can always have more
the idea that all t2 ships have to fit a specific role is a huge pitfall ccp fell into producing many worthless ships like electronic attack frigs and black ops bs whose niches are so narrow no one bother to use them there is nothing wrong with having a new normal ship with varying stats from other existing normal ships leaving the player to fit them according to need at least theyll see usage all the roles are pretty much covered including the narrow niches trying to invent some even more pointless role for new ships instead of just producing normal useful new ships is a bad idea
the idea of just have a bigger and meaner ship is a 100 times worse especially for the sake of wish to just have more ships for they will do nothing but obsolete previous ships this is the way wow followsthe almost obligatory bigger cost proposal is naive eve already proved many times that cost is a least important balancing factor
i cant count the number of times ive seen this idea float to the surface i am disinclined to support it because im not a fan of ccp spinning their wheels on a ship that wont be used id rather see them fixing things currently in eveliang
theyre always going to be fixing things but that doesnt mean they shouldnt also work on new content fixing doesnt bring in new customers and keep the game exciting it only makes the game play better for the people who use the things that need fixing and half of those things people want fixed arent actually broken they just dont work the way some players want them totake hybrids for example theyre in no way broken but many players want them fixed games have to maintain population and content growth to stay competitive and spending all your resources on fixing is a bad way of doing that there will always be bugs and glitches and they will get fixed and more will arise when you change things and add new content i for one dont really want to wait how ever many years it will take for ccp to track down and repair every last operational glitch in eve before we get new stuffas for whether or not thew new ship will be used thats your opinionevery ship has a bigger and meaner alternative except the titan and none of them made any of the rest obsolete the ac and hac in are nothing more than bigger and meaner versions of frigates and cruisers with the offset being their pricing and skill training requirements and neither have made t1 frigates and cruisers obsolete why is everyone so damned afraid of having more options available to them as long as its properly balanced it will be a nice addition no matter what its role or what its called and it beats having those very nice tier 3 bs models remain under used and undersold because of their poor operational abilities
bah damn i accidentally did that in another thread

post with your mainwhats confusing you here just in case you edit your post later to change it ill link to eve search and point out that despite your trolling about not providing links you prove that you really dont care about it and make several claims about threads while not providing links the fact is that your trolling is pointless the quotes are accurate if they werent anks legion of alt trolls yourself included would have pointed out that they were false im not digging up links again just because youre trolling lying and trolling again and using a predictable pattern of that anks alt trolls did during the campaign first claim that the truth is a slander and a smear against ank then when the facts are proven beyond a shadow of a doubt claim that theyre being misinterpreted when its clear that theyre not claim that theyre out of context so far the only context youve attempted to show was also a bit of your trolling again trolling by lying in order to claim ive lied about anything very meta yes you are lying and trolling i never argued with any csm about the facts of the situation which despite your trolling and lying now was the substance of your original trolling and lying either you were trolling that disagreeing on subjective issues is delusionalor you were trolling that i was denying a csm members eyewitness facts and here we see even more of your blatant trollingyou claim its a lie did i in fact specifically say that i did in fact disagree on the political implications yes and youre lying while claiming that i said otherwise again showing what that your argument is built on lies and trolling and nothing else you claim that i lie because i point out that you were lying and trolling and my disagreement with a csm delegate was not over anything straight from the horses mouth as you were lying and trolling about but over predictions for future events for which of course its impossible to get a prediction straight from the horses mouth unless youre talking to a deity odd bit of trolling to claim thats a lie though as if no i didnt disagree on firsthand facts yes we discussed the political implications cant both be true to remind folks who may be confused by winds lies by the way his actual claim was that apparently zero is incapable of believing anything other than his own delusions even when he gets it straight from the horsefs mouthbut the only thing i was disagreeing with any csm member about was predictions and potential consequences wind is a liar and a troll and wants to pretend that disagreeing with subjective interpretations and predictions of the future is delusional and wants to pretend that when i disagreed on subjective interpretations and predictions that it was really delusional and lied that id disagreed with anything straight from the horses mouth when only facts could even possibly qualify as a disagreement on things from the horse folks should check the relevant post to see the clear and obvious dishonesty and trolling like trying to claim that disagreement on predictions of future events or interpretations indicate delusion and inability to accept factson the other hand ank who evinced or pretended to have an actual delusion and mental illness by being unable to separate reality and fiction her he defends against the mean ol facts
 this and bump and support vectored in for intercept with coding at ccp hopefully
opposed highsec is carebear enough who cares about logic you play an immortal being who can send their consciousness from one clone to another halfway across the galaxy and who can singlehandedly pilot a ship kilometers long with the right training insurance exists for whatever reason blown up in war blown up by concord etc etc eve is pretty unforgiving in most respects insurance is an attempt to balance that out theres really no need to change the system except to make people who want to make a career out of mining feel completely safe last i checked safety is not the point of the sandbox
how much more risk free do peopl want high sec to be because in my 7 years in this game i have never once even come close to getting killed in high sec since concorde was introduced latly unlss i am looking for a fight its practically impossible to get killd in low sec even and the only reason people manage to lose their pod is because of laginsurance is what keeps t1 ships competative to t2 ships it is important bcause it brings the cost of pvp down and tries to encourage it  clearly  all its doing is creating more carebears who afk haul and afk mine in high sec high sec and concord was introduced to give new playes the space to learn the mechanics of the game not a mechanic to hide and make money behind   clearly people either dont remember why these mechanics were introduced or are playing this game for the wrong reasons so if insuance is removed then also remove concord  so then we can have a proper player driven game rather then ai assisted security that people hide behind i dont even suicide gank and all i can hear is the wawa and the faceless bots calling for more security
why would concord pay you for killing you if your police and insurance company are the same people and your car was totaled do to a police car ramming you cause you just committed a homicide you would not get paid the insurance note this would only apply to high sec low and null sec would be unaffected due to concord not having killed you
supportedsince this is obviously pretty low on ccps todo list why not simply use the font from the russian ui for the english ui as well i did the same thing after i saw a russian mates screenshot not only is the plain english text more readable but imo also looks a lot nicerwhat really scared me was the realization that learning proper russian will probably be faster than waiting for a fix

in addition to all the problems mentioned theres another small but noticeable issuehybrids damage type is worst for general pvpa lot of pvp ships are t2t3hybrid damage type is strongly resisted by gallente and caldari t2t3 with weaker resists on minmatar and gallenteprojectiles have switchable damage types so they can always hit weak resists that makes it very attractive for pvp in addition to all the tracking and range advantageslasers are strongly resisted by minmatar t2t3 weakly resisted by gallentecaldari and no extra resists on amarr t2t3naturally lasers look more attractive than hybrid damage due to less overlap with t2 resistsin addition to that majority of subbattleship pvp ships are shield buffer tanks which makes lasers more attractive than hybridsso even when fighting t1 ships without special resists you are more likely to encounter shield buffers so you want em and thermal damage both lasers and projectiles offer that hybrids are weakerthis isnt a big thing but its worth about 10 damage to me intuitively meaning that if i have a choice between 1 ship with lasers and another identical ship with hybrids and 10 more damage id seriously think about which to choose and if both ships were identical 1 dealt laser damage other dealt hybrid damage  the choice would be lasers 99 of the time
you didnt account for the damage type spread on emp or the armor and hull portions of t1 shield buffer tanks which are still a considerable amount of total ehp on these especially on the bc level in fact cn antimatter is just as good rf emp against t1 shield bufferslasers are much better against shields though agree thereas far as general damage type goes kintherm is a great damage to deal as it offers decent performance against shield and armor at the same timethere is a reason minmatar pilots regularly default to phased plasma which is kintherm when facing unknown or mixed tank type hostile groups
i am aware that there are many cases where em is not preferred besides the minmatar t2but as someone with lots of experience i can see that the cases where em is preferred happen more often than when em is not desired if i had to put a distribution percentage on it id say its about 65 in favor of em 35 againstand as someone who flew minmatar on my main for last couple months with about 200 kills worth i found that the based combo of ammo is fusion and emp i believe that resorting to phased plasma in pvp is for noobsanyway i said that wasnt a big issue its a small one about 10 worth
well you believe wrong then nothing worse than shooting the primary in a gang or a solo target you attacked and doing fail damage because you assumed a wrong resist profilein a solo engagement those 10 seconds to switch ammo or going on with the wrong damage type is going to cost you the fightofc there are those cases that are a complete giveaway but these days even attacking a harbinger isnt automatically a case of alright lets load fusionemp or fusion for those fights where you are 110 sure what you are going to engage ie they have guardians or scimitars with them or its a drake pp if you cant be sure barrage if you want to kiteedit and to be frank using emp against any battlecruiser other than drake or cyclone these days is the true noobish move even if you assume its shield tanked you lose almost nothing by going for pp instead and the consequences if you guessed wrong is much less severeand that is with triple cdfe standard shield buffers before we even take into account the various cheapskates flying around with dual cdfe  em rigs where using emp is actually worse than pp or before the standard triple cdfe buffers overload their invul field in which case pp or emp makes no difference at allanyway tldr kintherm is a decent all around damage type while it isnt specialized against any particular tanking style there is no situation apart from gallentecaldari t2 where it fails completelynow i wouldnt be opposed to increase em resistance on armor for bs by say 5 to shift the resist profiles there a bit more in favor of kintherm when compared to emtherm but in general i think there is nothing to knock about that damage type
the point is that blasters suck in more ways than onei believe blasters need 20 more damage  all blasters that would be equivalent of a free damage mod that would ensure that projectile and laser ships cant overturn that advantage by fitting 1 damage mod of their own and it would make up for the bad tracking bad optimalfalloff hard fitting requirements energy use and damage type of blastersbut im pretty sure it would fall on death ears at ccp as they are suffering from collective case of damagephobia

citation neededfinn proves yet again that he loves jump bridges and that he has no idea of what the words facts and troll mean through his continued posting and gratuitous use of the later term protip troll does not mean person who disagrees with finnagains opinion and fact does not mean finnagains opinionby the way evidently 10s of thousands who do did you do a survey do you have any you know data a summary look through this thread would indicate quite the contrary unless you count every post by you as a different person i would like to see the data sources you use how many tens of thousands by the way for someone that seems so concerned about clarity and specificity in language you sure like to make  up when it fits your agenda btw props on the awesome attempt to establish complete bull as a fact very sneakyand the bit about done specifically to reshape player created politics you do know how to read right i missed the part in the minutes where it is stated that it is their specific goal but rather their projected results of such a moveand finally so whatsince eve started mechanics have come and gone sov is completely different than it was there are now corps alliances how ships work has changed etc etc etc a lot of those changes occurred solely because the devs did not like how something that worked properly worked so is the game not a sandbox now are you prevented from doing whatever you wantif there are no jump bridges would you be prevented from being friends with any other alliance would ccp suddenly set everyone to red or some such noyour argument is fallacious and unsupported by anything beyond your opinioneve changes what happened to adapt or die ive taken to ignoring you because you are the same as a broken record and it gets harder and harder to take you seriously between your wanton use of fallacies while accusing others of it overwhelming hypocrisy and classy and liberal use of the word troll but some of your things are just lol10s of thousands of people agree with this post
jump bridge removal will be too much of a leap for the weak and inept so that probably will never happen since they wont be able to live in 00 without their nanny ccp watching over them and making their life almost as safe as jitabut what i think is a good compromise is to place these bridges at celestial objects maybe allow a few sentry guns to be anchored around them kinda like a star gate which can be incapped like pos guns this will create situations for great fights and at the same time allow for safer travel than just using gates for however many jumps you pathetic souls think is too dangerous for you to move
im not particularly moved one way or the other by this proposal though if you forced me to choose i would probably come down on the side of a nerfthat said i mostly wanted to address one of the main arguments that finnagain seems to keep coming back to ie that ccp interfering with player emergent behaviour sets a bad precedent and therefore removes the sandbox what is more i can do so in one word yulaithe highway nerf was ccp interfering with emergent behaviour that they didnt like the fact that jita then rose as the major market hub is proof that the sandbox didnt fail in spite of this egregious attack on player choices
ccp need to fix real problems and dont even need to be thinking this is a problem so thanks for wasting your time talking bout irrelevant things during your meetings and focus on the real things that needs to be fixed kkthxbyedown vote
so its wrong that the designers of a game who intended that nullsec should be about awesome fleet battles between forces vying for control of valuable resource would want to pull apart whatever game mechanics are in place that encourage nullsec to become owned by two huge alliancesthose political arrangements are apparently turds in the sandbox from ccps point of view they want awesome fleet battles the entire games economy revolves around war and destruction the current game mechanics for sovereignty dont push people towards war and destructionwhen the playercreated content sucks the game creator must find ways to adjust the sandbox to help the players do bettertheres more to this issue than just jbs but jbs are part of the issue i use jbs myself they are very useful for avoiding combat you dont want to partake in and very useful for bringing fights to where you do want them the advantage they give in tactical terms has very little penalty apart from a few billion isk a month and a supply of fuel
nullsec is about that right now and if they want to make sure that nullsec is the way they want it then they need to give up the idea of sandbox play because otherwise it will be whatever the players want it to be then as stated ccp needs to abandon the pretense of running a sandbox game maybe drop jove ships on any coalition that has more than 1 blue or whatever otherwise players will create playercreated content however they want again who gets to decide 10s of thousands of people have decided that it doesnt suck and theyre playing it that way and again that sets up quite a precedent if ccp thinks your sandboxing wrong they can take steps to stop you not for exploits or hacks just for creating the wrong playercreated content no it didnt target playercreated politics and there it was totally evenhanded everybody in empire had the same routes it wasnt like those people in empire whod cooperated well enough to achieve certain routes had those routes taken away citations provided stop trolling try counting the number of people who play in alliancescoalitions that use jbsthen stop trolling already discussed and youre ignoring what ive actually said in order to go figure troll heres a thought stop trolling
theyre talking about getting rid of jump bridges not chains of cyno alts capital ships would still be able to get around just fine with the inclusion of jump freighters for logistics it would be the subcapital ships that would be impeded ie the people who are either new or have chosen not to train up for being part of a capital ship blob
both you and finn can read but only finn understands do you really think that ccp will state it is our specific goal to break player created content you can see and have stated but rather their projected results of such a move now why do you think ccp made such a projection come on man think
fixed that one for you looking up the mortality statistics on dotlan the only time null regions even come close close mind you never exceeding the empire regions is when blobs collidemoving bridges away from armed pos may not be necessary just defang the towers by making the bridge module consume mostall of fitting they are probable now was in patchnotes recently so should be eay enough to finddoesnt address the problem of force projection though so would have to be part of a greater planfinn the argument that making changes to jbs is somehow a gateway drug to ccp dictating ingame behaviour is to put it mildly flawed  ccp changed wardec mechanics to stop privateers they declared alliance hopping a nono they evicted capitals from highsec etc etcyour cry of the sky will fall is many years too late i am afraid so move to the next item on your list of talking points
i cant stop laughing i seriously cant figure out if you are a  an idiot some kind of televangelist or an editor for fox news you dont even meet the standad or coherency for your idiocy but now you project your opinion over tens of thousands of people who are not aware of it and dont necessarily agree with you in fact most likely dontprotip plenty of jb users have posted in this thread for their removal including meseriously loooooooolbut lets play your game according to the qen newsletter most people playing the game take years to go to null or never do therefore using your own logic and brilliance they dont like jump bridgesi believe the number of such people dwarfs the number of peoples in 00 alliances so obviously democracy of people whose words have been made up to fit an agenda says that bridges should gohows it go again stop trollingbtw never stop you are an excellent poster and it makes for quite amusing reading your brilliance has brightened my day and shows the level of discourse that can be expected by you dont worry about providing any other facts i now see how reliable you are and how you know the difference between fact and your opinion 10s of thousands of people agree with this message
the only reason my suggestion was to move them to a planet is that poss would take a complete reworking if you want to make jbs more dangerous while they are at a pos this way you can leave the pos mechanics unchanged except for the fact that the jb which is supposed to be at that pos is actually on a planet which the pos is linked to
i love you minigin
by ccps own explicit statements these changes are designed to alter the playercreated content and allow small alliances to be independent and to potentially fragment coalitions its not flawed its fact and whats the next step when ccp can decide that a certain style of sandbox play is wrong the only thing that safeguards anybody then becomes caprice and chance privateers and capitals were both in highsec highsec is not where playercreated empires lie thats in nullsec highsec is specifically supposed to be where players interface with concord and the empires yet again stop trolling oh i know now youre going to troll about how you keep trolling and that earns a response telling you to stop trolling boy wont that be some great trolling yes 10s of thousands of people play in alliancescoalitions that use them and use them themselves your trolling about people who havent been to 00 and dont know how it works can safely be avoided as its some pretty obvious trolling as can your trolling about how eve is a democracy its not thats the whole point the content is playercreated not votingcreated you craft and destroy empires by logging in and doing  not alt trolling the forums rafia landras audelescenter for advanced studies from 20110120 0725 to this dayyeah youve used jbs a lot in your whole six days of playing eve as an alt troll post with your main troll
1 show me where ccp explicitly says this is an attack on player created content nb jumpbridges are not player created they are an illthoughtout inclusion by ccp a few patches ago2 prove to me that should they be interfeering that it is a bad thing in most cases3 prove to me that should they be interfeering that it is a bad thing in this case
finn had the choice to join an alliance with politics that were created by the players simply because he still has a choice to join an alliance after some of the open ended content created by the players has been closed by ccp is no argument at allthe jump bridges were given to us to use as we saw fit to create our open ended content if the jump bridges are removed then that content is closed off by being destroyed this one decision alone wouldnt suddenly stop eve from being a sandbox game but it does make you think am i really playing a sandbox game
they are not going to are they although is it obvious to everyone unless you are completely stupidno one in this thread has suggested that the jump bridges themselves are player created the content created with them is however this is your opinion read this thread read this thread
the alliances in null sec rarely if ever are in favor of things that make the lives of those of us in high sec better but i wish them no ill will or hardships therefor as this does not directly affect me i wont come out on either side of the argument and leave more experienced heads to the matter at hand
for whatever reason it is you and finnagain im not even sure you are different people at this point are refusing to see this from any other perspective than you just hate us you want us to suffer thats the goal of this patchwhereas we do not have specific statements from ccp saying hi we want all coalitions to blanket cascade we do have specific statements saying they want to encourage pvp in null secif you could stop being paranoid for about half a second perhaps you would see the benefits this game will derive from these changesfurthermore ccp markets 00 as a dangerous environment where people can attack you with no consequences there are popup messages every time you jump into these systs should you not disable them saying how dangerous these systems are and how not lightly you should take themthat ccp accidentaly introduced a poor mechanic that ended up benefiting you does not mean they did not make a mistake introducing those changes as they are now realising and saying in fact nearly every terrible argument you have made can be easily applied to the patch when they first introduced jumpbridgesgiven ccp now realises the mistake they made not only do i think they are entitled to undo the harm they have done to the game but i feel as though they have a responcibility to the communityone of the big selling points of this game is that individuals can make a difference in the scope of the game that choice due to the obseen buffs to coalitions have boiled down to join coalition a or join coalition b and that is about the sum of all change you will experiancethe newer manner of playing eve essentially means corps that focus on anything but numbers on a massive scale will have far less impact and i do not believe ccp ever intended for such a thing nor should they allow this style of play to continuelet me state this again just because it benefited you does not mean it was intended by ccp for this style of play to develope nor does it mean a change away from this is unfair if you are in 00 it should be because you are either driven to profit weighing in the risks or because you enjoy the dangerous elements of this gamethat we have ridiculous means in 00 to avoid all the risks and make obseen profits has nothing to do with player driven content these are issues to do with game ballance and designyou have no right to tell ccp that i want no risks i want lots of isk and you made a mistake and gave it to me unintentionally now you have to stand by your decisionbe happy that you benefited from their mistakes for long enough now its time for you to follow through with one of your favourite and ironic statements time to adapt or diewe surrvived the hardest times for small gang roamers will you survive a tiny nerf to your favoured game play i doubt it
here is your problem you dont understand this is an alt but i am not finnagain no and to my best knowledge the changes to jump bridges havent been officialy proposed if ccp did want that to happen they are not going to say that are they im sure you are capable of such suggestions without even touching the jump bridge debate you know it is possible that the game might benefit to a change in the manner jump bridges but thats not why i am posting ok and first thing this is your opinion did it benefit me i dont think they made a mistake ccp are not saying the jump bridges are a mistake they are however not happy with how they are being used no they are entitled to make amends but it is your opinion that they have caused harm yes i agree i am glad you are citing this you are still yet to understand that ccp are undermining the scope of the game for what they feel is the better good your opinion you might be right but we the players decided this they may have not intended this to happen but it has your opinion
it seems intuitive to me that a strategy game with instant teleportation of units is going to be a bad one in a way that it offers less value for developing strategies and throws in large random factors  enemy of plansi explained this view in couple posts long ago
ah so because they didnt interfere with null it doesnt count oki obviously missed the post where it was stated they would only nerf jb for nc oh wait they want to do it for everyone sounds pretty evenhanded to mealso how does nerfing them take away your ability to be part of massive power blocs it makes it harder sure but the choice is still there
dps is fine for railguns what i would recommend is eithera doubling the falloff or tracking speed of railsb replacing some of the range bonus on ships with falloff or tracking speed bonusesleave the dps alone we understand that the low dps is for balancethanks
no like autos you meanyes and so blasters or change t2 amo rails blasters to x145 instead of x045 twice you cant seriously do that you take some problem away and you put another ingive t2 ammo x135tracking speed pull it out of my ass that numberandto active armor bonus add rr bonus andblastertubs get 5speed bonus plevel  imun to armor riggmods drawbacksno we dont just you but someones else idea above is fair enough give t2s like 425mm 6m3 capacity instead of 2 and the bonus rof to 4 instead of 2 per skill level
can anyone identify what the railguns main strengths and weaknesses supposed to beand what are the strengths and weaknesses of artillery and beamsartillery have alpha thats very clear but how are beams supposed to be different from rails
sad bunnies but nothing is set in stone ccp have said they have things planned and as a lot of wis stuff will be somewhat shadywhat we should be lobbying for are cosmetic surgery practices or image rejuvenation and enhancement stations in wis stations basically a shop thats the character torso and head creation process with all body types types as purchasable options and priced accordinglythe process is based in its used environment and open to all regardless bar standings and has the potential for being a great isk sinkpersonally i happy with me
go to journal and expand the listbox for ref type you can see a dna moficiation fee listedthey could use that for us to pay isk for a bloodline change but only after we try making chars in diff bloodlines to see which one we want same race diff bloodline would surfice no
chances are its going to be a plex for character portrait changeupdate i am unsure if the modeling feature will be included but cant really harm any game mechanic in any way plus its well documented in the eve novels that extensive visual augmentations happen
a friend of mine keeps asking me why i took the picture while my vherokoir character was blinking i keep telling him that its as big as they get even after manipulating the musculature in both stepssupported
when i first found out there was no way but to look like i have down syndrome i practically begged for at least the ability for verokhior to open their eyes or give us the ability to change bloodlinethat didnt worki asked to break the arms of the person responsible for this so no more atrocities would be commited to no availim not giving up
perhaps suggest to them that we can use plexs to purchase bags for our heads for waking in stations kinda like valve charging for hats in tf2

or maybe its just you and your lack of ability to make appealing characters vherokiors are harder to make because you can barely customize the shape of their eyes but thats no excuse just deal with the constraints and make the best out of it

i support the unfortunate vherokior brothers and sisters 
as a vherokior i find myself displeased with this topic and think that yes there have been some inappropriate comments made here csm delegates should know better personally i think my appearance is perfectly fine and see yours as being no less soi also seem to recall vherokior having similar character traits in the old editor though they might not perhaps have been as noticeable therenot supported
even if you can manage to look fine  wouldnt hurt to redo it a little from wat ive seen it looks more like they cant lift their upper eyelids than asian mostly because pupil is halfcovered by default which is stupid cause it only makes seeing stuff more difficuilt  cant imagine humans evolve this if they still rely on vision mostly
keeping the eyes open is part sculpting brows cheekbones and eyes and part making sure they stay open in the portrait its not that bad really try moving the brows around and see how it affects the eye shape
i prefer squintz to looking like im going to evolve into an asgard
sorry but its not just the horrid case of their eyes being slits theyre apelike ugly too in bone structure and facial feature choices no matter how you slice it with the launch of the highlytouted new character creator people should not be forced to turn their characters away from the bloody camera just to stomach the whole process but thats what im seeing that and buttugly vherokiors some sort of racechange option is in order here call it what you will cosmetic surgery witness protection whatever new edens characters have implant surgery constantly and every one is now forced to undergo more cosmetic surgery if they havent already or shortly they will not even be able to log on ingame anymore its not that much of a stretch to offer a race change which doesnt affect much of anything but looks these days anywayi think ccp would then be shocked at the sudden plummet of the vherokior population in particular maybe they just dont want to admit how bad it actually isif avatars werent important they wouldnt be a part of the game in the first place and the new character creator wouldnt even have been implemented here okay aside from the fact that ccp needs a giant beta pool to test world of darkness features on haha
careful man vietnam might hear ya
not shure why they didnt do some thing to make the way points visable since they changed stuff around making them flash would be the way to go you could see at a glance where they are at and when one is coming up nothing like realising you missed one 3 or 4 jumps after that factalso i used to keep my chat window in that area and just used the colered dots to see how i was progressing in my rout being on the side of the screen that worked out great but now having them accross changes that i would like to see them placed back verticly along the edgecome on ccp mark our way points so we can see them at a glance with out having to open up the dam star map 
i like them how they are right now but by all means an optional vertical placement wouldnt hurt along with the ability to move the location box and the autopilot box around on the screenalso waypoint highlighting would be greatop is supported
ccp should start by making commander and officer spawns in 00 be like sleepersat very least have c3 difficulty maybe c4 for officers
huge support for 38but i actually saw some guristas warp away the other day is it actually happening already
yes all of them or at least one of them randomly can do it if they dont do its a matter of ai level
they sometimes do it but it is such a rare occasion they need to try to run away every single time
thatdoesnt fix anything it just makes drone boats also the best ecm platforms
while the nonecm drones are underpowered there is a problem with all ewar drones in general dps is very important in both pve and pvp and by using them you lose dps in return you get extra midslots to use but there are no dps modules that go in midslots except for things that affect effective dps like tracking computers and target painters even if they were buffed i have a hard time believing people would actually use them especially since they can be destroyed the only time ive seen ecm drones used consistently is for things like the pilgrim and again they are only used when you need to gtfo and when dps is not a concern
now thats a boost i could get behind liang
excellent pointsi think this discussion is well on its way to shaping into a proposal that can be supported by 3 consecutive csms over two years during which time it will be completely ignored by ccphow can we incorporate this into incarna could ccp sell players tatoos of appropriatelybalanced ewar drones for microplex i think you should explore this angle more
chancebased stunlock is an intrinsically horrible and unbalanced idea and the guy who first proposed it should have been fired on the spot
yeah
i support this idea

ty for the message white i didnt relize  my bad
well im not sure what i think about even more information available on the map but a buff to miners would be a good thing my buy orders need a buff
sounds good white im in 
i support this message
i was looking forward to the beta neocom i definitely would like to see it activated with a quickness the whole ui does indeed need a revampcleanup
no 
its a noble idea but i dont see how it could ever be less laggy than the request to be able to paint ones ships would be2x500 people jumping in on each other each ship with a slightly different look  the amount of extra data that has to go back and forth is insanei think ccp has said that they are looking at the corpalliance logo as a tag on hulls or that it would be cool or some such question is if even such a small thing would not degrade performance unnecessarily in large scale conflicts
i cant help but feel that big fleet lag should not be the driving force in everything ccp does if thats the case just turn all the ships into sprites and be done with it the fact is that more than 80 of eve residents never get into those large battles that go south to lagsville its not fair to penalize them for the sake of something they have a 1 in 5 chance of being in maybe one time in their eve existence now dont get me wrong ive been in one of those big battles on sisi and it was awesome but it was also practically node death i cant see what little lag this would bring making any noticeable impact in what was already 1 frame per 20 seconds still i imagine you could always have a button to disable those effects the same as turret anims for the sake of making large battles go smoother
well problem is the nodes only have a certain amount of bandwidth and when thats exceeded then u have a problem yes ccp have a lot of nodes available and yes market hub systems have their own dedicated node each other node hosts several systemsif you start asking tens of thousands of people to send and receive custom made skins for their ships the amount of people using it in hisec will outstrip any and every available byte of bandwidth in all the nodes ccp has meaning nodes will max out everywhere and start to meltcorp and alliance logos on the other hand are stored client side alliance logos have very very specific requirements and only appear after a major expansion because they have to be included in the patch corp logos are built around a series of pre defined components so implementing them would be fine too as theyre already client sideplus the art department has expressed that they dont want eve turning into a space version of second life cause it looks effing apauling
o god yes i always wanted to change teh texture at elast onmy ships and if we could place the turret were we want that would be amazing cause im ntired to see my baddon shooting from 1 saide or another  why not 4 turret each side when target is in friont god damnit  anyway i totally suport this idea and i really wish this can go trough and ccp could make lots of cash with this like sell ship textures for 1 im sure youll make lost of cash with this guys so comon lets make this nice for both of us
at least allow us to remove pilots without standings from our overviews
the overview was absolutely perfect preincursion barring the occasional bugi want it back immediatelyfix your  ccp
aye
ccp told me they meant to do this i am not going to put up with it quietly1 supported see my own rage threadsetting overview appearance was fine though there were some issues with the overview filter it needs the same ability to sort by priorities as the appearance menubut as of the incursion patch they changed it this is just something else altogether this makes it completely impossible for a logistic pilot to have an overview that properly only includes fleets and blues or for anyone to make an overview that only includes redswartargets
i support thisfailure to fix this issue will result in the mass ragequit of a near infinite number of accounts
yep and ill be one of them specialy if it turns out this was on purpose since up to this point in time i thought it was a bug and thought it sucked that they wouldnt revert it since a fix seemed a bit more then they where planing onif this was an intended change then i just might be through with ccp and there game get fed up with devs who dont take there players in to account when they do stuff like this one of the reasons i no longer play eq2 ill be playing the new star wars as soon as its released one person leaivng wont affect things much at all but if your not carfull ccp your gona loos more then that
i made a bug report for this issue i was told that it was by design and i should post on the forumsalso edit your post and check support topic bro

yes bring in the ccp cold case team
didnt they allegedly createrepurpose some small team for things like this i could have sworn i read that somewhere in the 30whatever pages of csm minutes or maybe that small things thread that akita t startedbut this shouldnt just be one small team  this should be a several teams and a major part of their development effortsnot because vets are bored or even just because most all pve content is years old at this point but because it will make ccp oodles of money and make eve a popular thriving place like it was before dominionsay what you will about world of warcraft but blizzard knows how to make popular and successful games a large part of that is keeping the playerbase engaged with timely and frequent balance changes and constantly revising and iterating on old content  cataclysm was a total revamp of the original game levels 160 lich king started with a remake of naxx from classic bc featured new starter zones new content in the old world like dustwallow marsh those guys are filthy rich and have 10 million customerswhat does ccp have a shrinking dissatisfied customer base with declining revenues and two unfinished games that wont be done for at least another year or more

removing aggression transfer for rring someone with a criminal countdown global or not is a bigger issueit is still needed to prevent neutrals from repping people at war without the ability for the attacking party to retaliate on the helperhowever i hear ccp is working on a fix for the particular issue of people dropping from fleet in incursion which would solve that issue
no it wont if you are in fleet and are being repped just shoot the nearest asteriod or object or yellow wreck to trigger concordokken
ill reiterate make them aggressors and capable of being attacked as this is the only sensible solution this will also help wardecs and both sides of the wardeccing process in that neutrals will be able to become involved without concord intervention wars will cease to be smallscale griefing dramas and become real engagements with unpredictable elements lets face it right now with maybe a few exceptions the only real wars happen in nullsecthis would be good it should also be applied to all ewar related forms of assistance making these fair game on both sides of the coin
has neutral you have nothing to do in their business find or create your own fleet if you are in fleet then you have nothing to worry or care about remote neutrals coming in they have nothing to do in there so let them blow in silence
obviously youve never been the logistics pilot when two piratefw fleets clash under the watchful eye of gate guns i dont need a gcc or faction standings hits for repping flashy pilotslianged also i dont want any of the crap about my rr disabling when someone takes a gcc or whatever but i agree the topic should be addressed in some way
do not supportbe more careful who you fly with if you are driving around and the passenger in your car shoots some guy on the street the police will be after both of you
this rarely happens jesuschristmotherofgodccpwtfareyouthinking
aggression transfer is not the issuepeople dropping fleet is not the issuethe issue is that people who are being remote repped or remote anything are able to make a decision to invoke concord without asking permission from the people they will get concordeda solution might be to prevent people making that choice when they are being remoteanythinged that is where the warning dialog would normally pop up just assume they said no and prevent that module being activatedthis is entirely independent of the i rep my friends tower now his war targets can shoot me issuethe issue here in a nutshell is a reps b b commits a criminal act against a concord kills b and then a because a inherited bs criminal flag since this is eve online not the day the earth stood still online this kind of punishment for unintended criminal acts should not be able to happen
after looking at some various threads regarding bots it seems that there is a general consesus that bots will prevail regardless of what is done as whitehound put it they are a plague and in the same way they will adapt to any countermeasures as long as there is  or just isk to be made ratting and mining can be made different but neither will be bot proofbut if we have to live with the bots we do so already anyway perhaps its time to exploit them back an account could recieve a number of hours every month week or day is too short of a time i think weekends and vactions considered that can be used on isk harvesting business like mining or ratting this could be like 812 hours per day or so on average so 240360 hours per month a normal player would have to play crazy much to fill this quota i dont think its humanly possible to fill it not even for someone between jobs when this alotted time is up mining cycles would no longer give any ore and rats dont give bounties nor do they drop loot edit time spent docked should be subtracted for this the idea is to manage the effective game time not just time spent logged into the gamethe obvious way around it is to get more accounts and thats the idea people who bot will have to use 23 different accounts to get a full 247 farming operation runningthis doesnt solve the bot problem which is unsolvable and ingame plex prices will probably rise but it has two positive effects ccps earns a bit more and the macroers earn a bit less hurting the botters financially is the only way to go its the only thing they care about and the only thing they cant solve with clever coding players would only be hurt if they play so much that its clearly unhealthy and possibly dangerous to them it could potentially spur a development for market trading bots but since the economic damage done by this measure is moderate at best it will probably be better for them to stick with what they already got and just use more accounts
hithis is my first post on here but i find this an idea to take to ccp04 security systems are a combat area and where cap ships can both be built and jumped in but here is the prop in some of them they have a hidden hi sec status which you only are aware of when trying to put up a pos you cant set up low sec structures in these hi security standing low sec systems and i find that wrong it is low sec in all reguards except in the above mentioned situation maybe this could be changed so that they dont have that hidden security standing which i cant see the reason for other than annoy ppl who wanna use these systemsthx for reading and i hope it ccp will see this issue and change it 
can you give an example of a system like this
if you are talking about needing permissions which you can buy from the lp store i thought this was never the case there was a change in the 11 notes about this try again and see if you still have problems and post the game supplied reason you could not set it up we need more specifics before we can comment further
you would think it wouldnt matter what the true sec rating of the system was
are you talking about moon miningliang
i never understood why 04 is considered lo sec space but you cant do lo sec space stuff in it theres probably a good reason i just dont know it
the technical detailthe security status is a floatingpoint number meaning it has many more digits than just one after the pointfor example the system obalyu has got a security status of 0423576765115572 the value then is rounded to 04 for an easier readingall systems from 0350 to 0449 count as 04security systemsthis also explains why one can set the autopilot threshold in 001steps and not just in steps of 01 because of this hidden precisionthe answera pos module will likely do a check against the raw floatingpoint number instead of the displayed rounded result leading to the observed issuemy advise you may want to file a bug report only to make sure that it gets attention from more than one side in any case i support this because it is one of the many little things ccp has not managed to straighten out in their code and it will always appear as nonsense to players
but then why not make the check against the roundlosecnumber instead of the unedited float 
ccps bug hunters are all volunteers my guess is that at least half of them are politics and arts students you can point out a missing letter within a description and they will understand point out that 4 is not the same as 5 and you will find yourself in an endless argument with someone whose grasp of mathematics is not just weak but esoteric sometimes these things then just do not get fixed
it is as whitehound says and i support the issue myself and yes it is with moon mining i have the problem and near where i live we have 2 systems  toustain and ratillosean easier way to change the prop is to change the req on the pos structure so that it works in 0449 systems could be an easier fix than changing all the systems
ok 04 systems and the rules regarding poss and structures is a bit confusing
it would be great if ccp took eve gate to the next level and created an app for the smartphones currently its being done by independent fans of eve who have ceased development and updates for the apps currently out there the creators have given up on the apps for various reasons not enough support from ccp not enough time irl to update cost to maintain too high whateverccp should take advantage of this growing opportunity aside from the occasional google advertisement eve isnt really all that well known nor advertised in the mmo industry i cant tell you how many people ive convinced to try the demo simply by showing the eve online dominion video on my iphone wouldnt it be great to have an app that shows more details about the game and lets players interact with their characters i think soalso if its in the realm of whats possible on smartphones can we also get a ship spinning app it doesnt have to be fancy or anything just something to rotate around and show friends the ship im proud to fly with oh and an eve jukebox too please
the only thing im in favor in changing about killmails is how all the killboards count killskillboards award kill credit to everyone involved instead of just the people who deal the killblow when 3 different alliances participate in combat together each one with its own killboard gets credit for the same killwhat this results in is that whenever alliance coalitions fight they all seem to have positive kill ratio even tho they are fighting each other and cant mathematically have positive ratios for everyone involvedthat type of gotry im against it makes killboards inaccurate in representing alliance combat prowessclaiming that killmails force people to fight a certain way is just stupid thats like saying the threat of pvp is forcing people to stay in high sec
killmails are currently the only metric about the damage dealt and received in fightsremoving them wont end blobbing it will just remove the ability for people to see how theyre doing in the fights deprive the ability to estimate ones success or activity useful tool for recruiting it would also remove intelligence tools used to know standard fittings of your ennemiesi will oppose this motion if it ever gets to the tableactually i favour extending killmails to pods as well so implants would show this was raised twice and will be raised again so far it hasnt happened because of technical reasons but ill keep raising ityour solution to the blob problem is not one i agree that small gangs should be encouraged not at the expense of the ability of having huge fights if people are so inclined however providing more incentives for small groups such as for instance smaller disruptive targets in sov fights decreasing big blobs mobility by nerfingremoving jump bridges and other things along those lines are things i favour
gtfonot supported
exactly however its not just the risk factor there needs to be a pushencouragement for more people to get into pvp zones those who live in empire are often driven by the pathological fear that low sec and null sec mean instadeath for them no matter what they try which is just wrong there needs to be a better way to introduce them to pvp not being a horrible thing perhaps making the start systems a null sec system connected to empire but putting a very low player sp limit on the stargates so only newbs can screw around but this is quite an extreme idea however there is of course the people who would never pvp and have no desire for it and that is to be expected but i do believe there are people that would if introduced to it properly or in a fun wayon another note low sec may never see an exciting rise in activity even if theres a rise in rewards until theres some way to control systems like null sec sov allows for alliances to do whats the point if hostiles can just dock up in the same stations
side note if low sec offered same rewards as 00 id be there roaming the regions if others wouldnt take the opportunity more good stuff for me
it isnt if i want to get in some corp being sure they will look at i just have two problems to resolvefind some friends to rrecmdps and gatecamp with meorprobe missioners in high sec and blow them faster than you can take your pants offand soi have an excellent killboard and super killmails because this is what you look first if i apply isntlets face it you can put all the bad will you want in this matter but the fact is that this system is the best way to push people to farm killmails and any thing to get them goesno matter the corp you have ben or you are im pretty sure the first thing you guys do after any fight is to lik your killmail on the corpallianceintellprivate etc etc tchatif you are realy loking for fights then you have wardecs in high sec do them in low sec jump in your enemies systems and stop pussie games at gates and with mission boats lol fake this one and if thats not enough you can play with reds at 00 im pretty sure that if you search fights youll find them but you dont you search killmails and so you dont take any risk of be someone else killmail you can try to convince yourself that its the isk loss to the enemi and all the blah blah blah you are the only one who is convinced that every one else is going to belive you is that because your killboard is better than others here or mine
yeah its because you people are ing stupid and i dont have any patience to deal with you i absolutely despise douchebag killmail s and gots waving their epeen about and trumpeting about their uber killmail history  and frankly thats all im seeing from you peopledo you even pvp this is the way things really work 50 guys get together and go on a roam theyre awesome and get 15 kills total drop  50 mil and 5 losses 150m each the fc collects all the loot and promises to disperse the isk to the people who lost ships once everything has sold best case scenario youll get 10 mil for your 150 mil ship but in reality you can kiss that isk goodbye because you aint getting  from the fcno if your goal is to make isk by pvping then you need to be in a very small gang and be very successful you solo the guy you scoop the loot you make it back to station and you liquidate it ive also set up loot cans in hostile space so i dont have to haul it to a stationthe next conversation requires contextlets see  the chain of conversation is about killmails showing skill i say that no killmail can ever show skill because it doesnt tell the whole story for instance you cant establish relative gang sizes from killmails tbh its no surprise that such a statement wouldnt make sense to someone who pvps purely for the killmailscomments counter strike is one of the most played pvp games in history theres nothing ever really on the line except winning and losing did you know that you dont get killmails for many kinds of pvp in eve market pvp lets you risk more than dozens of fully faction fit faction battleships you dont get anything except the satisfaction of having beat the other guyi underlined the really interesting parts there i agree that its a game and its nice of theres a way to measure your success but that method of measurement doesnt have to be or need to be killmails in fact it would be much better if they were removed because they measure failure more than successultimately my question boils down to this why do you feel you need validation of your pvp skillliang
this is not an important metric hell its broken on almost every single killmail and nobody even esi agree it wouldnt end blobbing certainly not in sov warfarethere are ways to do this without providing killmails aggregate killloss totals by ship class for examplealso useful for being an epeen waving got probably the biggest reason i despise killmailsand thats a fantastic reason to get rid of killmails glad to know i wont be voting for youif you gotta have killmails might as wellgood goodlianged i should note that i dont feel well ever get rid of killmails theyre very deeply ingrained into the pvp culture of eve too many people treat them as the validation of pvp prowess even though there are much better ways of going about it
name onemake it objective measurable and meaningful in the context of eve
why are chribba istvaan shogatsu tank ceo and sirmolle famous why was lord zap and ginger magician notorious why is menod pentor well known even outside of rens why are there still hundreds of players in eve who knew and respected golan trevize for his work in new and old cva why is cyvok still oh wait score one for killmails why do people troll my topics and posts just because im the one posting regardless of the contentif you need a killboard to validate yourself to others you dont have anything special to contribute to the community and as such you should be forgotten and overlooked i dont mind being nobody i mean i change my main pretty much every 2 years so obviously i dont care about having a name people remember but killboards screw with that you cant be a pvper without having a record on a killboard somewhere and that annoys me not because i care about how good or bad my record is but because i dont want people to know how good or not i am i just want to fight but those fights are cheapened by killmails and those who pvp only to get them
reading comprehension practice it my question wasnt to provide a way to show how someone could become famous or notorious rather the request was to provide an objective measurable metric that is meaningful measure of pvp prowess in eve there are thousands of people playing eve and a vanishingly small percentage of those will ever gain the level of notoriety as those on your little list there just like a vanishing small number of people will ever be the next billionaire or blockbuster movie star in real lifehow do you think an employer would react if you came in and said i dont think i should have to provide a resume its not an accurate reflection of my true skills and work ethic plus they can be faked so just take my word that i dont suck probably wouldnt go over too well would itwell the same goes for killboards since the vast majority of players will never become famous and corporations still need grunts they need a way to filter the decent prospects from the riff raff and the only tool for doing that in an objective way is the killmail system null sec alliances want to know if people are going to be disciplined enough not to screw up during major ops pirate corps want to make sure that recruits arent going to do stupid stuff thats going to result in their older members losing ships that shouldnt have been lost mercenary corps rely on killmails to prove they are actually meeting the obligations of their contractsthere is a hell of a lot more built upon the killmail system than simply epeen stroking
fyi it tends to work out pretty well when you give a lecture on their field and outline both the problems theyre going to face and ways in which they can solve them it also helps that places tend to have actual proficiency tests and dont just look at your resume furthermore i wouldnt really want to work for a company where your resume played a more important role than filtering you through the hr departmentno there really isntliang
i would be very much in favor of aggregate kill statistics that were available via the apiliang
well since killmails arent what do you propose we use when they are neuteredthings are not always as they seem and letting killboards run your standards methodology is probably why ive never heard of you nor your corp before this threadeven so you cant always be sure you arent missing something important maybe the candidate is the type who never posts killmails what does that do to your methodologyin my experience people will read killmails any way they want and the only ones who actually care about killboards are the players who care about killboards anyway id say that the best pvpers probably never use a killboard why would theykillboards cant tell you thatkillboards cant tell you thatthere are plenty of other methods methods that might even be more impressivenope not really
good ing luck getting in the door to give your little lecture yes there is i just described several how would a merc company show their activity to an employer with out the killmails to document it how is the average recruiter supposed to know if a potential recruit has any actual pvp experience
i dont need luck considering i did it  and got the job i also notice you neglected the rest of the point for a more eve based metric my corp kicked someones ass a few days back we now have a standing invite to their alliance zomgmaybe by actually flying with them for a few days maybe by talking to them for a few minutes just maybeliang
the flying with them is the job interview their killboard record is their resumewhen you apply for a job you usually require both a lousy killboard record is a bad resume and wont get you invited to an interview the killboard is the first filter if anyone could apply join our corp and fly with us to test them and no records existed we would never get time for anything else than recruitment and trainingthe flying with them part is more about personality and personal kompetence how well do the guy fit into the group the other part are the facts as accurate as they can get since fakedforged resume are quite commoni simply do not believe that the removal of killmails would provide any tangible benefit and many corps use those boards as a vital tool in their recruitment process incidently i looked you up nice record tells me that youre a competent pilot  i might want to invite you for an interview
absolute nonsense from the op people blob because a they can and b theres safety in numbers people dont like losing isk ships or face and killmails have nothing to do with this
how can they lose face if there are no killmails
oh i dunno maybe people get embarrassed having to warp out in a pod or maybe the victors smack in locali know that your point is that publication of losses via killmails enhances the loss of face and its not an argument without merit but its still just one of many contributory factors perceived loss of face and the potential loss of face isk and time will still be the dominant factorsif you want to reduce blobbing as your op suggests then you need to increase deployment and fleet formup times reduce the ease of dissemination of intel and to spread people out in space this could be achieved by limitingremoving jump bridges removing local as an infallible instant intelligence source and dispersing pve rewards away from single systems nerfing upgraded systems and sanctums blobs will then take longer to form react and move
so youre saying that you just walked in off the street and the hiring manager gave you the time of the day to give your little presentation no you provided a resume that indicated you might actually have a clue what you were talking which got you the interview where you got to expound on your expertisewithout that resume to get you through the hr screening process youd not have gotten the opportunity to give your little spiel a killboard serves the same function as a resume it gets your foot in the door you still have to sell yourself and how do you think they figured out you were worth a damn probably based on your killboard performance against them like the tusker said no one claims that a killboard is the only thing one should use to judge a characters capabilities just like no one is going to hire someone strictly on them having a good resume however if a recruiter has to fill 3 reqs and has 100 applicants interested hes not going to try to individually interview all 100 hes going to use some filter to reduce that number to a manageable level if im recruiting for a pvp corp and the ceo wants to add 2 bodies and my compensation is based on getting them quality apps and ive got 6 guys with good killboard stats and 10 with crapy or nonexistent im not going to be wasting my time with the 10 sure i might be missing out on the alt of some utter bad ass but the odds are that id just be wasting my valuable time that could be used doing something else further it cuts both ways im currently in the process of looking for a corporation and while the recruiters of the corps im talking to have judged me on my killboard i also judge them on theirs how active are they how successful do they tend to kill more than they lose and as noted earlier the way killmails work its particularly telling when the reverse is true do they tend to be blobby or are most of their engagements relatively small where do they operate who are their primary enemies ive set certain criteria for the corps im looking at primarily that they have more kills than i do but also that they are relatively activejust talking to them isnt sufficient everyone always tries to put the best spin on their own stories everyone is extremely active and into small gang pvp and are fighting a bunch of blobbing tards if you ask them and their enemies will refute those claims with their own spin are my criteria potentially keeping me from joining some up and coming corp possibly but the odds are low plus im looking for something rather specific at this point so killboards give me a good read on whether a potential corp has what im interested inof course the killboards arent the end of the process the good corps will have an interview and trail process where theyll judge whether im a good fit for their organization and ill return the favorbut it all starts with that objective measure as a jumping off point the alternative would be far more time consuming and likely far less effective rl corporations use resumes and other filters for a reason after all if they werent effective they wouldnt be used
ok this thread has actually reached the point where the final posters are arguing the best way to make isk in pvp is to solo im no longer going to continue arguing thereas far as adding pod kills i think thats a bad idea it would indeed accentuate the problems with killmails without much in the way of goodremember a good game has at least 2 things 1 a challenge that requires skill and 2 consequences adding killmails for pods just adds consequences to something that requires no skill its a bad idea to put more emphasis on something that requires no skillit would also put an emphasis on killing pods which would be a disincentive to newer players who need those attribute implants to help catch up with older players
alright since we are getting the point where any new points we bring up arent really having anything to do with the premise of the mandate lets discuss neutering killmail negativesno longer show destroyed items in the killmail want to know the fit use some brainpower and figure it out from the lootonly add the top 4 damage dealers adjusted for ship class so frigs have a fair shake at being on it top ew user not sure how to really determine this most time spent ewing the target i suppose including tackling and the person scoring the killing blow yes that means nobody else would get any credit for participating but there would be a total for number of opponents periodpod killmails removed entirely unless we want to make those the only killmailsthat would be interesting no more ship killmails without a podkill
oh look more bad ideaswhat difference does it make whether droppeddestroyed items are differentiated honestly i dont really care save that it seems that it would be developer resources wasted on a pointless changelimiting those shown on killmails to the top 4 would be a horrible idea then we wouldnt be able to tell who the blobbers are also damage reports in killmails are often less than 100 accurate particularly on ships that are killed really fast pod killmails should remain unchanged most people who fly in places were pods die regularly arent sporting expensive implants unless they are cap pilots or just rolling in money anyway so who cares i dont see the point in removing them either not to mention the small matter that it would harm the operations of my former corp rvb in that the no podding rule would become unenforceable once again the only real improvement i could see in the killmail system would be for ccp to host an official one so we could do away with most of the ambiguity created by fake killmails oh and it would be nice if the bugs with damage reporting could be corrected as well
so reading comprehension is only for other people
first off let me introduce myself im a piratelowsec pvper and this is my main accountfrom what i gather in the original post im ruining the game because i take a certain amount of pride in my killboard stats even though i have pride in my stats i still take time to ransom when and if possible by the way ransoms arent verifiable so you will just have to take my word on it also if i get a chance to get a good fight i usually take it but that must be a lie because if i take pride in my stats then its not possible for me to actually do these thingsthe sarcasm was intendedon to the good stuff killmails cause blobs  i have a few thoughts on what also causes blobs1 killmails dont cause blobs  friends cause blobs let me explain this is a massively multiplayer online game people are encourage to join player run corps and fly with friendscorpmates now i dont know about you but i enjoy flying with my efriends the more friends you have the more people in gangs and what are you supposed to do when you find a lone battlecruiser ratting in a belt tell them sorry you cant engage this guy because it wouldnt be fair2 ewar these days if you have a small gang without ewar and run into a equal sized gang that has lots of ewar not as uncommon as you may think then you dont stand much of a chance even though you may have even numbers so you have two options bring more ewar or bigger numbers3 logistics see ewar4 bait if you find something juicy in a lowsec belt people assume that its got backup waiting to pounce therefore you assemble a greater force to combat said backup and on the ofchance that its not bait are you going to tell the rest of the fleet sorry its not bait so you cant shoot itall of these come from my extensive lowsec experience killmails could very well be the entire cause of blobbing in 00 and highsec for all i knowthose are just my opinions not fact as the op implies his statements are for those of you that think you would never get into corpsalliances based on your killboard stats might i suggest that you are trying to get into the wrong corpalliance any corp thats worth joining my opinion again doesnt base entry solely on killboard stats and would suggest where to get some training before you are accepted or even train you then selfs and why would you even want to be in a corpalliance that places such and emphasis on killboard statsas far as hotdropping supercaps if you hadcould afford one and were stuck in it would you really want to just wait for evenfair fights or would you want to kill everything you could because you can i know where i stand on that however im not supporting hotdropping everything but i understand why i happens and it isnt only because of killmailsim a little confused about something you have been been saying about the accuracy of kill boardsyou say are only in pvp for the good fights and not killmails therefore you dont post killmailsyou also suggest that the majority of people are killmail swith that said killboards will not be accurate about your stats im not saying they areyou have suggested that killmail s are very worried about there losses so would it be fair to assume that most post all kills and lossesif that is the case then your killboard stats should be more accurate then not unless you are killing tons of carebears that dont post killmailsim sorry i dont play the game the way you have envisioned
no think this through how do we know when someone is a blobber because they end up with an endless history of kills where they are one of 50 others on the killmails if those kills arent counted on their stats then we never see them also many corporations track participation though killmail activitiesfurther why shouldnt the guy get credit for the aid he gave in killing an enemy ship whether that be from actual damage dealt out or keeping a point on it without which the kill would never have happened anyway and read your bit about crediting ecm to some extend but how do you know which one was most important to the kill happening or even if only one was importantwhich point was the most important to a kill the initial that resulted the target being caught in the first place the one in the middle that kept him from getting away at a critical moment or the one at the end that kept him there to finally die the answer is all of them the problem i think is that you are focusing too much on individual killmails while the true value of the killmail system is only realized when one looks at a large sampling and at a larger picture consider things that can be gleaned from a killboard beyond kd ratioif i see a pilot with 1000 kills but less than 100 losses i dont automatically see a great pvper i see someone who is generally risk adverse and very good at picking fights particularly if the bulk of those kills are either against weaker opponents or in blobson the other hand if i see someone with 500 kills verse 400 losses but the majority of their kills were against even or superior odds then i see a pilot who is good and willing to take risks take a look at someone like lady spanks killboard hesheits kd ratio is relatively low but their fights are mostly solo against superior or even odds as such im going to view that pilot as generally more dangerous than someone with far more kills but in more blobbyganky circumstanceseven someone like your altmain anubis for all the teasing i did his killboard really doesnt have enough activity to draw any conclusion of competence from 60 something total engagements just isnt a large enough sample size to say  at best its an alt who had some bad luck at worse its just the kb of a pvp noob killmails and the associated killboards are just tools like any tool they can be used effectively or wrongly a hammer works very well for driving a nail into a board when used properly it can also seriously damage the piece you are working on if you just bang on it wildly this doesnt mean that there is anything wrong a hammer just that the user sucks and needs to learn how to use it properly
uh a noobs few suggestions here1 if killmails are to still be in the game there needs be an official killboardfrom what it looks from my perspective ccp did not foresee the killboard phenomenon when they implemented killmails it just came as a natural sideeffect they hadnt predictedif this was something ccp were aware of im sure they wouldve come up with a more elegant solution for killtrackingits easy to forget that ccp created killmails but the community created the killboards so if you dont like the idea behind killboards you can only blame the communitywhat you can do however is ask ccp to redesign the way killmails work and possibly implement their own killboard to fix potential issues with the unofficial records and thats what i will do now2 most of the criticism aimed towards killboards seems to be the fact that they encourage blobs and picking fights only where you have a huge advantagethis tactic is great if your main goal is to destroy isk and if so you shouldnt change this tactichowever if youre looking to have an impressive killboard record this is a sad way of achieving itso i propose combat pointsi would like to see a killboard organized more like the fw boards victory points but where points are rewarded based on your odds in a fightthe points the destroyed enemy targets are worth are divided among your fleet in a fair fashionthat way a blob destroying a small fleet of flimsy ships would result in almost no combat points for the individual members of the blob however a small fleet overcoming a disadvantage and destroying a larger fleet results in a good amount of points for the pilotsthat way pilots who claim to be true pirates aiming only to destroy isk can travel in gangs picking easy targets but they will be rewarded with only a minimum of combat pointsthose who want to risk traveling in a smaller pack and picking more even fights will not only destroy the isk but also gain a fair amount of combat points and climb the boardwith this you could have a daily and weekly top list for pilots in your corporation and overalloh and if this is implemented keep killmails for show off if you did a particularly impressive kill and want to share it with othersim sure many seasoned pvpers will disagree with me here but this is my honest opinion and being new to pvp im not biased either wayzijal
i support the idea of official eve killboardas long as its setup in such a way that it is mathematically impossible for alliance coalitions that fight each other to have positive kill ratios if somebody is winning somebody has to lose
well at least youre changing over from thinking it would be good to do away with killmails to reforming them but i think youre going in the wrong direction killmails need to document more information not lessif 8 t1 frigates fight a battlecruiser is that a blob no not at all its likely a good fight and some gutsy t1 frigate pilots but if they actually kill the bc then what none of them get on the killmail except 4 who did the most damage and anyone looking at the killmail might think the other 4 ships were scorpions this is not an improvementfirst accept that killmails are not going to be perfect but then i think there are some very clear things we can do to improve them 1 if a ship is providing reps to an attacking ship that is on the killmail the repper should be on the killmail too eve already logs the repper as someone the victim could shoot so the mechanic must be close to there anyway plus they will likely make some changes to the repper mechanic in light of high sec griefing during incursions anyway i hope they fix a bunch of the problems that exist with logistics2 if an attacker is receiving gang boosts from another ship that boosting ship should appear on the killmail i dont know but from looking at a certain top ranked pilot i think both of these shortcomings are being gamed i dont necessarily think he is intending to get a high ranking from this behavior but whatever its still stupid that you have a logistics or a t3 helping you get kills in a t1 frigate and the killmails fail to mention this
even if they remain i think fitting information needs to be removed entirely from them or every participants fits need to be on them i much prefer the no intel option thoughregister pilot names pilot ships pilot corpalliance pilot weapons used to kill the ship all offensive modules and drones any rr modules or drones used and any ganglink effects
to me it really comes down to what youre up to if youve got 50 guys roaming through an area of space where you know nobody is going to be able to challenge you and youve got half your fleet ing over the last 50v2 well then youve got a problem if youre out looking for a fight and the 5 of you run across one guy not so much of a problemas to ewar and logistics causing blobs no thats simply differing gang compositions its totally possible to have too much or too little ewarlogistics on the field and its a natural thing for you to lose to a gang that has better gang composition than you dookwhich is trueand they wont be  not only about my stats but about everyone elses too they dont tell the whole story even if they get submittedno they tend not to post lossesor if youre killing pvpers who dont post lossesfunny  it seems that i dont play it as youve envisioned eitherliang
zijalit would be nice if they could do what you propose but how do you know when a battle ends and begins some battles happen over time with ships warping in throughout the fight right now a problem with killmails is a session timer i might be able to burn my bc back to a gate through a gate camp in 2 armor only to be caught on the other side by a ceptor and a cruiser killmail shows i was killed by only the ceptor and cruiser the session timer made it into a new battle like i said its not perfect and there seems no easy fix although the 2 ideas i posted above would be pretty easy but then again maybe ccp should start working on the harder stuff and really make killmails better i would rather they did this instead of barbie dress up why not just request that they put some real resources to make killmails very goodi dont mind that the killboards are community run the diversity is good many killboards like the evekill killboard do reward blobbing much more than battleclinic or eve arena these later two killboards really do pretty much as good of a job as you can with the limited information you get from a killmail unless and until the killmails are improved the killboard rankings wont get much better than these two
 are you ing serious 8 t1 frigates will ing murder a bcliang
i disagree with this because it would ruin my ability to thumb my nose at killmail s and provides free intel to people that i would rather not have itliang
yeh my suggestion isnt all thought through but one solution to the problem you point out here could be that one could let the reward for destroying a damaged ship be percentwise reduced by the damage the ship has suffered compared to its ehpas for deciding when combat starts and ends its a bit trickier and requires some more thinking
if fact there should killmails about implants loses and if capsuller had uptodate clone
fine let there be an option to choose wholl be able to see your statistics then
not if thats an ac hurricane sure the fight could go either way depending on numerous factors but if both sides got balls it can make for a good fighti can easily see how the fight can end up with 4 frigs dead and others running away
i dunno  the cane is likely to have a pair of neuts but it almost certainly isnt going to have webscram and its drones are gonna get instanuked id say the odds are firmly stacked in favor of the 8 frigsliang
first of all cane would have 1 neut not 2second if the cane has neither web nor scram then thered be no point engaging but if either is present it will be enough against most t1 frigsif those were t2 frigs then theyd be too hard to hit and do more damage 8 inties would win in most cases but t1 frigs really not that hard to hit with medium ac
comments almost all canes these days are ac canes with 2 neuts and a shield tank i dont have any idea what fit you are thinking this cane has the frigs were the aggressors in this position they decide if theyre even going to engage they absolutely control and shape the battlefield i agree that roflket condors using with 5000 sp using orbit will die but 8 competent t1 frig pilots will absolutely  a competent lone t1 bc pilotliang
so based on the responce i have gotten on this topic here are the basic areas as far as i can tell where most people agree are1sitting ducks destroyers are too big of a target without the ability to either mount a good tank or enough speed to evade fire from cruisers and other larger ships aso we would like to see slightly smaller size ship sizesignature b slight increase in speed and better manueverability2weak fittings destroyers are supposed to be anti frigate ships but have such poorly configured mid and low slot arrangements that they are unable to mount effective tanks and have tackle aincrease mid and low slots to a minimum of three and a maximum of 6 or an increase of 2 slots to both mid andlow slots for each ship respectively3 role bonuses as anti frigate ships the destroyer is lacking one critically neccessary bonus tracking so lets see a 510 bonus in weapon tracking per level of destroyer skilloptional stuff that is optional since opinions on these differ quite a bita drone bays it would be nice to see destroyers have more in the way of drone bays we can live without it if we mustb 1 or two more missle slots for caldari destroyer but like the drones issue we can also live without itcit may be neccessary to tweek the powergrid and cpu for the destroyers due to the increased mid and low slotsi removed the part about increasing the structure armor and shielding of the destroyers while i would still like to see some improvement in this area but the additional mid and low slots would be enought to allow better tanking on destroyersso is this something we can all get behind
destroyers always seemed to be filler ships with no real purpose new players cant use them effectively and vets dont need them at allso what should be done make them to frigates what battlecruisers are to cruisers maybe
they just need to be adjusted so that veterans would actually consider using them for their designated role
thrasher
i think the problem is where ccp is concerned is to make 4 dessies that arent basically the same ship in different models so the idea i think should be that each of them should have bonuses to different ways of keeping frigs down but make sure that no 1 type dominates at taking out frigsif u cant lock fast enough u cant push dpsif u cant track fast enough u cant push dpsif u cant get close enough u cant push dpsfrom those 3 if statements u can make 4 different flavours that compliment each other without 1 being overly dominantthe problem is to cap their abilities to not challenge combat and force recons
i think there is plenty of variety at the sub cruiser level compared to the cruiser and up level lots of variety of ships being flown if you lower the sig radius on dessies then how is this much different than a t2 frigate it seems this would make the game less diverse sure you will make t2 assault frigates even more obsolete but why is that goodinstead of continually tweaking sub cruiser stuff i wish they would work on the cruiser and up ships to give more variety drop the stupid tier system andor boost the tier 1 bcs so they are competitive boost allot of the worthless t1 cruisers give us a reason to fly something other than blackbird anti frigate caracal or rupture
shamans are fine learn to play
if you refer to my original post youd see that i didnt mean change the dessies sig radius but improve 1 of the races dessies scan resolutionheres a forum thread explaining the difference linkythe difference between a change i was referring to would still mean assault frigs are faster more agile and have a lower sig radius yes theres a variety of ships subcruiser bt theyre almost exclusively frig hullsthe only exception are dictors and theyre only used solely for bubbling

sign here if you want to see an incursion start next to jita 44
troll the eve economy sign me up
apocalypse starts in jita yes 
like that idea domg yes please
troll eve economy thats great but sadly most wont notice for they will be docked playing market games
they will scratch their eyes out at the green hew
supported start the incursion on friday afternoon for maximum tears next to jita 44 is one option at the perimeter gate another
although a gallente is suggesting incursions get going in caldari space ahemi think it would be a bold blitzkrieg kind of move if i were an evil cyber entity bent on collapsing the resistance of new eden plus it would shove the economy out of that lag filled nexus
i too support crashing tranquility

instead of just faction ships made by npc corporations i would like to see special ships made by player corporationsproposalbased on existing hulls and their existing stats manufacturers can modify the cpupowergridnumber of slotsresistancesetc based on a give and take balancing system the resulting ships would be specialized but not necessarily more powerful one corp could make a name for themselves by specializing in antigurista ships by making armor and shields heavily lean towards ballisticsfor example1 more high slot in exchange for one less low slot and one less mid slot15 more powergrid in exchange for one less low slot15 more kinetic resistance in exchange for 15 less em and explosive10 hybrid tracking bonus per rank in cruiser in exchange for 10 hybrid range bonus per rank in cruiser and 15 less em resisi hope one can see the opportunities to customize ships in this manner i realize that this would be a major project not just tweaking numbers but the opportunites would be endless
this would be overpowered someone could just make a uber ship and kill everything now if it was like a slider where you can take attributes out of certain parts of your ship and put it into others i would support example take 100 cpu and turn it into 50 pg and 50 capacitor actually being able to nerf certain parts of your ship to buff other parts would be pretty cool
i think were actually in agreement but you might have misunderstood me its not about making uberships its about making customized changes the resulting ship might very well be weaker in fact it should be but specialized for a specific task i want it to be balanced in the examples i gave i was hoping to demonstrate that the trade off would be substantial a slider system could work for slots and resistances for instance i believe the gain in a certain area should cost more than what is gained ccp should decide what would be allowed and not allowed but i think a 12 cost ratio would be more appropriate than a 11 ratio in stats like pg cpu slots etc and of course all the mechanic skills should be able to reduce it 3 per level to a total of 15 
submitting a help ticket did nothing to resolve this issue i do not understand why the scanning interface icons can not simply be returned to their former graphics the change served no real purpose and made this entire section of the game completely unusable if it isnt broke do not fix it
the aggression timer seems small when someone tries to pop you 15 min is really nothingi propoes that the aggression timer of 15 minutes stays  but a multiple day kill right is added to the region that it happend inso if someone is mining  there is a chance to get even by the time you get in a pew pew ship the other ship is eitehr docked or gone  waiting out the 15 min counterits too easy to fit out a ship with cheap mods and blow up an expensive exhumerand no  i didnt get popped  i survived  but since the guy docks for 15 minutes  i cant get even unless i actaully war dec the corpi would like to have someone free to hunt in the region with proper kill rights on just him
um nothe reverse situation of this would be a godesnd to ninja types who already know how to extend aggro mechanics far beyond 15 min for them to be able to hold on to a grudge for days would be horrific at best exploited beyond all words at the very leastm
just so you know ship crews have already been raised and while ccp isnt opposed to the idea per se crews would effectively technically be the equivalent of an extra row of slots to be filled like mid slots low slots rigs etc no matter how fun they may be they prefer balancing the existing ships to adding even more complexityyoull find more information about ccps thoughts on this matter in the csm 3 minutes
ill have to read that an extra row of slots huh lol that is so sad loli wish you were joking but for now ill assume youre not hopefully its just a very fuzzy notion at this time and will see some work in the near futurerealistically chronicles indicate that most capsuleer vessels have no more than a smalll crew complement a few engineers and technicians and nothing more the rest of a capsuleers ship is controlled by automated systems which is the real reason why the technicians and engineers are there i like this idea and consider it the best option available though i suppose it entirely depends on the capsuleerif you ask me my ships are automated without a single living crew member and if something needs fixing ill get out of my capsule and do it myselfi will support the idea of basic crews filling a handful of positions though and see it as potentially valuable to game dynamics while being entirely optional so you could fly your ship by yourself and sacrifice crew benefits or you could handpick a crew to increase the overall effectiveness of your ships these would transfer ship to ship or even be decommisioned or left behind optionally they could stay on station or be temporarily hired for a position on a contract basis for a single term theres a lot of possibilites there and i imagine if ccp said they would then they are doing seems to me that pieces of information ive heard read or looked at might indicate this is the case anyway with some degree of planning already donei just dont want them to be lifeless if they are there though i dont have too much fear of that be nice to sit in a station bar and watch the crew have a bit of fun
the thing is crew wouldnt be optional for pvp if any sort of boni would applyjust another thing you had to have like heat and rigsmaking them expensive wouldnt make sense from a lore perspective so theyd be cheap and everyone would use themagain theres already enough to balance as it is without adding extra stuffand if they wouldnt give some kind of boni what would be the point at all
yeah if they removed all low slots from ships and added identical armor repair engineer crew you can get on board youd get the identical resultthe difference is a rp one its a significant one though i agreeheres the gist of the csm 3 minutes
crews imo is a good idea and can add so much more complexity it would be amazing but balancing will be a painone thing that i would like to see as dust gets closer is the option to deploy teams onto ships to nuetralize the pod pilot the idea would support true piracy pirates take capture a ship and effectively disable it while dust marines storm the ship and kill the pilot right now piracy involves the spray and pray method shoot to kill and hope something good drops while the dust option would allow for complete takeover of the shipcapturing ships should be an option supported in this aspect
crews are a stupid idea its equally stupid that ccp decided to put this lore in supporting their existence on a pod piloted ship in the first place as far as im concerned my ships are uncrewed why the hell would i want a clumsy assed human bumbling about my warship needing to be fed and changed and having their poop disposed of when i have nanonics drones and waldoes to use my assumption is that the reason pod ships have windows and the various indicators of a crewed ship is because the designs are retrofitted versions of standard crewed ships this is also part of why tech iii ships are so much more powerful than their older counterparts they are built with a pod pilots in mind from inception so arent bound by the needs that a human crew would have for space and habitat
how very ungallente of you
i dont agree the idea how can i ship with wasted room for bed command bridge corridors bathroom and all necesary stuff for a crew be stronger than a ship who use all this spacev to install rigs computer and more module thhis is a bad idea if this go trough rig should not be an option foo these human ship1
its im 95 sure an oversight that happened when ccp changed keyboard shortcuts including the ability to map the targetting key historically ctrl to whatever you like i pointed this out early to them but they apparently didnt manage to get it back in in time or just forgot

you just go on to mention that getting rights for setting up that pos may be hard since your corp need to watch out for spies if anyone at all except you and possibly chars that you specifically gave the right to do so without corp roles being onvvolvedcan access your personal pos its not personal anymore

yes i support it
you didnt read the whole thread did you especially the post right above yours that proves the op was laughably wrongso now hes wrong and youre look like an idiotanyone else want to necro a stupid thread without reading all of it
this certainly doesnt fill me with joy
no just no its quite the opposite each bloodlines should have their own assets
thats a little harsh mate but yeah he is walking the plank now
god man do you people have to keep bringing the same bull over and over again seriously1 you are among the few that whine constantly about the clothing variety in a vast population that cares little about it as we all know that these clothing options are appetizers for the main course to come incarna you want better variety you want your tattoos you want more accessories besides those ugly policemen sunglasses wait for incarna if you cant wait for incarna the door is that way and you can drop your stuff off at my hangar2 good luck trying to convince enough people to boycott the new system the previous system may have had more variety but the graphics were lame and the individual characters all looked the same in terms of facial features in the new system the graphics are stunning and caught up with the times im spoiled by gear of wars graphics we now have full body characters that will be walking around soon enough in the next big expansion3 the only way ccp could improve the new system is if they had implemented it like they did just now that way they get the most feedback and catch the most bugs before incarna hits not everyone logs into sisi nor even bother to try they could hold it back but delaying it to add more features will only create more headaches as they then have to fix a larger patch of code in a much shorter timeme breathes a deep sigh of relief that his rant is over
i finished creating my new avatar and like in old creator im slightly disappointed about results whyin old creator i made nice avatar which looked great on big picture but when i entered game little icon with my face in chat window appired to be completely different and looking just tragicnow we have new creator and the problem is just the same on big picture avatar looks awesome and in little icon in chat window situation can still be tragic and there is no way to check how my avatar will be looking in this little picture earlier than i login to gameproblem is that this little icon is my real in game picture because 99 of time other players looking on this little picture of my character other thing witch came into my mind during recreating my new avatar is this there is 4 shots of character in creator when u creating it why cant they be all used when i first time logged after recreating my new avatar i was seen in chat list and local as old avatar and in chat window as new and it was awesome same face in two different shots if there is problem to manage more than one shot of character in one game session there shouldnt be a problem to load one different shot every next logging this way we have 4 pictures of our one avatar simple and great isnt it
only if its client side not server side and can be turned off otherwise the lag caused by this will kill the hamsters
supported but plz make it optional for bigger battles  slower pcsbut in general great idea like that one
allow us to unlock new bloodlines with plex uplex during the character creation processthis would be a purely vanity option
my main concern in flying around doing pi is not that i wont have enough space to haul things or that i need to scan the planets bettermy main concern is that some watchful pirate has noticed i fly to the same planets all the time and when he sees me in local will just wait at the customs office cloaked up in a recon or something so i cant even dscan himi would not use this over a transport ship unless it had ridiculous agility and acceleration edit this actually happened to me today but it was such a fail pirate that i managed to warp out before he pointed me
apparently they hired a typography expert 2 years agoi think he got lost in the basement and no one has managed to find him
looks like arial
right now theres only one tab to sort your agents in people  places and thats by name could more tabs please be added like corp division level and quality sec rating of the system etc
well im for not having to wait 2 more minutes when my freighter appear at 2000m from a stationi do way enough bms on wspace and on unsafe space to also have to bother for a simple station
repping a target with aggression triggers aggression as for reps y helo thar neuts
ow woot i get a neutral rep and when the repper gets targetted he just docks up no sweat next neutral repper in line and so on less crybabies about how this would diminish their ganking style and more people who see the logicseems those who mainly deploy neutral reppers are bigger carebears than their socalled soft targets
wait whatdo some people seriously have hordes of neutral rep alts they can undock and rotate between aggression
i know several corporations that have at the minimum of 10 neutral reppers ready at standby and those were only the counted ones
in this forum any eve player can raise an issue for debatethe best and most supported of these issue threads are picked up by the csm for debate the issues that pass debate are bought to ccp and if ccp consents the issues get implemented into the gameedit to add assembly hall post
i saw this and at first decided i wasnt going to comment and perhaps indeed i shouldnt it seems that ccp in their wisdom or lack thereof depending on your views are going to allow me to run again for the csm this term whether or not i do is still up in the air it all depends on dates work commitments and considering how serious the csm has gotten whether or not i feel if id be capable of stepping up to the plate to do a good job of representing the playersi can understand dvs concerns what i did was unspeakably stupid and noone knows this more than me both from a personal standpoint and with regards to the csm process as a whole and i wouldnt have batted an eyelid at a permaban from the game and permanent exile from iceland however that wasnt the case and i was told that given time i would be allowed to run in the future istr words like redemption and coming back stronger being used from an internet lawl standpoint there was no provision in the csm white paper banning one from running again after an infraction as a member when it was published during my election the fact that im getting a look in again and that i wasnt exiled is perhaps testament to how much they thought of my abilities and performance before the event to relieve the pressure in my head before it explodes due to my ego ill say i find this both humbling and hard to believeyes there is of course a perceived risk to the csm if i find myself allowed to run or even get a spot on the council again both to the procedure as a whole some would say it would discredit it and that ill do something silly again well i dont think theres much to fear im very much a reformed character and having seen ccp arkanon in the flesh i shudder to think what would happen if i fouled up for a second time note hes a thouroughly nice chap but has the appearance of a wwii era french resistance assassin id rather suffer my defeat at the hands of the people after a hard fought campaign given the calibre of some who have stated there intention to run ill have to work hard to prevent this if i decide to run than in a closed discussion dominated by personal agendas
regardless of the subject of larkonis himself the csm has and should have no say in the matter of who is allowed to run or not eligibility is a ccp issue not a csm issueit would set a very bad precedent whats next the csm deciding every candidate must be in a player corporation or maybe nobody should be allowed to run who hasnt lived in 00 for at least a year or is not a member of an alliance of at least 1000 people or that the manwoman parity at the csm must be representative of the playerbase and that only one woman can have a seat at any timethanks but no thanks
there seems to be a lot of bs posted as to what csm can and cant recommend fact is csm is elected and so long as they comply with their ndas they can recommend whatever they want if players dont like what they do they can elect someone else in the meantime csm is elected and it is their business what they want to propose to ccp its not like ccp has a decent track record of listening the csm anyway i dont see why we should make up further restrictions as to what csm can do out of thin air so yeah csm has the authority to adopt this proposalas to this particular issue i hope csm decides not to recommend this proposal to ccp i hope csm takes the approach as much as ccp will allow that the players can decide who is on the csm the limitations on candidacy should be kept to a minimumit seems larkonis owned up for what he did he likely could have easily fought and denied these allegations like a certain other former csm but it appears he was honest about what he did when it was pointed out to him he dealt with the embarrassment he had coming and didnt lie about it and never even tried to minimize it some players may forever be shocked and horrified they he bought things on the eve market based on what he heard at a csm meeting they will never vote for him no matter how much he can help the game that is their choice but the other players should be able to weigh in on what he has to say about the game it really is a shame in our society that people like martha stewart lie lie and lie some more about what they did and they are right back in business but someone is honest about what they did and people are relentless trying to tear them down give it a rest tldrcsm should not shirk their responsibility and make uprules claiming they have no jurisdiction but when they do address this issue they should vote the proposal down and let players decide who they want on csm
my personal inclination at this point is that like meissa i do not believe i can support dvs proposalwhile i understand where dv is coming from larkonis violated an nda with ccp not with the csm as such ccp has discretion to decide what consequences are appropriate from a slap on the wrist all the way up to lawsuits and my personal favorite ninja death squadsimho there has to be some discretion so that ccp can deal appropriately with edge cases such as an accidental nda breach caused by a misaddressed email those of us who live in the united states are perhaps a bit sensitive to this issue as we have seen firsthand the problems caused by zero tolerance policiesthe above should not be construed as support for a larkonis candidacy as he tried to troll my election thread last time and i have a long memory
leaving aside the patch changes to pi the numerous bugs and the generalized whining can anyone answer this question would you play pi if it was a stand alone game is it excellent when it was announced i imagined an eve flavored command and conqueris there any gameplay any real interest any development does it compare to any god game rts gamewhy have we allowed ccp to dictate the terms of the discussion on this pi is a horribly thought out very boring mini game inside eve this patch does not alter that at alli cant see a way with the current design that they can iterate it into anything less boring or tediousi certainly dont think that they have lived up to their promises to put energy and attention into iterating it iteration means in this case to incrementally improvei would suggest a really serious rethink  and possible complete redesign  anyone else agree
i understand your point but i understand ccp too now pi is a minigame that you play a bit and make some money for that its perfect just play as much as you like without exceeding your personal boredom threshold is has been revamped a bit now resources actually deplete and the game is less clicky and boring than before this has been the work of just one team team pi see pi as it is a minigameyou must consider that a miracle happened since tyrannis ccp actually committed to iterating on a feature before dust settles and while i think that it is due for many reasons even good ones this has not happened before you want more me too i think that planets should be huge breathing worlds with huge population with immense needs of commodities and developing a planet should be a really big endeavour something that gives you pride and joy on this point i would like to elaborate a bit exposing my thoughts about pi for space and pi for planetsnow planets are only useful to produce stuff for space like poses pos fuel pos modules outposts and some other commodities all activities on planets are for space in my opinion expanding pi continuing on this way without messing the current economy can become very complicated i think that the best way of expanding pi is actually creating long term goals to achieve on planets with population control pollution or whatsoever giving players the ability to actually administrate a district on a planet with people academias infrasctures to keep those people living food harvesting and packaging this would also encourage people to move huge quantities of planetaryforplanets goods using industrials and freighters giving a new powerful impulse to interstellar tradein my opinion this is the first step on the best way to link dust to eve and i hope that ccp wants not only to write game design history but even write the best history
i think concord should get its act together and get tough on crimeinals i mean criminals concord waiting for people to commit crime simply isnt working so they should just assume that everyone is planning crime blow everyone up and pod them repetedly concord remember a pod afloat if a criminal boat we should all just live in the stations and never leave our ships can remotely fly podless to trade and such like as we hide behind thick walls and locked doors guarded by our concordian protectors cctv survailence monitoring us 247 to make sure were not planning some kind of crime the perfect society
yeah im pretty sure they were rank 5 back in the day when they first came out i remember sulking about the time i had to spend grinding an advanced learning skill that didnt do anything except put one of my attribute points up 
currently there is none but with new pi mechanic ecus are often moved around and routes need to be recreated each time without a route all extracted material goes to waste theres no positive reason to not route products so why not forbid players from accepting installed program if no routes are present or at least ask if she really wants to do it
yes i saw the battle report if you notice my comment was wow someone is using dreads i am no saying they are useless just saying supercarriers fill their role and well every other rolethe issue really is supercarriers  titans  carriers  rest being the norm or titans first if a turkey shoot is expected this seems to be the problem and the fact that supercarriers and titans fill the role of dreads even battleships are for more effective than dreads nowbefore the supercarrier buff and titan nerf alliances frequently used dreads the option to use battleships instead was there but there was equal pros and cons of using eitherwho am i kidding though theres been alot of issues for several years bug reports and other stuff that isnt gettng sorted or fixed so i hardly doubt ccp will actually change supercarriers and dreads despite commenting and agreeing there is a problem
sweet jesus in a jumpsuit would you carebears just dry your tears accept that this is a legitimate game mechanic and let this thread die already1 find alternate routes around the most heavily ganked systems2 use a scout3 have a corpmate escort with a webifier fitted so you warp faster4 have someone excort in a logistics ship to keep your dumb  alive5 travel at offpeak timesany combination of the above will keep you from dying in a fire and coming here to whine about itif you really feel the need to continue crying to someone try a gm and file a griefing complaint against the involved parties so a the gms can have a turn laughing at your tearsno im not a suicide ganker i do have an alt that makes the jitaamarrdodixiehek run twice a week and has never been killed several attempts none successful now htfu and quit being lazy

hope dies last
hybrids tank or something
however you need to make gallente competitive again please do so
only if caldari gets rebalanced aswell not later than gallente
if they sort out the tier system all the ships would get rebalanced hybrids need the fix mostly
hey look a terrible poster emptyquoting another terrible poster d
bump
cat does want gallente to be buffed while keeping hybrids what they are now ie blasters short range
which is the exact problem kinda like how companies plaster breast cancer logos all over their products to attract the eye of the consumer using the idea that sex sells oddly enough breast cancer while sucking big time is not really that high on the list cancers in terms of which is most dangerous to your healthlifeetc that is the reason there will be such a stigma around this topiclolsmore lolsi hate to agree with a ing goon but i do agree also point 7 some women are unhappy with their own breast size irl and would probably opt for a larger size in a game given the option to increase and given there are any femal gamers out there at all notice i said some women and not all of them need to clear that up before some of you start trippin boobs and responding to ish i didnt say
well the way i see it is that the close range nature of blasters should mean that they should have the best tracking of any system ingame they should also have the highest dps of any weapon system ingame because of the short range nature of blastersjust take a look at evekill top 20only 1 sub cap ship that is gallente on the top 20only 1 gallente weapon system on the top 20 and its a cap weaponas for failguns i mean railguns i honestly think that they just need a complete overhaul
it would be a bit unfair if blasters had best damage and best trackingit would make them more general purpose easier to use damage should be high but it should be hard to use damage should be high enough to make overcoming tracking difficulties a useful thing employ web  scram take advantage of falloff try match traverse velocity things that take real player skill cause if you get high damage and ease of use then its unbalanced
i agree with you and i think the more diversity in weapon systems the better off pvp will be in the long run however the way gallente ships are currently its really hard to get into range and use blasters how they were ment to be used if they wont fix the weapon systems hybrids or the ships gallente or a combination of both then ccp needs to reconsider and rebalance lasers and projectile based weapon systems and even take a look at missiles as it currently stands both hybrids and gallente ships sub capitol ships are vastly underrepresented in the grand scheme of things just take a look at evekill top 20 its quite easy to look at game balance from evekill top 20 because people will always gravitate towards what works best because this is a full loot pvp game people will do anything and take any advantage that gives them a better chance to win there are so few gallente based weapon systems and ships because they dont win you fights except gallente capitol ships p
i would disagree here the limiter is already the short rangeplus fitting ammo cap use etc if you want to include it what makes it mostly a small gang and solo weapon in this scenarios it is mostly important that the gun performs a very solid jobbetter than other weapons in his engagement range and if you play it to the strength of it it isnt difficult to apply very good damage to heavy tackled or ranged targets with lasers it isnt difficult to apply damage with projectiles at a very huge range spectrum this only leaves close range for blasters where they must outperform other guns by a huge margin both in the ability to apply damagemostly by a proper web instead of higher tracking as well as by superior base damage to make them a viable choice over the other options again

mmmmmmmmhhhhmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm10th pg
the problem with his argument is of course that ccp has never said that a single person is guaranteed to be able to make a difference if theyre outmatched by other single players its an absurdity and he doesnt really believe it i fought two armageddons in my omen and i lost but ccp promised i can make a differenceindividuals can still be beaten especially by others working in groups thats the whole point and thats part of why the demand for making a difference as an individual is a troll if one individual can make a difference then two people working against that one person can too by demanding that only that one person can then the two people who oppose him are stripped of their ability to make a difference it also deliberately ignores the fact that there have been many many people whove made a huge difference on eve from personalities like molle to traitors like hargoth to skilled fcs in point of fact fcs often do more to shape the world of eve than absolutely anybody else at all individuals can and do shape eve theyre just not guaranteed to be able to out individual another group of individuals especially since doing so means that when individuals choose to work for a common goal theyll be smacked down if individuals who can not or will not cooperate with others get upset about it its a rabbit trail here let me repeat in case you really dont grokno it didnt target playercreated politics how players interact with concord is not player created its playermediated 00 space is designed for players to create the content these two are not interchangeable nerfing jbs only for those whove managed to get jbs set up andor networked with other alliances due to holding space and for those might hold space later on altering the flow of jump bridges in empire for every single person regardless of who they are or what their politics are you seem to be confusing my argument with someones trolling about what they pretends my argument is i never said that taking jbs away eliminates the ability for people to form coalitions in fact i pointed out that ccps attempt to break sandbox play and make smaller alliances independent whether or not the rest of the players in 00 wanted them to be would fail in point of fact i have continually argued for why trying to stop playercreated politics from developing as the players want it to and trying to break sandbox play by making nonviable alliance independent are bad precedents in and of themselves
ie it didnt happen in null therefore it doesnt count so evenhanded thenfact is precedent exists emergent player created behaviour has been forcibly changed in the past and may well be changed in the future burying your head in the sand and saying effectively that empire isnt a sandbox anyway is disingenuous and ultimately weakens your point if for the sake of argument it had been nbphn that had developed into a trade hub and then nerfed would that then qualifyim open to being convinced finn but you are going to have to actually argue a real point to say that it wouldnt alter anything anyway is effectively saying that they might as well do it as not in other words why is an eve with jb as they exist today preferable to one without or one with weakened bridges convenience doesnt work as an argument for me incidentally
ill assume that your second misunderstanding is not intentional yet again its playercreated content thats at issue not nullsec in specific it simply happens to be resident in nullsec if faction warfare produced actual benefits and allowed the players to really build empires it would be as improper for that too rather obviously effecting only those who hold space is not equivalent to absolutely everybody who travels in empire rather than pointing out how theyre equivalent you simply say yah they arebull no yet again how players relate with concord is not at all the same as how players create and run their own empires the hint should be that in empire if you do something wrong you have an invincible implacable unavoidable enemy that will automatically kill you and avoiding them is an exploit does such a mechanic exist in playercreated empires
well i must thank you finn for showing me that you are not in fact interested in debate but merely shouting down anyone who disagrees with you with nuhuh sandbox i gave you the benefit of the doubt as many of your previous opponents have been somewhat adversarial and you seem to be somewhat articulatei could point out that the only thing sanctioned by concord is actual unprovoked aggression and that all other activities regardless of how reprehensible they are considered by the playerbase are acceptable but that would obviously be pointless after all only nullsec is part of the sandboxgood day to you finn fly safe 07
so nobody cares about game design of war strategy games just political and personal mumbo jumbogreat
just let them get rid of jump gates what changes for you for me in most general terms for the whole communitynothing just reorganisation and more titan bridges
i support finnagain zeros suggestion of jump bridge removal and delayed local
an interesting way to look at it is as follows at current there is effectively no way for a small or even a large alliance to effectively go head to head with the nc for any length of timeexamples such as triumvirate pl xxdeath rksmash all took on 10 20 or even 30 alliances spread around most of the north sure there may have been initial successes and in some cases prolonged success but there was no way for these alliances to ever have a lasting impact or even a genuine one so long as they did not enter into an existing powerblockin the old days before jumpbridges when d2 still ruled the north i remember an enourmous cta 200 people lol coming down to roll a few small alliances in geminate the entire onslaught lasted 2 days because no one could be bothered flying to and from the staging area why because as you have been so rightly pointing out not everyone is playing this game for the pvp thus any argument relying on alliance numbers being projected via closeby staging systems is largely just crap imochanges to these machanics will give smaller or just noncoalition alliances a bigger chance than they previously had this will likely give us a much more dynamic 00 with more active people hopefully unalligned to the current 3 powerblocks this no matter how you are spinning it is not bad for the game everyone gets more content everyone gets more weight put on their decisions this wont get rid of the sandbox it will reinforce ityour choices will hopefully matter more we are litteraly never going to see 00 cease to be controlled prodominantly by coalitions but we can hope to let people who arnt interested in that to have a greater than sub 0 chance eve can be dynamic it can be active there can be plenty of pvp instances atm there are not because there are no insentives for coalitions to stop nonsovthreatening gangs rolling around their sapce there is no insentive to restrict the amount of space alliances hold too easy to sustain  expand there are no insentives for conflict eg differing value of space these things being introduced would give meaning back to the sandbox your choice is no longer coalition a coalition b losewhat i would like to hear from the people against this proposal is would this change make eve less funtheres been a lot of crappy sidetracking about ccp shouldnt mess around with what they have already added into the game but honestly all it boils down to for me is will these changes make eve better and will it be more funif either answer is yes i dont think any of this other crap matters
and part of the reason is  no way to disrupt logistics no way to starve the beastit has to be allout pitched battle for every postcu and its always a pitched battle because its always known in advance with the reinforcement timers and all anything small is completely irrelevantjb may not be the only thing to blame but they sure add to the problemthats my belief
lets get rid of it
this really is what this thread has been about you have side tracked into a debate about the effect of these possible theoretical changesyou dont understand the fact that csmccp are in the position of discussing using a game mechanic to institute a potential change to content that we the players created mattersit matters if you like jump bridges it matters if you dislike jump bridges
we are talking about political mumbo jumbo as you so ignorantly put it if you want to talk about the design of war strategy games please do so in your own thread
i support thisgetting stuff to 00 is just too easyand you still have jfs and all the other cyno capable ships it will make 00 more excitingthink of all those ppl roaming around without jbsyeyeve is suppost to be hardharshno jbs will make 00 what it used to be
one can change the texture and colour of sand in the sandbox without changing the fact that it is a sandbox if ccp was hoping players would build sandcastles but instead we are eating the sand would making the sand unpalatable be making it no longer a sandboxwould simply increasing the timecost of materiel movement lead to large coalitions breaking up would making moon goo spawn randomly lead to large coalitions breaking up would making sovereignty dependent on pvp kills lead to large coalitions breaking up would restricting the number of moon harvestersposes a corporation can run lead to large coalitions breaking up would adding rts concepts such as control units lead to large coalitions breaking up or would they simply spawn more overlords would restricting the number of jumps per day that a hull could endure lead to large coalitions breaking up would making eve bigger lead to large coalitions breaking up would causing system resources to dry up over time lead to large coalitions breaking upwould the large coalitions adapt to the changing texture and colour of the sand in the sandbox and remain large coalitions perhaps it is in the nature of humanity to form large groupswould it be possible to modify the sandbox to the point where nullsec alliances end up constantly at war with their neighbours instead of forming naps with all and sundry
you can improve server performance greatly by just no longer allowing connections to tranquility which seems to be the desired result that is less people playing eve
man i cant wait to base out of the nearest empire market and still steamroll whoever the  i want
this proposal is not the first indication that ccp wants to tell people that they are sandboxing wrong the npc corp tax was and i wonder which side of that debate the various posters in this thread werethose of us who opposed that change did so based on the fact that it was only justified by the idea that ccp wanted people in player corporations and were willing to change the game to encourage themactually i know one ephemeron has shown a consistent willingness to ask ccp to force others to accomidate his playstyle as such hes supported every half brained idea that would somehow make the game hardcore translated provide him with easy targets that comes along from the npc corp tax to removal of l4s from highsec so im completely unsurprised he would support this onethen we get this proposal to break up large coalitions by making logistics more difficult another attempt to force certain behaviors in gameplay through mechanicsthe npc corp tax set a bad precedent of ccp using game mechanics to force gameplay choices on the player there by breaking the sandbox model removal of a functional gameplay mechanic that is working exactly as designed would be yet one more step down that slippery slope of themeparkdomtoo all the supporters of this nonsense fin has soundly thrashed you in this debate no matter how much your little intellects think you have faired against him ive only recently decided to give null a go so im no expert to all this ive not even seen a jump bridge yet but i have been spending a lot of time reading up on null politics while trying to figure out where i want to go so ive been following the conflicts that finn mentions and his descriptions ring very true nc was not able maintain their offensive in the east while defending their tech moons despite their extensive jb network that would supposedly enable them to do so they had to break off that offensive to return and reclaim their tech moons from pl pl managed to project force perfectly friggin fine in this case with no jb network the idea that making logistics more time consuming and tedious would in anyway shape or form improve the quality or quantity of pvp opportunities in the game is ludicrous the more time consuming and tedious logistics becomes the more risk adverse people will become consider if it takes 1 hour of logistics to replace a pvp ship one would far more willing to risk that ship in an uncertain engagement than if it took 5 hours one of the major reasons that rvb gets such a high quantity of the goodfights that so many small scale pvp proponents want is because its logistics were relatively painless when you are only looking at 23 jumps to reship and get back into the fight its far easier to e motivated to reship and turn right back around again then if you were looking at an hour of carebearing to earn the isk plus 3 hours of hauling  from jita to get the ships and modules obviously there needs to be some balance so that there is actually some risk but care must be taken to not make the pita factor beat out the fun factorturning this game even more into logistics online is a bad ideaoh yeah tedious and boring  hardcore besides its a game if you want hardcore join the marinesnot supported
looking at both sides and having lived in 00 i agree with bridges goinghardly ever did we move in 00 without using a bridge and there was never any risk to it empire is riskierfurthermore ccp makes the game and they are fully entitled to make changes that in their opinion improve the game ive seen what the game was like when it started i honestly didnt like iti like it now ccp changes have consistently been in the right direction imhosupported
this is honestly the stupidest idea ever that would make tons of already cramped space useless and dead wow
ability to disrupt enemy logistics adds new dimension to strategythats a fact of both game design and real war anything that increases strategic and tactical choices in war is automatically good for pvppolitical discussions are irrelevant personal preferences are irrelevantthose things are valid only in the scope of the sandbox decisions to modify the sandbox are outside the scope of the sandbox
pretty bad argument pl had nothing to loose pl had nothing to defend pl had no need to go and help out friends on the other side of the mapany group in this game can project their force anywhere they want the real issue is when a group can change the area they wanna do this in within a short amount of timeone can argue that oh wow 15 jumps instead of 30 jumps hardly game breaking maybe not but think in a bigger picture think relocation of assets dreadnoughts carriers multiple ships mods fuel everything that needs to be moved for longer fightsbefore jumpbridges moves like that had to be proper planned and executed and people moved in groups im not saying people aint moving in groups today but they did in a much bigger degree beforewith jumpbridges people can move on their own for the most of the time they simply move through the jump bridge system if that had been done before jump bridges they would simply been picked off by even the smallest gangsregion wide logistics could simply be cut off by small roaming gangs if the groups moving was not prepared or of a proper size and small roaming gangs can not compete with deathstar pos  jumpbridgeadd titanbridges and some carefully located cynos and groups can practically bypassjump over entire regionsa very common tactic i have seen been used is simply move the entire fleet by jumpbridge until the jumpbridge network ends then do the rest with titans until the fleet is within a few jumps from the target system if not jumping directly into the targetsystemanother argument that keeps getting brought up is that it will reduce activity in 00i can simply point back to the time when ascn was still alive anyone who was active at that time know that ascn space was booming with life at its peak it was almost its own little empire one of its goals was that it would be as selfsufficient as possible this was also before jump freighterslook at feythabolis today and its a wasteland compared to the old dayseither you live in empire or you live in 00people dont wanna travel x jumps just to get a fightthen alliances should stop putting everything within 30jumps of their borders bluemain reason every major fights today ends up with abckitchensink vs deftoiletbowl is because they can there isnt really any timesink or logistic reason not tomy experiences with jump bridges comes from the short time in aaa aaa didnt have the biggest jump bridge system around but anywayit was a joke it had daily roams comming in from querious through the fat area they had no impact no impact at all on my movements i could sit in local and see them passing by then jump on the bridge network just to pass by them a few jumps further up the pipe i could move freely without any interuption by any gangs within minutes i could move from fat to hed and back at the same time the entire pipe from hed and down to ge could be camped for all i know it did not matter
well put
tzeer says the truthi was member of ascn for a while i remember the space used to be more lively than it is now and as he says small roaming gangs are completely irrelevant to a local alliance with jbs and titan bridges
kill all bridgesoh my friend finnagain zero is here
in my humble opinion the best approach to fixing hybrid weapons is no a straight damage boost to a weapon system that would favor gallente more then caldari but an addition modification ofrate of fire modifier rof  xxx to hybrid ammobase damage tweak of hybrid ammo taking into account the rof modifierdiversification of  kinthermal base damage7030 6040 etcmodification of exiting cap usage modifierpossibly spiting ammo in 3 range gropes 50 0 50this way both factions get some what of an even boost

all im saying is i know that dps is a big part of the equation if our dps is destined to be crappy then at least expand the range via tracking and falloff boosts where our rails are useful being able to hit something 100km away but only have a 8800 m sweet spot due to falloff is rediculous

everyone knows there are lots of bots most of us can spot miner macros on high sec pretty quickly they are everywhere they are so many of them in fact it almost changes the focus of player events hulkageddonmost veterans also knows there are tons of botters in null sec up to the point where it becomes common knowledge nicknames aaa botters legion of botters bad puns drone regions get it or mottos what happens in venal stays in venal are all products of rampant bottingccps stand at least officially is that botting is illegal and punishable by bannings they say they are doing the best they can yet we see more and more complaints about botting if it is so easy for us to spot and prove that someone is bottingmacroing how hard could it be for ccp to assign 1 gm to hunt bots its not exactly a secret where they do this stuff there are lots of threads about botting and ccp is certainly is avoiding them theres only one method of inquiry that they cannot ignore and that is csmthumbs up if you think next csm should bring this situation to the table and ask why is ccp openly allowing bots to flourishnote as a person whos income is coming from market games or mission running i have no direct quarrel with bots as one might assume however i am concerned about the current and future state of my favorite game
not a day goes by where i dont encounter at least three unique bots ingame thats not an exaggeration
ccp doesnt care about botting unless it involves rmt and evidence that botting itself is harming the game is dubious at best
we should all start botting then
yes you do
it does because it hurts playersthat said ccp is failing because the only care about the rmt problem and care about bots as a function of rmtthey need to stop bottingeven if it is not tied to rmt i got so mad at teh csm minutes because ccp seemed incapable of saying they are working on botting other than how it connected to some rmt operationsplayers want bots goneall of themi dont want to botbut with the lack of enforcment and rampant bots creating an alt acount funed through isk bought plexs and making me isk sounds rather nice as mentioned it not hard to see botseveryone knows who and where they areany step towards banning these acount and thier ips would be a step in the right direction we need more unholy furycurrently eve is rampant with bots at the very least that is the player perception of the cituation and reguardless it needs to be delt with as players are not happy about the bot situation and thus it should be delt withadditionally penalties shoudl be harsher when you ban a bot let us see nto onkly whobut what alliance if we see an alliance with a large amount of bots banned the players will scorn that alliance until it shapes up i know my corp does not tolerate bottingwhy should thiersthismay be the most effective tool if a corps or alliance stands to lose reputation for botters they may more actively police themselves further a better tracking of where the isk goesif i know that if i use a bot and transfer the isk to my main that my main will get bannedand my alliance shamed i will be less likely to use a botthis needs to be done nownot ina few months or years but now let us see action
i dont really encounter bots unless im trading in megahub so i have no direct quarrel as i said that doesnt mean they dont effect me however
i support this1
i think the problem is that some players are so stupid and carebearish that if you look at how they play and how bots play you wont be able to see the differencesome people just play like bots and neither you nor ccp can tell for sure if theres a real person behind the computer without discriminating against stupid
supported 1i doubt csm will get an honest response from ccp though but heck stranger things have happened in the universe 
are you seriously suggesting there are players out there who play 237 ratting in null sec then warping off and cloaking up when someone enters the system are you really suggesting there are players out there with no corp history barely 3 months old and fly an industrial through low sec all day every day 237are you implying that all those players with zxbdqkl names who mine ice belts in high sec 237 with no corp history barely 3 months old and warp back and forth from station to belt repeatedly in their pod after they get ganked arent botsreallyi cant tell if youre truly that naive or just incredibly stupid
there are people who play 8 hours a day and leave eve running overnight while afk cloaked i used to do thatmost cases it only looks like the player is 237 when in reality its probably 6 hours or less and afk the resti know a lot of people who use alts for carebearing  alliance members in fleet ops who switch to other chars while they are waiting for something to happensome of those could be alts of real peopleim not defending bots and im not claiming there are no bots neither do i care for carebears and stupid people im just pointing out a simple fact  its not easy to distinguish between a botter and a mindless carebear ccp cannot afford to make the mistake even if theres only 5 chance the player is legit they cant make a move they gotta be 100 sure and its sure hard to get those last 5 of certaintyi am for modifying the game to make it either to grief botters and carebearsremoving local in 00 would be a good start
supported
i guess you trained evasive manoeuvring to lv v the way you sidestep the obvious with your reply  being online 237 is not a sign of being a bot per se  mining 237 however issince it would take ccp like 5 minutes to write a small script to see who falls into the latter category the only logical inference must be that they dont give a rats ass
supportedi dont care too much about the isk i just hate the fact the only way you can reliably kill macro ratters in a reasonable amount of time is with awoxing especially the interdiction nullifier tengus like the goons all use and this means recycling characters which is a bannable offense i dont do it personally
id like the next csm to champion delayed local and a new dscanner with new scan mechanicsbullsheat nc alt op not supported
supportedbots can be fought the same way ccp is going after phishing by multiple actions at different placesmodify the code so its harder for a bot program to control itmodify the content so its harder to be bottedadd means to identify potential bots activity monitors player reports which seem to be ignored currently and maybe others seeing someones client do stuff that can only be the result of mouse or key clicks 237 is a rather good indicationhave a gm challenge potential botters identified above add a clause to the eula that says failure to respond to a gm challenge while you are playing can get your account suspended if the player continues to do stuff requiring manipulating the client while a gm convo sits in the middle of the screen they get suspended if they suddenly stop doing stuff or log upon getting a gm challenge they get flagged for future challenge repeats of this behavior can result in suspensionsname and shame would also be good as well as releasing data in the qen as to how many accounts get banned and an estimate of the number of bots still in the game at the moment the only ones who have any idea how many bots are in the game and how good a job ccp is doing against them are ccp and the botters us honest players are left in the darkat the moment it may be eve does not have a player driven economy it has cheater driven economy
supportedto allow cheating in a computergame will evidently lead to its doomplease ccp take action against cheaters before its too late
i know for a fact that ccp is not ignoring bots at least two bots players have been removed after my alt filed a reporthowever i would like them to continue working on this in some form or another at least tell us they are working on fight it dont need specifics just something along the lines of we see you posts and are working on a solution
or csm could focus on something that actually matters and for which they can make improvementsfaction war is a good start
i entirely agree i hope they appear on the backlogs for june and ive poked people about them the t3 refit is an important fix for wh residentsthere will be some news coming out about upcoming fixes in the reasonably near future i hope
maybe im late on this because i havent bothered to read the last3 pages of comments but perhaps we should be allowed to plug into some sort of virtual reality to kill each other it makes your wish of instation combat come true and it doesnt violate any sort of out of pod safety concerns
whats this i hear about the csm wanting to make wrecks probeable im very much against that because it makes running missions in unprobeable ship meaningless
well personally i dont think unprobeable ships should even be possible to begin with as for the major benefits though it makes salvaging an actual profession and probably helps reduce lag or something when all those wrecks are cleared
scanning down players is apparently too hard for some people who want the easy kill
bullits way too damn easy just go stop by dodoxie some timewrecks do not need to be probable
i believe the issue is not what happens in dodixie or other hisec systems but missioning and plexing in losec and null
i was being sarcastic i know its too easy
why not create a special wreck probe that can only be used in highsec then sort of like the opposite restrictions to an interdiction sphere launcher doesnt change people running in unprobable ships allows people to clean up and salvage after other people in highsec fine where the salvaging profession will primarily be used
thats actually quite a fantastic ideai support this guys post
in a way i support what the csm is recommending  under one condition if the wrecks are not probable in a deadspace area but only in normal space such as when turning in a mission then i have no problem with it otherwise it would become way too easy to ninja in highsec and gank in lownull secin general though i support your measure also remember to click the support checkbox if you do support it
this
perfect
not all missions occur in deadspace thoughcurrently missions arent probeable except for ded complexes with known locations via probeable wrecks people would get an easy backdoor to find missions and the people in it after allif wrecks must be made probeable per se then make it simply so that all your wrecks become probeable only after you turn in the mission that is more logical anyway as immersion wise its kinda strange youre able to probe inside a deadspace pocket anyway from the outside what with the existence of acc gates and all
why should unprobeable ships even exist though eve is all about risk vs reward and there is currently no risk in flying an unprobeable t3 cruiser which can negate bubbles being able to probe wrecks brings nothing but benefits and you can always pop your wrecks anyway and still have your supercloaked mission runner
supported conditionally the condition is criticalas long as wrecks are not probable in a deadspace or within 1 million kilometers of a missions warpin point i will support a wreckscanning probeno currently active mission immunity no support
eve is not just about risk vs reward its also about fitting choices if someone is willing to gimp his or her ship with 34 mods to make it unprobeable thus not leaving room for other mods in their stead then i say thats a perfectly valid choicealso in attacker vs defender often a lot of people seem to side with the attacker which is to say whenever someone finds a way to defend himself from ecm from probing from being jammed whatever theres always folks who immediately look upon said successful defence as some sort of exploit or dishonest advantage why is that you have tools to scan people down i have tools to defend myself from that when fitted accordingly if i dont fit those mods you can find me if i do fit those mods you cant i say thats good balance and making wrecks probeable while the missioner is still in mission only introduces a great disturbance in the forcenot really it only takes a fraction of a second to probe down a wreck of mine if someone just happens to be scanning in that area and then youre humpedalso flying unprobable ships is working as intended we have talon implants to increase our gravimetric strength for instance they serve no other purpose than to help your ship become unprobeableand like i said introducing probeable wrecks to circumvent a valid game mechanic to stay unseen is unbalanced after the mission has been turned in im okay with wrecks being ffa though
author does have a point however in my opinion importance of advancing salvager proffesion exceeds the importance of unprobable ships by a large margin
im stuck on this as a salvager i would love this but there are many ways it can be abused
like i said it is very annoying but it works how ecm is supposed to work gone are the days of olde where you were always perma jammed from 90 to 150 km away so i welcome this chance based system as i can improve my chances of not being jammed by eccming up and have a command ship boosting sensor integritybut thats ecm and id like to mainly focus on the other ew drones as these drones are clearly underpowered having powerful sdtdevtp drones as well as the feared ec drones would really mix things up simply nerfing ec drones isnt the answer as everyone will just forget about ew drones and use combat drones which is dull as i want variety i want to think crap hes using td drones i cant hit anything wasnt expecting that or another generic oh dear line with other ew drones
this
youre absolutely right  guessing its not made the list or something  heres hoping
i think everyone has proposed this at one point or another naturally i support thisliang
i will support this only with the following additional conditionif any of the items in a fitting can be found inside the station hangar then only those items needed to complete the fitting shall be boughtthis will enable two functionsone can purchase only that what is needed to complete the fitting and thereby avoid buying unnecessary itemsit prevents players from spamming the market with too many requests by forcing them to either fit or store the purchased items away before they can buy the same fitting againyou do not want to have a player who is sitting in jita and hits the buy fitting button a hundred times per minutei do not see a problem with buying an incomplete fitting in case not all of the items are available the feature could be made smart and have it check for available variations to offer them to you this way a fitting can be used as only a template and one can buy better or cheaper variations of an itemthe proposal itself could be made part of a bigger one around buying and selling multiple items including the support of shopping lists where a saved ship fitting is just an alternative for a shopping list

hey
thank you but the information needs to be provided by the games map this is where the players expect to find ityou can get the numbers with eve maps or by using the ccp database dump too or by just reading the orbital body information to a system and then count the belts and fields yourself this is however not the pointwith pi did we get new filters and for each type of planet and ask yourself how often does one need to look this information up on the map or have you ever used these new filters yetthe point of this proposal is to get the information onto the games map together with a 24h indicator for the state of a systems asteroid belts based on an averageit will be of good use for every miner day by day and it is also the core purpose of an intelligent map as the one in eve to be of good use
hulkageddon guys will love this featureno idea how this helps minersedit roids respawn at a crazy rate now anyway not like you have to go far to find roids
do not post when you have no idea but instead go mining if you are trying to say the mining activity shall stay hidden then you should say why you need to hide it too
i support this thread
sure why not doesnt hurt does it
im sure ccp is working on banning botsnot just working on fighting rmtbut as a player we see nothing and we grow frustrated that day after day we see bots in system that any dollard could spotplayers would be less likelly to use bots if they felt there may actually be a penaltynot worth the rewardso let us see the bots you have bannedshow us a list of banned botsthere must be some every monthfurther more let use see what alliance they where in or forwarding isk tofor banned bots show who benifitedalso display how much isk was taken from those who benifited or who was bannedthis would do a number of things1 alliances would police themselves to keep thier reputation 2players who bennifit would be ostrasized by the community3people would actually feel like there was a penalty to botting4non botters would feel that ccp was actually doing something
ccp is not legally obliged to report anything to you and in fact are against the name it and shame it crowd i would like to see numbers without identities just to prove the actions they perform but asking any more is uselessnot supported

one of the usual problem when we lock targets is that they can be affected both with positive effect rr for example and negative effect turrets etcits a problem in high sec concordokken  its borring when you are in logistic ship with warriors its borring when you are in carrier etcthe idea is to have 3 small icons near the locked target icon like this please visit your user settings to reenable imagesby selecting one of them youll be able to limit by yourself what what you can do to your targetneutral icon  the basic one automatically selected when you lock no change from now can be both affected by hostile and positive effectred icon  target can be affected only with hostile modulesdrones turrets scout drones energy neutblue icon  target can be affected only by positive modulesdrones rr projected eccmthats simple and effectivefor example when you have both scout and logi drones in space you can send them to the right target far faster cause they are automatically distributedthat can be also usefull in rr bs fleets no more friends shooting you instead of remote youusefull during fleet fights usefull for new players help you to reduce mistakes a must to have
i do like this idea how easy it would be to implement though i do not knowalso confusion is a huge weapon on the battlefield many many times in real life history military forces shoot at their own forces either by a simple mistake or because the enemy has caused so much confusion that they have no idea what theyre doing anymoreso sadly although i think it is a good idea id rather leave something like this out
cheating refers to the overt or covert breaking of rules to gain advantage in a competitive situation from wikidediausing bots and macros is cheating and a violation of the eula plain and simplein my opinion the problem with players cheating is not up to the players to solve its ccps problem to solve what we can do is to keep telling ccp that we dont like there way of handling the problem and demand that they fix it whine so much about it that they are forced to take action being silent andor accept that cheating is part of the game and even defend it in whatever way will slowly but surely drive players away from the game is that the eve you want to playi been playing this game since early 2006 and i think eve online is the best game i ever played but when i see that players cheat and gets away with it without ccp even lifts an eyebrowse to correct the problem it takes away alot of the feeling that this still is the best game ever i talked to other players that share my opinion and it seems to be the opinion of lots of players writing on the forums as well tldrseeing more and more players being allowed to cheat takes away the fun in playing eve online
if i may suggesti see the problem is that the mining sites are handleable per saythe idea would be to increase the number of rats that attack the belts and the frequency come on if youre defending something and lose it youll try as fast as possible to regain control of it mining in 00 should be dangerous fluff wise have the npcs increase the more miners there aremake the botters spend time defending their operations and by that i mean a lot of time scannable grav sites in 00 would be a very nice alternative to static roid fields while ccp could keep the static one in 10 to 07 security after that scan only and the same rules apply accordingly
not supportedi am against all game mechanic changes that are meant to fight macros  bots any change that is being made to stop macros  bots will be fought by the makers of these the players have to live with the changes while macros  bots have gone past it i am not willing to pay ccp for such changes all features shall always and only be made for a direct improvement of the gameplay if then a change has got a positive sideeffect on the macros  bots situation ie by forcing them to adjust shall it be preferred over other game changes
there is no other sec status it has got only one sec status per system and all that is being displayed is this number rounded to one digit after the pointthe sec status can also go from 00 over 03795748325448 down to 10 all that you see being displayed in the game is however 00this is also the number a pos module is being compared to if a module can be anchored in some 04 systems but not all then it is likely a bug this is how i read the ops commenteve is full of little rounding bugs in case you have not noticed it yet sec status of toustain is 0411824000977859 or just 04 for every other eve playersec status of ratillose is 036646798152469 or just 04 for every other eve playerif it is a problem with rounding then the module should work in ratillose but not in toustain
as so far as pos modules go 04 is 04 the problem is that the op is trying to moon mine in a 04 system it cannot be donehe is under the assumption that a pos in 04 should be able to anchor and use all the modules as a pos in 03 and belowread hooman targets post and check out the web sites listed and that should clear up the confusion about what you can and cant do in 04 and higher systems
i like itedit feel sorry for the developers who already put a lot of effort into independent apps tho
yes please ive got one for my android phone that does most of the basic stuff but id like to be able to access my mail and calender from an app instead of having to deal with scrolling constantly in the browser
this is a great idea when im at a computer with free time i play eve why would i use eve gate when i can just log in a great target market for eve gate would be popular mobile platformsi cant speak for everyone but while im at work looking at eve  eve gate would be frowned upon at home i just play eve if i feel like it the only time i dont have access and would use it are the inbetween times or while traveling thats when i read blogs  email  ect i would love to throw eve gate into the mix with a mobile friendly app
not sure if this is a troll but ill bitethis is idiotic people are willing to make great apps like aura and capsuleer for freecheap ccp should just pull their heads out of their asses and let those guys make a buck or two off it without threatening to throw their lawyers at them were still waiting on that new forum software that we were told would come out w incursion also look what a useless piece of junk eve gate is do you really want those guys doing the job they will delete your phones bootininot supported
i agree ccp needs to give a little to get a lot back in return they are running off an old mmo model blizzard and 3rd party apps if you let the developers make money an app community will grow and thrive giving us players more options to access eve giving ccp ideas they dont didnt have the time to create in return they will get increase in interest and subscriptionsyou have to give to get
with the api now coming thru
probably i am just missing something however what is the big deal with all the phone apps these days there are apps by weather radar sites television stations to view stuff later etc all stuff that is also possible via their normal website now you can do two things to make them accessible by smart phones1 make an app for the iphone and obviously blackberry windows mobile android and symbian i think that are the major players atm so you got to make 5 different apps2 make the site itself suitable to be viewed by mobile phones and w00t we are ready okay a few things might require redundancy because some fanatics for example refuse to allow flash cough apple so then you can make it choose between flash and html5 for example but that is just way more logical to do than making an app for everything with added risk the appstores want money you pay for eve evegate is a part of eve so effectively you pay for evegate and they want part of that for being in the appstoresimilar you want an eve jukebox app why would you possibly want to make an app for that just release the freaking mp3s or again make it a site that plays themin other words i dont see a reason why they should make 5 different apps to do the same thing one for each os when you can also just make evegate scale better on mobile phones i honestly have no idea how it scales right now if it allready scales well i really dont see the issue
you need quite a lot of training to get into app development and unless they already got someone whos been doing it not likely then it would keep devs from implementing feature xnot supported
better ideaperform an analysis of the apps that have been developed already and just pay the developers of the existing applications a wadge of cash then put a ccp badge on it
fine ill get in a cane and you find me some 8 t1 frigs to kill surely theyll jump at the opportunity for easy ganki dont mind losing a cane its cheap enough where do we do this
i recommend checking out the fw areas for frig blobsliang
the chance of encountering a blob of exactly 8 t1 frigs is very lowi will concede that i was mistaken about cane using only 1 neut i just tend to have cloaks on my ships to bypass gate camps with mwdcloak trick
its true ill see if i can scare up exactly 8 t1 frig pilots for you i promise it will be very amusing for you if i can liang
i guess it also depends on you definition of blob i assume since there are so many generalizations in this thread that blob ment a 5 to 1 ratio that seems to be the common perception one of the solutions to the better composed gang it to bring superior numbers aka blobwasnt trying to say there were 100 accurate just more than you guys are giving them credit for i do agree tht they dont tell the entire storyso let me get this strait killmails encourage blobbing because people dont want to lose and they dont want other people to know they have lost but those same people dont even post there losses in the first placeill let you think about thatthe fact that your responce is exactly what i had hoped for leads me to believe that you play the game precisely how i thought you would not that there is anything wrong with how you playby the way i dont think that killmails are perfect they are far from it infact if you presented any sort of rational arguement as to why they need to be removed or atleast changed then maybe people would actually listen but this whole killmails need to be removed because they are the only reason people blob and use ewar it total bull and only makes you sound like you lost some ships to a pirate blob who then made fun of you because of a fail fit
funny  one of the counters to the blob is to bring a better composed fleet zomglets see joe thinks hes awesome at pvp joe doesnt like to lose so he blobs joe gets lots on lots of killmails joe actually loses a ship and doesnt post the loss to his killboard yeah whats the contradiction there its exactly what i expect from killmail s and its a very normal example of why killboards are a ty way to evaluate someones pvp skillno they wouldnt people are killmail s and like to be able to wave their epeen aboutsigh lets go over this one more time killmails are a terrible metric for measuring someones pvp skill for a huge variety of reasons those reasons arent going to go away by improving them killmails provide entirely too much intel about what you fly who you fly with and where you fly lossmails provide incentives to not pvp and not risk failure that is always bad killmail s tend towards blobbing and getting on as many killmails as possible which actually damages the fleet because it doesnt perform as well as it should killmail s tend towards being elitist asshats that constantly wave their pathetic epeens in everyones direction this is the biggest reason i want killmails to dieliang
in this case you have my frigate i will say though an armor cane will tear alot of tech 1 frigs a new one if the frigs start is scram range of a shield fit it could go either way edit i am not against killmails i like seeing them show on my board and as far as im aware i dont blob
whether they are a good or bad metric is a matter of opinion as long as killmail data represents the facts no fake mails it is real data that can be used in logical mannerany factual data is better than no data at allyou can choose to ignore it no problem there but you cant choose for other people to ignore killmails  by denying people access to facts
a couple of comments not all factual data is good data to be disseminated the intel who what when where provided by killmails is a perfect example of this while the data can be used in a logical and useful manner it most often is not used in this mannerliang
do you post a killmail as soon as you get it
in most good corps and alliances people dont need to post their mails they are automatically retrieved by apithe fact that ccp added that api suggests they dont have anything against killmails dont plan to scale them down in any wayand im 99 sure that ccp would not remove killmails they understand game design they understand the importance of score keeping in games
there are many ways to keep score without the negative aspects of killmailsliang
tell us about them
funny i thought that the way to counter a blob was to eliminate killmailsif no one even posts their loss mails then why would there be a massive need to blob because of loss mails ok you are most likely right about thatok so you are ed that your pvp skills are not being respected because killmails dont show everything about every engagements and you dont like killmail s but you still fail to provide a rational reason to completely eliminate the only source of pvp record keeping that we have in eve yes that sounds reasonable
you might want to get your dictionary examinedbecause that person doesnt have to post their loss mails for them to get postedits much less about people respecting my pvp skill and much more about inappropriate use of informationliangedread the thread
i had hoped that you would see the sarcasm in that postthis is much better a tangable thought and not some mythical problem that only exists in your headim guessing that information is location and fitting of your ships how about keeping killmails and just not giving a location and only showing whats drops wouldnt it have be better to propose something like that instead of saying get rid of killmails because they cause blobshowever if you still believe that killmails are the root of all the blobbingewar whorage then we still have a long way to go
nobody has claimed that killmails are the only reason for blobbing
by eliminating the source of the problem wouldnt you be eliminating the problem all together
it was dramatic flair killmails do negatively effect pvp as a whole that is undeniable
ok what you are saying is that weve misinterpreted your dramatic killmails are the root of everything bad in pvp so getting rid of them is the cure posts could it also be true then that you are misinterpreting how the majority of players actually veiw killboardsi believe that killboardskillmails actually help to motivate people to get out and strive to be the best at their given trade and that without any kind of ranking system however flawed it may be that people wouldnt have the same drive to be the best because no matter how hard they worked there would never be anything to show for iteve is a game so is baseball football futball hockey tennis basketball what do they all have in common  if you guessed a ranking system of some sort congratulations i dare you to find one of those ranking systems that doesnt have any flawsmy point is eliminating our only ranking system is not going to make competition any better infact it may even make it worse
they post themselves my corps board has the whole api thing as does battleclinici like seeing them on there though so i have a record of things i forgot to fraps im terrible at remembering to press record
same here its actually not every time i post my kill and lossmails as ive let that job be done by syndication and clever use of the api the api calls you can do as a ceodirector of a pirate corp makes the actual data extracted true we trust the 3rd party sites to represent this data in a meaningful way againtrust the removal of killmails would also close down quite a few 3rd party fansites and out of game resources which i think is bad as youd effectively close down a smallish subculture in evethose that work with development of said resources
this bad sugestion coz ur mum
he asks for how people can be measured for pvp prowess in an objective way and you point out chribba chribba is certainly well known and respected but i would think he would agree its not for pvpi do not know sir molle for pvp prowess i know him for politicking in eve he may be a very good pvper he may not but he is not known to me as a good pilot maybe he made a name for himself back in the day but they did not have killmails so his former glory is lost if only they had killmails sooner istvaan shogatsu isnt he famous for doing scams i have no clue if he is any good at pvp as for the rest i never heard of them but you are clearly mixing up fame due to politics goodwill and other things and fame due to being a very good pvper look at the players that do well in the alliance tournament you will likely see they rank pretty well on battleclinic again im not saying this ranking is perfect but does give you a rough guide and you can set up killboards to automatically pull your kills from your api if someone does not do this then yeah sure i question whether they are posting all their losses but if they do this then you have all their losses but you wont necessarily get all their kills though you can also fraps but without killmails you dont know if all those ships going down were horribly fail fitoh and about the 8 frig v bc im in fw so my solo bcs often have 2 webs 8 t1 frigates would have a tough timeUF04A if i were in a shield cane i would say the frigates would win i know that if a frigate gets under my 425s in a rupture with 2 tracking enhancers they just need to orbit at 500 and i cant hit them plus although you can neut the frigates if one has a nos you may have some serious problems even if you kill their cap you wont be able to pulse the mwd because the others will still likely have you scrammed and likely at least 3 will have webs to get decent transversal i would think 8 frigates will hold the field against a shield cane and it might indeed be a slaughter

supported  they contribute nothing to the game
you dont know who tank ceo is or ginger magicianthe point i am making is people will get a reputation if they deserve one dark rising for example has a reputation for hotdropping good fights they arent necessarily losing dragoons have a reputation for dishonoring 1v1s sard caid has a reputation for being impossible to killnone of those reputations come from a killboard nobody memorable is ever memorable because of a killboard but that doesnt stop people from trying to become known for their killboard which is the problem the problem isnt that killmails are a record and testament that a fight happened but there are better ways to go about it
and how exactly was the evidence of the guiding hand social clubs killing of their targets prized ship verifiedhow do we know that people dishonor 1v1s because of killmail evidence otherwise its simply hearsay how do we verify that a group likes to hotdrop killmail evidence otherwise its simply hearsayyou continue to ignore the actual request though which was to provide an objective metric to measure a pilots pvp prowess the fact that many of us have never heard of some of the people you mentioned shows just how poor such a measure actually is not everyone has played this game from beta and paid attention to every single article written or chest beating post made to cp or coad you were asked to provide actually liang was asked to provide and failed to do so as well and objective metric through which pvp prowess could be measured instead you provided a list of famousinfamous people who for the most part arent actually famousinfamous for pvp prowessi didnt ask for a metric of whether someone is trusted or a successful scammer or alliance leader i asked for a metric to measure a pilots pvp performance specifically a measurable objective and meaningful one in the context of eveyou have failed to do so your attempt to misdirect have been noted and soundly thrashed you claim that the problem isnt that killmails are a record and testament that a fight happened but there are better ways to go about it but dont actually bother to mention what that better way would behearsay isnt a better way particularly in a game where anonymity is as common as it is in eve where not only do you have the anonymity of the internet to contend with but also of alts and sockpuppets flying with them isnt particularly effective particularly if you are trying to screen many applicants and have limited timereputation doesnt work because the game is simply too vast for most people to have any reputation at all much less a positive or negative one plus once again its all hearsay and we all know that no one would ever exaggerate the flaws of their enemieshell this idea is so bad that ephemeron and i are on the same side of the debate that takes some serious suckage to make that happenso far all ive seen from the proponents of this idea are groundless assertions that are not backed up by any facts a refusal to actually rebut any arguments given by your opposition and a complete lack of ability to differentiate between what is an objective fact and what is an opinionkillmals assuming they are api verified are statistical facts a fight took place at this time between these parties with this result those facts may be able to be interpreted in different ways and those statistics can be used in a variety of manners some more effective than others but they remain factsthey arent perfect but then again no statistical sampling is perfect any metric will have some level of confidence associated with it and generally the larger the sample size the higher the level of confidence since outliers tend to get beaten down to a statistical meanas ive said repeatedly and neither you or liang have managed to refute killmails are not only the best objective measure of a pilots pvp prowess they are the only objective measure of a pilots pvp prowess
screenshots im sure i dont know if killmails existed back thenhow do you prove that it was dishonored with rr killmails dont do thatso are pilots who lost a fight but were able to disengage why not make killmails for all fights explosion or not observation as ive said is the only one that actually mattersor just how big eve actually is there is no reason the average pilot should know who anyone in the top 10 of any killboard is im versed in eve history and it isnt found on a killboardi did provide one battle reportsyou ignored the pvp part of the list entirelyexcept i did battle reportsanonymity is better than engineered notorietyyour recruitment practices or lack thereof are your problemyet you want everyone to have some kind of reputationometerthat could be said of the counter argument as well the entire subject is subjectiveexcept for the inaccuracies of which there are manyso your argument is that killboards should have an acceptable margin of error i thought this was about accuracyand that isnt a problem in your eyes
i already told you that aggregate killmail statistics distributed via api would be finethe most famous pvpers are not famous because of their killmails but because of frapsthe funny thing is that it doesnt provide those facts  even if the killmail is 100 genuine they are not and if they were there are still better waysliang
okay so a pvp video showing a factiondeadspace fit tengu killing 3 crappily fit t1 battleships on a video makes the tengu pilot awesome and famous a video showing us a guy killing other guyes is not by any length of imagination a better or worse indicator than a simple killmail of pilot skill it doesnt reveal anything about the victimid be fine with anynomous killmails aslong as i can peep at what items i just blew up tbh atleast for me and being in a pirate corp much jokes are had about all the hilarious fits we kill and the rage when we discover the loot fairy abandoned us its just fun for me tbh and youd be taking away something which i enjoy chatting about in eve each to his own i guess but id be more worried about what would happen to much of the comunity which has based itself off this system like battleclinic and eve service corp real communities commoner out
awesome no famous yes notably killmails dont provide any more informationbut it shows far more about what actually happenedyeah im fine with thatliang
once again you keep talking about fame i dont give a rats ass about fame someone could be a famous pvper and be friggin cluesless for all i know if they frap only their wins and ignore their losses what should we all role around frapping every friggin fight were in so we can present something of value to a recruiter for the corp we want to jointhats just stupidwhat exactly about what i said about an api verified killmail being a fact was wrong it tells you the place thats a fact of the engagement it tells you the involved parties who shot who who ecmed who who pointed whom those are facts are there things it doesnt tell you duh of course but that doesnt change the fact that things it does tell you are accurate any inaccuracies are generally due to fake killmails note i didnt say anything about the amounts of damage done or taken which is sometimes inaccurate it doesnt tell you things like was the target engaged and damaged on the other side of a gate but what i described as things that are facts still remain facts direct observation is by default subjective not objective that doesnt mean that it doesnt have value but it does not qualify as being an objective metricyour knowledge of eve history is also irrelevant to the discussion battle reports are subjective everyone puts their own spin on them and will try to make themselves look as best they can as such they are crappy metric and fail to qualify to match the criteria i laid out of being measurable and objective add in the fact that few people like to spend large amounts of times documenting their screw ups they end up being incomplete as welllike ive said already im not talking about fame or noteriety i dont care about reputations i nor anyone else arguing against you has brought fame or reputation up at all what weve said over and over again is that killboards are the only objective measure of a pilots pvp prowess no one ever claimed that you could tell if someone was an asshat or a cool dude or a great alliance leader or a great fc or a good scout or a great industrialist only that you can get a general idea that someone with good killboard stats is at least competent as pvperas to the ones who are famous for frapping i know willl adama pretty well the two of us have spared many times on the rvb boards and hes one of those famous frs but you know what hes got a good killboard history if you know where to look you can see the kills he fraps on the killboard i know i was a few of them but you know what his fraps didnt cover every engagement for example he showed one between himself and i were he managed to get away he didnt show a fight where i killed him nor one where he killed me because his videos arent about documenting all his pvp activity but rather to give a sample for the sake of fun like i said though hes got the killboard to prove that hes not some jerk off just frapping his successes seriously you two are scrapping the bottom of the barrel for arguments here youre forumfu is weak and youre flailing about at strawmen while i laugh at you and decimate your argumentsfirst you tried to lay every flaw you see with pvp a the feet of the killmail system then when that nonsense if completely debunked you try to shift to strawman claims about chribba and scammersyouve completely confused the differences between subjective and objective as well as fact and opinion youve failed to offer any viable argument to refute my assertion that killmails are the only objective measure of a pilots pvp prowess further neither of you have been willing to put up any actual evidence that you are competent enough pvpers to judge whether killboards are an effective metric like i said earlier anyone can regurgitate crap they read and pretend they have a clue so i dont give that much credit to forum warrioring without some external evidence of competence
the funny thing is that you are personally dead set against a rational conversation you refuse to evaluate alternatives and continue to regurgitate the same mindless crap that has already been dismissed you rant about what the current situation is right now instead of examining how it could be or ways to address the negative side effects of killmails your contribution to this discussion has been nothing shy of trollish and i suspect your entire contribution to the eve community is the samegood day to you sirliang
you havent offered a single reasonable alternativeall youve done is make some unsupported assertions accuse everyone who views killmails and killboards as a bunch of killmail syou havent actually established any negative effects of killmailsif you wanted to talk about ways to make the killmail system more accurate im all for that but this nonsense of claiming that it creates ills that it doesnt is just that nonsensetalk about trolling
no op must die dount touch killamils improbe them rework them but dont you dare kill them
oh reallyoh reallyalso im really confused you seem to be addressing me and valdore as the same person stop thatliang
are you who are in favor of getting rid of killmails of the generation that grew up being told that winning and keeping score is bad im thinking so stats are kept in battles assets monetarily and body count factscore is kept for games fact if your ball team sucked and got stomped you didnt work hard enough man up shirley cuz you lostyou want an argument for killboards ok how about this perhaps the fight was close perhaps one of your targets had a hero tank killmails let you see the fit they let you see why perhaps something worked well or why something failed hard speaking of fits km may give you an idea that you hadnt thought of before in a fit killmails can also let you see how much isk you lost or killed record keeping if you will whats wrong with that not a ing thing thats what and yes killmails let you have a trophy of victory poor little johnny doesnt like that someone has a record sheet of his fail so ban killmails ive never once heard anyone use the killboard as an excuse to go roaming or looking for a fight people do it because its fun if a person is solely dependent on epeen kkb stats then theyre likely 13 years old and have more zits than sense one week a kb might look like gold and the next youre embarrassed that its there to be seen but  happens not supported
amusingly ive seen killboards used as an excuse not to go out roaming or fightliang
panic much i dont have a problem with winning or losing for that matter just the way your eve ball game lacks official scoring or rules that encourage less cowardly pvp
but thats like saying fat people blame cake for becoming fat the solution isnt to ban cake its to start eating responsiblyif some corps use killboards as excuse not to fight explain to those corps why they are wrong and tell them to seek professional help
shamans are finelearn to play
hmph i strongly disagree when people say destroyers are a bad pvp ship or destroyers are nerfedgranted they are a typical choice for newer players after a frigate due to cost and sp requirements although that is the case they are almost completely wrongly identified as being a worse ship class and what i disagree with most the fact that they should be boosted or in even more influential symantics fixedalthough i hardly know about minmatar amarr and caldari destroyers i do know that the catalyst is an excellent ship when flown right against even large cruiser fleets it is designed as being an antifrigate gunboat and it does that job exceedingly ive flown with a pro catalyst pilot and during a deadspace he was consistently killing frigates and light cruisers faster than i could target them in my thoraxalas hardly anybody flies them right anymore the ship hasnt been nerfed the pilots haveim going to get a actual destroyer pilot to write an article about it in the ships n fittings section and link it all for you to see and to learni hope ccp knows that still
cant really speak to pvp but ive been doing ok knocking off sansha frigs with my catalystthey are oneshottable by many cruisers though and this really limits them in what i think their planned role was anti tackle  anti drone in fleet fights as long as you remember that it is neither a big frigate or a small cruiser they deliver good bang for your buck if anything maybe a slight sig radius reduction and perhaps adjust pg a little upwards
this is where proper flight comes into play im still awaiting my corps catalyst pilot to write a proper flying guide who flies an eris at incursions taking down frigates and took all aggro once and didnt get popped so you can see how to fly one and not get killed
i would absolutely love to see the option to change the background color of the next gate enroute to your set destination i know that the gate icon is yellow but at times its impossible to see
it could accidentally happen
oh heck yes i would love to see the tears on the forums if this happens
yes yes yes yes ccp please do this
ho double yes 
nice to see such strong support for the idea and yes as a gallente i have no problem seeing a caldari system go to hell especially one which most players depend onalso can you imagine the amount of wrecks to be found there should such a thing accidentally happen oh it would be salvagers galoreps i got a strange feeling that everyone in highsec would come after me for suggesting the idea should it ever happen
sansha dont gate camp in high sec jita has got no belts nor agents effect of incursions on tradehaulmanufacturing  zeromight be the only system where incursions last for a full week though as the lag to fight in them would be bad esp on weekends
you just had to ruin it for everyone thank you for destroying my hopes and dreams
hell ye
as i have an alt in jita and have been in systems where an incursion is active i can say it would do virtually nothing to harm jita or the activity there it sure would not interfere with me no sanshas at the station or gates in high sec people will just carry on as usualin fact incursions seem to create quite a bit of trade activity this would actually be an opportunity for profitso let it happen but no reason to target it specifically

just like valve steam games allow to open a bug from within the game and to even capture a screenshot to attach to iti cba to switch to the desktop from eve or use the crappy ingame browser to log into eve bug report and then addd details switching between the game and the browsermake it easier in order to get more bug reports because currently i cba reporting them the awkard way
cheating refers to the overt or covert breaking of rules to gain advantage in a competitive situation from wikidediausing bots and macros is cheating and a violation of the eula plain and simplein my opinion the problem with players cheating is not up to the players to solve its ccps problem to solve what we can do is to keep telling ccp that we dont like there way of handling the problem and demand that they fix it whine so much about it that they are forced to take action being silent andor accept that cheating is part of the game and even defend it in whatever way will slowly but surely drive players away from the game so however clever solutions you can come up with to solve this problem will all be meaninless until ccp actually decides that cheating is bad for the game and does something about it
yeah it is annoying

i finished creating my new avatar and like in old creator im slightly disappointed about results whyin old creator i made nice avatar which looked great on big picture but when i entered game little icon with my face in chat window appeared to be completely different and looking just tragicnow we have new creator and the problem is just the same on big picture avatar looks awesome and in little icon in chat window situation can still be tragic and there is no way to check how my avatar will be looking in this little picture earlier than when i login to gameproblem is that this little icon is my real in game picture because 99 of time other players looking on this little picture of my characterother thing witch came into my mind during recreating my new avatar is this there is 4 shots of character in creator when u creating itwhy cant they be all usedwhen i first time logged after recreating my new avatar i was seen in chat list and local as old avatar and in chat window as new one and it was awesome same face in two different shots if there is problem to manage more than one shot of character in one game session there shouldnt be a problem to load one different shot every next loggingthis way we have 4 pictures of our one avatar simple and greate isnt it
note this thread somehow got duplicated and one moved to features and ideas both have been blocked so there was a hiccup on my part and also on ccps therefore here is an unlocked thread since it was locked in errorhii am sure i am not the only person tired of all the unimaginative and peurile trolls and whiners on the forums since moderators either sometimes have a hard time determining genuine trolls and timewasters or simply do not want to hand out bans to paying customers i appreciate this is understandable i propose a simple fix to this solutionallow players to moderate what they see on the forums to this end there are a couple of features that would greatly benefit the community as a whole1 add colour standings to characters and corporations similar in style to in game perhaps although acting independently from in game standings this would let us see quickly if a thread comes from a dodgy source2 ability to block certain individuals and corporations not only from showing up for you but also ideally to stop them from posting in threads of your creationnumber 2 especially would go far to reduce the timewasters on these forums note i am not suggesting that we have moderation over players to the level that it blocks them from everyone just a bit of control over what we ourselves see with this power available to us it may deter some of the horrible posters we see cluttering up good discussionsregardsbongo debbie
nobut csm or some other volunteers could at least moderate assembly hall and other places where youre not supposed to post unfinished ideas like remove killboards boost gallente boost my guns nerf suiciding these dont really belong here hey i got idea when i woke up and i am going to post it on assembly hallim not sure if even this thread is worth supporting or voting whatever
most of those ideas unfocused as they are represent a significant concern for a large portion of the playerbase we are asking for a fix and whilst we might not be able to agree on a way forward we at least want an open discussion on how to best achieve it moving a discussion like that to the assembly hall from features and ideas merely represents an escalation requestpure troll posts should of course be moderated and they are

i propose that ccp advertises on video websites such as hulu youtube etc especially hulu as they use video adverts i think it would be awesome to be watching something tagged as scifi and have the incursion ad it would certainly peak my interest in eve online i could click the video and blam there i am creating a trial account and downloading the client for a highlyawarded mmo
human beings will go from commodities to moduleswarhammer 40k called he wants his grimdark back no seriously id rather completely ignore this aspect of the fluffbut a game where you got to manage a spaceship and its crew id like that but theres no place in eve for this
ship balancing is a nightmare because there appears to be no rhyme or reason to who tackles the task of curating game balance it needs a permanent team of dare i say it specialists hardcore dd statisticians or something scary like that who are accountable  or at least should thoroughly explain themselves on issues they tackle  to the playerbasecsmi hate the module implementation of crews its a horrible ideai would much prefer for crew experience to be based somewhat off something like the standings system where certain actions would introduce modifiers for your ship this wouldnt add server load as it would simply be an additional calculation performed off a killmail  yes it would require more robust killmail generation but thats no bad thing eitherthis allows you to control how quickly your crew becomes more experienced based on the ship type  frigates would level up fairly fast whereas capitals would have to see huge amounts of combat and usage to become experiencedto reiterate  killing npc ships would not result in an experience modifier this completely eliminates concerns about elite afk dominixes becoming fotm additionally the crew experience modifier would only affect ship functions by an extra 510 or so selling your ship would result in its crew being broken up and returned to rookie statusccps nonsensical statement about afking confuses me the only person on a killmail whilst afk is routinely the one that got killedit encourages pvp activity and therefore isk sinks it discourages pve activity for anything more than isk generation and it will make people think twice before throwing their crackcrewed ships away on a whim
i dont think its up to the players to solve the problem with other players cheating and breaking the eula its up to ccp so however clever solutions you come up with solving the problem it will do nothing if ccp keeps allowing it instead let ccp know that we think cheating is bad and that it makes the game less fun to playso to ccp cheating is bad for the game ok please fix
anyone got an update on this
incarna isnt going to destroy the space portion of the game its just another thing to do thats all if you wanna pvp mine or whatever do it i believe ccp has said many time that incarna wont change the core game play experience it will be ok everyone
if i want to learn rogue i can play city of heroes or wow
i can confirm that everytime theres talk of it rapage he gets all excited and starts ramming my ship in the rear its very uncomfortable for everyone present
i was going to wait until the meeting but as csm are putting their opinions on the table already i will post a summary of my post in the csm internal forumccp have said that lark can run and if he decides to do so many people will use the insider trading to discredit his campaign hell just have to deal with it
it may just be me and dv feel free to correct me if im wrong but i get the feeling that lark is collateral damage on this one
i am a tad more blunt sirfor those not able to read between the linesis this more directed towards lark or perhaps ankh as hershel suspectsthing is that you have set an air asif you are using the csm for certain personal agendas and this is a bad thing a very bad thing
larkonis is exactly the reason that item was put on the agenda any other consideration is accidental
the fortunate thing with lark is that the information on what he did is publicly available and therefore we can make up our own minds as to whether we want to support him againwhat this conversation does bring up is the issues that might come about when someone whose actions have been buried wants to run though im guessing those would be seen as more serious infractions that would mean ccp chose to permanently ban that individual from running for the csmi have to say that if this is a personal attack on lark then im horrified that any csm member would think that was an appropriate use of their power dv can you explain your reasons for this proposal since i think the playerbase now deserve a clear explanation of your motives so that we can be informed as how you intend to use your position within the csm next time if you get in
these are really 3 different arguments i altered you quote to make this clear the first argument seems to be that csm lack authority to make a recommendation on this issue but its sort of poorly worded csm does not make any decisions on the game at all they merely recommend proposals if you mean to say it is not the job of the csm to recommend who should be eligible to run then i disagree i think csm is fully within their rights to make any recommendations they want regarding any aspect of the game what if it appeared ccp was considering that only players who work for ccp are going to be eligible to run for csm thus pretty much defeating the whole idea couldnt csm recommend that they not implement this sure they could csm could also make recommendations about whether someone would be ineligible to run again after serving a certain number or terms etc your second argument is not whether you can vote on this type of proposal but rather whether you should csm does not need to address every issue they have the power to address this is a argument a good one i might add that csm should not start taking votes on these matters unless there is a very good reason but it is not saying you cant do it i am not sure if there is a procedure as to what csm will and will not vote on the third argument is just a simple but good argument why the proposal should be voted down it has nothing to do with csms authority but instead addresses the merits of the proposali think this clarification is important because i have seen this authority issue come up before and cloud issues for example mazz had a proposal that ccp employees play eve this was apparently rejected in part because some on csm thought they had no authority to make this recommendation i have no idea why they thought that certainly no document was provided to support the claim that csm has a limited scope as to what they can recommend i think the csms scope of authority as to what they can recommend is very large imo csm members shouldnt punt issues due to unsubstantiated claims that it is not within the scope of their job
i should have been more specific it is not the job of the csm to decide if an individual is eligible to run yes csm can and do make recommendations about the csm process in fact the requirement to supply a campaign message was one of them however now is not the appropriate time to attempt to change parts of the election application process at the end of the day ccp reserve the right to exclude a candidates applicationplease note that only two people have left csm due to nda issues one publicly apologised resigned and was told by ccp that he could apply again in future the other was removed and afaik hasnt been allowed to run again i believe ccp should continue making case by case decisions based on the severity of the infraction rather than a blanket ban
no suicide ganking is not a hack its a feature and entirely working as intended which is to make elite eve players feel superior to wows players

originaly id thought this original pos rebuildturns out i was wrong id never noticed any such thread here on the forums or bothered to take a look back in history with the search bar ive just though of an original idea that happens to be much like others as it is sort of a second run at the same thing ill post it here as reference to my own idea how it should be done and support this threadultimately id like to see poss get a major mechanics upgrade a new way of controlling and managing them some idea of how that could be accomplished may be found in the thread i posted as well as my ideas for how to develop a modular pos personally i dont want to see some square chunky thing with a bunch of big bay doors it actually reminded me of something from an old rts game or something which i only half remember testing at one time when i saw the pdf file earlier and not much different from the picture i saw somewhere around here lets try for a cross between a pos and a station as they currently exist in game now within reason obviously there are some limitations to that but not as many as you might thinktake my single module with autoskinning of textures one step further and youve got modules that autoarchitect based on the tower they are connected too that would require some additional planning perhaps as you would require both a modular construction package and some additional materials based on your posjust a thought anywaypreferred1 new management and control options preferably in a system like i have described2 keeping with history lets not change the overall function of pos too much i dont believe they should allow station like docking or enable repairs without cost a station module which functioned as a repair facility using stored minerals and the like would be reasonable but how to dock at it3 it has to look like it belongs and unlike it came from somewhere else im sure ccp will be happy to oblige there which makes me happy toosupported

i support any buff to bo but i would suggest the domi hull used for sin and mega hull used for maurader be switched considering that domi is more pve and mega is more pvp plus guns are way better for bo role than drones main thing i would support would be allow covert clocking device on bo ships for me the ability to warp while cloacked alone would make me more interested or 50 price reduction secondary i support extended jump range and abilities being brought in line with their t1 counterparts which are about 110th the price all other buffs i would consider gravyfeffps cmon ccp

you should petition an gm because their exact answer is blasters are intended to have the best tracking and dps at close range of all weapons i will no quote the gm because has you know its against the eulathe problem is that they dont work like is intended has you just said and they are incapable to figure out this dont ask me wy because has you all i can say is that either they are blind either none of them has ever used or uses them
any news
so far the devs dont even recognize there is a problemthey are looking at the game but they should be looking at themselves the devs have a problem a personal problem that bleeds into bad game design

lol i suport the idea if you need to prove your age to unlock thsi content
i know i was caught by surprise when i found this was not possible i fully support this it seems a lot of people were not expecting this behavior the first time they tried it forcing them to learn this the hard way is just an unneeded frustration
you forget there were two sides of that confrontation well 3 really but one was under contract to one of the other parties and nc still had to end their campaign even though they have that massive jb system that according to you and others supporting the idea of jb removal claim should have allowed them to operate in both theaters with impunityinstead they had to abandon their campaign then were forced to reclaim the systems they lost while trying to move their force backsounds like everything is working perfectly fine in that regardas far as being able to undermine the activities of small roaming gangs so what one would expect a large organized power block to be able to effectively deal with small time criminals trying to harass its citizenstime and time again these whines such as this just come down to some malcontent being upset that their desired victims have ways to avoid being victims
imo it will make eve worse it will be less fun
its not a matter of opinion we have people who know first hand what eve is like without jb and with jblets conduct a poll among all the vets who been with this game since 2004  is eve more fun now with jb or was it more fun before jbsure we expect that but we expect that security to be achieved by pvp by patrolling and hunting down the criminals not bypassing it completely with safety of teleportation devicesyou want security fight for it
i believe the point would be that they already have by gaining sovereignty that typically isnt gotten by flying out and planting a flag what you are asking is that they surrender that bought and paid for security so that any random group of twits can roll in and upset their empires because they are bored i believe it has been pointed out that those devices are not completely safe now someone who wants to make it unsafe does have to commit some resources to doing so but considering the amount of resources that the defender had to commit to gain that teleport capability in the first place its hardly unreasonable that those who try to threaten it must commit more resources and planning than just getting together a dozen bored friends to try and gank transportsit seems to me that your problem with jump bridges is that you cant take a small force of subcap ships and undermine an advantage that likely required a significant force of capital ships to gain in the first placeim sorry but david only beats goliath in fables
such a poll already exists herefinnagain zero replies 69
so you would have no problem whatsoever with restricting bridges to industrial type ships or do you want to add some exceptions to that assessmentpfft marines are nothing but gis that are not hydrophobic hardcore is parenting and elementary school educatingso a weeks worth of blobbing justifies perpetual security that is higher than that of highsec are you sure you want null to be that dullpretty sure he is asking the same that i have been for a year or more that null entities be required to actually use and police the space they call theirsbut with things as they are there is no need to patrolpolice if anyone contests something you have a few days to gather the da blob  that is the extent of the sovereignty system hardly inducive quality fights or any other worthwhile pew
there needs to be some balance between 12hoursoutofsync alliances repeatedly razing each others infrastructure versus long timers on infrastructure ensuring that all fights will end up as massive capital blobsi agree with the idea though that sovereignty should simply be a measure of how well the residents are defending their space

if regionally exclusive alliances are the desired format then yes there has to be a time buffer to bridge the gap not sure if the protectionist alliance is actually desired by the powers that be though before bridges you practically had to patrol the various pipes at regular intervals to keep normal traffic flowing time spent ratting was often less than that spent keeping the paths clearwhatever is done to bridges it has to be accompanied by significant boosts to null ability to achieve selfreliance when it comes to common modsships  so a huge buff to the industrial side of things will be required
what still gets me is that most of the folks who want to use game mechanics to nerf playstyles they dont like seem unaware that the same process can be turned back on them if next year or the year after whatever ccp decides that small gang combat isnt where their vision is and its large fleet battles that get column inches in the ny times whats to stop them from trying to nerf small gang and boost large fleet now star gate activation time is directly proportional to the number of fleet members you have decreasing with each member individual ships will have to sit on a gate and not move for an hour if they want to jump out and if they move or activate weapons the timer restarts and why this will even be good for pvp since it will increase all those ganks of small fleetslone travelers who get pounced on and cant escape its only when your own ox is getting gored i suppose that some people are willing to see that ccp altering mechanics to cater to or harm a style of play isnt a very good system to endorse trolling in this threadsay it aint soof course i probably shouldnt have given you the benefit of the doubt like when you respond to it being pointed out that changes which only effect sov holders are not evenhanded unlike changes which effect absolutely anybody who uses jump gates in empire and your response is so theyre both even handed then ah well i tried which would be somewhat deliberately missing the point in a discussion of whether or not players are allowed to created their own content or whether or not its mediated by ccps interdict in empire the very fact that unprovoked aggression is met with lethal force whose avoidance is an exploit would speak to the difference between playercreated content and playermediated content yes it would if players didnt want to form alliances and only wanted to have 10 man roaming gangs ever and ccp wanted to try to force them into alliances thatd be breaking sandbox play the whole point is that the players create the content in the space that the empire dont hold and that content is created and directed however the players want build sand castles or kick them into someones face same difference it is possible im sure to break sandbox play in any number of ways the previously mentioned instantteleporttojovianarenacombat would be a great way its a very good argument and you tacitly admit it rebuts your claims alliances can project crushing force without jbs they can inflict serious damage on a defender even if the defender has a huge jb network we know this because it just happened that groups may have to make choices to accomplish this is hardly noteworthy all youre saying is that the sandbox is fine and we have choice of playstyles
i also said that any entity in eve can project their force anywhere in evebut the amount of force is highly dependant on the numbers they have in said fleetthe need to jump 30 jumps vs 6 jumps will have an impact on the size of fleets one thing is moving the actual fleet another one is when all thoose members in fleet need to get to the staging areaso when an alliance is doing a cta if you are getting 100 or 200 in fleet is influenced by how many jump they have to do to get there its been like that since eve came upsandboxeve has always been a sandbox but ccp has always done changesmodifications within the game when they have felt a certain gamemechanic has been too widespread nano nos system scanner removed due to new scan mechanics damps aoe doomsday motherships remember when they couldnt be scrammedlast time i checked correct me if im wrong the cost of having a jump bridge was 10 milday
hi new to game and ive already had some problems with bots the market ones are extremely annoying updating buy and sell orders instantly and to the exact same isk agrotone way to deal with market bots is to buy 1 item off them and then check transactions to see player name open a trade box with that player as trades can not be insta rejected it seems to upset the macros functioni was interested in playing eve to see the real player driven economy that is advertised but im disappointed to see that its just a sham driven by bots and npc like any other single player games economy of course there is human element but not nearly as much as advertisedi dont think ill be updating my subscription but im not sure yet because eve is still a cool and unique game it seems strange that ccp does little to prevent botters who play the game for free using iskd plex but would rather see new subscribers leave the gamei think the best way to encourage ccp to take action is to make sure noobs are aware of the bot problem before they subscribe that way they can vote with their dollars which ccp will listen toowith a couple of new mmpog space games coming out ccp might be more motivated to take action ccp might then take action against the botters just like the unholy rage thing against evil real money bottersas for the claims bots are undetectable a quick look at other games detection methods including the online gambling world would reveal tons of ways of dealing with them
thumbs upif you dont understand the immense problems with botting and how it lessens the player experience for every single legit player you havent put much thought to it alternatively your a botter
ive never used bots or dont even understand thembutwhat about key binding is it the same can we use them or do we have them i used them in other games and i liked them pretty much
i would really like to see ccp take some actions against them 
any keybinding that doesnt involve repeats or decisionmaking should be fine for example pressing f1 f2 f3 f4 from one keypress is not an issue having something that drags whatever is in your cargo hold to your jetcan every three minutes is obviously violating the tos and spirit of the game
fyi csm did bring up the bot issue read the meeting minutes
supported but money is the bottom line so ccp will do nothing they cant afford to lose 30 of their accounts with two other games still in development and eating up the revenue from evepersonally i just tell people not to bother playing eve if they ask about it i explain 1 that theres no point in manufacturing due to so many maxed out chars in existance  and macro mining funding a lot of it 2 001 station games are mainly bots 3 null sec alliances are mainly funded by botting yeah i know about moons but this is for a newbieif you want to do small scale nonsov pvp then thats doable haul crap around and sell it  yeah you can do that you can even play 001 trade games but its not as easy as it once was due to the proliferation of botspretty much everything else though you will be competing with bots for resourcesbounties and unless you also bot then you will lose the isk war which in turn means youll lose any real warsbeen going on for a very very long time now though with nothing done except when it affected ccps revenue or put load on the serverthe implied message from ccp is carry on botting
maybe the question should be are you prepared to accept a xxyy price hike on eve to cover their perceived losses if they get rid of all the bots
however at the same time without bots both rmt and nonrmt people have to get their isk somewhere else since doing it the normal way like others apparently wasnt an option the next possibility is selling plexes more people selling plexes  lower price of plexes  more alts funded by plexes then the question is what is larger the extra number of alts funded by the cheaper plexes or the loss of the macros or version two just get rid of the macros ffs
i think this is a factor remember the last big stomp of bots unholy rage which was almost 2 years ago it had a big impact for example highsec macro miners virtually vanished for awhile ccp did some big crow story about how much banning botters reduced node lag as wellwhy havent we read stories by ccp of unhony rage ii iii and ivsimple they havent engaged botters seriously since unholy rage why ccp makes more money off botters than they do us people operating bots and ive seen it demonstrated where one pc can now run multiple bots farm isk and pay for their game time in isk this fuels plex demand which then induces people to buy them to sellccp and other publishers like to wax poetic about how buying in game currency from rmt sellers distorts and ruins the game yet somehow buying plex items from ccp and selling it on the market is good the fact of the matter is that everyone who buys isk be it from purchasing plex items from ccp or buying from your friendly chicomm isk farmer is buying farmed isk most likely produced by botsthe plex item existing on the in game market purchasable via in game currency in virtual anonymity is the fuel that is powering the botsccp will not engage in widespread bot crackdowns like they did preplex because they know that it will harm their revenue here is what they need to do1 there needs to be a period where plex sales are suspended what is in game and on the market can continue to sell but they wont sell new ones2 ccp needs to commit their gm staff in a period of antibot crackdown on the scale of unholy rage or larger repeat steps 1 and 2 as often as needed 3 ccp needs to sue the publishers of bot software there is precedent out there for such a lawsuit to win ie see the wowglider case where blizzard successfully sued a bot maker
ccp is not going to remove botters or their ill gotten gains anyhow the only fair way to remove their ill gotten gains would be a complete wipe and restart of the eve universe this will never happeneve players will just have to play the game knowing that the market is a complete sham that is only partially player controlled the eve market is as realistic as a market on a single player console rpg in the simple fact that items are generated by automated npcs and scriptsyes some items are player made sold ratted but only a small fraction the majority of items particularly high value null sec generated items are from bots they might as well have every item available in infinite amounts in every station at a set price this is the way its going anyway ok a bit of an exaggeration but the foundation is correct
supportedat least start with a damn self check of the client its not too hard for a program to check its own processes to detect injected code that shouldnt be there while the client is runningchecking for a large variety of constantly evolving programs running on the users computer is a lot more difficult but the former should be in every mmo that has an economy at risk of rmt and macro  bottingother often suggested ideas can be more involved then you think and even if they worked eliminating rmt is not possible best case scenario will result in removing all bots and macros however those will very quickly be replaced by real people farmers working from developing countries where wages are horribly low
they should be able to build into the client a block that only allows itself access to the server also considering that bot programs are advertised why cant ccp acquire copies of them themselves and build simple detection into the client to make it exit the game if any of those programs are runninganother option would be to have the client look for those programs on the pc when it launches and if it detects them delete them
not sure if its true but i read somewhere on these forums that ccp was reverse engineering some of the bot programs highly improbable but who knows except themdont think ccp would risk deleting anything from anyones computer even if it was legal which it probably isnt and scanning of hard disks causes a lot of consternation for a lot of people microsoft got a crapload of flak for it if i remember correctly
no thumbs up as ccp did already post a devblog on this matter and the current csm discussed botting and possible countermeasures with ccp at the december summitjust because you dont like the answer to a question doesnt mean it wasnt answeredand asking the same question over and over and over again wont change the answer
you know im getting quite annoyed with people around here accusing ccp of not wanting to get rid of bots for revenue reasons for crying out loud they are still cracking down on rmts they allowed hulkageddon to flurish and they started unholy rage as for the plex for some of you that dont remember ccp created that system in order to draw people away from rmt sites if that is not proof enough that ccp is concerned about the bots then i dont know what isand besides they have limited resources to deal with bots on a individual level since much of their resources are still focused on the development of the game not to mention the incoming incarna expansionthis means that it is up to us the capsuleers of new eden to take matters into our own hands we will gather up our ganking ships muster the largest fleets and begin an endless crusade against the macros there will be tears there will be wrecks there will be hatemails and the best part about it is that its all legal as for those of you who dont think this would have the slightest impact against macro users and their wallet let me ask you this how long do you think it will be before macro users run out of isk after they have to constantly replace their ganked mining ships the immediate war against macros has now evolved into a war of attrition
in principle supported it makes no sense that the fofs hit an unarmed hostile structure instead of any of the npc cruisers showering you with hms it would be nice to have t2 fofs too but they must have some drawback as opposed to manually targeted missiles occasionally fofs handle npcs much quicker than manually targeting them especially when you have many weak npcs due to the auto switching of targets they can behave like a giant smartbomb which i love when it happens but its too much
i agree if a bug report cant get it fixed then to the csm with itliang
uhm i think their actual purpose is to harden your ship against ecm
theyre like hull rep they fail for their intended purpose
meh theres ways around it such as looting and salavaging your wrecks as you go
then you are doing something wrongpretty much the best investments ive ever made got the racial sets on all my characters and it makes those falcon pilots cry bitter tearsespecially love my falcon killer vagabond gets them every single time
it doesnt matter how much you gimp your fitting you can apparently still run missions just fine and without any risk i can understand your point but i think the idea of a ship that can run level 4 missions solo avoid bubbles and is unprobeable is opi never even heard of unprobeable ships until t3 was introduced and those implants have been around for a lot longer and its not like the idea of probeable wrecks was introduced as a way to find unprobeable ships ive only seen it mentioned in salvaging threads its just a side effect if you want to be able to run missions in lownull then there needs to be an element of risk involved
agreed provided it also nerfs the ability to probe out missions or makes it thrice as hardreason being 95 of the probers out there are looking for ninjaing stuffganks and not direct pvp combatits entirely driven to be steal your lootz and hope you shootz meand make the salvage probe very easy at that point within the boundries of not being able to invade an active mission areaif the missions done have at it otherwise no go
is this a function for noob probersi want ccp spend time on more important stuff
ships shouldnt be unprobable anyway
anything in space should be probable
andim glad you guys actually spell it out like this because i believe the support probeable wrecks is getting has never truly been about salvaging but about the ulterior or maybe not so ulterior motive of having a way to find unprobeable mission runnerswell of course its never mentioned like that  if people came out and said we want probeable wrecks because we want to find those pesky unprobeable tengu mission runners so we can have our extra easy and juicy killmail then people might objectif it were really about salvaging people wouldnt object to wrecks only being probeable after the mission has been turned in i can only hope ccp sees right thru the ploy
which one doesnt even the ungated ones are technically ded space as far as i know instanced space where special rules can be appliedprobeable wrecks in normal space is a phenomenal idea
if ungated mission space is deadspace too then i got no problem with wrecks being probeable everywhere but in deadspace  it would indeed give the salvaging profession a boost
i would support this proposalits hard enough trying to persaude people that its possible to pve outside of hisec as it is without making any mission or plex site trivially probeable
for the record in case it wasnt clear under these conditions im totally okay with wrecks being probeable
a number of posters here may be getting confused with their support not tallying with their commentsthe thread title is supporting this thread does not mean you support probeable wrecksi feel that it is a nice idea but it would make ganking mission runners even easier so needs to be approached with a lot of caution
i am up for ganking mission runners also probable wrecks would be awesome because salvaging would be a valid career also theyd have to let you tractor beam wrecks that werent yours
you already had combat probes to eliminate an entire poulation from low sec that its not under big alliances bootsprotectionhavent you donne enough to destroy a big bit of the game for a great number of eve players

my only complaint of this is that outposts in 00 should be completely destructible so that stupid deployments can be corrected i know the argument that folks who dont log on might lose stuff in a destroyed outpost so what if you lose a regional war and have to evac quickly you leave stuff in an outpost you may never see again anyway i know i have assets stuck in 00 i do not expect to ever get back and some of that is 3 years oldthere should be 3 tiers of outpost attackassault  current method destroy upgrades assault station in with reinforcement timerswreck  virtually all station services are gone hangars still exist with ships and gear no ownership to prevent anyone from docking the core of the op heredestroy  a second complete cycle of the assault as far as structurearmor hp like targeting a wrecked ship the wrecked outpost can be targeted and destroyed completed this destruction will then leave pieces for salvage random modules andor ships from the various hangars for loot destroyed stations dissolve into the ether like ship wrecks and cans after 24 hoursthis allows for a true scorched earth campaign and to eventually correct stupid outpost deployments note that this is only for playerdeployed outposts the only indestructible player created object in eve that costs less than a supercarrier
post here if you would like ccp to make the removal of botsscripts from eve online a priorityby posting youre keeping our anger at the situation on the front pagefeel free to discus the problem or just simply a post supporting an anti bot petition is fine
yes
supported
angry coco agrees with this
fixing lag should be priority they try to do it for a year and getting worse every expansion
lag may be a problem but so is boting since they have a direct negative impact on the new eden economy price inflations caused by macro ratters collecting endless bounties while ore prices plummet as macro miners flood the market with ores
yeah the interface has a report isk spammer option whatever that means why not have a report botter menu option

information is neither good nor bad it is what is done with it that may rate a moral judgment i agree that dotlan can help in this regard but just because a third party has made a fix does not mean it shouldnt be implemented in game by that same logic you could remove the in game browser all maps and the mailif possible we should have our tools close to hand let the information flow and see what the players make of itm
something to think aboutlook at other games like wow and sto are they betterthey dont tell you nothing and when they do they lie at least ccp let you know where you stand you may not like it but they have the ball to tell you its not easy killing bots and still have the engine work right so if you dont like it go to another game sorry that is how i think im not a nice person im an eve player
whatever ccp decide do something about bots and let us know what theyve done
also why not post their habits post how they were caught and if possible what ship fittings they regularly used

there are a few posts already some from 2009 you should read themonly constructive in your own opinion or all other opinions are considered make it simple they should have the smallest alpha and good dps supported by their rofsuperior tracking witch isnt the caseonce again make it simple the ammo size for you is important considering rpif the game was rp projectiles shouldnt exist in the gameto make it simple you have 650m3 of cargo on your bs 5k ammo is about 13 of your cargo you can shoot a lot of stuff with thatnow if there is some problem in this point is the capbooster charges size not the ammosince the railguns use huge energy to lounch the projectile yes lounch the ships need a great boost in their capacitor or lower the fitting requirements for railsblasters but also armor modswhat changes will this make nothing just 5sec to swap ammo no changes to the real problemincrease the rof bonus skill to 4 instead of 2 per skill level this is a positive change but it must be related to hybrids add extra capacity of the guns the bigger ones like 425mm from 2m3 to 6m3 this is positive this helps the dps in conjunction with some minor changes to the ammo has tracking bonus of t2 ammo tracking speedrof of blasters is supposed to be the highest of all close range weapons in the game but it isnt wyyou cant get in range to apply your dps before you get facemelted by everything and when you get the web supposed to help and increase blasters dps is nerfedchange the ship bonus of blaster platforms or give them another one more speed per level or web strenght per levelall t2 ammo are crap you dont even notice that the tracking bonus in them is not one its a drawback what interst on using ammo that lowers your tracking when you are already complaining about tracking issueschange tracking bonus andod add dps or speed penality to the target 10 per hit or something like this i dont know and its not my job to find it its ccp onemy conclusion to your post is simple most of your proposals have nothing of any possible solutiontalk about ships bonus related to the weapon system and bonus that aloud using them effectivlytalk about t2 ammo their bonus and their drawback that shouldnt existtalk about the rof of hybrids witch its supposed to be the advantage of hybrids and is notcould add some more but is a waste of time
no that isnt unpredictable at all in fact i know exactly what would happen if someone did thati will concede that there might storyline reasons as to why things work as they do but vague hints of possibly some sort of unknown intelligence behind it all or maybe not is no reason to let an exciting and new frontier become stale and homogenous like it is becoming now we cant say anything with certainty when it comes to wspace and the sleepers as the many multipage threads in eve fiction show if they were that desparate to cling onto lore ccp could just fudge it and say yeah theres been asupernovaor somethingand now all statics are random enjoy and youd still have your lore to back it upheck even just slapping a in few more regional statics would spice it up a little it doesnt have to be a earthshattering change to wh mechanics as we know them it just needs to change a little to throw some more unknown factors into the mix
supported this is what i thought how wormholes work now
yes
i do not support removing or changing current wormhole mechanics but i am open to adding new more random wromholes on top of the current system
it got off of the test server so it must have been working as intended the bras females are wearing under their jackets dont show anything indecent we have to have jackets on so its just a little cleavage being shown you can probably see worse on prime time tv we see our characters without clothing during character creation and honestly some of the things that go down in game and in chat are worse than a little skin and would be more cause for a worse rating than the cleavagethus theres no necessity for forcing peoples avatars to wear a shirtso if you agree there should be shirtless avatars both for males and females as long as theres that jacket or whatever for the females please support this threadedit  games like blade and soul and tera have more skin showing than the eve chars so it isnt like eve would be the worst
yeah no kidding the editor starts off with you in your underwear anyway so its not like going shirtless or pantless is anything we havent just seen on the screen before hand why not just let people go forward no matter what state their wardrobe is inbesides you wouldnt say no to these cans would you
my characters will have shirtsbut i hate the kidification of everything so supportedheck people should have to wear jackets eather we are all naked in pod gew anyways
i think that some of the outerwear should be worn as whole outfits because some of it covers the entire bodyi support this topic also
i see no reason to enforce top clothing unless ccp can come with reasonable explanation i support the op
agreed my original toon was naked except for the gallente transparent whatever the hell it was what is the problem ccp this should be an 18 game anyways
my chars aint shirtless but i still see no reason for ccp to restrict this
those are extreme examples and not at all definitive of what would happen plus giving the option to make changes to your ship hardly turns eve into second life
all itd take is a do not load custom ship skins flag in the optionsthat anyone doing any sort of pvp would obviously turn on
of course its a good idea and i believe ccp is already considering it as an optionsome ideas1 texture shift im pretty sure that this is very simple and would in no way increase lag first off having seen it implemented before i know a simple hue shift can be done where the player adjusts the textures coloration in a positive or negative fashion similar to what youd do changing colors in a paint program this affects one layer on a material that is applied to a model with each material applied being able to receive similar adjustments another shift could be applied to the layer involving lighteningdarkening the texture effectively you are painting your vessel with these color shifts which would then be visible with look at to all other players its just a modifier to the textures which the server then relays to other clients i think lag as a result would be minimal or even unnoticeable2 texture change here the client would have installed multiple variations of textures for each shipfaction given that a lot of the textures in game are wrapped there would have to be a number of optional textures for each ship this is the downside of using uv wrapping of textures where applied textures can be done much more easily this is because each texture applied is common to a great number of ships and so less textures are required to apply to all ships it is still a workable option with 34 variables available and wouldnt require to much storage clientside i think effectively the textures chosen each have an individual id which the server then relays to other clients this is much like the previous idea3 corporate and personal logos these are a little more complicated particularly when you customize them for a simple option a  personal logo could be built in a similar fashion to corporate logo design these would be readily available options with easy application on ships much like corporate logos customized logos would function like alliance logos in that they would have to be submitted ccp would then place the submitted and approved logos serverside and deliver them to all clients as visible logos on vessels using the content delivery service this might result in logos not being immediately visible but slowly appearing on a ships hull regardless of how these nevertheless remain options and could be effectively introduced in game players would be able to select placements of their logos on their ships with 23 options for available placement for each kind optionally alliance logos could be available as well replacing or being in addition to corporate logos players choice all ships flown by the player would either follow a similar arrangement or have to be individually set up at cost the latter is perhaps better as it would allow for individual customization of ships which would mean fewer in game and less potential lag as a result of individual customization also less likelihood that a ship will end up not fitting the design scheme applied to it4 engine trail customization heres an interesting one offerring variable engine trail and exhaust effects it allows the player to give is ship that special look optionally it could lead into actual ship customization and be entirely dependent on engine upgrades various racefaction engine designs leading to variable engine effects as customizable upgrades5 wouldnt it be interesting if we could customize our very own ships making them better than they were initially when we bought them sleeper talocan yan jung and various factionpirate technologies available to fully upgrade and customize our vessels and allow for a little less predictability when engaging various foes in combat no longer would ship balancing be as much of a concern as going up against adversaries with unknown potential its a thought
possibly the best analogy yet liang
really an aggregate score would leave out too much information no youve made some claims about how you think killmails might influence peoples behavior but its pure conjecture and opinion youve offered no actual evidence to support your argument i am addressing both of you at the same time because you are making the same argument and i dont see any point in repeating myself
killmails tell you how the battleships were fit isnt this relevant this argument that hearsay aka reputation aka chest beating is better than killmails as an objective indicator of pvp prowess is pretty funny instead of playing a game of football maybe the packers and the steelers along with their fans should get on nfl forums and beat their chests about who is betterand liang your proposal to give some vague aggregate is very odd you will not get a better understanding if you are provided less data as for killmails not showing when 1v1 isnt honored due to remote reps  just show the remote repper on the killmail problem solved
so you support the removal of killmails and the implementation of battle reports
i think what he means is that ships providing rr should be shown on a killmail say as a involved party with a rr module shown as used with 0 dmg caused so that their presence in an altercation is visibleof course that depends on what you mean by a battle report at its most base level a killmail is a battle report though people generally refer to a collection of killmails taking place at the same place at around the same time as a battle report or you could also mean a manual write up

it would be a small change but it would make their programs much less efficient right now they know they can warp in turn on miners and it will be x seconds before its time to warp back to station and repeatsimply randomize the ice miner cycle time by  30 seconds or so if an example base time is 430 secs just make the module either complete at 400 or 460 at random  and anywhere in between it makes sense from a rp standpoint as not every piece will always take the same time to mine it doesnt hurt regular real miners at all and it makes macros just a bit more inefficient it wont hurt skills as it could be randomized after the players skills take effect
cough the python bots can just check the cycle status directly with the clients own ui code the ocr bots can just see the green ringmacro is a improperly used word to describe eve bots they are far more advanced these days than simple recorded key strokes
thats why im saying to randomize it i guess i wasnt clear enough you cant see the green ring you dont know when its going to complete and wouldnt the random time be server based not client based  so i dont see how the programs could read the code
the server has to send a message to the client of the ships cargohold containing more ice and to stop playing the mining laser effect ocr bots can easily read changes in quantity in the cargohold python bots can just place a hook waiting for the message or just read the quantities of ice in cargohold as well
hello allthis thread is about what youd like to see in the next expansion assuming incarna dust 514 and world of darkness online dont make it in the next patch what would you like the theme of the patch to be and what areas could be most improved in said expansionill get this started by giving my idea  eve online syndication this expansion would be all about corporations not npc corporations or alliances but the actual corporations that form the alliances or work individually it would be themed around three things corporate roles player owned structures and declarations of warcorporate roles would be more free to decide each corporation could set the title for the various roles and assign what permissions to give the individuals you could for instance give the player the ability to add fuel to a pos and gain access to a hangar but not let him install or remove modules or access other hangars for securitythe second topic poses has been outlined in my depots document i realize the idea is far from perfect and some things may not be possible but it would be a drastic improvement over the current state of affairsthe last issue declarations of war would be a tougher issue to mitigate but ive compiled the various ideas posted in this forum and collated them into a new conceptthe first issue would be to declare a reason for this war it could be destroying a pos or doing a certain value of damage to the opponent or even forcing them to leave the system in question the cost of the wardec would be set at around 5 of the objective per week and if the defenders decide to wait it out they would be penalized toothe second issue is a corporate vote to declare the war similar to how it is done now the details of the war would be outlined and the players would have to agree for it to go into effectthe last part is a bidding war between aggressor and defender corporations it starts out at the weekly cost then the defender has 24 hours to counterbid if the defender finally wins the bid the corporation in question cannot declare war on that particular corporation for two weeks or some other reasonable valuethis is just my idea and i know there are many other issues out there that need focused on mining missions lowsec et al i just feel that this is the most important thing that needs fixed in this game id like to hear your opinions on this issue and maybe we can form a consensus on issues to present to ccp
eve online fixation  it would be all about fixing the lag
did someone say my namemy ideal expansion would include the following changesmore space would be added in nullsec lowsec and wormholes but not highsec unless it had to be done in order to add to the formersovereignty would be turned into an influence system ie you can only have high level sov if you actually inhabit that system based on activity poses upgrades and whatnotlocal gets completely nuked in null and lowsec with the addition for sov nullsec of a local transponder that makes the list current but has pretty low hpindustrys ui gets an overhaul making mass production and research easiertier 4 battleships and tech 3 battleshipsisk bounty nerf corresponding rat loot increasehighsec sales tax increased to 25 base npc corp tax rate increased to 16small gang objectives in sov warfarelowsec gets unique resources randomly appearing smugglers gates and pirate ships that are illegal in highsecsome wormholes are added that cannot have poses anchored in them for whatever rp reason ccp decides to cook up i definitely foresee interesting emergent gameplay ie new tactics and styles of play in wormholes dont want to see these wormholes taken from existing wormhole space thoughabandoned pos degradationseriously nuke unused highsec poses and abandoned wormhole poses if the owner hasnt been there in months it shouldnt take such a hideously long time to kill itpos coding reconfiguration and complete makeover needed this for agesmining revamp could post a couple whole threads on how to do this but the gist is involve scanning and exploration and massive andor hidden belts that people have to actually explore in conjunction nerf or boost drone region mineral drops so that they are not suddenly the richest regions in the game unintended consequencesmake mission rats dynamically spawn everyone knows exactly how every mission is supposed to be done this leads to booooring game playboost regular npc aimake the sites spawned by pirate array upgrades random not always the same ones and make the contents dynamicmake site content based off of truesec so that system differences are actually differences and some are better than othersdynamic moon minerals greyscale i hope you read this highend moons never change hands and are rarely fought over despite their value because theyre always in the same spot in addition the average 00 resident never sees a dime of the money they produce because its always alliancecontrolled i have seen some interesting ideas on how moon mining could be spruced upand to hell with the t2 manufacturersnerf supercap hp down to the levels the csm suggested like 45x current carrier health not 60x as isnerf but dont remove jump bridge titan bridge and jumpfreighter rangenerf the dramiel a bitboost hybrids durrrrallow us to reconnect to drones in spacetake a look at killmails theyre still rather buggy and yes killmails are well worth having in the game you filthy carebearhit the drone regions with more incursions i like seeing krutoj squirm as his macro empire grinds to a standstilllook at blackops and electronic attack ships they need a rebalancesnake implant set equivalent for shieldsmoar boosters moarmake customer service gms play the game so they understand what theyre dealing with it would really cut down on the number of petition responses that are completely out of touch with the game such as the extended downtime onlining debacleim just about out of space and ideas off the top of my head butyeah thats what id like to see in an expansionalso buy more jita nodes for fleet fights
supported and i prefere it asap
supportedalso id like to have highlighted only the next gate in my autopilot route not all gates on my route not an issue if you only have one waypoint but multiple waypoints can cause you to have multiple adjacent systems in your stargate route
supported along with the next waypoint only additionwhilst were at it lets actually look at the overview informationicon stargate  ok coolname stargate destination  fair enough though duplication between iconname is annoying  at least switch the description around so it reads destination stargate for the 4 people in the game that dont have icons and names enabled on their overviewstype mumble stargate mumble  yes i get it its a dang stargate i really couldnt care less whether its racial standard stargate stargate racial system stargate racial constellationthe same massive duplication of information applies elsewhere overview space is at a premium i need to know nametype for a bunch of stuff particularly other player ships but id like to not have to see a bunch of entirely irrelevant and superfluous data
reasonable proposaladd a different colour ie green for next gate on route sometimes a route comes back through the same system and one gets multiple yellow gates and a distinction here would be nice too
if you are in a pos without bubbles you log off and you warp off 1mil km from the pos and become vulnerable if they became aggressed they could be in space for up to 15mins except if theres a bubbled pos they stay safe in the pos and just disappear my proposal is that anyone logging off in a bubbled pos stays in space until they die or the bubbles go away
nope when you log off at pos you stay at pos disappear and when you login you appear 1 mil away from pos and warp to it get a clue then make proposals
ops a troll spend some time reading his other proposals and youll see what i mean
im guessing thats an opinion and not really a fact quite right about the stationary logoff though you stay in one place now it didnt used to be that way though and ships just fly off in a random direction
to be able to reduce communications between fleet members and maybe even break up fleets using skills and modules would add an element of uncertainty to any fleet fight it would create innovative new approaches to fleet fights and ehance the experience for new as well as seasoned veteransfor instance a fleet of twenty ships fc 2 wc 2 groups each of five ships encounters a similar fleet the dedicated white noise generators on specialized ships spring into action after ccp calculations and a lot of groans and onos from fleet members suddenly one group from each wing is detached and effectively cut off from fleet including communications this requires either the fc to acknowledge the problem and put them back into fleet structure or the affected fleetmembers to rerganize themselves
so you suggest we add needless micromanagement to the already ed fleet interfacewhykeep in mind that with out of game comms being the standard the effect of any such feature would have marginal impact at best and merely add to frustration with ui in general
you have a point the reason for my proposal however is to have the option to remove some of the features in a fleet fight one important such thing is to assign targets and that would have an impact dont you agree also if a requirement for using projected eccm and all the modules working remotely is that the person is in your fleet it would have a very interesting effect
you mean this ecm module hacks their ventrilomumblets server and brings it down maybe closes their alliancecorp channel so that they cant x up for fleet again
i am open to suggestions the idea is to make the disruption of a fleet an option but if it is like you are implying why do we have a fleet interface to begin withwrong alt when responding  still von stenck
uh huhinteresting idea except that no one uses eve voice that being said if youd like to disrupt 3rd party communicationshave fun in jail as im sure thats a violation of several different us federal and international laws you want to assign targets how about your fc calling primary and secondary targets ive gone through entire fleet battles without ever actually being in the fleet just on ts ewar is already ridiculously overpowered not supported move on
not supported as suchfirstly everyone will try to avoid eve voice even moresecondly a fleet structure is not a thing but an immaterial organisation each ship itself exists as a material object in space but their organization in hierarchies exists only in the pilots heads you cannot disrupt an idea as suchhowever the fleet feature adds an extra to it which could get targeted a gang link to counter an enemies gang link would be interesting to see a fleet would have to give up some of their own fleet bonuses for the ability to reduce an enemies fleet bonuses by fitting a gang link disruptor or whatever you want to call it you could try to broadcast pron pics onto each players screen and it would disrupt quite well the organization of a fleet but it would really be just trolling
what id like to see is way besides bugs  to jam command structure leadership and ganglinks
i support this
support lol
blood for the bloodgods
yes
a while ago i heard an awesome rumor that incursions would turn off concord what ever happened to that
it wont work because it doesnt go far enoughthe objective should be to stop the lameness that is the rr heavy gang that can jump into a certain death situation gank a few targets and tank until they can jump out  something simply copying the timer will not do
people keep using the petition system to report bugs why not add bug report to the help screen
because that would make sense silly we cant have that hereps fix lag
im hoping this is already on ccps list for the ui upgradeswhy stop at screen capture an option for 30 second or whatever client screen capture will show more for the bh and be easier to show reproduction steps
i think we should be able to advertise on the billboards i mean with lots of isk and a high standings with corp or alliances like you can do on eon magtell me what your think
just see how many disagreement this post will get youll have an idea how many ppl are botting and prefer ccp doing nothing about itas you mentioned more botting will increase plex price that is true it will also benefit ccp a lot in selling more plexes so although i support your idea or anyother idea against botting i really dont think ccp will do anything about ithowever to give you some hope there will be some ballance at the end when therere enough botting ppl in game raw material price drop a lot and plex becoming super expensive therell be a point botting no longer cover the price of plex maybe 3 times more botter lol so i wish that day come soon standing on the position of ccp everything becomes very simple to understand only goal is to minmize costfixing unnecessary stuff and maxmize profitselling more plex
presuming they do it right i might agree with you there the problem i see with this is players hate drm why it messes up your computer makes logging in a pain randomly kicks you from game and a multitude of other problems why else because the hackers and botters still log in every day and seem to have less problems than anyone else why is that because normal players dont know what theyre up against so they cant prevent their pcs from setting off warning signals for the drm they get kicked because their pc uses specific software unrelated which requires little bits of script or other things that the drm recognizes as hacking or botting andor macroing the botter hacker macro guygirl knows exactly what will set off the drm and makes sure it isnt on his computer some of them also use hacked clients where the drm has been removed and some even use hacks and bots so advanced that the drm doesnt recognize themjust play battlefield bad company 2 or half a dozen other fps games if you think drmpunkbuster or like security programs are really working when an enemy teleports into your footsteps and kills you youll know how well it really works given they can do that or even when you get shot through a hillside or other heavy obstruction fact is most people banned for hacking on those severs are banned because someone spotted them and reported them it doesnt work programs just get more advanced and workarounds are found for everything you do to put a stop to them
lol the siren totally freaked me out the first time i heard them cause i remembered silent hill loland no dont remove them i love them just drop your world volume or wathever siren is afected to
heh i do not agree to remove those sirens but change them in to a klaxon sound could be cool because we are in the future arent we
heres the idea rather than have a 24hr timer between jumps impose a 24hr timer on the clone you jumped fromexample youre in system a and you have jcs in system b and system c you jump from a to b the clone left in system a has a 24hr reuse timer you cant jump back into the clone in system a for 24hrs you then jump to the clone in system c the clone in system b has a 24hr reuse timer etcit would allow more jumps yes thats the point but you can only have as many jumps as you have clones and you cant jump into clone you left in the same 24hr periodwould this be more handy is it gamebreaking what do you think
the time is approaching to the csmobile
thanks for the swift reply csm people
just to clarify this agenda item is not a formal proposal of the same kind you see in assembly hall i would characterize it more as an administrative vote to recommend an official csm stance on the matter to ccp what ccp does is up to them they run the show when it comes to policies that control who can and cant run for csm since opinions are being aired here i will share mine i respect dv and can agree with the ideology that moved him to call for this vote which is a strong desire to avoid potential damage to csm credibility by preventing previous ndabreakers back on the council however i will vote against the measure ccp have made their decision about lark i cannot support asking them to do an aboutface on the matter it is too late to impose such a policy for csm6 candidacy besides i believe that lark has paid his penance sincerely regrets what he did will not repeat the mistake and has a lot to offer in the way of game expertise and an ability to express his views intelligently all of those qualities would serve csm6 well if he were to be elected sure you could speculate that he is masterfully trolling us about his remorse and has every intention of letting his inner bad boy out again if elected but i prefer to give him the benefit of the doubt based on many conversations weve had about it over the last year or so without the ability to do a vulcan mindmeld all i can do is make a personal decision about him based on the information i have to work withand before you ask me if i would support ankh being allowed to run again the answer is nofor reasons i am not permitted to and wont discussanyway if the item remains on the agenda for a vote i will reiterate in the meeting my position as stated here im sure there will be a lively debate and it will all be the raw logs for your reading pleasure
reading this i am very impressed with you diplomatical and political skillsnot only do you manage to defend the proposal to the vote while looking like not supporting ityou also manage to sneak the option of lark being a possible liar and thus increasing the chance people will think he will do the same again while skillfully making him look like a repentfull person and you the good person with the big heartheck in the beginning you even very slightly planted the seed that not you but dv is the one who wants the personal agenda rolled you do understand where he is comming from but youre too bighearted and understanding of ccps course to support himmy big wonder however will remain would you have reacted to this all the same if this hadnt gotten some intelligent responces in a negative way back or notsadly we will never know anymoreyou skillfully pull a 180 whereever possible without looking like someone covering his own butt for the new electionsmight be the paranoia i build up over the years of eve or might be i am just a tad more skillfull in reading between the lines heck it even might be my own experiences as diplomath which grew my feelers for such cunning wordplaysnow the sole question remaining for me to decide ismynxee skilled diplomath orthis is a personal question to be answered by me personal this ofcourse in no way reflects the mindset of my corporation alliance or other people i encounter or play with in the game
killer people who know me know im an open book what i say is exactly what i am thinking and feeling if my efforts to try and see both sides of the question appear to you to be cleverly executed 180s theres nothing i can do or care to do about that but tbh im really not that clever i am certainly not maneuvering regarding the next election because im not running my interest in eve is at an alltime low for a variety of reasonssome ccp and some personal mainly eve cant compete with rl these days so i have no ulterior motives or agenda here just expressing my views in public on a matter that obviously has people in a bit of a swivet
yeah if there is one thing that would improve wow itd be suicide gankingback in the day i was looking at both eve and wow as a potential mmo to play and the reason i chose eve is that i can shoot anything i want wherever i want whenever i wantjust look at pugs pick up groups in wow if a bunch of pubbies are incompetent you can whine on chat for an hour or so with your impotent elven rage in eve if the pubbies are incompetent then they all die in an incursion and you can scoop their loot in a noobship
with the recent discussion about jumpbridges titanbridges etc it seems to me that both ccp and the csm are in favour of making new eden feel largerin a similar vain i dreamed up a set of changes to jump clones on which id like to hear some playercsm feedback1 players can change bodies as often as they like or possibly introduce a skill that allows for body changes more often than once a day2 players need to be in the same station as their clone to change bodies3 allow more than one jump clone to be stored in a station4 remote destruction of jump clones not sure if this is possible atm5 possibly increase the max amount of jump clones from five to 6 change the name into something more fitting like spare body or somethingconsequences of the changespvp gets easier to get into because players can change into their combat clone for a roam and back again at the end of their sessionjump clones cant be moved after their creation which opens up gameplay choices i spread out clones or a central location ii which npc corp offers the best jumpclone locations  has viable stations dispersed throughout empireplayers need to travel instead of clonejumping to the other end of the mapi think the consequences of these changes would be overall positive for the game with the 3rd being the only which could also be seen as a conso what didnt i think of
i dislike half of what you said but you do have some intresting ideasi would like to jump more than once a day 
i support this would be a great change ccp just do it

not game breaking in anyway and it simply makes sense
yeah it is a joke which is why if jump bridges were to stay and be able to be used by everyone an alliance has blue the cost per day should be the number of pilots in said nap train times some number right now the cost of jump bridges are an utter and complete joke to runor better yetremove all forms of bridging except black ops covert jump bridge
you know part of making eve bigger could be to give stargates mass per hour limits this would work inversely to your strawman here but it would certainly make fleet ops interesting
burn all the jump bridges or make the price so astronomical that more than 2 or 3 become a massive burden to run for even the largest most wealthy alliances add on to this that only the alliance that anchors the bridge can use it and increase the bridge fuel requirements by a huge margin to make them soley used for logistics and not for moving large fleets
allow me to quote myselfif you come up with a solid argument to counter that i will offer a full and utter retraction otherwise im just gonna let the facts do the talking
giving my support to this bots have been making it difficult to mine effectively at all and theres just no way to compete with them on the market unless youre watching it like a hawk 237this needs to stop
macrosbots are the cancer of eve that is present everywhere in increasing numbers this issue needs to be addressed head on by the development team we can only hope that csm can make them do more than making empty promises in a blog
even if ccp implemented the code in total secrecy the macro programs will simply be updated to better get around the new change in the eve client example mining 127 instead of 237 once someone has realized the change as some of the knowledgeable people can tell you macros can be for more intelligent than one can realizethats the only example i can give you as i dont want to give macro developers any ideasno matter how you look at it it will ultimately be left up to the players do deal with the individual mocros in this front while ccp combats rmt on another front since the players are the ones that are way better at spotting individual macros than ccp is
1 most of the bots are ocr based meaning they dont inject any code all they do is take repeated screenshots of the current frame and parse it also they have standardized ui layouts so the bots already know where everything is it also takes all of five seconds to change the checksums of a program via automatic exe padding to foil any silly program checks2 the python based bots are very few and limited ccp has actually caught a fewdid you know ccp can remotely upload and execute code on selected users d however its near impossible to stop such code from being injected attempts because of how eve is compiled w python see unreal engine 225 3 being hacked the same way via unreal script directly with no way for punkbuster to stop it all one main issue is that any code to weed out injected code can simply be overwritten in memory by higher level injected codeessentially bots are here to stay ccp needs to however make it a lot more difficult for them to function i guarantee you that if after one patch the ui keeps resetting to defaults for everyone after each launch of the client that the mineral market will suddenly sky rocket in prices

games ruined by botsrunescape  ok this wasnt an amazing game but it had a lot of good things going for it the kill rmt update killed in game trade as well as pvpsilk road game was hack central i would reccomend never downloading it as 3rd parties could do crazy things such as change your player shop priceseve online sadly its coming true market prices fall bot alliances have funds to fight off any legitimate alliance out thereany random player can download a mining bot and in in a 9 all day and make a few mil with no fear unless he sells to an isk selling site
if ccp actually did this then all accounts currently botting 237 would be immediately banned as is being taken off the field permanently unable to enter new and improved botsand once you realize the magnitude of said change you realize you just cut botting time in half  not bad for 5 minutes work ehthe overwhelming factor which gives botters away is greed simply put they bot too much to be human and they kinda have to thats the catch otherwise whats the point in doing so thats their primary achilles heeleven if botters were to adapt as im sure they will thats still minus all banned botters and their ip addresses who currently bot 237 leaving the rest to mine only 127 also highly suspicious thats quite a reduction
 ranka  well just have to see but i still firmly stand by my belief that a good year or two of constant ganking on suspected macros is the most effective means of containing the macro infestation changing codes will do little to combat the situation
one last bump
just to be clear adding a height slider will change nothing about the game at all even your portrait will look exactly the same with no discernible difference between short or tall character pictures this is a complete waste of time if ever there was one1 supported
agreed on saying no theres no upside to thisin hisec you allow people to circumvent unprobable ships for ninja looting and ganking even if its just used for abandoned mission fields youll increase salvage supply and depress pricesin lowsec you have just finally killed level 5s you also make scanning small ships like frigs triviali dont think it would add anything to null eitheras for nothing should be unprobable i dont see anyone here extending that to cloaked ships i think having to train for a t3 cruiser and gear it to do so is a pretty steep cost for limited utility
thats because while cloaked you cant do anything being unprobable skews the riskreward ration by a huge amount all the way to 0 in fact assuming a proper fit you can run level 5s in lowsec all day long without any fear of being ganked
seems like you support the proposal  please click agree button if you do
its not an ulterior motive for me i want wrecks to be probeable for salvaging i dont care if they are only probeable after the mission has been finished i would definitely consider picking up salvaging as a profession if this was implementing removing unprobeable ships is just a good side effect imobut seriously i havent read a decent argument as to why level 4s and level 5s should be able to be run in lownull with zero risk regardless of what fit you are using
probing a wreck should only be possible after mission is completed orwreck has been in space for more then 30 minutes  1 hour in highsec and lowsecthis meansnullsec battles and missions can be salvaged maybelowsec missions can be salvagedhighsec missions can be salvagedall by a third party that was not in fleet and did not scan the original ship down it would be a profession that isnt lolninjanubit would be like a junker maybe one who follows nullsec blobs in a cloaked ship to take the loot from a roam or salvage a large cap battle
the problem is that probing skews the risk ratio so far the other way that its not worth doing any mission in lowsec otherwise so its a choice between content getting done or content getting ignoredyou are not going to get people to increase risk by making their ships probable you just are going to send them back to hisec why should being able to salvage battleship class rats have no risk at all everyone is talking about mission runner risk but mission salvaging ninja or not has so very little risk its not even funnyyou dont need to scan wrecks down in hisec find a busy system with miners and salvage the wrecks they leave or get some stones and head out to a lowsec system to salvage the aftermath of militia battlesincreasing the ability to probe down mission salvage is just boosting the payout of salvagers while making it have zero risk you dont even need to worry about rats salvaging is tuned as a beginning lowsp profession the changes to probing made it insanely lucrative with zero risk and changing it even more in that way is being hypocritical especially when claiming riskreward otherwise
the issue here is not that they are trying to do whatever against the mission runner the issue here is that there is a large portion of mission runners that complete the mission turn it in and move on without ever looting and salvaging lag would be reduced if in these situations if players could probe out the wrecks and clean them upalso it does not really makes sense that you can probe out a battleship but not a battleship wreck because it would still be large
every pve high sec profession is riskfree if you know what you are doing including mission running if you want the benefits lownull provides over high sec then you need to accept the risk involvedsalvaging high sec belt rats would of course probably be the lowest paying profession in eve which is why i used to probe down mission runners back when i was in high sec the advantage of being able to probe down wrecks in high sec is to clean up the system of abandoned wrecks
because clean full plexes in caps and super caps is not risk freeare you going to start with the same stupid arguments that high sec is risk free and profit are you kidding or just stupidyou know whow mutch you can do al allone with one cap in a single plex do you ever learn maths or even donne them to come out here saying all that crapwhere is your risk when you salvage what risk do you ever take anyway you dont bring any value or reasonable argument to your opinion the only thing you are able to throw out is mission runnes  risk free you dont have a clue of what you are talking about or just trying to convince noobspeople like you have already done a good job with los sec genocide of carebeers you whant to contiue your game must be so fun
id support probeable wrecks when they have been abandoned otherwise abandoning mission wrecks would be wastedprobing wrecks which are not abandoned i dont support ninja salvager shall work for their benefits
first calm down your sudden surge of insults and typos show me you need to relax a bitive never flown caps or known anyone who has so i cant really comment on that part however doing pve in caps means you are in nulllow sec and have the ability to be attacked at anytime with no provocation so it is more riskier than doing pve in high secas for high sec pve assuming you know what you are doingmining is risk free fit a shield booster and bring drones or mine in systems where rats dont spawnmission running is risk free once youve run a mission once you should never have a problem with it again you also have the option to avoid missions you know are very difficult ive lost only one battleship running level 4s in high sec and it was when i first started and did not have enough spexperience to run themninja salvaging is also risk free you have no clue what mission you will be salvaging but the mission runner is usually taking full aggronow if you want the extra lp and rewards given by missions set in lownull then you need to be willing to accept the higher risk involved it has nothing to do with removing carebears from low sec besides bringing a ton of unprobeable carebears into low sec is about as helpful as having none there at all
cheers lads keep it posting
definitely in support of this idea
i am in complete favor of banning autonomous clients bots signedhowever there are some things that are techincally macros for example the programable keys on most gaming mice that allow you to press multiple keys at once for example a one click activation of your tank eg mouse 1 f1f2f3f4 and i am willing to bet many of the serious pvp players use these regularly and arent even aware that they are technically tos violationsso i am actually in favor of simple utility binds and macros that are not game altering especially since ccp refuses to fix the market system to allow the sale of multiple itemsin short no bots yes for basic hotkey binds
10000
the main problem i can see is that it would generate a wonderful set of information for gankers this is a good and bad thing for miners that are in less populated systems it could cause more miners to show up there and for the more populated systems it would draw more gankers until the miner pop drops or slows a bit dont get my wrong the information would be valuable for mining ops but for solo miners it can be a killer that causes you to move i actually like the several systems i mine in that have low minier pop and it would suck to have to share them with more miners

seriously i cannot support the reasoning behind this change whatsoever its stupid if we want to be shirtless let us be shirtless id also support not requiring pants shoes or jackets but its clear that theyre never going to budge on that

you should give more details about certain issues within the game that is hard for those visually impaired i know what it means but lets face it there is a crap ton of kids playing at least that is their mentality and they probably wont know what you are on about unless you explain it a bit more
UFFFD ui contrast mode all text is colored sharpwhite not gray or light gray but white that means for those of you who are nerdy 255 255 255 in rgball fading or gradient effects removed in this mode this should cause all fading to make the ui flat  just like when you talk about a flat black vs a glossy blackUFFFD font type selection i now how hesitant developers are to change something theyve created into a certain mold because i am one but honestly there needs to be a choice of at least 2 other alternative fonts im guessing the reason ccp chose the font they have chosen is because of the caps that are used in their menus etc they also most likely chose it because it is one of the only fonts that will not break or alias badly when in a small size having said this there needs to be support for a least one other font that only renders in a larger size maybe so that the eye can cope with the small sized fontsUFFFD 800 x 600 resolution support i know youre saying what let me explain on every pc i have installed eve 800 x 600 is very difficult to confgiure on my xp machine i had to put the client into windowed mode first before the 800 x 600 resolution even showed up my mac simply does not have 800 x 600 for an option in the client if this is a problem to code or whatknot i think there should be a zoom mode that uses a high resolution and then emulates 800 x 600 in that high resolution in other words you would scale it so that the 1024 x 768 would actually render as 800 x 600 this would be a tick box in the graphics settingseverything i have listed above is completely doable these accommodations are reasonable because im also taking into account the time and effort to pull something like this offis there something i should be more specific about not saracsticcontributionsUFFFD textual representation fixes
eve is famous for inducing eye strain even for those that do not have any visual disability i can imagine the pure frustration of anyone with failing eye sight trying to play eve
i think you cover it sounds good to me
bigger text
supported also have you thought of adding bigger buttons to control the windows pin minimize exit my eyesight is not great and the text gives me a hard time but my worst problem is accidentally clicking exit instead of minimize because my mouse is 14x bigger than the buttons
no excuse for not supporting visually impaired players get your  together ccp
its interesting as i was mulling this over since eve is played by young and old alike you would think ccp would want their old players to keep coming back you would also think that they would want their young players who will inevitably become old in the game and real life to be able to actually play so they can pay and be a returning customer this even works out from the business standpoint big lol why nip this in the bud right now
i have challenged eye sight but luckily it doesnt effect my ability to read text close up yet
supportedanother issue is with increasing monitor sizes the interface and font is tiny at the high native resolutions of newer monitors there is no interface scaling at all running at below native resolution introduce display problems and blur i dont think its fair to those of us that use decent computers instead of decade old laptops
incursions should not just disappear after a week if left undone they should spread to nearby constellations incursions need to be persistent and carry consequence when ignored the entirety of mother russia must be basked in sanshas green glow sov null have been breastfeed in their comfort zone for far too long we must bring the involuntary pve to them whenever you undock in eve you subject yourself to pve make it so that moongoo stop producing during incursions too
i like this it means that leaving things unchecked could become a major problem for the risk averse carebares in nulland of course the non risk averse will take their fleets kill the sansha and then return to what they were doing
i would honestly think that the major problem with this is that in low sec if an incursion began it would run rampant in the system since no one would clear it and it would just spread to all of low sec eventually making low sec a giant incursionon second thought supported
no incursions would become a chore for nullsec allianceslow sec incursions will never be done so the lowsec ones will be there forever and spread until all low is covered
exactly
russian incursion is down 1 someones doing it
global cynojam for all of lowsec sign me up
title says it all really i have enough channels up as it is its extremely irritating having the incursion channel popping up every time i enter a constellation with an ongoing incursion im not saying remove it im saying make it like constellation chat where you can close it once and be done with it
supporting my own post
incursions are supposed to be annoying not supported and give us back highsec sansha gatecamps too
you do realize it was a game bugglitch righti mean your discussing and debating a nonexsistant mechanicunless ccp discovered how to troll gasp
i hardly ever post on the forums but this is something which should get some attentionat the current time its virtually impossible to have certain roles for certain pos up to a higher levelmeaning that you have to grant roles which you dont want permanently added to some corp members in order to give them more options at buildingsame applies for the ueage of research if people want to use a corp pos for research they have 2 optionsa fly to the pos with the bpo and put it in the lab to research it  this is a not very good idea b use a corphangar to put the bpo in and research it remotely from there  this also puts the very expensive bpos at risk from thieves that might sneak into a corpthere is no c which would allow you as a member of the corp to selevt your own hangar as where to research frombuilding is also kinda off worst case scenario you have certain people building high valued items and someone who has nothing to do with those builds but whos peed off and has the role to access those builds can virtually mess you up by cancelling the builds close before they endas a corp you havent got the option to set access and roles to that regard to only certain pos which is an oversight in my opinionclearly there should be the option to tweak a role to be granted to only a certain pos or several pos but not to allthis would allow more diversity in the useage or pos without limiting a lot of people or increasing the risks for a corporationcertainly with the current infiltration chances of a corporation the options to increase certain securities should be upped tooyour opinions on this pleasekind regardsandrea
i think this is intended feature to give a possibility to steal bpos and other stuff
poses dont need tweaking they need a complete overhaul from the ground up this issue is just one of the many issues ive tried to fix in my depots documentneither supported or not supported  this issue is just fixing a symptom while the disease rages on
just as there has to be the possibility to steal them an owner should have more than the crude basic options to protect them
no not supportedkillmails are a viable way for us to tell how many people were there what they were in and how they didif you cant take your failure being on an open board for people to see get a private board or stop dyingedit what game do you play that people are scared of a loss showing up on a killboard i cant think of any alliance in 00 that cares about losing ships on the kbnone of the russians seem to careit sure doesnt care they welp super caps almost as fast as we donc doesnt care goons will welp a fleet in a heart beat and regularly have slosh ops just to do that and nc proper dies en mass on fleet op almost every other dayand well our kb is open posting so anybody can make fun of anybody elses fit even if your not in the allianceso where are all these people shying away from pvp because of kill mailsor is it just you and your friends who dont want people laughing at their losses
hi plwell they arent really accurate enough for most of thatfailureeve onlineive had one smack talk me for an hour after killing his probe bellicoseim almost certain the op isnt making any assertion like that
a battle report system would be a summary of an entire engagement regardless of the end result think of it as a verbose dialog driven translation of the combat log it wouldnt have fitting information but it would be a more accurate method of gauging a conflict
theyre usually the asshats in elite pvp alliances liang
i thought those were the killmail syou do realize that it is impossible to get on a killmail without taking some risk of losing a ship right no matter how good or blobby or ganky they might be everyone gets killed once in a while if they are going into pvp situations there is always going to be someone out there who is better than you or has more friends than you or is just plain luckier than you
not supportedstupid idea if killmails are causing you and yours a problem then heres a clue for you its your problem fix your own corp and its anal attitude to efficiencyothran has his api linked to battleclinic so every single killloss no matter how embarrassing goes there whats the problem everyone screws up from time to timethis really is the dumbest idea ive seen in a very very long time congratulations on the levels of stupidity displayed it really is exceptional
from the op
you didnt read anything beyond the title of the thread like i said people will do whatever it takes to avoid losses so they bring whatever they need to guarantee a win at no point did i talk about people who dont post loss mails because usually those get posted anyway by the killmail  that killed them
people will opt for the easiest solution to any problem wouldnt that solution be just not pvping 
they cant be on killmails if they dont actually pvp
people blob because the use of overwhelming force is the single most successful tactic ever devised every other tactic ever dreamed up has been because you didnt have superior forces to use against your enemy and generally involve dividing your opponents force in some manner in which the result is that you have overwhelming force arrayed against that subsection of the enemies force fair fights are for organized sports in any other situation the goal is to crush your enemy as quickly as possible while sustaining minimal damage to yourself this is why large predators do not normally pick fights with each other because any time a predator engages an equal in battle there is a chance of serious injury which can threaten its survival thats why except in the case of extreme desperation predators tend to go after the weak and injured because a health wildebeast is liable kick your teeth in preventing you from being able to eat resulting in your starving its the nature of life human beings are no different we dont form social organizations and cooperative societies through some thought out rationalized concept of enlightened self interest we do it because its a successful and those humans who embraced it are the ones who thrived an survived passing the social mutations empathy love caring tribalism from generation to generationwe band together and hunt down and eliminate lone predators including criminals for exactly that same evolutionary reason because a rogue hunter that is a threat to one member of society is a threat to all the members of that societythats why the existence or nonexistence of killmails has no effect on how people play the game from a combat perspective the only time you are going to see human beings engage in fair competition is when weve structured rule bound contests ergo sports anywhere that doesnt have rules to specifically enforce fair competition we are going to revert to norm and take what ever advantage we can find in any given situationall the whining about blobbing or naping or carebearing or any other of the favorite subjects of the ebushido crowd ignore this reality people who want fair even fights play team fortress or some other structured combat simulator part of the draw of eve in the first place is that its structured more like rl combat obviously not in the mechanical sense since immortal spaceship pilots arent a part of our reality but in the way combat is done most of the actions that affect the outcome of an encounter are done outside the actual moment of combat from scouting to ship fittings to logistics these things matter in this game where they dont in more structured competitive environmentsthe killmail system does not in any way shape or form affect any aspect of combat in this game other than to provide documentation of battles and their outcomes and to provide limited intelligence on the forces used by each side in the engagementin the end they are a useful tool to those who use them properly but they are not a major factor in determining behavior
hello and good day to youive heard its because everyone knows i make the best damn vanilla ice cream shakes in all of new edenand for your proposal i disagree kill mails are a good thing its one of the few ways to rate a pilot the only thing is there should be an officially sanctioned killboard available in game to prevent padding or other types of false kill mailshave a nice day menod penter  mayor of rens

no you do not understand the latest bots do not use the client any longer they simulate the client connection so whenever the ice arrives it arrives and then they send the commands back to move it into an orca with screen recognition do you simply check the cargo load bar if it fills it fillsdo you want to change the game so that players cannot see anything and have to guess if anything happenedpoint is what a human can do with bitsbytes can a computer do too they even play better chess than any human these daysalso please have your ideas discussed in the features and ideas forum before you create a proposal this is not an alternative forum to it but the second stage have you ideas discussed first see what could be wrong and what could be improved before you take it to the assembly hall
1 do you know that there is a autorepeat function in gamethe bot will check the ice in the cargohold and shift it when needed 2 those signals are for the player convenience your changes would annoy players without affecting the macrobots
as long as you can just warp to belt and theres automatically rocks you can mine plus mining is so stupid that you need to mine into a can and constantly activate your mining laser for no other obvious reason than just activating it there will be bots
as far as i know only proven bot prevention mechanic is the captcha system even that can only go so farproblem is the mechanic itself and how grindy it is mining needs more interaction rather then simply watching the paint dry obviously a mining overhaul is required but you wont be able to convince ccp to thatunless they add captchas theres no way they can prevent bots they can however get a team and aggressively ban any and all bots they see so the threat of banning will convince your average joe that botting is dangerousthere are entire alliances that are accused of botting every knows they do it everyone buy ccp unless ccp acts i see only more bots in our future
captchas are completely useless now i had a forum i run recently be overrun with 200 spammer registrations per day until i implemented some hilarious autobanning for entering a country name in the wrong fieldthe bots were half dumb there was recaptcha used and it didnt even make a dent want to know why there are services that bot programs now use and the bots simply take a screenshot and send it off to the service within 10 seconds they get a response with the recaptcha answer want to know how the service gets the answer they farmoutsource the work to third world country areas where they pay like 10 cents for every 1000 answeredthis is just dumb they dont simulate the client connection otherwise a single error in their packets would result in ccp banning them as thats how sensitive the protocols are they just abuse the client in more intelligent ways ie python bots interface with eve in memory at the core level having full access to all the game functions and data while ocr bots just replicate normal keymouse input
as a gallente player drones are one of my primary forms of dps however drone behavior can be very erratic a few times drones have aggroed large groups of ships in pve combat im also not sure what there ai priorities are but when left to there own devices they tend to spread themselves out among several targets rather than going in an order that seems more suitable such as targeting heavy dps or electronic warfare targets by simple adding a few more options or an ability to tweak the ai priorities to follow a specified order would allow drones to be better customized for the individual user tactics or roles this extends to logistics drones as well such as having them set to repairheal targets based on  of shieldsarmor remaining i would also like to propose another option available to drones like the ability to target incoming missilesbombs in a defensive capabilityany constructive thoughts and opinions would be greatly appreciated on this fly safe
under control in the escape menu there are two shortcuts you may want to look atone control of note is drone focus it toggles whether all drones focus on one target or allowed to spread to several i guess the spread has only been put in to help people get on more killmails easier five drones on five different targets  five free mails anyway this solves the spread part of your postsecond is the passiveactive drone setting setting it to passive means that drone ai is effectively disabled drones will not do anything until you tell them to attack the specified locked target once it is dead they come back instead of engaging another this is near essential for missions since it will ensure that drones will not aggro what they arent supposed tonow you may say that turning off drone ai is not a good idea you want your drones to act on their own according to your prioritiesordertactics i will admit that it can get annoying to send them after every damn frigate in the mission as they pop there is a shortcut for drone engage which makes it bearable but i will still not support having extensive drone optionsreason is simple serverside laglag is not an issue during missions now imagine a fleet of 250 jumping into a system with 250 others waiting on the other side node is already choking while trying to load the gate grid and this is without having 250  5 drone objects sending it messages saying that they now decided to change their target due to some criteria i want every tick of the server cpu to be dedicated to loading grid updating the overview and processing gunsmovementwarp commands instead of those damn drones believe me there are few things in eve as frustrating as sitting for 40 minutes with a black screen and then loading back in station in a new pod
on drone settings there is a check box called focus fire when you click this the drones will not spread out as much and all move as a single swarmbut on a side note to fixing drone ai considering the fact that drones have their own targeting systems as well as being able to pick their own targets when left alone there is no reasion why you need to have a lock when you want to designate a target for the dronesso it isnt just ai the entire drone controll and inteface needs to be redone
ah thank you arx and corian i was unaware of those options 
id be happy already if drones did what i told them to do ie if they didnt change their mind half way through
it is inevitable that a courier will sometimes get ganked and have to pay out a collateral to the contractor my proposal will cut down on trap contract eg contracts where the person who posted the contract conspires to kill the freighter carrying his own equiptment the new rule is a simple fault detection system if the couriers ship is destroyed by any character on the contractors account this includes other accounts registered on the same credit card any member of the contractors corperation or any member of the contractors alliance the contractor will forfit all fees and items and concord will transfer both the collateral and the contract reward to the courier as reimbursement for a criminal actit is basicly the same as torching someones car and than trying to sue them when you burn your hands noone would get compensated for losses that they were directly responsable for
welcome to the sandboxso much did you lose
to be honest i fly a crane and have never lost a currior i just saw a exploit and wanted to have somthing implimented iactually make a habbit of ripping off obvious trap contracts  dont get me wrong piracy is a crucial part of the game and you are free to kill random indys this is just to take care of the dUFFFDshs that intentionally kill their curriors in high sec after all a courier cannot see the package contents and therefore can not know wether or not the 500mil is a officer module or a few tritanium stacked to be about the same size as onein a sense it is the same as the bounty exploit where you jump in a implant free clone and use your alt to pod yourself
how is it a exploit to kill the courier what if he called me a name and he coincidentally was carrying the package at the same time as when he ticked me offi honestly do not see the justification in fixing this one can see the contents of the contract once expected and one can take counter measures if one indeed feels it is fishy such as waiting a few hours to run it another option is using alts to accept contracts and contracting packages to the hauler to deliver and then contracting it back to the alt to complete the contractyou can also make it backfire hilariously on the gankers by using alts to create an identical route courier package and putting in a mix of items that look like the real packagethe same quantities if lol cheap or just one of each or something and moving that package first assuming it was a industrial sized package as to not lose much isk on them p
supported either this or make npc fill courier contracts after a while legit contracts anywhere outside of highsec arent getting filled especially if it pays well i dont see why broken mechanics should remain unfixed purely to benefit a small group of scammers if you want to appease them give them some free kms or isk or something why do the rest of us have to play a broken game for their sake
aessors the problem is that there is zero risk the gank contractor can set whatever price he likes often with them being low enough to be a pittance to losethe way to cut down on this is to force the reward to be a much higher percentage base of collateral and make fees reflect collateral if you put 100 million as collateral you should stand to lose at least 10 million if the contract is successful fees also should increase to discourage superhigh collateral accounts if you are asking a billion isk collateral you should be paying a chunk of that just to set the order upthis also is good for general quality of life i can make far more money just shuttling npc goods from station to station with less risk than accepting any public contracttrying to make lowsec and null contracts doable would just be impossible though if you want them to happen you need as an alliance to blue any neut industrial and even then pirates would be a pain
your reasoning is far better than the ops and the solution much better
perhaps a reversal of the mechaniccollateral is only paid out if the contract fails not when its paid up frontthe only difference here is the pilot is given motivation to succeed as opposed to being keen not to take it upmentality wisei hate the damn things simply because the stupid collateral is insanely overkill and ridiculously stupidas a result my freighters get tons of dust on themid be more likely to run those shipments if i didnt need to worry about footing the bill upfront for a measly few hundred k isk with 1 bil collateral f you people seriously for a few jumpsas for the exploitation mechanic its not as bad as it soundskeep in mind while you have the contract they have to track your location you could easily mask your position in any number of ways grab the box when owners on but log off until hes goneget scouts to help etcmany tactics a fix is unnecessary in this case but reversing the system in such a way where you have better odds of success and less at being ganked out of a ton of money i can deal with thatps quick question perhaps suggestion can the package be passed from hand to hand to handthe collateral remains in the hands of the contract holder but no one said the package had to stay in the same owners hands would add a whole new plethora of piracy and theft to the game but at the same time it would neatly dodge the gank exploit mechanic as welli mean its no different than a pve objective item right item can be sold traded and all you have to do is have it on hand to complete the contract much like a mission amirite
not supportedif you take a courier mission you have to be ready for the consequences like getting shot
exactly and so no one take those risks your courier contracts for anything outside highsec wont get filled if payment is too low if payment is high they think its a scam your nonhighsec courier contracts dont get filled period its like how yerrpirates want more ganking pve fit carebears in lowsec by making it easier this is a mmo not sigleplayer you dont get players to act like rats all you end up is abandoned aspects of game
it happens you just need to be prepared for it or start to outsmart them like accept the contract with an alt and have another character transport the contract
the problem is why bother it doesnt actually hurt the people wanting to run courier contracts theres lots of other more profitable things to do it hurts people who wants things moved
as a highvolume shipper i cant support any of the suggested changes in this thread some of them will actually hurt the public shipping industrynot supported
i support this not because i think eve shouldnt be a harsh world or because im a carebear who wants risk to be lowered or anything of the sort i would like to see this because as it stands now using courier contracts for the purpose that its used for is more of an exploit than a scam bar a few cases like delivering out to 00 to stations that you cant dock at those are reasonable scams courier contracts just like everything else in a game need to have a legitimate use and function and as they are now they dont
against this proposal is silly
its not exactly hard to scout accept the courier on a disposable alt and trade package to the hauler or simply not accept couriers to areas you arent familiar withnot supported
for people worried about gankbait contractsfind highpaying courier contracts in high secaccept with your mainhaul the package with an npc corp altprofitalso as ive issued nearly 2500 courier contracts over the last year with only a single failure i tend to disagree with claims that these have no legitimate usefor people complaining about low payouts  remember who your competitors arered frog freight who accept any highsec contract up to 1bn isk collateral and 860k m3 in return for a fee of 500k  350k per jumppeople who are making the journey anyway who happen to have spare capacity and will accept any contract no matter how small the payout especially for small loads moved between the major hubsfinally for the doubters i know of at least one corp specialising in lowsec logistics  it can be done but of course it requires more effort than highsec afk haulingpretty much every purported issue raised by anyone in this thread is baseless and dont even get me started on some of the proposed fixes
you missed the entire thread go read it
i would like to see an ingame calendar that corp and alliance leaders and post events to just like the calendar in evegate make them link together as well i know you can already access evegate through the in game browser but make the calendar an icon that can be clicked on the neocom there is a calculator notepad and even a music player but no calendar this would make it easier to notify people of events such as ctas and whatnot it is rather annoying to have to filter through emails daily just to find out whats going on its especially annoying when you are a part of a large alliance with many things going on all at once
there is a ingame calendar and it already is hooked up to fail gateare own members really this dumbheres a hires screenshot
nevermindfound it didnt know you could click on the time in the bottom left corner learn something new every day
the blink needs to have its own settings this way you can control the lighting or brightness of the blink and also a blink color for each window for example my corp window above corp x would be a green light that slowly brightens to where it is easily visible while my alliance window could be blue i would think this would be a simple task and well needed
imo its better to allow couriers to see the content of contracts this way they can see a trap before accepting it
not better for the people making the trap
fix the bounty system so i know who has put a bounty on my head and so anybody can go after anybody with a bounty and perhaps bounty hunter contract types
i read in coad about creating a cost for having standing lists and would like to see something like it implementedfirst 4 blue standings are freefirst 4 red standings are freeevery 4 after that there is a costevery 4 after that its double the initial costevery 4 after that quadruple the intial cost and so onthis may go well with breaking apart the bigger coalitions and cause internal rifts we already pay for war decs why not for standing lists
no not supported at all what do you really think this would accomplish for one it would bring a sledgehammer on nrds corpalliances which are already hampered by the existing standings system and its 300 slot limitwhat we do need is an extended limit not a nerf to the whole system
old troll is old
3 new features should be added1 inability to cloak2 inability to dock3 sansha forces to attack starbases careless of if the incursion is in highsec  lowsec  00now before i get flamed for this the reason i have suggested the above is to promote pvp in incursion constellations it also prevents hisec 1 man corps from dropping poses and then jumping alliances if they are at warremove the hand holding ccp make incursions pve and pvpoh and since incursions only affect a few constellations at a time this would encourage different trade hubs and strategies
1 maybe2 no3 hell noif you pvp in highsec your a scrub in the first place go to low go to null go to a wh if you want pew pew
sounds like a good idea i remember hearing an awesome rumor a while ago that incursions would turn off concord over time effectively turning highsec into lowsec while the incursion is happeningright not incursions dont feel like an invasion just a minor inconvenience the way they are now imagine if an incursion happened in jita people wouldnt be able to belt rat or belt mine because of the sansha but otherwise its business as usual people can still dock up buy sell and be protected by concord1 incursions shut off concord after a while2 incursions shut off the local buying and selling after a while3 incursions spawn gate rats more often with scrams  webs4 incursions spawn station rats also with scams  webs5 incursions turn off mission agents6 when the incursion commander shows up he probes people down and warps on top of them with a small gang of sansha to mess them upnow imagine if that incursion hit jita people would notice then
did you miss the part where i said remove the hand holding ccp make incursions pve and pvp evading wars by joining alliances sucks sansha can easily fix thiseverything needs a risk oh and the docking comment was todo with lowsec  00 killing docking games p and promoting new trade hubs in hi secthe cloaking thing was to introduce a new type of pvp in lowsec  00 but i should mention it only applies to normal cloaks not black ops  covert cloaks 
how about no
im going to go with no they are supposed to be sansha raids into a hostile territory raids as in surprise attack by a small force for the purpose of seizing goods and valuables that is why they chose the term incursion and not invasion

eve online desolate frontieri would like to see the sovereignty system have a major overhaul specifically to delink dps blobs from capturing space and making it easier for small alliances to actually establish a foothold in nullsec without being wiped outthe functions of pos could be simplified to the extent that rather than towers and modules they could just be sold as objects with various attributes eg mining pos storage pos etc the career arc for mining could be expanded with escalating nonscannable mining sites creating a new prospectingdeep space mining career and lastly i would like to see a new section of claimable space adjacent to kspace except with no stargatesanyways i wrote up a very longtechnical proposal for all this awhile ago
my ideal expansionhow about nonenot kiddingwe are fed up with the new content crap yes its great yes its shiny we get that we dont mind muchwhat we do have a problem with is the increasing number of bugs and glitches that are constantly ignoredoverlookedskipped past and shelved for so long it hurtsan entire expansion dedicated to one task and one task only polishing the gamemake the game better fix the glitches no new content just fix the content we gotif they spent an entire expansion develop bracket to just that i dare say they might actually get a ton more subscribers backand i while i normally dont go out on a limb to say we i think its quite clear everyone is in agreement fix not expand
yesyesok sureyesyes also t3 frigates or destroyers to encourage people to fly the thingsactually this would help with inflation oddly enough or more lp rewards over isk even in 00yeah screw those guyssure why notyestake out jump bridges altogether this will kill bloated nullsec empiresyesalso i keep hearing that some features promised in dominion and quantum rise never got put in place we could always go back and finish that up
honestly i look forward to seeing a good article regarding effective pvp piloting of any destroyer including fittings and tactics would be a welcome solution to this conversationi personally still think that destroyers should actually be resized but that is a personal view because i do not think they should be the same basic size as most cruiserspersonally i just want destoryers to actually be considered a viable pvp threat
i want destroyers have a special ability to detect cloaked ships like in rl destroyers hunt down submarines with sonaruse a special scanner to detect approximate position of cloaked ship in system and take about 3 min to find one cloaked ship within system standing still
your idea will just cause the creation of afk cloaky macros see the cold war
simple effective and useful fully supported
i was every 5hrsi had 20 extractors and 4 refinerysi have now 1 refinery and 10 extractors i used to get 10000 units of refined noble metals in about a week i now get 1000 units dont tell me this was not a nerf team pi stop hiding away and start facing the music in my eyes pi was stealth nerfd and now you hide away and will not answer our calls in the forum sections why did you nerf pi what thought went into the nerf and changes hey do you even play pi for more that 1 hour testing face the music ccp start talking and stop hiding explain why my pi has dropped so much why your ecus need so much power gridjust give me back the click fest atleast we knew where we stood
the way the system works now its much easier to make a lot of p3 actually gather each resource one at a time on 2448 hour cycles use the same processors each time to make whatever p1 good you need and once youve built up equal numbers of everything run some advanced processors
i noticed one of the biggest issues here in ah isnt on that list all the botting thats going on theres usually two or three threads on the first page about the rampant and unchecked botting thats going on ingame

supercapitals are supposedly alliance level assets if an individual buys one and fails to get support when moving it  coupdegrace eve is a better game without fools in supercapitalssubcaps do not rely on the cloaked recharge for getting out of a pickle like capitals dosubcaps have cap boosters and generally have a lot of cap just from recharge while warping to safein short they are affected but it has no significant impact on their operation in 99 of cases
lets make it more juicy then the cyno ship gets blown up and the ship making the jump appears in a random system in their jump range at jump speed from which it takes a looong time to actually slow down and be able to turn and with a heavy spatial field distortion thingy that shows up on overview typosomg more typos
since missiles have to fire in all direction including right above and below you im beginning to see why missiles appear ex nihilo unless ships were outfitted with visible launchers on each side of the ship fugly a more realistic animation in this regard may be hard to achieve
this is a very good point and one that ive thought on some if the fb fix was used this is less trouble as you can simply put in a graphic code much like other games that dont use realtime missiles be aware i have no idea how to program but in other games this is what you seemissile launches from point a and flies straight to circumference point b then at a radius of c rotates around point b until aligned at target and continues on if i had a picture id show you but effectively the missile launches flies to a set sphere that surrounds the ship based on the ship size before it pulls a small uturn towards the target causing it to fly around and not through the launching ship imagine a realworld battleship firing a missile forwards at a target behind it  you see the missile launch straight or at an angle then do a half loop backwards and over the battleship towards its target not hitting the battleship of courseedit for those of you wondering about flight time calculation we want to try and avoid skill changes of course the flight time is calculated from the sphere surrounding the ship which at most would be maybe 500m for a battleship the sphere doesnt necessarily need to be circular either it could be a much smaller shaped form for the missiles to base on again im no programmer the point is if missiles take longer to reach a target behind them graphically we dont want the pilot penalized another 1km on his flight time a potential work around is that the missiles move faster or slower graphically in the first moments of launch based on direction then follow a set standard speed like now to the target this gives the illusion of launching at different vectors but maintains a standard for the damageside of things to work fromif turretlike launchers are used which i prefer not many ships need new skins to accommodate the needed hardpoints on top of the existing turret hardpoints for example the tempest only has 6 spots for turrets another two would be needed for the launchers my idea has the big box on its side which ive always assumed to be the two launchers should do the launching butturret launchers dont need to have missiles redirected as only the launchers facing the target would workall in all keep the points coming but remember this thread is calling for the development of a better missile launch graphic and has not explicitly chosen a particular style how the devs want to go about doing that is their call but i encourage everyone to post their idea on this thread so they have a pool to draw fromi would also like to see more csm andor dev supportif a missile update can potentially reduce lag some more who wouldnt want to look into this

i started eve missioning as caldari watching missiles fly out of my cockpit did not leave a good impression it still doesnt
interesting and1
if you google the eve and bot words together youll find pretty interesting results no you wont be able to find a bot most likely youll get keylogged in the process actual bot developers dont have their websites on front what you will find are the forums where you will see the tips for botting how to do it without getting banned what will get you banned and what will prevent you from getting unbanned obviously because of eula i wont go into details just wanted to say this it is common knowledge that if you dont go rmt approach ccp will pretty much let you bot as long as you want unless someone reports it even then you can contest the issue and get your account backon these sites youll see why ganking them doesnt work because majority of them are macroing in 00 and capable of going to a safespot when someone else enters the systemseriously try and google it then youll actually see how ed the current situation isalso if you see a bot report him dont ignore it thinking it someone else would apparently thats the only way to force ccp to take action against themedited for support
to defeat the bot we must understand the bot outside of rmt most people bot because making isk otherwise is dull time consuming and not fun botting is also so rampant now that ive no doubt that if there was a mass banning of personal bots there would be a tremendous knock on effect to the rest of the economytackling botting requires a multifaceted approach engineering the game in such a way so that it is harder to bot certain activities making these activities more fun and possibly more rewarding in the process and a gradual phased culling of the bot so that the percentage of known bots is steadily reduced over time in an effort to ween the economy off the massive inflow of botted iskthis is something id like to see the next csm address and will personally champion with much vigour if i win a seat on the council
ill support this not because i particularly care about bots but because i think it would be interesting to see what comes out of csm and ccp talking about bots
aggressive banning of bots will act as a deterrent factor
support there is also actually a lot of market bots at jita actually easy to spot very active and still not bannedsometimes you manage to f them but in the end they always win
this is a pair of proposals that i have been mulling over for the last month or soproposal 1 let us name corporate hangars and ship maintenance arrays at a pos we can name assembly arrays so lets bring the corporate hangars and smas the same ease of use i realize this is a small small thing compared to everything that is wrong with the pos but if we cant have filet mignon ill take hamburger this would make it a thousand times easier to find thingsproposal 2 right click show fitting i am very very very tired of having to get into a ship to see whats on it or trying to name it something useful so i can remember add a right click menu option to show us the fittings even if its just a simple text list and yes i know you can do this from assets show contents but this does not work for ships in smasedit changed the title of the post  lets see if anyone else stops in now
edit failure at reading supported
sounds good to me
living out of a pos would be easier if we could name all the structures 
both good ideas i like
i will now support this as i do not wish to be flying a mission and have a random noctis warp in and steal my loot however since you can now bandon wrecks there is no reason that i should not be able to shoot said noctis when it tries to salvage my wrecks not supported if it will help ninja salvagers supported if i can get kill rights on said ninja salvagerson a side not why not make abandoned wrecks probable while claimed wrecks remain un probeble
wait what gathering intel means nothing to you being able to pick and choose who to engage while being undocked means nothing to you being able to halt pve ops in a system is nothing to youif you are for making unprobable ships probable then by extension it should also apply to cloaked ships
i dont support being able to probe down wrecks but for an entirely ingamecharacter reason wrecks do not emit any power signals for probes to lock on to so it would not make sense to be able to scan them down with probes

theres already a thread on thisahh well ill support this one also for the same reasons i supported the other one
time to get the exterminators in eve is infested

what anger i am wholly and utterly indifferentthe way i see it the entities without fat moons available use them as alternative isk faucets income appears to be about the same if going by the even growth of supercapitals across the cluster so mehbesides even if ccp managed to find some method hitherto unknown to the entire gaming industry the markets would crash for pretty much all items
oh yeah so there is no problems  then why mining if a bot can do  why losing time to update market orders if a bot can do  why farming rats in 00 whereas bots could do it for you 247 you convinced me im going straight to find an effective bot how do you get your isk already  i hope its by producing or ganking indus cause if not start botting man 
ban the bot plz
the bots are everywhere even in the most remote regions of low sec i still encounter two to three unique bots each day and i know for a fact that these bots are not getting banned reporting them yields no results months after the petition is filedif ccp is dealing with these bots behind the scenes we the playerbase certainly dont see it perception is reality and what we perceive is a game becoming increasingly saturated with bots in all corners of the galaxy while ccp sits idly on their handsif it continues to get worse eve will eventually turn into lineage 2 or ffxi theyre so full of bots that even the starting zones are full of them the devs in those games simply gave up and quit trying to combat the infestationtheres almost nowhere i can go where i wont encounter a bot anymore with the exception of whs and some null sec regions to add insult to injury its arguably the most discussed issue here in ah yet its not being put on the table by the csms
sure there is but there is no realistic solution to them how the hell do you and others expect ccp to solve a problem that has had the entire industry on its knees since mmos became mainstreamccp are pretty damn good but they are not godsnow if the op had asked for a context menu item similar to what we have for reporting isk spammers then i am all for it but generic emothreads serves no purpose other than dilute the issues raisedps made my isk inventing manufacturing exploring and ratting  you know playing the game
bots cause lagtwo birds with one stone
keyboard macros which simply press many keys in sequence with no repeating or decision making are perfectly fine under the tosim not in favour of ccp reporting numbers of bots banned i am in favour of some system allowing people to attack and destroy the ships of people suspected of running bots for example being able to be in space with a ship carrying weapons which could then be activated against the bad guy
agree
you dislike change you hide and enjoy solo mining you are asking to be ganked
not supported on one of my old mining characters i found it excessively simple to find a decent system to mine in and judge the activity in the system without this proposed feature also im not sure why you want to add more info for pvpers in such a way honestly it would only help in lownullsec if anyone actually does mine in low sec not many im sure and this sort of info should be obtained manually by a scout not a few clicks of the mapso again i really dont think this is a very good idea
supportedhow about a filter showing quality of belts as well
agreed this is an adult game i mean come on they are still in their underwear
it may seem like a small thing but it shows you where ccp is headed a parent friendly game
my fellow amarr would gladly chop off my legs at the hem of my dress so no showing leg from me or chest god would personally kill mebut i support more diversity  customization
1 for shirtless there are some minor tweeks ive been wanting to make to my portrait but have been unable too because i dont want to be forced into a shirt
supported
supported or at least give us a real explanation why not
what we probably dont know is the teen playerbase is growing to the point where ccp doesnt want to upset parents
besides that now that the noctis has been introduced as well as other specialized ships i believe there should be dedicated gas harvesting platform that gets some sort of bonuses to harvesting perhaps create another variation on the noctisprimae platform
just remember that increasing yieldhr will reduce the value of the item youre collecting
they currently have two teams working what i would consider iterative development of past features team best friends forever is apparently dedicated to csmspecified lowhanging fruit and strongly supported issues from the assembly hall and team gridlock is working on lag which i consider a feature introduced by dominion a lot of stuff is not on the assembly hall list though so the main push would be to keep team best friends forever perpetualas i state in a blog post i wrote on the subject incursions and incarna are just going to rot on the vine unless ccp makes iterative development of past features part of their culture and dna
this code has been broken for yearsplex spawning mechanic does not work for any part of the game for which it has been implementedeach time ccp release a new area of gameplay it is adversely effected by this broken code and never reaches its full potentialboth faction war for years and now incursions suffer from bugged plex that will not despawnboth faction war for years and now incursions suffer from bugged plex spawning that means within hours of downtime no plex can be spawnedfix this one bit of code and magically fw and incursions will actually be playable beyond downtimecurrently your features sound fine they look right on paper they kinda work for a few hours a daythis broken spawning mechanic turns these features that sound right into something that can never work the way it is described
not supported why bother if the players wont even come in to defend the plexlianged im all for fixing fw  but i dont really want them wasting time on temporary fixes
absolutely also while nothing comes to mind specifically keep in mind the colorblind as well like me
so do expand on that how could the ui suit the needs of a colorblind person
a small team gathered around patch timethis team creates test cases and experiments to ensure eve patches conform to the usability and accessibility issues theyve identifiedsome alliances painkillers and hot nurses are the main topic of idle discussion
please allow larger text sizes even if not a full range of sizes at least normal large xlargeplease please please make this happen
why stop there fix the colorblind issues as wellliang
looking at the history of incursions so fararaz  kakoljoas  kalanginit appears they already do spread to neighboring constellations even if completed perhaps if theyre not completed within x dayswatching now to see what happens in the constellations near algintal as that one was completed the fastest
the 2 gallente incursions were the first to go down neither spawned nearby i dont think its a factor atm
i like this idea
this part supported
1nullsec alliances could also curate sansha incursions to give them free cynojamming in border systems
why cant i look at my orders in 1 page and my transactions in another i propose we seperate them so you can see both at the same time currently theyre tabbed together i have to look at orders sold by pushing load then go back to my oreders tab to see if that item is needing to be bought more of for my resales i gotta go thruough 30 to 40 items this way jitas lag has been a problem it takes longer to get in and out of jita working on market orders this way this may help people make market transaction decisions faster and get out reducing the population in jita faster which reduces the lag in market transactions as well
im with ya on this i fly with my corp for these things so the incursion channel is useless
we dont need incursions to be annoying we have youwindjammer
how hard is it to minimize the window
kind of besides the point imagine that a constellation channel opened up whenever you entered a new areasure you can close it but it is a hassle if it just continues to reappearthere is a snazzy notification box that pops up in incursion areas add an open channel button to that instead of autoopening it
supported if there is an incursion anywhere that matters or is relevant to you or your plans you will know about it via your alliancecorporation forums mail or whatever seeing as how the vast majority of organized groups in eve communicate via ingame or outofgame mass media limited to desired participants the incursion channel is superfluous i would even go so far as to say that judging by the performance of random idiots joining incursion gangs in their special snowflake ships and being slaughtered that the incursion channel is more of a detriment even to solo or smallgroup players than it is a boon

this thread failed at point where someone hinted that fair fights are actually some kind of point in this game fights are decided already before they start what you see in killmails is the resultim 100 sure this is a troll but anyhow bored enough to post
ha of course its a troll and never has any chance of being implemented but like all good trolls theres an element of truth to it i believe we would see more pvp  solo small gang and fighting outnumbered  if it was simply an isk loss instead of also an efficiency loss on the killboard as an example thats why elite pvp alliances will demand everyone dock up instead of risk a losing fight when people roam their space afterall that 90 efficiency is hard to maintain when people fight outnumbered or they fight prepared enemiesbasically killmails by themselves arent such a bad thing  its the social constructs that have been built around them that are the problemliang
supported
it is more about odds being stacked to the point of being impossible to overcome reasonably than it is about being fair ive never been afraid to fight against the odds but what is the point of undocking when the only thing out there to fight are gangs you have no chance of actually hurting nevermind beating without bringing a blob of your own
this is a friggin space game what reason could there be that some races can not wear certain things or have certain hair cutsi want my vherokoir with a hood or at least a robe like in the old editor and long hair or even better the old standing up hair style
they are minmatar not persianbut yeah i would like to look like my hair is clean not like some bum who hasent showered in months
to be honest theres no reason at all why longshort hair should be restricted to various races do the people of the future find it impossible to grow hair like many other limitations with the character creator this limitation makes no sense

supported the amarr seem to have the only finished character creator
aye long hair for all races and bloodlines
not supportedtry acting like men for once
some of the manliest men have long hairbut yeah ill vote for more girly men in eve
yup i miss my hair
there isnt any technical reason why everyone couldnt have access to all haircuts they just plug into the back of the scalp model
i ask that people read this entire post before flaming me or writing this off as a stupid idea i have been reading on these forums for a while now and lately i have noticed a very valid trend that is popping up everyone agrees that supercarriers are op while everyone has their own opinions on how and where to nerf them i had a different take on it while i currently believe that ccp should make all supercaps equal these are 2060billion isk ships they should all be mostly equal i also think that there should be a fix for these massive fleets that are needed to take them out so we come to my idea on this create a new class of ship specifically designed to kill capitals and supercapitals capital hunters would use the tier 2 battlecruiser hulls would only have 5 guns and would be inferior in every way excluding the tank of their t1 counter part against sub caps these ships would be nearly useless as most t1 bc and some t1 cruisers would be better but with the addition of another item to the game lets call it a strategic targeting system it gets a ten percent bonus per level to the damage it deals to capital ships and a fifteen percent bonus per level to supercapital ships and for the rp crowd to make this viable as a storyline thing lets say it locates the weakpoints on large ships that larger ships are simply unable to hit precisely to take advantage of and smaller ships simply do not do enough damage to effectively exploit the bonus to the guns would be on the module itself to avoid giving a ship too many bonuses to better elaborate lets say that we have a t2 harby lets say it is called a bishop it uses 5 guns and has the tank of an absolution it has the normal harbinger hull bonuses and a role bonus of 95100 percent reduction in the cpu need of the targeting module now the obvious question about these ships is deployment simply warping in and motoring within range would probably not work out well because any fc worth his salt would call primary or have pilots on standby that are only there to kill these ships so the obvious solution would be to jump them in or get really good warp ins well instead of fitting these ships with jump drives how about we have another module that is fit into the high slot that when activated allows the ship to use a black ops portal activating this module requires no cap however when you use the jump portal your cap is drained depending on your skill level at level 1 75 percent at level 5 50 percent the downside to this is the ship is unable to use jump bridges either titan or pos stargates are unaffected the downsides to these ships are pretty obvious they are not very powerful vs subcap ships any t1 bc could kill a capital hunter in a 1 on 1 fight 910 times using the strategic targeting module significantly increases the sig radius they only have one role and are otherwise useless the bonuses to these ships is it would create situations where it would be relatively easy to kill a capital that is alone ie a nyx ratting in a belt in 0 or a carrier used by militia in low sec it would decrease the need for super large fleets to kill supercaps if you see an aeon outside of a pos you get a cloaky 10k off of him and then you light the cyno fifty of these ships and a black ops jumps through two minutes later you have a dead aeon
its a needed role but its more interesting to make a superbomber a t2 bc hull that can launch cap torps something like 253k dps no covert cloak ofc
simpler solution would be to make dreads more usefull again
this better nonsiege dps and better sieged tracking for instance
to be honest i read everything and i cant agree with youwy create a new ship while battleships that fitted cost 5 to 10 or more than any battlecruiser for the lowest battleship price and can be easly ganked maikng these obsolete for anything else than two options sniper fleets agains sniper fleetsdrakes blobs or missions wow what exciting class ship asking you months of training and be prerequisite at lvl 5 for capital fighting ships when your game with is very limitedbefore creating a new ship i would like to see the existant ones get some love like gallente ships and all of them including dreadnaughts when this is donne the right way then we should look if those changes have any influence on cs and scs op
lets look at this a bit closer and remember that these complaints will apply to all lets make a new ship x that only kills capssupercapsship meaningfully damaging supercapitals obsoletes capitals that do not have supercapital ehp further obsoletes dreads by taking their roledoes not meaningfully damage subcaps is useless outside of preplanned capsupercap ganks will never be taken on roams as its just a liabilityis virtually impossible for capssupercaps to kill rockpaperscissors in the worst possible way terrible game balancingadditionally it still doesnt address the difficulty of tackling supercaps whether alone or in groupsliang
how about an alternative module for dreadnaughts increasing their anticapital rolesiege module fitted dreads and titans for pos bashing other module for capsupcap fightsthis other module which should be for dreads only would increase trackingfire ratesrate of firerange while increasing cap demands for the guns andor reducing the self repairremote repair rates
perhaps instead of boosting dreads or nerfing super caps we could just allow dreads and regular carriers into high sec and ease their entrance and exit into wormholes while at the same time keeping the super caps limited to low and null sectheres plenty of high sec pos towers whose owners believe theyre much safer there than in low or null sec and whs are littered with abandoned pos towers the logistics behind taking down a tower in a wh are excruciating to say the least
i like the idea of a cap killer ship but it already exists make dreadnoughts viable again and you dont need to add anything new
the eve creation character its not fully finished yet and because of it there are differences between the ways to make each character on each version by this situation i purpose that ccp allow us to remake our characters each update that the system suffersor at least let us to change our character a bit times 3 times for example before the final versionim sure about you could understand that the actual character creation its so complicated than the last and obtain the optimal version of your portrait might need and iterative process
i would like to redo my portrait didnt quite come out like i had hopedill support this
wow you really dont know how to read up on the update do you ccp has already read that as they update character creater they will allow again for players to update profile if someone could link that so i dont have to find it or you could just search around for it
hello i have yet to see ccp look in to way to have stop anything to do with timers in game wont it just be easier to stop all timers when servers go down so im asking csm to look in to fact of having ccp turn off timers just makes life easier as its big problem right now between alliances shooting towers tcu and many other things if your not playing then you dont get extra count down
yes stop the skill timers during dt
do you know how incredibly annoying it would be for everything to slip by an hour every day
ok so all timers stop for lets say 5 hours per day this would include training also now all the players want to be compensated because they dont have the ability to train as quickly as players did before the time stops startednot supported due to the nightmare of whining that will ensue
yeah scanning in a wormhole is a complete  since this change

i would like to ocasionaly purchase a plex but the cheapest option on the website is to buy a package of 2 for around 30 usd there is no logical reason why plexes are not available in units of one for around 15 usd and frankly i have a feeling ccp would make more money from the ocasional plex buyer if they allowed the sale of individule plexes on the website
who are you asking to force ccp to do anythingthe csm has the authority to make a suggestion which has to be taken seriously
someone has been fishing in wow too much
protip this checkbox is infamously unreliable and particularly in the case of sentry drones will still result in them going off and deciding to engage whatever they likei suppose at least they dont attack friendlies as detailed here
give them incursion sansha ai
i am not going to read all of the replies to this because they are probably all bashing your stupid ideai am going to bash it morestupid idea
do you even know what the csm is about as a veteran member were a liaison and advisory council id like to know how you plan to achieve this grandiose concept or what methodology you would use to detect said enemiesim not saying that i agree with what ccp has been doing with project unholy rage or any other initiative but this idea is ludicrous unless you can demonstrate a reason for me to vote for you i doubt youll get few if any votes except from your close friends
csm cannot force ccp to do anything if youre running on the mistaken belief that you can you are doomed to fail csm can apply pressure management successfully in some cases but at the end of the day ccp will do whatever the hell it wants if what it wants doesnt mesh with the csms message as the voice of the community there is not a whole lot you can do about it also dont fail to factor in the blowing sunshine up your ass phenomenon wherein ccp nods politely says all the right words to csm and then proceeds to dowhatever the hell it wants sure there are quite a lot of good people working at ccp who engage with the csm in a very collaborative fashionout of which some longawaited changes have been delivered but thinking youre going to force ccp to do anything is pure folly suggest you reword that bullet point to describe something that you and not ccp have control of  such as apply relentless pressure on ccp to act upon bots and macroers with swift justice ban rmters or not

i for one will vote for the hotest candidate avatar on the next csm election just saying
so you think avatars in stations will be like posters on the poles  knowing nowadays ccp who knows but i still doubt itor you know they will walk like people lighting and angles will change every moment never thought about that oh and totally wrong forum section on top of that
i just wanted to point out that part of the discussion about storing and exporting settings was covered some time ago in this proposal
i support it big time
it would just be awesome
bump for truth
i dont care how fix the black ops
i honestly think that a delayedremoved local would be the best way to increase need and use of black ops i dont honestly think the point of a black ops is to be a direct pvp boatas it stands now local pretty much kills any purpose of a ship like this imo since if you cant get some other ship into the target system without being detected in order to pop a covert cyno without being detected etc and then jump n gank theres not really much point to it imobut then again thats just my opinion
i am against race change but for change of bloodline
thumbs up

so can the csm give us an update on this proposalwhen is the next csm meeting what is their agendawhat are they doing
i want my bar code tattoo back
lasers projectiles and missiles have all been buffed or at least tweaked since i joined years agoisnt it about time to look at eves forgotten weapon system
ill support this on one condition i havent seen a single post detailing what exactly is wrong with gallente ships i honestly have no idea as ive never really flown gallente ships into combatso can someone please just post a comprehensive list of whats so wrong with gallente ships that it needs fixing
its not gallente its hybrids its really the trackingfalloff of hybrids being too tight if falloff and tracking were even 125x what they are nowrails would be more balanced its not just dps its more so too small a sweet spot
i cant understand englishnot support
lets give the gallente some much needed love
id like to support this but theres nothing here to support this proposal is really just a vague affirmation that something needs to be done we know something needs to be done ccp knows something needs to be done the csm knows something needs to be done  simply saying to them something needs to be done isnt going to accomplish anythingcome back when you have a real proposal flailing about madly isnt going to fix gallente
flailing about madly is apparently what resulted in this situation we are ed off that what this thread is saying we are fed up with the issue getting discussed and being left at nobody can agree on what to do so were going to do nothingthat is not an acceptable response so someone from ccp needs to speak up and give us a detailed and reasonable explanation as to why things are the way they are i expect a detailed dev blog post covering in depth the process and individual dynamics involved how does ccp balance the four major factions against each other do they have four guys or four teams of guys sitting around trying to push their own agenda or do they just choose a fotm to work on to avoid antagonism and favoritism is that approach honestly working what is their blueprint or vision for faction balance as one person said in one of these gallente balance threads  how do you wind up with a game where the melee character is also the slowest and how do you expect that to be in any way reasonably balanced eve might or might not be somewhat different but it is still an rpg and for a very long time the basics of how these different combat styles should function have been well established by thousands of manhours of neckbeards squabbling in darkened rooms with game boards and dicethey need to bite the bullet and actively revisit the game balance issue by committing active resources ie  team falcrum  or something to fixing itleaving 14 of the game assets and players out in the cold for over two years is not ok and the most frustrating thing about it is the silence and lack of acknowledgment received from both csm and ccp they might have more specific things to worry about but ill reiterate what i just said  this is ruining the game for one quarter of your playerbase
lol on the big bold print1 anywaymay add this to your proposal roleplayer reason due to the inefficiency of non covops cloaks all energy gernerated by the ship must be put into maintaining the cloak all excess energy created by cap recahrgers is dumped to keep the cloak from being overloaded
black ops must be immune
supported black ops need to use covert ops cloak though
it is quite obvious none of you have ever lived in a wormhole where it is require to cloak certain ships and no i am not talking about my anathema or my pilgrim im talking about my orca you ever tried to pop a wormhole with an orca and the wormhole has a variance on the mass you need to have an orca inside of a potentially hostile wormhole for a protracted period of time while you get the mass right with bcbs not supported
it is quite obvious an orcas capacitor not recharging while cloaked has nothing to do with what you are arguing about did you read my entire proposal marlona sky by the way
1 to both
gotta keep the movement moving
beautifully put
it only fails completely against half the t2 ships in the game luckily those t2 ships are fail and hardly anybody flies them in pvp

alias does bring about a good point with using a predesignated area for missiles to attain a distance before turningas i mentioned in another post i had read about how the original ships of eve having these locations for separate missile launching and drone launching points on the models they were removed in the productionbeta due to massive drawbacks of the video cards at the timei believe a compromise could be in order if missiles fired forward to a designated area around the ship before making a correction then one could have a predetermined outcome of the rendering each missile would then as alias stated make its correction towards its target while theoretically this could cause missile delays in flight time maybe it would work to treat them as the missiles do when they arrive in range of the target the missile whipas far as removing server load i dont think that would particularly happen as the missiles would still need to converge at a certain point before making its arc or in some cases a separate convergence outside the ship ships inside this range would then cause for a really grotesque flight of missiles looping around in a weird ballet acttechnical problems aside a client could be coded to display the action of the missiles firing from the launchers while the server calculates the math on its current trajectory settings with the client displaying the aforementioned whipi think until the majority of eve pilots however support machines that could render such a load i think this will not gain support among ccp devs due to its limited access to pilots once it gained a following though i could see a secondary box under missile effects in the general settings tab

whilst i can appreciate the concept and explanation of a virtual sphere from the edge of wich missiles take on their final path i foresee at least one issue heavy assault missiles  torpedos are unguided im not 100 sure how much people are willing to accept such missiles taking uturns immersionwiseotherwise solid idea 
immersionwise this is far into the futurebut even now unguided missiles dont necessarily fly straight many have a shortdirectionchange charge in them at initial launchthink of it as a final touch before flying the primary course to its target an example of this is when a pilot fires an unguided torpedo at a point on a station to compensate for the pilots potential error the unguided missile will adjust trajectory within tenths of a second to put it on that exact line needed before traveling the full distancelimitations are not the lack of computer but fuel for unguided missilestypically they carry much larger payloads and thus need more fuel for quick movement forward which in turn sacrifices fuel for side movements for readjustment as seen in guided missiles while a uturn is certainly a large change in direction it is feasible during the initial alignment after launch before traveling its designated path as a dumb missileto the point it was simply a potential idea but you do have a good point again turret launchers may be the best bet but the missiles will definitely need the fb fix in that casenot to mention some ship skins will need adjustment not necessarily bad just more work im personally advocating skin launching but as stated anyone is welcome to post their own idea on how to jazz up the missile launch graphic and bonus points for this find a way to reduce the lag that surrounds missiles
bumpy road
i dont see the pointsay the game world runs on ticks a tick is an update of the worldrenderingetc fps depending on the game can translate to the tick rate at the start of each tick a set of actions is done in order for example ship positions update then weapons fired etc the end of each tick returns to the start of the tick when lag occurs due to server side overload the tick is already slowed down slowing down weapon modules and movement wont do much because the server still has the same set of actions to execute in a tickthis already happens to the point weapon modules will become broken and unresponsivestuck in a green no cycle state until you do something drastic like jump system or relog
this actually might worksupported

heres your reality checkif botting is as prevalent as suggested you can bet youre last dime that ccp has a very low interest in dealing with its pretty much a lose lose proposition for them its damn near impossible to tell the difference between a bot and someone playing semiafk its very hard to prove short of devoting support resources to the problem which means that it costs them more money to hunt them down add that to the fact that if they do find a botter and ban them theyve lost subscription revenuermt gets nailed because thats competition for gtcs and frankly with the gtc system in place anyone who buys from an rmt source deserves to get banned for stupiditythe problem is that there are so many activities in the game that are tedious repetitive and boring stuff at which robots excel as long as these tedious activities exist botters will do their thing the only way to effectively combat these programs is to scan the systems local memory and the last company that tried that crap got head bit off many macros actually run on vmware and isolate the client to the point where it can tell the client software any bs it wants so you cant even reliably spot bots with a rootkit toolthe people writing these bots are just as bright and talented as the programmers the game companies employ and there are probably damned sight more of them than are on ccps payrollas ephemeron pointed out many of these programs play with just as much if not more sophistication than a live player in fact in many ways they are better they dont make mistakes the best ones can tie multiple bots together so a scout on trial account can see you coming from several systems away they can hit dscan every few seconds and react instantly to the first sign of trouble so even removing or delaying local would be of limited value in combating themso looking at the situation realistically it would cost ccp money in developer resources to combat them in support personal to investigate the ones identified and sort through the false positives then theyd lose the revenue from any banned accountshonestly i think the best thing ccp could do would be to simply level the playing field as much as possible id suggested before turn mining into a passive activity using some sort of mining pos and mining drones make pi passive once setup save for picking up your loot all threads like this and the 50 others like it really accomplish is to make people who hadnt thought about botting go hey theres an idea
thank you it is a tiring affair trying to explain logistics of such a task to people who have littletono comprehension of what would be involvedalso i am getting tired of reading a hundred bot threads you want bots gone suicide them repeatedly thats your cross to bare for wanting a bot free system i see the all the time even 10 characters of a name like 89ds38dff01 02 03 and so on all mining in sync i report and leave it up to ccp they have a lot of petitions to go through every day that are submitted with pooruninformed judgement on part of the players before they get to the valid ones so sometimes they are not caughtplease stop blaming ccp and csms for an environment entirely created by players even after its clear its against the eula you want a antibot squad form a coalition to purchase accounts have everyone name it antibot000001 and increase it sequentially generate enough accounts well maybe ccp will do so otherwise please please stop repeating the same complaints about something that would cost valuable development time that would involve a devoted team
while you two are correct you are missing the other issuebots hurt games its that simple i have no illusion of a game that doesnt have one but excessive botting have been proven time and again to hurt the game in long runas you said in your posts ccp is perfectly happy with them in their game because they pay for their accounts via plex that means well see occasional pr stunt about the bots aka unholy rage until the next great bot whine thread marathon startscurrent mechanics makes it extremely easy to bot proper way to battle the bots long term would be changing mechanics to be more responsive we all know ccp doesnt want to change anything with mechanics they just like to put new stuff on the table without touching the old stuff problem with this approach is obvious they have to make more frequent bot purges if they want to keep going in that direction ccp also lacks any desire on this departmentcurrent bots are impossible to detect via datamining but they are still oblivious to the most basic method of bot check o hai thar at this point it is probably cheaper to assign 1 gm for active bot search instead of wasting developer time for creating complicated bot detection methodsit is well known and documented ccp only cares about something when it becomes bad press that is the only thing they care about its like the whole company is being run by marketing department alone if theres no whine threadnoughts if theres no bad press then the problem simply doesnt exists for ccp csm by definition is a marketing stunt which means they actually have the opportunity to actually talk with ccp about this issueyes i realize last csm talked about bots yes i saw that devblog about macros i also see how they specifically ignore the threads to give devs some credit they have toas for the matter dealing with bots yourself well if i can identify and deal with the bots myself imagine what ccp can do about them if they put their mind into it finally amount of bot threads will only increase until ccp does something about the problem so if you want bot threads to stop click that support the topic tick instead of advocating for bots
honestly incursion is another huge swipe at bots i hope ccp continues to iterate on that as content continues to be less static and become more dynamic bots have to increase in complexity or simply disappear you can look back to the old school static plexes and the farming of those plexes ccp made them dynamic and bots had to shift to something elsecaptain shes got plenty of power youll just have to be patient  scotty
inability to view fittings has caused me much grief
its the smallest things which cuase the biggest headaches
edit i should learn to read the entire post before replying 
no worries dear i am guilty of that myself from time to timewhile i agree im hoping that by asking for something small we might at least get ccp to do more than go no thats hard
both ideas are fair requests
yep on both
so i am going to bump this just because its time for ccp to tackle some little things that make us happycsm  throw this on the pile please and thanks
why not
ninja salvage cheap scanning frig or dessie only risk is the missioner running out and you not being fast enough to warp out too loss cheap shipthats much less investment than training a bs to run level 4s for a lot more proportional reward yes l4s are safe too but theres little reason to buff either l4s or ninja salvaging salvaging high sec belt rats would of course probably be the lowest paying profession in eve which is why i used to probe down mission runners back when i was in high sec the advantage of being able to probe down wrecks in high sec is to clean up the system of abandoned wrecksthats because its one of the lowest sp requirement professions as well but you are making no sense with this if all you want to do is clear abandoned wrecks why should the cost matter
well i dont want to be making 1 mil isk an hour cleaning up belt wrecks as for clearing up the system the amount of belt wrecks is nothing compared to the amount of wrecks left behind in deadspace
i believe that everything in space should be probable even the unprobable t3s however i also feel that it should be extraordinarily hard to do so if the ship is set up rightwhy not introduce a new type of probe that take very high skills and special implants to use and only usefull after you get your 999 or whatever it is hit on the shipwreck with normal probes maybe even having to use 1520 of them and have a longer cycle time but shorter lifespan hell maybe even forcing to have the probes within 250km of the target so they show up on your overviewthe point is that everything would be probable but it wouldnt be reasonable to actually catch that t3 unless the pilot is a complete failure maybe i assume to much there and in that case he would deserve to lose his shipeveryone would be happy pirates like me that would like the ability to probe out everything regardless how futile the effort may be and carebears that would still be relitively safe in low and null missioning away

while i support this as a whole its not going to happen bots exist people coders with a brain control the mouse not the game randomizing menus is just going to cause people grief and is on a level or paranoia as the tsa in the united states you want random borderline sexual abuse pat downs nextbots exist and will always exist unless ccp literally controls your computer then whose playing the gameif you see a bot report it ccp can dance like a marionette but it is not going to change the result the effort they have spent in curbing bots already is one of the most developed antibot system i have seen i cannot in good conscience ask them to waste more time on this unless someone develops a way to hack the servers themselves
sorry but we can ask ccp to waste more time on thisand you know whybecouse we pay rl money to play this game and before we created account we had to agree to eula and eula is contract between two sides and all we ask is that other side carry out what they wrote in that contract nothing more and nothing lessso if they say that botting will be sanctioned well then sanction itand if they dont do anything to conduct eula then we dont need to obey it and that will lead to death of eve like many other games died becouse of bots
1 create an antibotting coalition2 make ccp reveal names of bots3 declare war on bot user alliances and annihilate them
like it
nice if it could be done
while i think this idea definitely has its merits i think the internal game play would suffer a large casualty freighters suddenly moving at base speeds when you think about it they move as slow because they would assume to be full would be automatically known to be full up whats the first thing that is going to happen every freighter moving at its base speed would suddenly be lit up like christmas trees in a bonfire in juneships in dire circumstances would just jettison cargo andor ammo to get a boost in speed to escape  that is what sways me to hit the check box for support i still think this idea would need a massive check for balancing however all in all i think that the current speeds would be the speed of a fully loaded ship when you add in the cargo rigs and cargo expanders the speed adjustments would already be accounted for if ship is light or empty it means you move at a faster rate then would be the current
considering that a typical bs weight around 100 mil kg and weight of a full cargohold of ammo it will hardly make a dent
yeah but a ton of feathers is the same as a ton of bricks is it not but a volume of feathers will not equal that of bricksif you get a chance watch one of those documentaries about ships laden with cargo maybe even something about battleships those shells on such small weapons when compared to eve ships weigh 800kg1800lbs as per the bismarks 15 main turrets when you compare it to the real life equation of how much it costs per poundthink it was in the 10s of thousands now imagine it being 200000 rounds of 1400mm artillery ammo the ammunition above is only 38cm thats about 37 times bigger bore and the weight would be massivean 800mm armor piercing round developed by germany weighs 7100 kg 1565282 lbs thats fifteen thousandnow to break down your idea that ammo means little in weighta tempest with no bonus cargo modules can carry 24000 rounds of large projectile ammunition if we were to assume that the ammo was to be used in 800mm cannons since eve doesnt differentiate by bore size we can assume the ammo weighs in at roughly 7100 kg the tempest itself weighs 103300000 kg now 24000 rounds of ammo weighs in at the assumed weight of 170400000 kg that means that the ammunition alone weighs in at 16496 the mass of the ship itselfnow take all that into account you still think ammo has nothing to do with a ships mass
according to eve that large projectile ammo weights 1kg each and used in both 400mm dual ac and 1400mm arty yeah everything in eve has to be realistic cause you know this is no game
i only see 0025m3 listed under the eve info tab how do you see 1kg each
thanks for the link though i think after having read some of the excerpts in the art of eve book these numbers were an arbitrarily assigned number without a purpose i had not realized that the original ship models have specific missile firing points and drones exiting and entering the bays as so many ask for but they state how it was such a load on the graphics cards and engine that it cause unbearable lagin its current form i do not see any moduleammorigcargo that has any relative kg rating though im not going to check every item eve simply has too manyin its current incarnation yes you are correct in that ammo has no effect in the scheme of things however if a system was indeed put in place i would happily submit weights for every single item in the game that i can for review to adjust to the appropriate weights or in the case of the many things we dont have guess
noskilled campers may need help but i dont consider that a good thing slowing the game down making more time sink i dont consider that a good thing either throwing a couple hundred thousand more calculations at an already stressed server is most definately not a good thing you want it to have to recalculate the weight of every ship in large fight the server can barely support every time they fire a weapon
no way not need more hidden amarrian boosttheir ammo not need mass but every other need full loaded cargobay
yes that was the fun of it
if that is the case i would support if a wh can also spawn some ice from time to timeotherwise i think the logistics of planning to get fuel in and goodies out would change too muchright now players do not have to be on every day hoping for a hs  ls  to get to known spacereal life issues doesnt permit everyone to log on every day
if parents havent figured out how to deal with this well before the teen years they are fail as parents and deserve what ever they get seriously the second thing most human beings see in their life is a boob and the first is the other part of the anatomy everyone gets all wierded out about boobs are life they are what makes us mammals the fact that they are prominent on the chest is unique to humans they create friggin food for crying out loud they are friggin miraculous just more neopuritanism because the religious right is ed off that theyve lost the culture war im disapointed in ccp for capitulating to such nonsense its a cruel harsh universe but keep your shirts on
a reply from ccp on this issue would be nice but im not holding my breath
by popular demand shirtless now in the incarna store for 1 plex
checker i think you are thinking more of the victorians than the puritans the puritans were modest and didnt show things off however it was the victorians who were more aggressive about itlikewise the goal of this thread isnt to be about anti religious right rants being against improper or excessive sexuality has its place plus if you want to split hairs theres just as many on the left feminists whod hate something like this as people on the rightmy thoughts on the matter are1 technically everything that has to be covered is so its not full nudity now it might be tasteless trashy ty or sexy depending on your point of view however no female nipples no genitals  not nudity2 all of the avatars ive seen are already wearing a jacket theyve just got the front open so they are mostly clothed and its a little bit more about cleavage than nudity plus at least a few of the avatars ive seen had more of a tough chick look to them than a sexy one3 in the rightwrong pose a woman with a ddd cup and a tight shirt is just as goodbad as cleavage so if there were more prudish interests at stake here why not keep every female pc a b cup that actually might keep women who dont like pcs with big busts for leaving the game ie its less offensive to them4 whats the point of letting us see characters in their undies to begin with only to tell us a screen or two later dont forget to put your shirt on i mean ccp could have started everyone off in a bodysuit and those things can be kinda sexy too or something and theyve had plenty of time before now to think about this as someone whos done qa work before this one kinda bugs me the most to me it means decisions are either based on whimsy or ccp doesnt have their act together in some fashion or another whats going on up there if this was a problem why did it make it all the way to release 4a i know the icons are small but why are there half naked strippersprostitutes in the game as things you can move around i mean seriously if you want to go a prudish route thats fine but at least get rid of the half naked hookers in the process why should i as a player have to face this sudden mea culpa that doesnt fit with other things ive seenit just seems really weird to me some people might not like a little cleavage but its hardly the worst game out there in terms of clothing and there are other things in eve id consider worse plus i cant make any sort of rhyme or reason out of it and im left scratching my head
it such a minor thing but it hints about ccps vision for a younger player baseeven in a kiddy game like wow you can walk around in your underwear but you cant in eve
yes if someone wants to run around in there undies let them gee they cover more than the 50s bathing suitim waiting for the thongs soon hmm even the man thong women love that
since gas clouds are kinda restrictedbanned in high sec why not make a pirate vessel which is used for gas cloud harvesting everybody knows gas clouds are used to either make drugs or forbidden technologies given the requirements for production so it would make perfect sense and give a new market for pirate vesselsnormally im against a better ship for such a limited industry but if it could only be built outside of empire it would make perfect sense i envision it as being similar to a gila in terms of attributes with a 100 m3 drone bay and 50 m3 bandwidth but with the following bonusesspecial ability 75 reduction to gas cloud harvester cpugallente cruiser skill bonus 5 to cargo capacity and agility per levelmining barge skill bonus 5 to shield resistances per level
1also with these new vessels maybe add more uses for gas to keep pricesdemand up
i dont know both the ferox and the myrmi make great gascloud harvesters i agree of course how could i not a dedicated gasharvesting ship would be a real benefit receiving benefits related to its intended purpose flying a bc is alright and it works well enough but thats not what its designed fora good gascloud harvesting ship would require decent cargo space and a minimum 5 bonus per level to either cycle time or amount cycle time might be preferrable and thats just a bare minimum it would also have to be fast with a decent align time and be capable of sustaining a reasonable tank alternatively it could be capable of warp disruption immunity or other factors which would allow it to function in null effectivelya t3 industrial would be nice for that matter being able to be configured for various exploration tasks gascloud harvesting hacking archaeology and mining among them with changes elsewhere granting interdicion immunity higher agility and other things aside from t3 frigates and possibly destroyers and possibly battlecruisers andor battleships the t3 industrial ship would be among the top things id like to see introduced in eve wishful thinking perhapssupported
sure why not its the only thing i currently use my brutix for to be honest be nice to have a specific ship
qaft when i was noobish and first became able to fly a covops i made a point to travel to lownull to view some of these very things the eve gate was encouraging but the rest of the points of interest on the map simply were not there after trying 3 of them i just gave up
ccp just added a ton of sites to the game about one per system on average the reason there arent more is due to the amount of time it takes to code a site laying out objects spawn points etci do agree that some things should be included but no major revamp should be taken care of theres enough for ccp to worry about already and a massive backlog of issues to take care ofwhile i do support it somewhat im gonna have to defer to fixing the problems of eve rather than adding in eye candy not supported
yes more to the gameyes i know it takes time ccp but in the long run i think it is a good ideal
new features always welcome
treaties please since they are sort of important for making a lot of the changes in dominion not be meaninglessi dont even care about new stuff after playing eve this long i just want the old stuff to deliver on its potential theres a ton of stuff in eve thats just mediocre to downright bad that could be great if anyone actually spent time on it
i think this  with respect to fw  has been passed by csm but it still hasnt been fixed so i support it clearly its bad to have a world wide mmo where the good content only spawns during a certain time zone
the active repair bonus is only useful in very small pvp situations and doing solo pve work my proposal is that it also includes repair receivedso instead an astartes bonuses would read like thisbattlecruiser skill bonus 5 bonus to medium hybrid turret damage and 75 bonus to armor repairer and remote armor received effectiveness per levelcommand ships skill bonus 5 bonus to medium hybrid turret damage and 10 bonus to medium hybrid turret falloff per levelrole bonus 99 reduction in warfare link module cpu needwhat this does is allows for certain ships to be an option due to medium to large size fleets doing ehp and remote repairs
1 its worth remembering that even with this boost resist bonuses would still be more powerful because they also provide ehped perhaps the phrasing could be battlecruiser skill bonus 5 bonus to medium hybrid turret damage and 75 bonus to all arm
active armor tanking is a horrible horrible bonus and definitely needs looking atsupportedinb4 troll accusation
i think the idea definitely warrants discussion but if you look at the description and effects of a command ship this bonus is applied fleet wide with a specific command module i find it rare that a guardian under the command of an armor linked damnation could keep a ship alive unless your already dead due to 10 hostiles locking you as primary
id rather have it changed to a 5 resist bonus but thats fine too
in todays eve active tanking is plain horrible and only the rr is powerful  if you have the people1600mm plates  3x trimarks or lse ii  3x field extenders completely dominateits passivebuffer tanking that should be looked at it shouldnt be so strong
i support the proposalhowever the idea shall not be limited to armour tanks only but to include shield tanks too there are ships that receive a bonus to shield boost amount and these shall get the same attention as the active armour tankersthe proposal itself will not change much with regard to blob fights which is the cause for most of the currently perceived imbalance of ships and that is something i would like to see being fixed before patching up ship after ship and module after modulestill the proposal does not change the distinctive characteristics of the races but adjusts the active tank bonuses to be of the same value in fleets as the resistance bonuses this a good thing
i have a better idea increase armor rep bonuses from 75 to 10 and 10 to 12
yea good ideal that way if you make a deal someone can give you coords now if we could just fly the ship better
supported 2nd proposal is best but either would be incredibly useful
i dont see anything wrong with this ideasigned z
the alternate solution is the only one that makes sense but i would modify it slightly and say allow any item to be dragged to compare window from anywhere including but not limited to market contracts assets hangar etcpersonally not a fan of more clutter in the context menu the compare feature does not see nowhere near enough use to warrant such a placement
due to feedback on my mains thread and the fact she has a forum ban  i have decided to revamp the idea to include said feedback in a new thread because i cant edit the old onecynosural field generator changesthe self destruct timer on a ship is cancelled if the ship opens a cynoany ship that jumps to the cyno automatically receives any aggression timers the cyno ship already has and receives during the jump once in system any further aggression the cyno ship receives no longer applies to the ship that jumped to the cynoif a ship jumps to the cyno and the cyno ship is destroyed before it can load the system is placed in a random noncyno jammed system within its jump range high sec systems are also excludedsome examplesi want to farm level five missions with my nyx and need to jump a few systems over to get to it currently what is most commonly done to insure a 100 risky free jump is to have a throw away cyno frigate to initiate self destruct then a few seconds before it explodes open the cyno and jump to it because the cyno ship is dead before my nyx can load system i appear at a totally random safe spot in system ready to cloak and no one ever had any hope to catch mewith the new system this of course would not be possible to get to the system without showing up next to the cyno i jumped to thus adding some risk back into the mechanic of jumpinganother example would be a fleet wants to do some hot dropping or capital blobbing currently any ship will do for the cyno but the smaller and cheaper the cyno ship is the better less risk in the isk for the cyno ship also the smaller the ship the longer it takes to lock it and kill it to try and keep the entire blob from dropping on youwith the proposed changes if the fleet wanting to spew their blob all over another fleet jumps to the cyno and the cyno ship dies any ship that did not load system before it died is now in some random system with an aggression timer and low on capacitor provided it is a capital ship if it is a ship that does not have a jump drive it will be in a random system that was within the titans jump rangeso the fleet that was hot dropped was able to prevent a portion depending how fast it was able to destroy the cyno ship from making it to the fight sub capital ships can of course try and burn to the system to join the fight but it will be some time before the capital ships have enough capacitor to be ready to jump again capital ship in a system with no station to dock in no pos to hug no cloak and fifteen minute aggression timer have fun a smarter attacking fleet could split up their ships to jump to different cyno use a larger ship that can take more punishment and possibly cyno the fleet not directly into harms wayas always commentsragesupport
what problem are you trying to solve other than the minor issue of cynos broadcasting your presence in system to all and sundry
this dude is reaising a seious issiue wth peoplefullest support
 yeah
have the sansha influence meter affect moon goo outputsansha influence is 100 then moon goo output is 0 sansha influence is 70 then moon goo output is 30 you get the idearemember it is not forced pve at all you can simply wait till the sansha move or hire some other people to clear it for you
good way to get more alliance involvment in lowsec terrible idea so far given that incursions areaunder ccp controlbccp has already made some serious booboos recently regarding favoritism to certain factions tcus being removedmagically unanchored warp disruptor bubbles etccan you imagine the threadnought would spring into being if an alliance was gearing up to assault another region and all of a sudden sansha incursions appeared and stuffed up their income and logistics how about if it happened repeatedlyuntil ccp can demonstrate it is truly impartial they ought to keep mechanics like this very separate from the 00 playerbase
omg the tsunami like tears from coad really poring over to assembly hallyou guys are so quick to cherry pick what best suits your argument all the time bawww people we dont like were able to evade us because they understand how the game mechanics are currently working more than we do that bubble bug has been around for a good while now i experienced it first hand myself up in spacemonkey alliance space i had a tower with bubbles anchored on it to catch little monkey bombers and for some reason there was one bubble that would be offline after every downtime petitioned it and a week or so me and a dev investigated it and tried many things still we could never figure it out before monkeys sosd the entire nc and i had 800 nc captials evaporate the tower shame reallywhat is really gonna burn your bottom is if nc didnt ultra blob everything the tower would have lasted a lot longer and it most likely the bug could have been fixed now imagine if your bubbles didnt bug after down time awwwwww things that could have beenso you guys need to cut that tinfoil hat  out and grow the  up already your so quick to forget about that super cap fleet and assorted other capitals that magically respawned in the waiting hands of the nc a while back it shouldnt of happened but it did just like the bubbles around the it capital fleet should have been online after down time but they were not get the  over itso back to my proposal if you dont like it that is fine but dont for one second list the reason being because ccp would use it to batphone people out of trouble seriously you guys are truly pathetic
1 to the htfu sentimentsseeing some expanded penalties with incursions could be nice although knowing where to draw the line is important asteroid belts might not have as high qualityquantity ore as well as far as moon goo perhaps just cutting it t
this
i think expanded is correct but not enough this is a full on invasion and some people just go about their days mining when you invade a country your stopping all supply you dont let the farmers and workers to just walk past the front lines and go about their business i think in order to make these incursions a serious deal we need to have the belts scouted by sansha maybe even have sansha mining ships with guards present this is an invasion again and i would imagine sansha kuvakei would be taking advantage of all the benefits of war whether there is ships actually mining or not their should at least be ships stopping his enemies from gathering resources when you think about it what do we always do in war bomb the factories processing plants etc that make and assemble war resources and weapons we did it to germany japan italy they did it to the french polish hungarians etc i think the turnout for incursions could be so much more massive and have a more serious undertone of your not going to ruin my life in character not emo addiction if the underlying market got a massive interruption of supplies and resources
yes all infrastructure and upgrades must be destroyed if incursion is not beat back
of course youre provably wrong as the socalled batphone has been a big issue in the past and its strange how the bubbles only around their supercap towers disappeared noi do feel this is an issue and thats why i am not supporting your proposal until there is absolutely no question about the impartialityrandom nature of what space gets affected by the incursions  its just too open to abuse of the kind that weve seen many times already thats all
seriously take off the tinfoil hat for once now gtfo of my thread if your just gonna mope around
the issues that you bring up are not game mechanic related and while i understand your reservations its founded under the basis that ccp is just simply corruptwhether or not that is the case regardless of the many times people say it happens that is neither here nor there how favorable did it seem when it was announced that the drone regions were to be the only place where you can get what i would equate as t3 drones at the time i was a resident of the parts and we quickly lost it due to a massive invasion we were originally inhabitants because no one wanted the space no bounties etc however we were not prepared for the onslaught that ensued and we lost the space if you have a problem with people abusing the system as obviously intoned in your message your gaming life will always be an angry one as will your real lifethe idea has its merits and its downfalls but if my moon stops producing its incentive for me to do something other then station spin when i am bored it also has that realistic element that eve attempts to apply to many situations that all other games seem to gloss over if your counterpoint is to argue its only a game well you just debated yourself out of the discussion the point of eve besides being fun is to also offer you a sandbox a spice of gaming life what spice is there to life as a moon miner if your primary concern is obtain charters defense and refueling there is only 3 reasons why and easily avoidable at that that a moon would stop producing on you that same moon can net players billions as a with my industrial toon who can manufacture invent research process and do anything that is not combat in game i can tell you i still want a hard time when it comes to making isk because its a game whats the fun if i log in and have isk just thrown at me with nothing but monotonous change of the clock to keep me company
sounds like a good idea if they can replace belt rats affect mission income and cyno jam systems surely they would knock out moon operations as welljust report him for trolling and making off topic posts with any luck he is a repeat offender and gets a break from posting
ive made many other posts in this forum and my intention isnt trolling unless its my alliance affiliation youre paying attention to other than what im sayingi do have to admit im somewhat taken aback by your inability to decouple the politics from provable fact but what else is new
makes sense
interesting ideagiven that it would be very easy for established alliances to dispatch 20 guys clearing them out in no time i dont see a reason why not
100 agreepos fuel costs should go up toothat will make everyone work together even if they are enemys
i read this as incursion code from 2010 now affects the pos code from 2003 so no not supported
theres already enough negative effects from incursions the empire ones are being cleared long before their timer runs down so no more incentives needed atm the null sec ppl whore ignoring the incursion should be free to do so without additional penalty
i like this idea nerfing incoming moon goo would be a good idea to incursions5 for making test people whine in this thread
supported
not supportedmaking no sence it their own lose just ignore the incursion
not supportedany proposal regarding incursion at this early time is too soon to be of any value
sanshas divert moon goo into building themselves some more supercarriers
problemoverviews while pruned to each users liking can be lag induced chaos in even the best situations leading to unintended concord interventions friendlyfire and simple lag loss all of which inadvertently get blamed upon ccp in an unfair manner after nearly shooting a concord protected shiplag delayed the overview adjustments and i started locking an empire npc during combat the following idea spawned in the back of my mindsolutionhave an overview drag system akin to the current chat system detailsmultiple overview windows can be created by simply dragging the tabs about your screenpilots would be able to dedicate an overview to hostile or friendly stargate or stations etc without concern of a lag induced missclick that leads to so many lost shipsreduce the number of petitons complaints and foul language thrown at ccp for something that is not at faultexpand the functionality of the ui to support the new approach to multidisplay gaming in evesince the server sends the same information to the client the client would be left up to parse the information for the separate overview tabs at which point it is reliant on the machine to display the information correctlyi know some people would say well just remove certain things from your overview in actuality very few people have a cut and dry overview of only hostiles i tried that but quickly found myself adding things such as corpses containers and debris that would decloak a ship shortly after i am looking at a screen that is entirely filled with white icons and your left waiting for the screen to finish sorting targets before you dare clicking them otherwise your wasting both valuable lock time and either dying or letting targets get away
i have gotten the impression that at the moment the server sends out only that data the visible overview needs if this is the case  multiple overviews would add significantly to lagif however it only adds clientside lag  this would be greatall they would need to do is allow you to detatch some of the overview tabs already available
i have overviews specifically designed for every situation i could possibly forsee bc logistics tacklers decloakables celestials having the functionality to see multiple overviews without clicking back and forth andor reloading them would be really niceall the information presented by your overview is handled via the location node on the server it has to send your client everything anyway so the physicshappy dancing laz0rs of death look right when rendered by each individual client your overview just pars down whats being presented via the client ex the presence of celestials on your overview celestials are still present in the system just not being displayed via your overview andor brackets you can still interact with them as your client knows theyre present
we already have tabs in the overviews use those and switch between them
not really a comparable solution since you would have to contantly click betwen the different tabs and you have very limited number of them so you end up putting more stuff in them than you really want to the tabs are better than not having any options to alter beetween but a whole secondary overview would be a much better option to have and a clear improvement to the current situation you could always just use the one and the tabs if you dont feel the need to use secondary overviewsas an example i would love to have a primary targeting overview totally separate from an utility overview the primary overview would determine what you see in the main view in space but you could target things from any secondary overviews too
this was actually suggested as part of the big wins fan favorites  low hanging fruit ui proposal last fall crowdsource and implement a complete redesign of overview filtering and presentation oh and multiple overview windows would be nice  yes we know it might reduce client fps let us decide about that tradeoffit was a good idea then and it is a good idea now
ice mining is an incredible boring part of eve its also necessary for the operation of a pos it is in desperate need of an overhaulmy suggestion is the following introduce a new layer of game play to pi through tech 2 buildings tech 2 buildings produce the power requirements for an orbiting pos perhaps the player is required to carefully manage reaction rates that produce the materials and the alignment of the gravity sling that transports the materials directly to the pos perhaps they need to make sure that the periods of highest output of power match when the pos is on the same side of the planet this would create lots of opportunities for interesting decisions based on the resources of a planet its day length and the power requirements of the pos since the fuel requirements of pos vary as does the composition of planets certain planets would favour being paired with certain types of posbenefits removes a boring macro friendly part of the game ice mining makes a pos dependent on the planet it orbits making the dust514 link more meaningful and gives players another means to disrupt an enemy in addition to the traditional shootituntilitpops they could jam the transmission of power or hire mercenaries to take out the facilities encourages corporations to invest in their space to spend time developing their area and encourages them to maintain smaller areas of space rather than spreading out over a loosely defended empire
yes ice mining is mindnumbingly boring however its something that needs modified not replacedanyways your idea has a few faults for one poses operate around moons not planets second wormhole ops would be completely selfsufficient destroying the need to ever leavethere are many more but for now not supported
it is a pain we need a better way of doing it
im with liang and i would be against this change as the op knows i think it goes in the opposite direction plexing should have nothing to do with wasting ammo on red xs but i wont belabor the issue i am supporting this discussion because the plexing mechanics need some work and its a bad idea to continue with plexing being sort of pve and sort of pvp and a whole lot of boring this proposal pushes it more in the pve catagory i am against that but i think the players should discuss it and state their views
oh but people do defend when applicable problem is that the system as it is allows a t1 frigate to cap all plexes without firing a single shot yes even minor are being speed tanked those ships are made for that single purpose and head for the hills at the first sight of an enemy so a lot of people just dont bother entering anymore other than to chase it outthe fix itself should not require a whole lot of work as it is essentially just drawing on existing missionexploration contentall too well problem is that i and others have brought it up intermittently for two years and counting ccp do not currently as far as i am aware have any plans to do work on fw for at least another year maybe morethere are so many flaws with the fw implementation that it will take a lot of manpower to bring it up to speed so i just dont see it happening anytime soonusing npc destruction as a stopgapbandaid would force plexers to use appropriate ships thus removing most of the altgaming in that area at leastthose committed to plexing will do so regardless which means that a lot more actual ships will be inside rather than roadrunner frigsaddendum edited original post with missing request
with the new patch the primae has a hold of 1600 but command centers are 1000 can we get 2000 storage
its hold was originally sized to be able to hold at least 1 of any kind of command center after the changes it still does so
yea how about just cutting us off from ccp that way they dont know what we want hmm lets just play sto
henry haphorn impersonates dr evil as he drives up to wartech2 in his electricpowered boss seathow about no you crazy troll alt
my forum bot just pinged me telling me of this awesome bot threadccp have a schedule that is laid out 618 months at a time if you look at all previous issues that have been raised then youd see that they do get around to them when time permits  since this fad hate the bot is brand new the only times that ccp cancels ongoing work to rectify something is when the game or ingame mechanisms are under imminent threat botting has been around since forever so even if it is increasing it is apparently not yet at a level where ccp feel it necessary to postpone their prancing barbie projectif you got a hardon because of the isk involved then id suggest you look to the moons and sanctums instead as the income from those far outstrip anything garnered from the belts
all they have to do is read the forum and it seems that they already doi see threads since 2  years about blasters and rails about blaster and rails platforms about dronesjust saying
please lockremove this thread
yes making the 1000th thread about the same topic discussed for the 1000th time is going to change somethingseems to me you people lack the necessary intelligencediscernment to figure out what ccp is trying to say
i fully support removing this thread of the assembly hall from the forums
a little harsh but ill ask since you didnt say and seem to believe you know what ccp is trying to say what do you believe ccp is trying to saywindjammer
i really cant fathom why this isnt allowed you have to pick up the stuff eventually anyway i can do virtually everything else from far away so why is this the one thing i have to be in system for
i suspect its because it gives you another huge massive storage facilityand if you were doing pi in a wh then that would be even a bigger advantage
making it a manual thing also limits the amount of automation that can be done would be rather silly if you could do everything from one central location and then spend 10 minutes running errands once in a blue moon
thats exactly how it already works you just have to pause and launch your crap first right before picking it up for some strange unknown reason instead of being able to do so beforehandbut actually i suspect its to insure youre on the same location node that the resources are being passed to from the pi node probally due to some immense codefail of ccps becasue you really shouldnt need to be who knows what other random reason it might be
yea even wow has itplus in the station you can buy new clothsdifferent from the start up ones
if people dont start some real rabble and soon  this is going to cost you UFFFD each time you do itmicrotransactions are bad
no it wont the accessories might but retaking your photo or changing your hair style or color wont ccp has already said theyre going to allow you to retake your photos at will in a coming patchexpansion they have to make the photo taking free so youll be tempted to buy the accessories
id like to believe this is true but i havent seen any statement that it will be free  let me know if you havekeep in mind that you used to have to pay a microtransaction to modify your portrait in the old system i dont think its a leap to say its a possibility you will have to in the new systemi keep getting a bad feeling incarnas going to involve way too much of my wallet
lets get some ideas down for the colorblind folks im not quite sure what would need to be altered for a colorblind person
honestly the more i think on it the more i realize i dont have any color issues with this game maybe in the pi scanning but who looks for anything besides the hotspots anyway
i would be happy if they just put a line through the damned zero and and at the bottom of the lowercase l but apparently even those 10minute changes which eliminate an insane amount of frustration are too much to ask
supporting all ui improvements since 2007
supported
if you have more well thoughtout ideas do share them id like to consolidate all of our requests into one post
they already do that now the difference is those border incursions dont spread home
i would support for this reason alone
change it so moon goo output reflects that of the sansha influence of the constellation sansha have 100 influence then 0 moon goo output sansha have 70 influence then moon goo output is 30change it to that and you have my support
if you want to use incursion to kill macros you made it wrongnot support
first time i seen them i was starting an alt doing explor tut and i went into a jump next think i knew was there they were and i could not even turn my ship around well short story i got pop then i laugh my ass off only in eve this could happenwell what do i think i love it and we should see more of them and i dont mean in low sec i mean look out carebears well at least it will keep them on though toesyes eve needs them it keeps the spice in the game
op has a valid argument pirates always think they can force pvpcalled ganking ya know down carebares throats lets try another way round for once and i would absolutely fall off my chair laughing if they would take away sovereignty or system upgradesor i can imagine sansha mothership chasing people around the systemand if lowsec becomes one giant incursion to hell with thats more useful than what it is now
gosh dudei hope ccp can hear you and i hope they will do that
excellent i hope this happens its about time something has some real consequences other than the if your stupid your ship gos pop lol
of course i support  otherwise it is justm pointless feature that was wasted hours of delelopers time
kinda supported if undefeated the incursion should move to an adjacent constellation but the original would despawn
yeah i can see it now incursions magically appear everywhere except delve
supported
not supportedwhen you try to punish players they will not get to low sec or 00 but just quit the game maybe you dare to bet if they will but the ccp will not to
good those sovnull farmers should quit plenty of people more than willing to go there and take their places if not for the mom blobs
yes if fully agree i have to open them up to see if they are copies such a pain
good idea supported z
supported this is actually one of the reasons i never bothered with invention and t2 production back when i was learning eve
10
hmm in the station i would like to have a store or bar that would be niceor set up some kind of biz in them or even be able to set up a small station or somewhat near other station as a trading spot
wow i didnt think anyone would bring up this ancient topic but oh well since i am open to criticism i guess i can make a few changes to my original ideainstead of producing other peoples ships and being a broker agent lets just keep it limited to just being able to see yourself build a ship that you will own and fly using a bpobpc that you bought along with materials that you acquired we can still keep the npc agents if pilots are too lazy to do the work themselveshow about it that way the isk sink is still there and there is more interaction rather than some boring old poker game in stations i suck at texas holdem anyways
i would suggest creating a new topic in relation to visibly seeing your ships being manufactured as far as modules the time durations would not warrant a separate rendering of the output as far as the other stuff main reason you would not want to be a broker is when would you sleep i would imagine griefers getting orders would dock in a station they are sieging sign on as a broker then do nothing or process nothingthe idea is sound the actual reality that is gamers is the fault so your suggestion isnt a bad one just one that will not work as far as implementation unless you had personal vendors like ultima online or final fantasy etc that just brings up new questions about why are all the vendors dressed like hookers or completely stark naked
true well in a effort to keep this topic from popping back up again i ask the moderators to please lock this thread it is after all an old thread
wish we could summit our own logos for the corp like the alliance has yea i know there should be a charge but at least it would be more personal
lol hell why not
sound kool but too much on the engine we need other stuffi say na
id rather have option to hide portraits unless i check their details doesnt really make much sense to see moving heads everywhere
yea im for it now are they going to be naked
if you want the corpses more realistic replace the current models with a pulpy decompressed mass of flesh that has been frozen onto the skeleton either that or a small urn as most weapons used in eve wouldnt leave much by way or organic remains
that or have a bank system where you can get something out of it well if you put lots of isk in iti mean they always take money from us why cant we make it back in savings
yea i love icandyand if you dont like it have it where you can turn it off
yes i think this would be more fun if fix rightgive some more ideal players
still i dont like ityou really can not key bind like set two commands together like some other games ive seensay launch your drones and engage with on key stroke i dont even see where you can launch your drones yet maybe im missing it or its just not there
why am i think of simmsbut it should have more rp to it even in fable you can have sex but it comes as a price to it
to start this off do they keep making quafeok now to the subjectwe should consume the items like say quafe and when you do it maybe adds one point to perception for about 5 min that way there will be more trade in it well different holoreels will show a small movie say i dont know yet how but i guess it can be done and say the coffee does something to you like make you faster at shooting for a small amount of time what im saying is i would like to see the trade in these item move more they did it to booster why can the other items do somethingi would like to hear your view on this
sounds new and interestingi like this ideaim wondering how do you consume exotic dancers prostitute etc lol and the effect
well the dancers and so you can drop them off at a pi and the work gets better think the workers are happy after a while they get used go figure
apologies if this has already been suggestedsimple idea no wall of texti suggest implementing a feature to show the amount of items in a container into the name of the containereg small audit container 23the figure in brackets represents items in the container that way at a glance you know if a container has items in or not
oh and i support the idea p
yea that might be nicebut what about the spam containers you know what i mean they are all over the place taken up space
okay thx for clearing up my mistake but i think still it should be changed simply due to the very clear lack of poss in those systems since they are easily targeted by capitals but yield too little isk since they cant moon mine or do reactions
yesand it would be nice if it can export to more stuff nothing else to a site so you can look at it on the inbrower with eve
any work in this area would be appreciated its really dated and needs some tlc
having signatures on our mail in the game would be nice i do get tire of copy and paste all the time
does make sense to me
i petitioned to get rid of this channel spam and got the generic replyunfortunately no at this time it is not possible to fully disable that chat window when going through incursion systems the sooner we can get rid of it the better
well if you have to pee i guess you would want to leave your pod but i dont see why you want to in spacelol is what i think
i do agree the poses needs lots of work
that would be nice that way i can keep up on some more stuff
this proposal begins with a simple premise local either needs to be removed completely or put into delayed mode for low sec and null sec however since this fundamentally changes the game mechanics something is needed to be put into place to fill in the overwhelming gap that simply removing local would createhere is what i propose give every ship a dscanner that actively scans a given range around the ship the dscanner will still keep the previous functions and you will be able to use it as before but when you close that window the dscanner actively scans around the ship and alerts you to any presence including corp mates and such this alert will include the ship type and the pilotin addition to this the dscanner will have filters but not in the traditional sense what will happen is that when in fleet the system must be synchronized with other fleet members before leaving in order to turn alerts off this will be a 10second process in space or could simply be done instation automatically after the fleet is formed this could be useful in certain cases since that is not all for the dscannerwhen you join a corp or alliance the dscanner can also be synchronized with that alliance or corp and allow you to either turn off alerts for that corp or keep it on in case you are up to nefarious deeds any personcorp registered blues can also be applied to this if a red or neutral player enters within range of anothers dscanner then that persons dscanner will give automatic alert to that person and whoever else is in fleet it will include information on fleet size and ship types it will be possible to alert entire corps or alliances based on size of fleet and editable if one wishes such filters or options will only be available to directors ceos or fcs and the fc will have these options per each fleet that they form ie each time they form a fleet they will be presented with the option to turn these off or oni could go on but i think the rest of my idea is rather unagreeable with others so ill leave it to this for nowedit and of course the entire reason i posted this and forgot to mention is that cloaked ships and covert cyno fields will not be detectable by this scanner
yes please most people chose their avatars racebloodline when thier pic didnt matter much and racebloodline did nothing but change the system you started in
ridiculous removal of killmails is going to somehow encourage people to play worse ultimately in this game or any other victory is defined as killing the other guys stuff the best way to do that is to blob with other likeminded individuals and camp gates use overpowered modules like ecm hotdrop etc whether you have access to the record of your success or failure is irrelevant though it would make the game feel more pointless to remove it if you havent noticed blowing stuff up in eve is not that fun on its ownactually this topic seems like a troll upon reflection
i agree i miss my long hair
since most of us are growing really concerned with the rise of macro bots in eve online and their negative impact on the ingame economy many of us have put forth a lot of ideas on how to deal with them most of which have been talked about repeatedly and we all know that ccp doesnt have the resources to deal with these bots in an individual level there are so manywell in a weak attempt to help fight the long fight against bots which so far has officially turned into a war of attrition let me propose my own ideain the current setup of eve online there is the obvious bounty office in which pilots can post isk bounties against other players anonymously and then other players can then hunt them down and kill them for the isk what i propose is a new feature in which players can anonymously post on the macro bot bounty office about a possible bot in eve the rewards can be anything including ships  modules not just iskthis list is broadcast to everyone throughout new eden just like the list in the regular bounty office in addition if suspected bot has been given a bounty by a large enough number of different pilots the client should then send out a message to ccp to investigate the suspected account if the account has been confirmed to be a macro bot user then ccp has two choices1 make the confirmed bot and all related alts attached to the account and credit card an open freeforall target for other pilots permanently so that other pilots can gank the bot without having to worry about concord retributionor2 ban the users account personally i prefer option 1 as it makes it more fun for us
to answer your question theres actually alot that can be implemented to stop macrobot usage but doing nothing is not an option for me an easy way to do it was when someone filled a petition reporting a player a gm would then teleport to that reported player and engage in a convoa warning would then be issued before convo saying failure to engage in a convo with a gm may result in a warningbanif such player doesnt answer and continues to do things only a human should be able to like accepting missions change targets warp jet cans etc that gm will issue a warningban to that player plain and simplei really dont how this is so hard to do
actually if that is the only thing you have remarks about my candidacy i think im in the right path putting some  on force may help because im not that naive to think i can force ccp to do anything afterall its their gamei just chose such a strong word to express the frustration of our player base about how this matter is being handle by ccp and to reinforce that i will do anything humanly possible to force ccp to take action
and i know 20 moreneutral rr must die if you whant to fihgt have theballs to come oput and fight 15 minutes nondocking time and i fully support this highsec wars need to be a serious choise some 5 man griefer corp declares war and when they get their ases handed to them no big deal warp in nuetral rr save the ship dorck up in 30 seconds when timer runs out and play spintheship for the rest of the weekyou could actually make the time a few minutes if the r is in a player corporation then you can at least declare war on them but you should not be allowed to rr people if you are in a noob corp maybe just get yourself concorded right away or kicked from noobcorp
agree with you therevery very agreed if you stick your nose into my fight i should have the right to bite it off and spit it in your eyesomething to be said for this but i must admit i like taking advantage of my opponents inabilityunwillingness to study the battlefield
was sounding good until i realised all you wanted to do was gank people on undock1 is a mixed bag its easy enough to fight someone on station but being able to deagress and dock if they spike local with a blob is useful counter to blobbing on different side of that coin people blob on stations because hostiles just dock up if they dont stand a chance2 neutral repping is annoying making people war targets for rest of war sounds hard to implement and potentially problematic if you have a war on and you get a neutral to rep in missions for example logistics just needs to give docking timer aggression of the person being repped3 its annoying only for gankers like you and me sitting on station undock in a bumping battleship should not be encouraged any more than it istldr i want more consensual pvp not ganks
i can do that as much as i want simply because i live in 00 i dont have the restrictions in that departmentwhich ultimately means you need to play smarter want to undock to pew pew you better have intell on possible hostiles in next system on gateas it is now its easyplay to be a stationhugger and the risk of losing a ship is less than viable if you know what youre doing and have your spy alts or your friends spy alts outneutral repping is practicly chosing a side in a war and as i stated the neutral repper should get flagged as wartarget when he is repping during a fight we have annoying pop ups for about anything how hard is it to implement a pop up warning that the one you are about to rep has an agression timer from a pvp encounterrepping in a mission wouldnt trigger it thenand lets face it howmany socalled neutral reppers dont know their teammate in the mission is at war howmany people do you think actually fly around to make isk by neutral repping missionrunnerssorry to burst your bubble but i am not a ganker and till not too long ago i was a missionrunner and carebear we were wardecced several times and the annoying thing was and still is the stationhugging docking gameit wasnt us carebears that did the dockinggame but the hardcore gankersits actually the l33t high sec pvp corporations that would suffer more from it sincea they wont wardec 3 corporations at the same time that fast anymore because those soft targets might combine forces and own their tushiesb those l33t high sec pvp corporations will have to device more tactics than undock and be able to redock carefree because their ship gets a neutral rep without any agressioncounterso you see the ones who would be hurt more would be those corporations that think that undock and redock is the way to pvpconsensual pvp is bullcrap you consent into pvp the moment you undock ganking is a form of pvp like it or not but why would those who have a lot of experience in ganking have easy ways outand if you want consensual pvp just drop 1 ammo or so and let your designated consensual target loot it
personally id rather see jitas sec status dropped to 04 or lower would solve the congestion problem overnight and would also give people like the op something to really complain about rather than wasting time producing threads like this one
a hacklolno
