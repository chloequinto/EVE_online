amarr has been getting worse recently what we need is an option to auto block any message that has a link of any kindnecessity is the plea for every infringement of human freedom it is the argument of tyrants it is the creed of slaves  william pitt
remove jita local
because some folks see isboxer as automation and gives an unfair advantagenecessity is the plea for every infringement of human freedom it is the argument of tyrants it is the creed of slaves  william pitt
i still havent seen a solid argument proving this anyone who has said this has either never used or attempted to use this software or simply been trolling very funny your post also holds no data or proof of this as well
kms should only show person with final strike or person with highest dmg dealt atm everybody get on it and has perfect kd ratio so that everyone can feel special
also what could be done like the explosion effects can be turned off can we have this as an option to b4 i deside to leave the game my time left is 20 days approx now want to loose 3000 players see if that puts a dent in the gaming i will advise goonswarm of this too if you refuse to roll it back even my girlfriend has has similar effects with the gates like myself she by camera angle was sliding sideways and backwards then was facing straight i have even seen black jumping and a weird other colour like cream in your coffee then after the jump its fine the strain on the eyes from yanking the ship and then go through the gate moste of the bigger gates are all backwards did you not see that i llaughed at so many errors best to back it out of game or get a switch so we dont need to see it thanks

as im sure others have stated being forced to use a third party application in addition to the eve client is a less than optimal solution having to tab out of the game at the wrong time can get you blown up running yet another app in the background can be a performance issue in addition ccp removed functionality from the game that many of us found extremely useful and the new dynamic music system just doesnt cut it i spend most of my time in low sec and end up hearing the same 23 songs over and overi dont get why the csm members whove replied in this thread are so dismissive at least humor us and bring this issue up with ccp so that we can get a response straight from the devs as to why the jukebox wont be brought back
interesting thought i would not be opposed to this in conjunction with a general update to the arrayshrolt ceo live free die proud
you need proof that some people see it as automation you do understand the phrase right some folks see  it means some people have an opinionif you cant comprehend that not much i can do for yanecessity is the plea for every infringement of human freedom it is the argument of tyrants it is the creed of slaves  william pitt
wow because arguing semantics gets you places righteven a child could understand i meant proving that this is automation there is nothing within isoboxer that automates gameplay and i have yet to see solid proof of any arguments stating it is like you so immaturely made clear people see it as such and feel free to argue against it despite not trying it or learning about itautomation  auto miners and botsisoboxer  keystroke broadcasting if you think the two are the same you are wrong
i do not think isboxer is automationi do not think sending keystrokes across multi clients is automationhowever for a game that prides itself on sandbox style always on pvp in all forms  market ships mining  is seems odd that ccp would allow the use of a paid 3rd party application that lets one person control many accountsthe argument about the accelerated gaining of isk holds true on the   account level but when there are 20 players funneling money to one account that account breaks that spirit of the eulathis could be argued endlessly but the fact is having more that 5 accounts putting money into only one is ridiculous and will continue to drive people away from the gamewant 50 people to give you money for nothing start a culteditoh and the accelerated rate can easily be measured by the time it takes to alttab from client to client
seriously did you just create this character to copy someone elses old jokepretty lamejint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
im coming up to 1k bookmarks and i wasnt aware there was a limiti can easily see the need for that many if you consistantly travel through null  low and require safe spots gate and station tacticals etcso yes please can we increase the limit
this would be greattotally agree
post this module to build items such as pos tcu i hub pocoeasley done add this as an assembly array so you dont need a station to freighter to move the modulesbuild it in system in stead job done

1ccp said they would do this but then got distracted into fiddling with the way lp is paid out end result fw still broken i would love to know if this is still being worked on people who want to run and hide from all pvp would still be able to do fw
i didnt realize you could get the stats that way its very interestingseven of the top 10 in the victorypointslastweek section have none or very few engagements recorded on evekill those that do primarily lose unfitted ships or fit more than one warp core stabilizer for example the top character for victory points last week was mitsuyo ichinumi who only lost unfit condors devora dora 4th is only 2 weeks old and has no recorded kills or losses and last starfigter 7th has no recorded kills or losses others have very few kills or losses but are losing primarily warp core stabilized ships to ships with large alpha or those of us smart enough to fit multiple points and get lucky catching themedit in fact if you look at the corpoisk corporations kill history and members you will see that they are all losing unfitted or warp core stabilized ships and some members are have been on both sides of the war pak zeitgeist two of its members are in the top ten last week devora dora and last starfigter this is pretty obviously taking advantage of a broken system id love to link to killboards here
1i am in fw to easily support my pvp habit however not having the timers roll back is just silly both from a lore pov and a gameplay povi personally would also go a step further by removing lp for dplexing and add multiple single ship spawns in plex
personally i use afk cloak tactic all the time and heres why i have to do it because of the local channelif local did not show player names of everyone in system we wouldnt need afk cloaking its that simpleso lets remove local chat and get rid of afk cloaking at same time
youre not going to find a single person who opposes this 1 that enabling a switch characters or return to login screen button in the esc menu is a short fix requiring minimal dev time to implement for significant payoff in user experience  especially now with dct giving me a reason to switch between chars on the same account
hey csm dudes did ccp have anything not nda covered to say on this
 i know this is a repetitive topic so if it has been mentioned for this csm already please forgive me i did try searching for a similar topic but the only one i could find was back in 2011 as many of us from my experience anyway have already stated we would like better graphics in eve in fact this thread has nearly 100 pages of support for better graphicshowever i digress with ccp stating that they are concerned about people not having computers which can support higher quality graphics why not release the better graphics separately so that for examplemachinima creators can make better films this should help everyone as ccp only need to release the better graphics they can make it limited through registration if they do not want everyone having them while the players can effectively give free advertising to eve through their machinimasi would like to know what you guys think about this idea as well so many of us want more shiny and it is obvious not everyone can support it but if it is done this way the graphics can be slowly implemented to the community and it is up to the enduser as to whether they believe their computer is capable of handling it
i dont remember how many 100s of times i checked the show info window for ship  drone attributes im sure im not the only one losing himself in iti think infos in the attributes tab isnt clear enough and i was thinking about an easier way to display it could it be possible to make the attributes tab for ships and drones look like the fitting panel the info part on the right of the panel easy to check you can find the info youre looking for without even reading everything just looking at shieldarmordamage logos nor scrolling for 5min to see the info at the end of the list
its quite the testimony to the persistence of the eve community that this is still being chased a system that plays tracks that lots of people have said they dont like listening to but allows them to skip over for the tiny handful that they do like listening to if ccp can bring it back without crippling some other apparently unrelated system i say that they should given ccps track record for adding stuff without breaking other stuff though  hmmmmi think ill stick to listening to my mp3s and cds with the eve music turned off some of the eve music is good but sadly most of it is just noise and whales humpingi rate eves music on a par with wis utterly irrelevant and a waste of effort
i would agree with you mostly dorrann though i personally enjoy the whales humping but i think there is a very large difference in the development resources used by wis vs whats used by the jukebox it had the functionality to add your own music to the jukebox folder and play it ingame via the jukebox and to create your own playlists sadly i discovered this feature mere days before it was removed and i did not get around to playing with iti think if people knew about what the jukebox could have done for them they would have liked it more also i do not believe it costs much more development time and programming code than the ambient music system id like to have both in my game and a zone shouldnt have one 8minute track of nothing playing on an infinite loop not everyone makes a quick flight through nullsec before jumping right back to highsec there are people who actually live in nullsec shock they dont wanna hear that hissy crap 247
should role back a lot faster than they tick down imolike 4s every sec
absolutely agree with this proposal there have been several other threads on this subject so lets hope someone gets on sorting it outagreedalso i suggest multiple npc spawns during countdown say once every n5 minutes n being the original plex timer and balancing of npcs so that a cloaky stabbed condor cant take out npc cruisers sorry taoist only read your post after i posted xas for lp for dplexing that is less of a problem i thought it would be initially in terms of farming youll mostly see farmers offensive plexing usually in backwaterquiet systems anyway they are all about efficiency of their efforts so dplexing is not their primary concern if dplex payouts were to change id go with my original proposal made before lp for dplex was introduced  direct defensive plexing lps to system upgrade status contributions no lps for farmers but some rewards for defenders some other fw related stuff  would also be nice if they balanced fw missions across races but thats another story give us system upgrade benefits which were originally proposed preretribution
1 for this proposal  personally i think they should roll back 4 times faster so if a stabbed cloaky lp farmer cloaks up in a plex i enter i can hang around as a neutral pirate and let it count down quickly if the farmer isnt willing to fight for his
1 would love to see this implemented
i find it a little pointless having a covert ship in null sec when it can be easiy decloaked when caught in a bubble dont get me started on static bubblesallow a new mod like the t3 nullifer to be able to be added to covert shipsta
dear god no
i think they should shake up the complexes a bit remove the idea of small medium and large complexes its too predictable make multiple people decrease the amount of time to capture an area for of course reduced reward when multiple people do a plex as now maybe add those rollback timers maybe multiple capture areas of a complex say some will have three outposts instead of one and when you enter a plex maybe generate random npcs of same or different types frigs with battleships for example get rid of the acceleration gates
can you imagine the forum rage from the nullbear contingentjint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
first time you afk at station over 15 minutes you get warning second time ban afkers ruin my game
really this is your idea for the assembly hallits pretty lame just sayingjint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
aww so you dont like afk players and you want the whole community to change i thought ideas here were supposed to be for the benefit for at least a reasonable portion of the community to be afk is their decision and as is natural to eve it carries risks they choose to accept those risks leaving them a target for other players afk is part of the game and that is highly unlikely to change especially not through near immediate bans

at the least the largest refining array should be able to reach 100 or near 100 refine if my skills are good enough to get there really long wait times plus an at best max of 75 is stupid crazy
1 a year on adding my support to this ideaits never made sense to me that station refining is instant with full return and pos refining takes time plus limited to max 75 it should be exactly the opposite let the stations have instant refine but t
no if you dont like local then move to wspacean auto logoff if youre inactive after say 3060 mins or so is a good idea imo there is no legit reason to be maintaining those peoples accounts online if they arent at the computer now if they are at the computer then sure let them stay online but if they arent just log them off

while this woudl be nice and all for those videos it would never then be implemented in gamewhysame reason we dont have dx11 and wont have ti for quite a whileeve for whatever reason has a fairly large playerbase of people using oldasdirt computers with mulitple accounts running who will amit that yes they want shiny but they absolutely refuse to upgrade their computer for any reason and threaten to quit playing should they not be able to run all 5 of their clients at once on their stockwindowsxp
the above topic was deleted since the opening post was in violation of forum rulesforum rule 5 trolling is prohibited
hmmm i think i could get behind something like that 1
i have a question why do people say if you dont like local go to wspace does that make that a valid argument if so then can i present a new argument using much of the same wording if you dont like afk cloakers go to high sec if you dont like pvp go to hello kitty onlineif you dont like how people can affect you in a online game go play a single player gamedo you need me to continue next part a bot can be quite easily programmed to wiggle your mouse around so you can stay active
you dont even need a bot it can be done without breaking the eula and keep you onlinedestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
this is why i was proposing this it would not be implemented ingame instead an external download can be used to provide the texture maps needed when making 3d modelspictures and the like those who complain about their lowspec pcs dont have to download and shouldnt because they wouldnt be able to use them effectively anywayas far as i can tell the only reasons an external release could be blocked would be that ccp dont have the facilities to support the download or they dont want to release game assets publiclydont get me wrong i know the chances of this occurring is slim however as the csm is a player elected council representing the community in front of ccp it may be an opportunity to raise a longterm issue in a new way which may appeal to ccp while still offering some of us the opportunity to improve our creations
its faction warfare not carebear
can i get one of those birds that repeatedly dip down and position it so it just hits spacebar repeatedly to keep me active
im on the quit whining about afk cloaks side of the fence i mean seriously afk andor cloaked or not you play in a sandbox game where anything can and likely will happen over the course of your gameplay experience deal with it assume youre out in space with a suspected or known cloaky camper you cant know if hes afk or not but you dont need to let me go into a few scenarios for you1 safe spots if you fear that you may be attacked by a cloaked ship make safespots in your favored regionssystems not hard to do and it makes their goals more difficult to accomplish if getting ambushed while traveling the preestablished pipelines between gates and other landmarks dont use them make your own routes2 afk is afk for a reason any number of reasons really the bottom line here is the player has other priorities irl too just like you do just like i do for that matter count your blessings and quit with the poor me attitude crap you consented to this sandbox experience 3 if you have a problem with an afk camper cloaked or not how many star systems does this game offer thats right too many for me to even bother trying to count if one system has a camper relocate get on with your life and quit crying on the forums about your lack of creativity if relocation is not an option i promise you a wardec is sure to turn up the heat maybe the camper will react maybe not but i know youll get inside his head by doing this4 ever heard of spy vs spy find out where this guy lives and go pay his home turf a little visit with your merry little band of outlaws ive been involved in such tactics and it does work for a little while or a long while the point being if he is responsible to a corp or alliance they will call for his helpi could go on and on like this all daythere is always a solution to any problem that doesnt involve crying to ccp get creative and let ccp worry about more important issues than some whiny childish antics because you dont want to think on your feet
sorry that youre bad at evading decloakersmaybe you could try not sucking
i remember ccp showing some sort of tessellation video awhile back on how if roids broke into smaller pieces and scattered when they collided with a ship perhaps this idea would give that idea sustenance
no its much more about timecost of labor analysis copyright and client security to do the highres texture pack ccp would need to devote dev time to creating a method for the client resources to be loaded on the clients end depending on the texture packs available on the users machine regardless of a persons ability to render the textures ccp would need to handle multiple situations and provide debugging tools for cases where outdated textures might affect client performance then ccp needs to devote additional dev resources to maintaining the regular textures that ship with the client as well as the new highres pack in the end ccp doubles their workload for each patch where even a slight tweak to an alpha layer is the only graphic change as well adding methods to custom load a texture pack only increases the amount of information that the user can glean from the clients publicaccessible data the more you open up the client code to be poked around in the more possible security holes you open for botters and nefarious nerdowellers to exploit the client so on top of the dev resources to maintain the texture packs with each release you add additional dev time to security analysisfinally adding the texture options will only lead to headaches down the road during code refactoring eventually ccp will need to move up to dx11 as dx9 gets pushed out of the market the day is nowhere soon though at that time the engine will need some significant rewriting if its not already done anything that works with the graphics engine is going to need a finetooth combing to ensure compatibility and a highres texture option will only present additional headaches during a full code reviewthe highres texture pack would be awesome to have but eve isnt exactly like skyrim et al where mods can just be dropped in willynilly as an mmo ccp has to make choices based on whether they can devote the dev time to maintaining the project in the longrun we already saw the classic graphics option get dropped in favor of the trinity engine for the same reason dev time was being wasted maintaining old code and old graphics it might be nice for the niche group thatd really like the highres pack but its not really in ccps best interests to devote the devtime to the project in the long run
ok maybe i didnt explain what i was proposing properly what i am suggesting is that no changes should be made ot the client or any part of the actual game for that matter instead a situation like the following could occur a zip file is released by ccp which contains jpg and png files which can then be used to reconstruct the bump maps specularity maps and texture maps required for modelling anyway if ccp have already stated they have the textures and can give them to use now the only dev time required would be to dedicate a tiny fraction of a the server for the texture downloads
i dont see how this even has to be out of game a tiny company in the balkans managed to package spaceforce rogue universe with 3 separate rendering engines down to shader module 20 for the windows 95 usersthe visual difference between the 3 engines is absolutely huge making an interesting contrast when you switch between themccp doesnt even need to do new work just package the 2003 graphics engine back into eve and all the whine goes away
as an amarrian may i say i support this as well
they should come with a buyer beware sticker just look at what happened to homer destination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
afk cloaking  possibly the safest activity in eve for the risk adverse grieferwhich is why its fans seem to have so much time to post utter bollocks on the forums
thats a highly compelling and detailed argument you put forward do you have an rss feed or newsletter i can subscribe todestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
the one and only way to make covert ops be truely covert would be to remove it from localbut that will never happen because it would bring actual risk to 00 which would be completely unacceptable of course
ill take a big ol helping of suggestion b as well please
sorry for not replying sooner its a tricky line to tread i think i can say that theyre definitely still working on improving the launcher
as a gradea ship spinner myself i totally support this idea make it so ccp
you realize that art has stated that these 4x size ship textures are the ones they make in house from the beginning and the ones we see ingame are simply lower resolution versions of them they wont be doing twice the work to maintain the higher res v3 textures as the ones they work with before resizing and packaging are the high res onesyou make a good point about the packaging and delivery but this is what they offered to do the work for if enough support was shown
whilst i didnt like all the songs i loved the ability to pick and choose what i listened to and whennow having returned after almost 2 years off i have to go to soem other website out of eve not even able to use the igbshould we expect that to go soon too i meanwe have firefox chrome and ie for that too right having to tab out or what have you just to play music that was in the game originally but removed is really a sub optimal approch and suggested fix almost ot the point of being very very lazy designif it aint broke dont fix itwould be nice to get it back but i sadly doubt anything would happen especially with a csm that doesnt seem to care
agreed afk clocking goes against the spirit of the game no ship should be 100 safe in space this is what the pvpers carry on about when a mission runner or a miner loses a big ship to a ganker and complains about itafk clocking playing the logging off logging on game and covert hot drops in general make it far too easy for bad carebear pvpers with there fleets of billion isk black opps battleships covert tengus and bomber fleets to pick and choose easy targets and pad their killboards with endless kills of mining barges and complex running shipsone fix would be to make a long cycle probe that scans down cloaked ships in system like make it take 15 mins to get resultsanother would be to change the way covert cynos work so people who use them actually need to use them covertly not ontop of a warp disrupted target
thats like saying if you dont like afk cloaking move to high sec where the bad man cant touch youafk cloaking and local chat are 2 sides of the same coin you cant have one without the other any change has to effect both sides of the issue
optimism factor increased
option b winner i would like to take the opportunity to thank everyone for their support in this thread especially the csms please spread the word to any other players who would be willing to support this idea by adding their comments or likes to the thread and its true that most players agree that it is quite bizarre that such a common sense idea hasnt been implemented to date but i can confirm that after asking a ccp rep in help channel following the release of oydssey he did confirm that a majority of players have been asking for this and they will work towards it in future patches good stuff

i propose to help curtail data harvesting via that ccp raise the price for receiving a detailed killmail to 10 million on the part of the per individual bounty poster a bounty below that amount would still receive a mail but simply saying soandso has been killed and their bounty now is x isk a bounty over 10 million  or another amount if any people have ideas what would be a deterrant  would receive a detailed killmail showing all of the involved parties equipment location etcthank you for consideringthe grabbing hands grab all they can everything counts  depeche mode
can we please get some horizontal scroll bars ingame
why
bear with me ill just cloak up and put something together
bumping for visibility given the serious nature of the topicplease csms look into this
its been over a month has any dev taken the time to verify whether or not this is true
its already been confirmed that the igb is vulnerable to exploits that were patched in chrome 4x but no dev has commented on this which from an assurance perspective is troublingthe linked quote above is only a denial of service vulnerability that makes the browser crash which is fairly harmless but if a vulnerability that exists in chromium 4x still works then every other exploit newer than this also will succeedmany of them are serious sandbox violationsif you browse this website with the igb it clearly displays the browser version as chromiumchrome 3x and also shows that the igb posesses the ability to use host system java binary which alone is a known high security risk if left outdated
you posting stuff does not a confirmation make especially not in something of this technical of a nature
noted i am both experienced and qualified to diagnose issues of such a technical nature it only remains to be seen if the devs will actually do anything about it so far they have done nothing for several years
weird i ran the same website as you did it doesnt detect flash nor java probably because the igb doesnt even have flash or java plugins to begin with so it cannot bridge to the executables on the computer and i really dont know how you got this result on your igb
ive never used the in game browser because i have no control over it i either alt tab out or had my laptop on next to methis thread comes as no surprise tbh but thanks all the samedestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
if you only use internet explorer which less people do now than firefox or chrome you wouldnt have the correct flash plugin installed in your system its been an urban myth within the eve community for years that the igb had disabled features for added security such as not having flash player java and such but i submit that added security if it ever existed is more or less nonexistent with an ancient insecure web browser versionalso if the browser runs in its own process and can detect the host systems flash and java binaries it can potentially use them or they can potentially be usedalso if your using a mac that may be another reason why it wasnt detected the mac client runs in an emulatormy eve client also is not installed in the default location i dont know if anyone else will get a different result from that web page its entirely possible but if being installed in cprogram files is what the eve client relies on to provide security to the insecure software installed with it thats a poor security policyabove all else theres some hard questions for ccp to answer the csm needs to seriously consider asking them
if you had bothered to read the thread instead of jumping to conclusions you would have noticed that i already had previously posted my example of abuse on page 3
my suggestion is that ccp needs to not be halfassed about any kind of law enforcement system for one thing in order for a corp to be able to honestly label a player as a corp thief there needs to be a mechanic in place for member voting to pass by majority vote to decide if a corp member is a thief it doesnt need to require for 100 of the corp members to pass a vote due to random game times but it would need at least 75 of a corp vote imo there are plenty of mmos that are able to add all kinds of guild functionality so a voting system solely to convict a corp criminal is far from an unusual concept
really the game is all based on scamming have you played the game much there is a whole other universe outside of jita the reason jita is the largest trading hub in almost every mmo is because of the rest of the game scamming is part of eve lure and lore and legend its a sandbox that is as close to real world good and evil as a game can get the only thing missing in eve is prostitution for a good time call me brought to you by barony of vulnezia mmo micro nation wwwvulneziacom be a part of the worlds first mmo micro nation
1 depending on how it is implemented
basically promoting some thoughts of mine here
1the timer could go by how many are in the plexmore friendlies faster timermore enemiesneuts the timer slows and possibly goes backwardsso if a players of caldari is capturing a gallente and he is by himself then it goes normal speedif a gallente mil
i fully support any kind of timer resets or backwards running timers proposals it was even considered for inferno and i basically mentioned it in every thread i saw devs lurking back than but devs dropped it they probably ran out of time cant remember the reasonthere are several different versions which do more or less the same timer reset immediate backwards running slow but automatic quick decontest timer runs faster till default state is reachedso game designers would have enough options to balance it up and down could be even system upgrade lvl dependentso yeah 1edit what makes me a bit sad is that ccp repeatedly tried to fix the problem but they never fixed it at the root there is still no incentive to stay in a plex and fight plexers which run make progress with 0 risk investment still there should be no progress if you cant defend a plex plex layout changes didnt help people where complaining back then that they cant point plexers quick enough since the beacon was too far away from the warpin  bullshit that was not the problem the problem was and still is that there is no incentive to fight
everyone has a great point but the bottom line is that afk cloaking is faulty in the game only because there is no counter to itafk mining  its easy and its legal to do but there are ways other players can counter afk miners by bumping or gankingafk travel its easy lazy legal to do but there are in game counters to it called gankingafk missions was countered when they changed the npc ai to attack dronesafk cloaking anythingwaiting nope still no counter to it the afk cloaker has all the power i am all for afk cloaking but i am also for in game counters to itmy team at vulnezia university have already discovered a counter to afk cloakersits called acw or anti cloak warfarea depth charge module is fit to a destroyer class ship and has depth charges  it is used to hunt down and probe out any kind of cloaked vessel it is not perfect and takes patience but in the right hands a destroyer can hunt down and destroy an afk cloakernow if i can just get ccp to buy my depth charge module idea i will be filthy richbrought to you by barony of vulnezia mmo micro nation wwwvulneziacom be a part of the worlds first mmo micro nation
the counter is called local
indeed they can either close it or stop relying upon its instant intel so muchdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
t3 have those thats enough
im using windows 8 and im pretty sure that you need a working plugin to support the binaries for the browser which im pretty sure doesnt support pluginsit is indeed something that needs to be lookedat and this had been discussed at the fanfest that ccp didnt knew what they wanted to do with it since players where using it they couldnt really scrap it and updating it would be a hard thing to do my first guess is that they might be using webkit libraries for more then just browser but i could be wrong
if you had read the thread you would have seen me relying to that post with questionshow about some answers instead of silly posts suggesting gms viewsdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
err i missed something i did not know that every other mmo was infested with jita omg omg drama drama drama
i am a seller of plexmy job has me working 80 hours a weeki am lucky if i have 2 hours a week to playi am a casual playeri pay for subscription every 3 months for 3 accounti buy upto additional 9 plex to buy stuff so i can die in a horrid blaze of glory as i am a sucky piloti play the game to to have funi am the worlds worst industrialistwith the money i spend even though i am not active i fund ccp development equal to 6 subscriptionseve needs money to run its game and people like me i provide the income so progression of fixes and expansions will continue with out me eve would turn into you can play earth and beyond a game that is trying to be rebuilt by volunteers if there was not plex rmt would be rampant as if i had not been banned by then i would have been buying rmt isk to fund my activities resulting in bots taking up cpu and ccp getting none of my moneyyou say that when i loose a ship it does not hurti have had to endure extra long work hours my wage sucks to earn the cashwhen i buy something new sure i may buy expensive stuff unlike wow the having the best gear does not mean i will winso it does hurt
no now go crawl back under your bridge little troll
i dont see why an armed militia pilot will always make an unarmed weeks old farmer take off and they can wind back down the plex themselves and get their own lp if they want it its not like the farmer poses any danger to anyone with a gunthe plexes arent there for pirates to get goodfites or whatever so the fact that he isnt forced to stay in the plex when a neutral warps in is working as intended neuts arent supposed to have a big effect on the outcome of sovereignty or its gonna get abused to hell and back i sure dont want to see people starting to use nonmilita alts for defensive plexing because you get no warning in local that would be much worse than whatever frustration you get for not catching a guy with wcsfor the record i never used an unarmed or stabbed ship in a plex but i do sometimes warp out when some neut tard warps in sue me
what do you think the alt does while you undo the damage he did in the plex he plexes another system or waits at you in the other plex in the same system now you can choose tho hunt him around all the time or decontest in any case he already won since you alone can not undo the damage he did while he runs or plexes his risk investment 0 he probably multiboxes mutiple pexes at once your risk investment a combat ship he makes progress while running away you do not while willing to fight why should you plex in combat ships againwhy should you be able to take over systems without being able to defend the plex you are in imagine it is war and everybody cloaks
please note how you if you want to have the lp from the site you scared the farmer away have to run a timer for longer than default and get paid the same its unattractive to run these sites if youre for the lp so if you want those lp for yourself you ignore the farmer and go get your own plex and at this time you might actually just change ship to a farming wcs cloaky aswell which makes plexing a pve expierience unless you have guys entering plexes in hope for enemies who are also up for pvp wanna shoo away the bad farmer or actually get a fight and most of the time once a fights on the horizon people tend to call in as much backup as possible but cant blame em its their blindness for killboard effectiveness

thanks got myself a new sigalso i fully support this ive had some great fights against fw plexers but they are extremely rare
afk cloakers say local is the problem no more local for intel like wh space problem fixedafk cloakers say local is the problem no more local for intel like wh space problem fixedlets see in wh space you cant hot drop ether so that covert ops ship with scanner probes sitting afk in system becomes just that a covert ops ship with scanner probesin null sec lets look at what it is well it could be 20 bomber 10 ewar ships and 10 black opps battleships waiting to blow your ass up with 0 warning apart from local and instantly jump back out again once your pod is space dust all in the time it takes your pvp defence fleet to undock and thats in a cyno jammed systemwithout cyno jammingwell could be anythingso back to these reds sitting afk in local thing is we dont know if they are afk or not so yes an afk red cant hurt anyone but thats like saying falling from a 100 story building will not hurt either its the hitting the ground that hurtssame with the reds in local afk they dont hurt but when they have finished their sleep done an 8 hour day at work and gone to the movies to come back and see theres a mining op on or a bunch of battleships doing a complex boom he has his free kills no risk 5 mins spent at the keyboard and the easiest pvp in the game hell even high sec mission runner have more chance of losing a shipafk missionsgoneafk ice mininggoneafk freightinggoneafk gankingnext to go lets hopeedited to include no local in wh space also no hot drops and limited access points also wh space has better rewards too for those willing to put up with the short comings off it like no local no jump clones and no stations no markets and no friendsno local in sov space would mean every gate in null sec would need to be camped with fast lock ship just to run one mining operation and then covert opps ships still get through gate campssov space should be dependable if reds come into system all we ask is for a fair way off getting them back out again
wh space is completely different to null even if local was the same you cant compare the two and thats not the point the point is local is the reason people afk but stating this fact doesnt also mean that some of us want any change for we believe it is already balancedwhen people say that no one in wh space complains about afk cloakers its true for how would they even know they are there that is the point and nothing moreyou are correct though you simply do not know if they are afk or not this is the major flaw in that argument that gunslinger keeps highlighting this complaint isnt even about those afk its about active play and reducing the uncertainty associated with cloaking and its fuddling of local intelbut your claim of no risk is quite frankly ridiculous if you wish to hand an enemy no risk then you shoulder that fault completely because if you had accepted that he was most likely not afk you would have been ratting in a pvp ship in a gang or mining in a large group with protection in other words be preparedi couldnt comment on afk missioning as i find it boring as hell anyway and havent heard if people still do it or notpeople keep saying afk ice mining is gone but ive yet to be told exactly what stops them activating the laser and going afk as beforealso afk freighting is still very much alive but as always there are risks involvedthe final one no one and i mean no one has ever ganked anyone afk to even suggest this is to be quite honest ridiculous whats next comparing it with botting or would you like to also throw in the complaint that its an exploit pleasedestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless

while we are at it ccp should remove titans supercaps jump clones and charge 70 dollars a month lets get a real edge going man sarcasmworst idea ever
actually i agree with what the persons sayingi get ccps point of the dual training but i get this persons point of spending a plex cost of 20 dollars for it this alt will only be logged in training while there will continue to be only 1 allowable character to be used on the account at any given time so it boils down to this main character  already 1495 a monthalt character  1999 a monthonly one character can be used at any given timealt is only logged in to say 10 minutes a day to check skill training and some times not logged on for a entire week due to the length of some skillsso say you have one skill that takes 1 week to train and you need to do 4 of them for 4 log ins for a total of a months time it cost you 20  1495 for your main equaling 3495 just for your characterthis is no way a viable option and no offense but really screams greed lol i love eve and the idea of eve but that upsets me personally to see them do that to the player basebut then again i guess its like you said if you buy it with out wieghing the options i guess its the same as giving away 500mil isk for a cargo expander just a little crazy the scaming cause people dont do the math has gone beyond the game which is funny because if one of the players takes advantage of the game this way it breaks the rules lol i think eve is going to see most of the users for this like me will use in game plex bought from the market with isk ive earned and eventually lead this to crashing the plex systemanother example of this which proves the point i just created a alt mind you using a plex i bought with isk which makes eve 0 extra dollars and my first thing i want to train is spaceship command to level 5 why well simple this is one of the most important skills in flying anythingtotal training time coming out gate is 5 days and 17 hours now lets say i want to do this to another skill like say cybernetics so i can install implants and boost my training timewell there went 15 days for just level 5 then lets talk about the 5 other days it takes to get to lvl 5then there is caldari frigate for sure gonna want that up to atleast lvl 3 well there gos 7 hours the first lvl 1 day and 17 hrs the second lvl and then 9 days and 18 hours the 3rd so say i paid cash for the plexi spent 20 dollars for what here better yet let me tell you what i just paid for if i did pay cash i paid for a tune who cant fly with my other toon who is gonna take forever to be able to useso basically i paid for something to set and not be used for a couple monthsyay mewho knows maybe this is a good way for anyone to farm characters not a know it all but how i see it personallyjust my 2 cents dme slowly walks away

wow its hard to believe that a company who owns eve and makes hundreds of thousands of dollars if not millions a year can be so stupid enough to not listen to their own forums when some one says hey this is going to cost you out the ass so question is who pushed this idea the devs what they need a new feature cause i know the user base wouldnt of thought about this on a level where they pay 3495 a month for 2 accounts mind you and can only use onewho in their right mind is that stupidfor 2 accounts monthly your only talking 1495 each hello math alert thats 30 dollars or 299 a monthlolyour paying 3495 for 2 accounts one you cant accesshere let me break it down easier since obviously you have a problemyou have 2 home phones one you use 2 times a month and pay 40 dollars for the second phone you use about 50 to 60 times a month you spend 35 for the second phone you just wasted 40 dollarsi mean im worried about how many of you live in a shack piggy backed off someones network lol since you cant do normal math on investing your moneyok im done this is ing hiliarious lol
if nothing else then your ego is thriving parity what makes you think that an on paper unaligned entity making the same suggestion that entities from all four militias have been making for years carries more weight  hahahahahalast word was that ccp was rather happy with fw currently but i fear the truth is much more dire and that there are some in iceland who see the idiocy of current but are either hushed by higher up are experiencing a brain freeze when trying to figure out what can be donein any case good luck with your endeavour
i fully support this 1in addition i would support a few other changes that i believe would improve fw gameplay no warp stabs in deadspace fw ded complexes missions all of themno cloaks in deadspace exceptions being ships capable of covops cloaksallied militia should show as they truly are neutralacceleration gate activation should not interrupt target locking this is seriously wrong it makes about as much sense as 113i think these changes would be a good way to improve fw gameplay without a full overhaul on the flip side i would also support a full fw overhaul including 4 or more with yarr factions faction ffa combination of warzones into a single large warzone that all can participate in and system upgrades similar to 00 increasing the value of upgraded space better complexes pi exploration sites ect but that is a lofty idea far from implementation and i would prefer a fix that doesnt take forever and a day to become practical
sorry for the misunderstanding was meaning no risk for the ganker cloaky camping and 0 risk to his fleet waiting on him to hot drop them its bad game play when one person can shut down a system say containing 40 because that one person wants to pick and choose an easy target like a solo mining barge from a new to pocket corpim not complaining about pvp im just saying at the moment cloaky campers have it way too easy fair is fair if they want to come into system and look for targets thats ok miners and complex runners just dock up and wait for them to leave or get into pvp ships and try to engage but going afk for 1 to 10 hours is a game play mechanics exploit plain and simple getting in pvp ships isnt an option because they most likely will not engage docking up simply means people who live in that system can no longer play eve and continuing to work in system is what the camper wants so when he gets back to his computer he gets the pick of targets
its also bad gameplay when people can use a mechanic that provides them with instant and accurate intel on who is in a system at any given time without exerting any effortyou want one type of bad gameplay gone work on fixing the bad game mechanic that it is trying to counter so basically you want people to fight on your terms if you are pveing no one should threaten you if you are all ready to fight then people can come at yousorry but my 5 to 10 man gangs have no interest in getting squashed by 50 man fleetsbesides attacking an alliance shouldnt just be limited to fleet brawls and sov attacking industry and pve with small groups should be equally viable currently afk cloaking achieves thisalso lol  fair good sir that is the entire point of using pvp ships to do pve if you present yourself as too much of a threat the cloaker wont engage and you can continue making money eventually the cloaker will get bored and either attack someone heshe shouldnt and die or just leaveffs you do realize that this makes you seem more cowardly than highsec miners rightthe highsec miner has to deal with the constant threat of all those neutrals being a possible suicide ganker they have no idea who it might be or when such an action may come even making themselves unprofitable isnt a guarantee that lolgankers wont show up and yet they still continue to ply their trade usually without supportyou are part of a 00 alliance made up of hundreds or thousands of people many of them on at any given time so you usually have support nearby you always know who is and isnt a threat based on local if it isnt blue its a hostile your gear in is system you have bubbles that can make entry into a system very hard you can put up special pos mods to mitigate the risk of certain things ex cyno jammerexplain to me how a highsec miner can play eve when heshe is under constant duress from unknowns with limited support and options but a single person presents such a threat that they can prevent hundreds or even thousands of other players from playingim sorry but no person in the game has the ability or should have the ability to pick and choose any and all engagements even while pveing or doing industry stuff not without paying penalties which cloaking ships do by generally being more frail than their tech 1 variantsi suggest you live in highsec or lowsec for awhile to learn how to live with and manage actual risk
and like i said if you want to hand the ganker zero risk then you take that error on your own shouldersif you mean before they attack and whilst they are cloaked up then its zero risk for both sides not actually zero but its your term and semantics but we are talking about active play here and in those moments the risk to them is your responsibilityas far as one person shutting down a system sorry no no one cloaked and afk can stop you using gates docking undocking possing up using modules refitting ships forming gangs etc etc the only one stopping you is youif you dont wish to be prepared for action and give them zero risk when it arrives then that is your fault and your fault alonehow do they have it easier than you and your local chat channel the fact you point out that whenever an enemy arrives they dock up shows exactly what the problem is here i say this often but it needs saying this is not a chicken and egg situation here as we know what came first local afking came later in an attempt to fuddle its instant intelbut joke is that you still have the upper edge here because even though local intel is a guarantee 2357 the psychological effects from afking are not there are also things you can do to mitigate the threat when they engageas it stands local works so well in null that null can now be considered safer than high or low sec space it even had an intel boost not long ago flashing with new arrivals now youre here expecting yet more intel but not expecting to give up the on a plate version you already have but bemoaning those pointing out that local is the reason for your woesdo you honestly think that because you use local that others wouldnt try to use it against youyou may want it to be an exploit but its most definitely not oneim glad you see there is an option but you dismiss it because you dont think they will engage as shahfluffers said isnt that the point if they dont you won if they do and you were prepared and they diaf you won even if they hot drop more than you and you all go up in flames isnt this a good thing wouldnt you learn from that and change methods for next time after all youre not complaining about pvp heredestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
local doesnt give us a list of who is good ie defenders miners complex runners sov holders and who is bad trouble makers gankers and lame ass pvpers the rules set down by the sov holder does those welcome in the space and who follow rules are set as friendly those who we dont want in the systems are set as unfriendlyno intel from local would be the death of eve all sources of isk and minerals outside of high sec and wh space would be shut down completely null sec would be empty like low secwell sovereignty space is sovereignty space if 50 online live in the system and you invade their space with a 10 man fleet expect 50 people to come out in pvp ships and blow your ass up if you want fair pvp go do faction warfare or something gankers are the lowest form of scum in the eve universe so they get treated as suchfair point still not valid complex rats are immune to ewar so that is pointless webbers and warp disrupters are just wasted slots and pvp type ship like assault ships and destroyers are useless at pve mining barges are impossible to fit for pvp point is also invalid that the pve ships are usually tanking the rats as well making it easy for a ganker to come in a bomber and get a free killyes pvpers like yourself hate high sec miners some who mine in the more popular systems get ganked so what they have local too it isnt to hard to find a system that isnt so overpopulated and get to know the locals and do the same checks we do in null secin high sec yer you can loose your ship but gankers are restricted to cheap ships like destoryers have a time limit to destroy the ship in and more importantly cant hot drop also high sec is for everyone it isnt owned by anyoneindustrial mining and pve players arent interested in a fair fight if u threaten our activities we want to jump in defence ships and blow your ass clean back to your home station we want to destroy every ship that is hot dropped in and not let a single pod get out alive and we want to do it fast so we can get back to why we play the game ie industry mining and pvepvpers are just there to use up and destroy the ships we make that they buy from us and fly so we can make more buy us free game time with the plexes they love to sell us and take a good beating when they misbehave like long term camping cloaked in hostile space

here let me break it down for you does it have a limited and niche appeal yes are you forced to use it no is this a replacement for a second account no could it be cheaper to get a second account yes at around 3 months per char should it be cheaper than standard pricing to use hell no this niche system works out cheaper for short term training of alts than getting a second account i could see the argument regarding cost if ccp had removed all other options they haventbut hey rant on some more why ccp shouldnt offer this flexibility and why they shouldnt make money in the business they are in hilarious indeeddestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
this is one of those threads that just makes me shake my headdct is not intended to be used forever if you need to train a character long term chances are you want it to be logged in along with your main at some point so get a second accounthers a perfect example of what dct was meant fori want an alt that can do exploration so i too can bask in the glory of finding faction pos bpcs turns out i have an alt that for 30 days of training can have those skills maxed out im really not going to use the character a lot mostly when im either bored or broke this sounds like a job fora staring a second account or sixth in my caseb dual character trainingsince i only plan on logging the character on occasionally starting another account seems like a real waste of time before we even look at the plex costs and since i can max the skills i need in under 30 days 27 to be precise this is exactly the kind of scenario that dct was meant to solve i can spend on plex and get a character i need as opposed to 4 or whatever it costs to start a new account and train for 30 days saving me money in the long run since i dont have to continuously plex that account to keep the one toon active and the hassle of managing another account as its also one of my cyno alts the character now has dual purposes and i dont have to interrupt training my moros pilot for 30 daysdct for the win in this case cheaper better less effort
sure you just mentioned it you could movethis isnt just a afk cloaky issue but the whole cloakycynolocal dynamic they lead to passive game play if a cloaky red is in your system your actions are limited you cant realistically organize and track them down you cant continue to minepve with escorts because of a cyno so the answer is to just do something else or go somewhere else passivity to the issue of a red this is the smart thing to do but game mechanics that rewards passivity arent the best
you want to allow cynos in wh
local is part of the problem but it isnt the problem the issue is much more complicated
this the problem isnt with afk cloaking itself its that an afk cloaker by his presence is impacting on other players while not needing to be at the keyboard or even in their mums basement for hours on end all this without the afk cloaker running any risk to his ship whatsoeverthere should be risks to afk cloaking right now there are noneit ought be be possible to scan down afk cloakers with the right skills and equipment
it should be possible to scan down all cloaked ships just very difficult but at the same time local needs to be addressed it has to be a packagethe ability to scan down cloaked ships might mean they would have to stay on the move safe point to safe point etc the active cloaky would have a considerable advantage over the afk onechange the mechanics so that whether the players are the hunters or the hunted the advantages goes to those who are organized and active right now the game play favors the passivebetter game play in my opinion
yes it should be a package of changes youll find even those of us that like the status quo would agree to that a difficult way to find cloaks within that packagebut no change or nerf to cloaks should happen until or without that package containing a removal of intel from local this would mean you have to work for intel and not get it handed to you on a platealthough im not sure the poster you quoted would agree to thatdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
he may not butneither the hunter or hunter should live risk free yet that seems to be the system that has developed for the most part the cloaked hunter can walk away for 23 12 hour secure in the knowledge he is safe and the nullbear can see the instantly see danger and bear somewhere else the balance is off adjusting it would be good for the game imo
the nullbear can dock up in a station thats protected by 4 sets of timers
 put 00 local on 1 minute delay allow overview scanner to show data from directional scanner so you are constantly aware of things within 14 au radius add 15 seconds spooling timer for cyno so once it lit people cant jump for 15 secondsafter that it would be alright to add afk flag in local that goes up after 10 minutes of no client input
train up your alt enough to get good standings with locator agent then just log him in any time you need info
july bump
you wont need those restrictions if some form of timer reset is implemented
1 local is fine how it is gankers just whine about seeing expensive ships safeing up when they enter a system where they arent welcome of course people arent just going to let you kill their pride and joy2 cynos need a rethink spooling up is a good idea at the moment people are scared of being hot dropped hence the needs for huge defensive fleets of super cheap ships just to take out a single threat3 being long term afk in hostile space needs to go yer scouting in a cloaked covert opps ship is a valid tactic but leaving your character online while you arent even home just because you know it frustrates defensive fleets and stops normal operations inside that system is an abuse of that mechanic ccp is all about cracking down on systems and ways setting things up so machine code cant play the game for you and stopping people from only minimally being at the keyboard like old school ice mining or auto clearing mission rooms with domi drone boats lets see them do it for pvp too4 maybe make special faction scan probes that can scan down cloaked ships require very high levels of scanning skills to use them effectively and give them long cycle times let the players take control of there own space after all thats the whole point of sovereignty sov holders taking the place of concord and npc factions to control their own bit of space and lives in it and who doesntpvpers carry on about what they call nullbears but lets not forget when pvpers carry on about special favors for them like removing local channel intel because its too scary for them they are being carebears themselves ccp has given pvpers lots of things like covert hot drops bombers tier 3 battlecruises black opps battleships and even more destroyers to make pvp more easy none really have any real use outside of pvp and ganking time to give something back to the rest of the people who play eve
cynos are a separate mechanic if you have issues with them make a threadas far as local is concerned its directly related to afking if you want your easy mode intel system to remain unchanged then afking will remain unchanged this includes any changesnerfs to cloaksdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
cynos are related to cloaking cloaking is related to local and afk all these issues are interconnectedright now 00 in friendly alliance space is too secure its almost same level of security as high sec if not more secure if you take into account war decs this is simply unacceptable 00 has to become less secure the way it was when the game started
cynos do not need cloaks to work and they are unrelated to being afk as they are an active mechanic local on the other hand is directly related to being afk as it simply wouldnt work without it thats my pointbut as usual these people moan about pilots being afk but try and include active mechanics in an attempt to help their cause should we then include the fact its home ground for them and as such they have more friends docking refitting ships ammo supplies repairs etc etc no because its simply moving away from the point which is apparently being afkbut totally agree with you null atm is too safe i would say it could be argued its safer than highlow sec mostly due to how well local intel works in sov null local even had an intel boost not long ago and if cloaks are nerfed without a change to local intel it would become ridiculously safedestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
why should they even bother with the likes of you expand on them let them develop a relationship that has to be maintained they start at level 1 and can only improve by player doing their dirty laundry  lowsec agents might order a hit  highsec agents a base courier jobrelationship deteriorate over timelevels are on a per player basis so the random guy who only use them once in a blue moon will only have access to a level one whereas the bounty hunter who has a cot at the agents office will quickly have a level four availablewith agent level the accuracy speed and options of the service they provide improves  from target in constellation x to docked in station y currently picking his nosewe need less free intel in eve not more  make us work for it
thats a pretty shoddy answer was the jukebox broken did it intefere with some other part of the game did it cause on grid lag when you hot dropped your crew in while al listening to your favourite ig track actually while we are at it lets takeaway the ig browser too because eve shouldnt do that either as there are a multitude of oog browsers you can usewhat was the reason it was taken away certainly not for performance reasons
this exactlythose of you talking about development time and game issues are just spouting off you guys have no idea what youre talking about if you hate the jukebox that much you can just turn it off i dont see why you have to go flame our thread needlessly
the jukebox died in fire as it was used to run python inject scripts
ccp have buttons that make isk grow on trees hence no value therebut rl moniez that doesnt grow on trees010
its too late now the damage is done by plex love it or hate it if ccp took away plex now the game would die that simple its here to stay
what damage exactlyoh and this would mean that whatever damage you are referring too has been happening since 2004 all the plex did was simplify etcgtc salesdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
i strongly disagree here though i fully support the op for a timer rollbackwhat i dont want to see is plexing become is a get in a blob and run people out of plexes activity the biggest thing i like about fw is that for warzone control unlike nullsec its about dispersion of force not concentration of forcemaking the rollback faster than the capture makes it more efficient to eject people out of plexes with a blob
without covert cynos being able to be used in their current form ie warp a bomber or t3 on top of the person you want to gank lock set warp disrupter hot drop a fleet of alts in kill hot drop them straight out again a cloaky camper in system is a lot less of an issuecloaky camping isnt an issue in ether wh or high sec because they lack the possibility of hot drops not because of the lack local channel intel
cynos are an active mechanic if you have an issue with them make a thread about it or decide if its active play you wish to nerf or being afkcynos work rather well in low sec and still afking isnt an issue there but because low didnt fit your argument you left it outalso i dont think ive ever seen a complaint about afking in npc null but lets ignore that as well because it doesnt help your argument eitherlocal doesnt work in wh so afking is pointless it doesnt work as well in high low or npc null as it does in sov null simply because there are so many unknown pilots around in those systems their openness means locals intel power is reduceddestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless

thread title is proposed fix to cloaky campy not remove afkers because they are dangerous if a red in local is afk or not is beside the point its that they are using the fact that you are 100 safe when you clock at a safe point this lets them engage and hot drop at a time of their own choosingjust to make it clear while cloaked they are 100 safe when they engage they risk their ship and pod just like any other normal pvp activityfact is unless we metagame these guys and get into their ts3 or fleet we dont know if they are active or afk current mechanics means they dont even need combat scan probes out or come out of cloak to find targetsthe benefit they get from being afk for many hours is it frustrates defensive forces trying to bait these tards out of cloak to remove them from system and gives people who live in the system a false scene of security thinking that he is afklocal whs high sec npc lowsecnull sec all have nothing to do with the issuethe issue is if a person can befit from being afk cloaked in hostile space at the moment yes they can that is why they do it in the first placemost other afk activities have been removed from the game except for macro scammingspamming in trade hubs why not physiological warfare as well yes having a potential of an instant bomber fleet hot drop plays a big part in thisthe point of my argument isnt to remove reds from null sec leave that to the players just give us a way where they need to be active in hostile space or log off
this thread brought up afk cloakingto assume it is not tied into local chat is a glaring failure to recognize the cause and effect relationship they shareactually suggesting that the problem begins with the pilot using afk cloaking tactics ignores enough to be considered misleadi shall try to explain a few details that are usually glossed over crudely but hold the truthafk cloaking this is done in response to local chat flawlessly reporting pilot presence it dumbs down the interaction between pilots by outright telling all parties who is present without this crutch use of sensors strategy and cooperation would be needed to fill the voidwhat does it achieveit creates a flaw in the usual flow of cause and effect for life in many systems often a neutral or hostile pilot is seen entering and activity is suspended until they leave there is trivial risk as standard procedure often involves being ready to get safe in the time frame provided by this instant alarm hostile pilots who refuse to leave are subsequently hunted downwhen the afk cloaking pilot enters he disrupts this process by not leaving further since this intel tool persistently shows him present the default response of suspending activity is perpetually pushed as chosen reactionthis devalues the intel tool as it is now being used against the native pve pilots instead of helping themif local were removed sensors strategy and cooperation would be placed as valuable means of protecting pve income assetsit would also be pointless to afk cloak as noone would be aware of your presence while you were passiveit is widely anticipated that any change to local which stopped free cloaking awareness would also include a means to hunt cloaked shipssummary that free intel tool favored by so many can be used by the hunters toohot dropping bridging is intended to bypass reinforced blockades and travel time here it has been fine tuned to avoid advertising the presence of a fleet to the free intel tool as well by delaying the easily recognizable population spike till the last possible moment the intention is to deny the warning local provides although it still reports the presence of the cyno boat enough to be associated with afk cloaking insteadquite simply while pve pilots would never resume regular activities with a hostile fleet present they are sometimes willing to gamble over whether a cloaked vessel represents that level of threat at a given timesorry about the length but the mindless repetition of afk cloaking is bad mmkay sounds foolishupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
afk cloaking also gains no isk for their activities for their risk of trucking a rather heavily nerfed vessel across space and time through gates and so on just to sit in your system 
but the op is about afking but yet again as that point didnt fit your argument you ignored itoh and just to make it clear if you want to use the 100 safe argument then it works both ways but again this fact doesnt fit your argumentwhy should you know if they are afk that would be yet more intel on top of the already easy mode intel system called local the fact that you dismissed options earlier in the thread doesnt mean they dont existlocal is the reason for people afking other space systems are merely good barometers to the cause of your woesoh and there is no benefit no isk or items gained they hope that you stop doing activities but thats not a guarantee but even if you did stop its your loss not their gainyou mentioned the removal of certain afk activities before i did respond post 81 but you ignored that too im seeing a pattern heremaybe answer that postwhy should psychological warfare be removed im not sure you understand what that term meansdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless

thats the hilarious part actually it only has the potential to create risk because any risk would be an increase over what many have right now regardless of how unlikely such risk would actually belocal helps the hunter far more than the pve pilot working out of friendly sov systems in nullhere is something that seems difficult for many to grasp but is an important detail that those hunting will not have an advantage because of local being missingthe advantage will always belong to whoever has sov simply because the intel channels and patrols supplying them will be a huge advantagethose hunting in hostile territory will be on their own and with no local to artificially tell them where everyone is chances are they will have no ideathey can of course guess or do research to learn where people usually hang out but unless someone spies for them and tips them where to look they will be effectively blindlocal is never the friend of pve pve has a far more obvious advantage trading it in for an intel channel while the hunters are blindupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
it also lets you scan down which cans you have to pick up  whether picking up data is useful or just the parts  material cans as materials can contain the salvage and if cargo scanner displays only salvage in it then we know to pick those if it would not be this way it would be terribad i would not like to simply randompick the cans 
heh we do already work for it as for having another alt trained up to do the work well i have a few doing that already to bridge the gap but its in my mind an unnecessary waste of time building the rep required for the lvl 4s and then flying between them in order to track a targethowever i can understand the frustration one has in thinking its free info to the lucky guys who has locators on standby even if they earned them so maybe they could have a notification from their own agents they might have the same  standings with that would inform them that someone was on their tail for a prepaid fee of course for such information from their own contactsthis would only happen however if they both had standings with the same corporation by chance that way no affiliated corporations would have the interest in the goings on between two pilots  3rd party  location services  tjorven einherjar valkyrja  to do business please enter this channel inf 3rd party
i know this has been brought up many times but for many of us when we started playing this game we were not serious about the game and gave our characters poor names we also bought characters with poor names because thats all that is sold on the character bazaar i for one have characters i would love to be able to rename the nature of the game and the time it takes to train characters makes it pointless to start new characters for the sake of a name change for example i have two toons at 65 and 83 million sp you are talking 3 to 4 years to get that back if i remade themi propose a one time name change per account not character for a fee along with conditionssec status must be at 3 or above character has no petitions against them account has never been suspended by ccp once a name change has occurred all people with that character on their watch list will receive a eve mail notification of the character changing their name so you can identify whos character that is on your listi also want to bring up a point people always fight this idea cuz they say criminals can erase what they have done for a second humor me this would be a one time deal per account now with the character bazaar you can change out characters and erase you actions every week if you wanted too and as we have seen money is now object for many people as seen by the things people do in the game if you only change a name their actions will still be known due to the eve mail and by their kill and loss stats that will still be attachedweigh that in your mind before you fight this proposalcharacter bazaar  unlimited identity erasecharacter rename  just a name change

the flaw in this is getting around the one trial account per ip limit ccp implements it is so restrictive that you can not log in payed accounts from the same ip that a trial account is logged in at annoying but smart
80 accounts 80 ice however many players behind those accounts it is still 80 accounts
mag i see you in alot of afk cloaking threads and i disagree with almost 80 of what you say however i agree with this for the most part no free intel no way to afk cloak a simple tradeoff i will try to outline my problem with afk cloakers 1 i run a mining barge which can be destroyed by a cloaker before i even have a chance to align either by hotdrop or by bombs 2 if the afk cloaker goes online when i am out mining chances are that i will be dead before i have a chance to do anything about it 3 so i sit in station because there is a cloaky in every system within 2 jumpsi believe that local should simply not show cloaked characters and it should not be available to them when cloaked or give characters the option to shut off local if they please if you shut it off you cant be seen in return for this there would have to be a way to gather intel on cloaked ships there would have to be a way to avoid certian death in my mining barge while local is a very unbalanced mechanic its all i have to keep me from getting blown up without a chancei know i am in nullsec and i have to expect some risk for my reward but get rid of local without a balancer i couldnt mine enough ore to replace all the ships i would loseedit and stop saying that there is no reward for afk cloaking people if there was no reward people just wouldnt do it
i just throw in my ideas about not giving the cloakers the chance to go afk at least not for a long time1 idea let the cloak cost fuel this would make the decision of going cloaky more important either if the pilot has the chance to resupply soon or if it is actually any use to go cloak on a second note if fuel runs out anytime the afkcloaker gets uncloaked and can be hunted down 2 idea let the cloak have a cycle time im imagining a cloaking module that behave like a mining turret just without autorepeat it can be started it can be stopped anytime in between and if the cloaker is not sitting infront of his computer i assume for honest nonbotting player he will get decloaked the only thing that would then need to be tuned is how much the cycle lastsofcourse these two ideas could only help a little bit on this subject the intel tool is something that would need to be looked aswell delayed local but in the topic of op afk cloaking could be hit with the ideas aboveuthings that would make eve betteru nrds  remove local  balance cloak  sovmechanic changes  less qq
its all a matter of perspective lets look at 3 people person a b and cperson a is a ganker he or she hates big fleet pvp and sov space warfare and just loves flying a bomber favorite ship covert opps tengu or covert opps scouting ship person as favorite activity is blowing up miners and complex runners because he knows that upsets the person flying the mining ship or complex runner person a believes that eve is a pvp game and anyone who thinks otherwise deserves to be blown up person a thinks that instant local is a broken part of the game and needs to be removed so travels to system x and leaves his character online cloaked 23 and UFFFD hours to try to negate the effect of instant local intelperson a is a member of a UFFFDclocky camping corpUFFFD or npc corp where itUFFFDs hard to trace him back to his home system though he is a member of a standing fleet of another corp who lives in system y the standing fleet are ready to hot drop 24 hours a day and have many cloaky campers set up in other systems with known enemies ie miners and complex pilotsperson b is a miner he has a few accounts and loves to mine and buy his or her game time with isk he lives in system x he thinks that local intel isnUFFFDt the best solution to keeping his ships safe but itUFFFDs the only one he has at the moment he just wants to log on to eve and do a bit of mining and socialize with his friends in the pocket where he or she livesperson c is a pvper who does sov warfare he isnUFFFDt interested in ganking and defends system x because itUFFFDs his allianceUFFFDs system and wants miners to mine so he can use the minerals to build ships that he pays for by doing a bit of complex running when things are quiet he also does a bit of mining himself when neededperson a has his character camped in cloak in system x he then leaves it online and goes to work for 8 hours an hour after person a goes to work person c logs on sees a red in local gathers his defence fleet and tries to bait person a out of cloak after 30 minutes of this person c gives up on this and looks for the home system of person a to go pos bashing in that system after failing this too because person aUFFFDs corp doesnUFFFDt hold sov or appear to live in a sov system person c goes to work on something else6 hours from person a going afk person b logs on sees a hostile in local and doesnUFFFDt undock he looks for another system to mine in but sees they are all camped or too hot to mine in so he stays docked and waits for person a to leave system or be blown up nether happens so 2 hours later he goes mining anywayperson a comes home sees a mining fleet in system warps to the and hot drops successfully killing all the mining barges for his 5 minutes at the keyboard he has killed 2 mining barges and an orcaperson b has lost his 2 mining barges and an orca 2 hours of game time where he could be mining and knows because of this person a will stay in system to try for more killsperson c cops the blame for not defending the system but he too has wasted an hour trying to bait person a out of cloak and punish his or her corp for cloaky campingperson a by going afk cloaked has evaded person cUFFFDs system defence frustrated person b out of station while still appearing afk he has set things up for a instant gank of 3 ships that he successfully pulled off after this he goes out with his friends and watches a movie still leaving his character online cloaked and afkfor the next few hours the sov holders in system x treat him as active and try baiting all over againwhere is the balance in this person a blames local channel intel for the problem knowing that taking away local channel will make ganking even easierperson b just doesnUFFFDt want to be ganked he wants person c to make it a safer system where he can happily mine he hates that all his time has been wasted just for 5 minutes that the ganker has just had and knows he canUFFFDt do much about the problem other than help with the baitingperson c wishes he could do something about cloaky campers in his system but knows nothing can be done when a person isnUFFFDt activelets give person c a scan probe that can scan down cloakers after they have been cloaked in one system continuously for 15 minutesperson c logs on to see that a hostile is cloaked in system x he uses the probe to scan the person down and instructs all the friendlies in system to get into newbie ships fleets them and warps to person a bumping him out of cloak and killing person as bomber and pod with a fleet of newbie ships person a no longer goes afk cloaked in hostile space person a logs off instead when he goes for extended afk giving the people in the system x some warning when he comes back online because they have him in watch list he still gets some kills because people still make mistakesperson b is happy because he can mine again but keeps his eyes on his watch list for person a because person a is a known troublemakerperson c knows when person a or any other ganker is active in his or her systems because they no longer risk going for extended afks online and now can defend his sov space against him or any other ganker with baiting and gate campinglocal intel is another issue yes it needs some work but sov space or any other null sec system still needs ways for those who live in the systems to operate in those system without giving gankers easy mode kills local intel should be talked about in a separate thread as changes to it affect almost every aspect of null sec living
your example falls apart hereall details subsequent to this are invalid as a resultreason you actually had a pve player as the responsible party in this tragedy they created the opportunity by poor choicethey do not own that system no system is owned beyond a building permit so plan on hostilesthey knew a hostile was present irregardless of how active they may seem at any given timethey had an option to mine mine with defensive protection or mine in another locationafter deciding they could not do anything but mine there they then decided to not just mine but do so in a manner unsafeat the very least the orca should have been in a pos and not at riskmining create two bookmarks bombers do it all the time bounce between them so no matter what you are aligned to something not just sitting at zeroadd to this they had three accountsswap out the orca entirely and get a ship to web up the two mining bargesthey can fly aligned at 75 and realign much faster if you do it rightnull sec where effort is expectedhigh sec if you cant handle risk in this part of the game even time to reevaluate your expectationsupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
im in them because people ask for change without understanding the mechanics at work simply blaming cloaks in the regard of afking is just plain wrong ill always fight for balanceyour points1 are you saying that you would mine alone with an enemy in local without any protection or without taking precautions sounds to me like you would deserve to lose your ship if this is the case2 if you see him log in then you could organise your alliance to protect and quite easily save your ship if you mean him returning to his keyboard then see 13 there are options available to people who live in null but most dont wish to use them or as in dal rayls case dismiss them out of hand if you decide to sit in the station then that is your choice its not something the cloaker can force upon you but yes local not showing cloaked pilots would remove the point of afk cloaking i could see the need for a way to locate cloaked ships if this was the case but it would need to be balanced in a way that didnt mean cloaked ships became useless but i hope you see that afking would still continueas far as reward is concerned its rather simple people do it in the hope that pilots in local stop their activities but its in no way a guaranteethe afker gains no isk or items so i guess you think someones loss is a reward that being able to affect someones mind to the extent that they log off or simply dockpos up is a reward the only reward i see is to the pilot logging or docking the reward to them is loss of earnings for being bad at the game but the cloaker gains nothingif you think that someone dying as a result of not taking precautions before hand is a reward then i disagree thats an opportunity and the reward is given to the pilot that hands out that opportunitydestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless

not going to go into detail but i have discussed mining fleet vs cloaker tactics with people in my alliance at length and everything that is thought of is shot down with explanation now as a miner i would be happy to see cloaking nerfed but i realise that there are a great many people who do not want that if possible i would like to find a solution that eliminates the possiblility of afk cloaking but does not affect active cloakers at least not enough to make people not want to use cloaks i also see it as a foregone conclusion that for there to be any changes affecting cloaks the issue with local chat has to be solved as wellbut for any of this to be a possibility people on both sides of the fence need to get together and think of a solution a solution that would be fair one that drives conflict instead of discouraging conflict a solution that encourages mining fleets with proper defences and cloakers who can overcome those defences noone should be safe but still get a tangible reward for their effortsnow what i just said is a tall order no single person is going to come up with this solution take me for example i am a nullsec miner almost exclusively i dont have the experience with the game to even suggest solutions all i know is that this is an age old issue where miners have tried different tactics to combat afk cloakers time and time again and failed you will not convince me that there is no issue here just as i wont convince many that local chat isnt an issue these are issues that people want solved and they are not mutually exclusive many in this thread can agree on thisi am getting tired of all these afk cloaking threads and all these local chat threads that just keep repeating all the same argumentsand i have only been looking for the last 2 weeks there are many people who can claim years of seeing this lets stop arguing over whether this is an issue or not and focus on getting what all these people want editi have seen many posts regarding pos upgrades that combat cloaking i agree with the general concept as it limits effectiveness to the systems with such an upgrade and to the people controlling it also creating an isk sink possibly requiring fuel to operate however most of these solutions are horribly unbalanced encouraging pvpsafe pve activities in nullsec now a pos solution that encourages nullbears to get out there and hunt the cloakies requiring time isk risk and effort to do so is what i think is needed
so to have an opinion on this myself i consider myself to be objectivesome perhaps might disagree but at the very least i am drawing off of experience from both sides of this issue which is making me consider them both with interest in keeping them fun to playi am a miner i mine i rat as needed and i even have an orca with appropriate skills to boost withcant claim a rorqual those things are too bloody expensivei am also a cloaked player although i find my situation one that makes afk cloaking impractical for mei would however be targeting the enemies of my corporation  alliance if it were possible to do so with a bomber  blops  what have you and by targeting i mean their miners and pve group in general economic targetssee this game style is like two halves of a whole mining and pve on one side hunting that type on the other and the experiences from either actually helping both play betterexcept as many note it is not possible to hunt miners or ratters in null not really as i know from direct experience we can get safe the moment a hostile enters the system since local displays them immediately my intel channels usually tell me before this can even happen but the point remainsand unexpectedly for some crying about afk cloaking perhaps being able to get safe that reliably with guaranteed intel is actually hurting minersthe devs realize we cant be caught unless we screw up an attacker cannot force a failure in the sequence of events between their arrival in system and our warping to safetyso they have the ore and now the ice too spawning in limited fields for the versions that have the most isk valuefirst come first serve the fields respawn after a delay if  when they are clearedthis means they can have a few rocks left floating and not respawn if those last few were not worth someones effortsthat means yes while you can pretty much guarantee a miners safety you cannot guarantee they will have anything worth mining first come first serve pretty much means there is not enough for everyone in this caseso yeah i want the miners and ratters more vulnerable i want to need more effort to stay safe and hopefully the devs will consider mining dangerous enough then to make the ore and ice flow freely relying on our risks to limit our activities rather than simply limits to the available things to mine at allupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
yes the more i read these threads the more i am convinced that local has a huge part in this issueand it should be possible to hunt us miners and it should be possible for those miners to have a way to fight back or at least with the right equipment and skills to hold out or have a means to escape and i realise that right now we have an awesome way to escape its called local and it is so effective that we dont even need to worry about pvp as long as we dock up this is not a good thing

there should be achievement points for ship spinnning likeship spinning iship spinning iiadept ship spinner titleship spinning iiiship spinning ivmaster ship spinner title etc
hrma good buff would be keep a running total of how much ship spinning a player has done not being a big ship spinner myself i gave it a whirl while watching tv and seeing 1000 in blue was  such a huge accomplishment
i can see why people want this i also think that a bit of thought was put into this thread it may need tweaking but thumbs up from meedit such a change may need a bit of effort from the devs to bring about and they have some pretty full plates as i understand it though i like the idea on second thought i see alot of bigger issues that i would like fixed before they work on stuff like this
the concept is a good one might need tweaking in my opinionhowever i will always say fix current issues before bringing in new featuresthen i get laughed at because everyone knows new features bring in new players and more money
i want jukeboxreasons aside thats iti want jukebox
no my example doesnt include the perfect miner who has an interceptor their ready to insta warp the mining barges out at all times and yes the miners makes a mistakes the orca should be at a pos the miners should have a pvp support fleet and he shouldnt be solo with a red in systembut like i said its about perspective gankers want to gank miners want to mine and sov holders want to set the rules for the systems they hold and keep people inside those systems safe all of these things are ok ive just shown that leaving afk camping in the game gains the pvper a huge advantage removing local intel from game without replacing it with something equally strong gives them so great of an advantage it no longer makes sov space workable any more however removing long term cloaking from the game doesnt take away that much form the pvper he just switches from going afk cloaked to going off line in system in doing that the locals who live and work in that system now know when he is active and when he is not he still gets kills because miners and complex runners still make mistakes like you pointed out that person b did and to add to that person c defense of system x is baiting so relies on person a engaging the bait but however game time is not wasted worrying about if an hostile in system is active or notas for ownership of space thats a matter of perspective too
in that case going by your example you still reference the real problem is poor judgementi agree the only way a hunter will catch a pve ship in null is if the miners use bad decision making skills as you describedas for ownership perspective thats easy you control what you own if you control the gates you own them that is exclusive to effort not sovupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
i agree pveers who make mistakes loose ships pveers who dont make mistakes dont loose ships gankers will still get kills because there will always be new miners and complex runners coming to nulllocal intel has been in eve since the start of the game its a hard habit to change nbsi and nrds rules are built around local intel and for nbsi system if a non blue is in system he will be actively hunted for nrds they need to know you are a troublemaker first gates can be camped red poses blown up and stations control who docks inside them by standings whats more sov can change hands with sov warfarethis is really beside the point cloaky campers get an advantage by screwing with the game of the people who live in the systems they camp otherwise they wouldnt be doing itgetting rid of cloaky campers doesnt take much from the game of the gankers who use the mechanic because they just switch to logging off and on inside their target systemseveryone else gains because there are no longer inactive reds in systems they live in
yes new players will be killed but why should mechanics change because old players dont want to use the tools currently provided but its ok to change it because new players will still be there to dieyes local has been in the game a long time but it was never intended to be the free intel tool is currently is the standings in local came about after a large alliance found ways to manipulate it to show that information ccp reacted by handing that option to all they have wanted for many many years to remove the intel from local but its not that easy and so far they cannot think of a way to do thisyou say everyone else gains but fail to see local is the issue here you want to remove uncertainty from your intel tool but fail to see that any nerf to cloaking wouldnt stop others using local against youthe main issues i have with these threads are as follows not understanding the actual mechanics at play yet wanting change wanting to stop afking yet wanting to keep the reason for it not wishing to utilise current tools to play the game but expecting new ones or nerfs wanting null to be even safer when it could be argued its already safer than highlow sec space claiming to talk about afking yet constantly bemoaning active play and mechanics in their argument ill make it simpleas and until intel is removed from local and made an active mechanic afking will continue no amount of cloak nerf requests and ideas will change thisbut understand thisif local was change in a way that meant you had to work for it that it wasnt instant easy mode as it is now we can all see that if this was to happen cloaks would need to be changedbut while ever local exists as is people will continue to try to use it against you you dont need a cloak to cause this psychological effect just local in its current formbut at what point do we stop id wager even with these changes people will still complain that they can see people in the new intel mechanic but insert poor reason here cant find them counters to counters to counters at some point we have to stop being given counterswe are at a point of balance due to cloaks not being so covert and local being so powerful bad in some ways but balanced all the same i personally like the status quo but if there are changes to be made it has to involve local completelydestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
ok so lets start with local nikk narrel proposed a solution in the features and ideas discussion that removes nonactive pilots from local this would include cloaked ships docked ships and those within the shields of a pos i agree with this solution for the most part though i am not sure about the pos partpersonally i think all players should be able to enter silent mode where they do not show up in local and can not access iti would like to discuss the merits and flaw of these solutions before moving on to any adjustments affecting cloakingnikks thread
as i pointed out in the thread if you are inside the shield of a pos you are disconnected from locals pilot listbut in a technique popular with carriers already these pos using pilots can stick their craft juuuusst a little outside till it is considered out of the shieldsee local watch local but duck back inside if feeling threatenednow if something hits them while they are sticking out it could possibly bounce them out of safety and smaller ships bounce easythere is a little risk for a little rewardupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
i like this idea there is nothing wrong with making pve missions less repetetive it would be interesting to see if iskh actually went up despite the missions being less profitable simply because you would have to pay attention because you havent done that same mission a gazillion times before
i do like the idea in case you total botched your name or your ideas change over time on what is a good screen name
this must be done my very first eve character is really in need of a name change i really dont wanna delete him because hes of significance to me for reasons ive just said too old too significant to delete he was the first i created and a reminder of my early days in the gameccp must go through with thisi wholeheartedly agree with thisive also read that ccp offered a free name change service for players in the early days of the game apparently

1 your reasons for doing this are completely invalid as highsec corps make plenty of isk from missions incursions and mining and the biggest reason to war a corp will always be to collect tears2 killing a highsec pos takes entirely too much effort for most corps to bother doing if the corp is large enough to be able to field the numbers to takedown a defended pos then they are more than likely operating in nullsec and dont care about highsec 3 there are extremely few corps that have a corp standing of 500 with a npc corp so extremely few would even be able to use this feature
i liked the idea of increasing rollback based on system upgrade level wouldntshouldnt be much say 10 per level so that defenders get more of a benefit out of the lp dump  10 equates to 13rd and it would in any case only apply until timer is resetthe blob systemplexes is already the mo as it is the only speedy way of insuring the plexes and it is the only way of attacking hq systems where the generic farmer which are usually used for the bulk plexing are easily countered by just a few defenderswill never be applicable more than a few jumps from a hq at any rate as the operational sphere of mains is minuscule to say the least practically all plexing outside of hq2j is done by altsninjasfarmerswhole thing needs revision but rollback remains the single most effective on paper tourniquet that can be applied until such a time that devs realise they  fw up and can spare the time to sort their mess
this thread seems to have gone off the rails againremove local intel thats been in the game from the start and ccp would need to replace it with a tool for defenders to use that is ether equal or stronger dont like trying to gank with local intel messing up your day go do ganks in wh spacebut hang on no hot drops in wh space guess you gankers are going to have to get skillsmake local intel weaker by removing people in station in poses and afk cloaked from the list and you have the probem of what happens when they come back from afk leave station or exit the pos unlike logging back on in system their is no warning so for the afk problem not fixed only made worse pos bubbles would be fine because u can just fly out before you warp stations would become more painful because you would need to undock a scout ship first or have friends giving you system intelstations arent as overpowered as these gankers are saying they are they can be bubbled ships can be bumped away from them and so on when someone is in station they are safe so what if they want to pvp you they will come out and pvp you otherwise they will just wait for you to go awaydefenders should always have benefits over attackers when defending their own space otherwise there is no point to holding sovereigntyback to my point with the afk cloaker time wasters if person a logs off in system x person c doesnt have to waste his game time baiting someone who is afk person b can mine for 2 or so hours after he logs on he still might loose his ships when person a comes home from work and logs back on again but his time would not be wasted by an afk cloakergankers wine about lack of targets in this game make null sec more ganker friendly make high sec more ganker friendly give mining barges less hit points give covert hot drops longer ranges make it so they cant see us in local and so on and so on what they dont realize is they already have low sec and 05 systems because of this no one who is a non ganker and has at least half a brain will risk ships in these systems because of all the gankers hanging out in themgankers are really their own worst enemy lol
claiming local benefits pve as much if not more than a player driven intel channel networking players togethervery disingenuousfirst unless you are in sov null to begin with there is constant traffic by non blue playersany one of which if not directly hostile could be just as likely the eyes for pilots who are very hostilebut then lets say you are in sov null spacehere is something that is difficult for many to grasp but is an important detail that those hunting will not have an advantage because of local being missingthe advantage will always belong to whoever has sov simply because the intel channels and patrols supplying them will be a huge advantagethose hunting in hostile territory will be on their own and with no local to artificially tell them where everyone is chances are they will have no ideathey can of course guess or do research to learn where people usually hang out but unless someone spies for them and tips them where to look they will be effectively blindlocal is never the friend of pve pve has a far more obvious advantage trading it in for an intel channel while the hunters are blindupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
i for one believe claokign to be broken for an entirely differnent set of reasons than affecting pve but ill tell you why wh low and npc null dont complain about cloaky camping npc null low income is derived 90 by missions in a mission site you cant light a cyno and it cant be found without using combat scanner probes so yes you can afk cloak active cloak we but you cant appear in someones mission site without giving a telltale warning to them your probes you also cant hot drop directly on top of them im not sure you still can do it but you used to be able to do the missions in unprobable or at least very very hard to probe t3s ships wh no cynos no hotdrops and again sites have to be scanned down by core probes or ships in space have to be scanned down by combat probes both of which appear on dscan im going to go with the side of local isnt the problem claoking in this scenario isnt the problem either i like the current nullsec sites though i dont actually run them myself not requiring probes so i think if i were to propose anything i would say it be this if your cloaked no dscan so you can still cloak all you want in and stay there all day but you cant find me and i cant find you unless you take risk we both have the same amount of intel i know your there you know im there but neither of us know where the other is in system or what ships where in if you want to find me you have to decloak and drop probes then recloak in which case i can see your probes on dscan or spend the time to warp around system to find me instead of spending 3060 seconds dscannign and knowing with a high degree of certainty where i am additionally i would pair this with a small change to cyno activation mechanics you cant activate a cyno after decloaking for 45 seconds to introduce some more risk into the equation for the pver i would say give certain kinds of battleship rats that appear in the various sites the ability to warp disrupt making ti so there held down longer and taking more risk allowing for more opportunities to be caughti dont rat at all but the current situation is all sorts of unbalanced and if you cant see that a fridge was dropped on your head when you were a small child i however dont believe 1 change can fix the imbalance i think if your going to introduce real risk or a nerf to the cloaker you need to also add some additional risk to the pver to bring balance to the equation make the one possible to catch and the other easier to get into troublethe issue again is not local though i actually like the idea of 1 minute delay on null local which strikes me as a pretty good balance on timeis what i written perfect no far from it but it at least has some semblance of being reasonable best part you can still afk and make local dangerous but at least the pver has some semblance of a chance to shoot you when you make your move
local is a give away to the hunters of pve pilots in two different wayson the one hand it persistently presents the hunter as a threat in system while they actually need to make no effortfor the second part it tells the hunter exactly which systems have targets in them information they could never be certain of otherwiselocal only helps local sov pve pilots in one waythe warning they get when the hunter first enters the systemthe mutual awareness local shares past that point clearly favors the hunterwant to move to another system local shows you vanish from the list so a hunter can check if you are still online and if so knows to follow you your continued presence is the useful intel benefiting the hunter and local is handing it to them for freein many cases they had no idea anyone was there in the first place they cant dock in the alliance owned outpost to check it and they have no intel channels outside their own sov space if at allupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked

use the search function they have been laid out many times beforejint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
and if you would have used the search function or even a little bit of the brain god gave you youd see that the only possible issue would be keeping those who had those chars on their contactswatchlist updated with the info as well which is easily solvable by sending a notification to those people so they also know that xxxxx is now known as yyyyy the ingame functions presence on watchlist standings that have been assigned to the char would automatically update thus being a nonissue themselves an entry in the employment history could be also be done so that all those who didnt have that char on the watchlistcontacts would know that chars old name the ingame functions are all based on the char id with is a string of numbers that never changes and has no need to in order to change the char name and killboards would be able to automatically update the char name as well the next time they got a km with that name on it with a simple api call of 
youre typical arrogant eve dork that has nothing to bring to the table but negativity man gamers make me laugh sometimes kind of like when you talk about how a game console should have backwards compatibility and how some moronic fanboy will come up with just about anything to say no no there should be no backwards compatibility omega thats forward thinking anyone who disagrees just got logically pimpslapped i deleted one of my characters that was in a corp andand the corp got a notification afterwards gasp1d
heres another solution to killboards having the correct name have an api call that lists all the chars that have changed their names within the last 30 days results for the api call would be both the old name and new name so any killboard could automate the update and have very little impact on the api server
i see this thread is still being ignored to death by everyone csm  ccptoo bad easy fix and the arguments are quite fair imho
csm said theyd put this on their list a page or two back originally they completely shot it down prior csmthis is a great addition to null wh low and high secdont have standings in empire use a posthere are lots of good reasons  even some not posted yet  why this should be implementedgo go gadget csmhrolt ceo live free die proud

it never ceases to amaze me how any attempt to fix a mechanic which is obviously broken here immediately draws a loud chorus of ccp fanboys who are apparently in favor of never changing anything ever because the game is just perfect as it is and everything is always working as intendedthe problem is that spam from disposable zeroskill characters carries no penalty whatsoever and has grown to the point that it makes the use of jita local for anything other than spamming not worthwhile eventually this will spread to all the populous areas as people increasingly ignore jita local making it profitable to spam elsewhere instead the obvious solution is intelligent userconfigurable spam controlseither allow us to block characters under a certain number of skill points which would mean that we wouldnt see new highskill spam bots every day so our block commands would actually work or allow us to block messages from people already blocked by greater than a  b of the people in local chat or ideally allow us to write our own formula using these variables for who we dont want to seethe existing situation makes reasonable interactions impossible simply because ccp cant be bothered to allow us to block spam intelligently

yer i get that local shows everyones hands ganking pvpers get to know who the good marks are so will actively hunt them and people who live in null sec get to know the gankers by name and exactly what they fly and what they do from experience and kill boards so they too actively hunt down these gankersbig difference is defenders dont usually use covert opps hot drops to defend they use more traditional pvp fleets only covert hot droppers in sov null sec benefit from the cloaky camper tacit as pointed out in this threadthe only benefit they get from cloaky camping is their targets get no warning when they come back from afk as per all grav sites belts and standard complexes they can warp to cloaked without the need for probes that show up on dscanthe cost of allowing them to do this is that their little tacit effectively can shut down industry and pve in the system they camp in if they are known to be any good at hot droppingsome hot droppers already use logging off and logging back on as a tacit to try to lower the targets guard this is a known tacit and information about reds logging off in system is shared on intel channelsbig difference is loggers dont waste large amounts of the targets time force them to work in other systems and shut down systemslets look at fixesgive cloaks a 10 min manual cycle or consume fuel this would work although its not popular with people who use cloaks and doesnt add anything to the gamemake cloaked ships have a scannable signature after being cloaked for longer than 10 mins without warping this would add something for defenders to do into the game wouldnt be popular with cloakersmake it so your ship warps to a safe point after being afk for 10 or 15 mins and disappears just like logging off removes the person from local channel and turn local off for himher too but doesnt log the person off the game when the person comes back for afk his ship autowarps back to his previous point just like logging on he appears in local straight away and he can see others in local straight away but cant do anything until his ship is out of autowarp ie turn afk cloakers into loggers without actually logging them off the game
i see lots of nerfs and you not wanting to change the mechanic giving you the problem but for it to be a problem would mean we dont already have solutions wouldnt ityou do know that you can get the same effect without a cloak which kinda pours scorn on your supposed fixes now doesnt itlets get back to basics here when someone is afk which mechanic are they using to interact with youits a one word answerbut i do find your stance rather puzzling lets see what you said in another threadso you think learning from it means complaining about it and asking for nerfsall i see is a poor attitude towards others play styles which means you do not have balance in your thoughts when considering changewere simply going round in circles here us pointing out your problem and ways to solve it you lot not wishing to use the current mechanics as solutions but instead wanting to nerf the effect rather than the cause its all rather tiresomedestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
when you consider the basis for your arguments is so easily countered and subsequently dismissed using facts and logic why do you even make such obviously baseless suggestionsmore traditional pvp fleetsis this some attempt at humorif we and i am with no doubts a null pve player were to engage in pvp ship combat on a regular basis we might have some overall preference but we dontwe are doing economic support the combat support guys are quite often not even in the same region traditional fleets are not a pve concept they are relevant exclusively to ship combat we form fleets for boosting and when it makes sense for things like mining efficiency and hauling logisticsif we can get a titan bridge or use a blops one blops not common unless maybe some kind of exotic scouting for sites we take the bridge with gratitude since it is usually needed for combat elsewhereagain local is screamingly helpful to the pvp ship combat hunter hereunless they happen to be on grid with a target at the time they come back for all they know they came back to a deserted and empty systemwithout local they have no intel to tell them who is docked in the outpost or at the pos if they do a scan at a pos they will get every unoccupied ship sitting near the tower so that is not much helpupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
sure the game may have an unchangeable string of numbers to identify each player but as a player i recognize other players only by their namenot everyone in the game is on my watchlist not even the regulars in my local system are however i recognize these people by their name and i know what some of them are likely to dowith a name change function any name i dont recognize could potentially be someone i do know with a name changeso now i have to check the name change history of everyone around me in case they used to be someone i knewanyhoo i would rather not get into an argument about this the only people who seem to want changes are1 i chose a stupid name and now im fed up with it tough your choice live with itand2 i bought a character so i didnt have to train one up but i dont like the name tough you knew what you were buying when you bought itgood luck with your proposed huge game changes to address your specific wantsjint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
i literally cannot support this proposal hard enoughhonestly dont restrict it make it an isk sink by having a name chance cost 3x your skillpoint count from a concord agent or something like that or even a flat bill each timetheres a real simple workaround to the whole people changing their names to avoid punishment for past deeds problem add a new tab to the public character sheet of each char prior names and have them show up in a people and places search as  current name former name former name when the former name is searchede also for watchlisted people just kick an evemail notification to a person when somebody on their watch list changes name i doubt it could produce more spam than the thing under attack in x notificationsa mechanic for changing names exists its just gm only so its not like its conceptually impossible i see no reason that namechanges cant happen with appropriate steps taken to prevent people from disappearing utterly
the things mentioned above that disapprove of name changes are valid problems but in my eyes easy solves things like kill mails for example i really dont know how they work on a coding level but kill mails are attached to apis no so if you changed the name wouldnt that be reflected in the kill maili can also relate to identifying people by name i live out in null sec with my other characters and you do get to know people by their names as potential hot droppers or fcs etc at the same time though that is why i proposed a one time name change per account more than likely if they are well known for their name they wont change it and may choose to change another character on their account others have also mentioned a tab with their past nameto me its a no brainier their employment will be the same there kill mails will be the same you will be able to quickly identify that person again even if there is no tab and such you learned once rather quickly who they were and i am sure you can again besides whats to stop said character to going to the character bazaar and selling that character and buying a new one i dont hear any tears about that cough coughlastly all i ever see in any of theses posts are the deeds you wont be able to see their deeds give me a break people ask for api keys for a reason when joining a corp not character names api  they look to see past communications and forum posts they look at isk transactions even then people dont identify problems i know someone who stole 6 dreads from a corp he was in then sold them and he still has no problem joining major alliance corps as they never notice the transactions as devious he tells people he use to build them with an alt so when people talk about deeds get over it if you want to cry over a high sec freighter gank well that will be in their kill mails cause thats attached to the api that deed will still be thereif there are more visible deeds attached to accounts that would be erased by a name change lets talk about them and address them rather than say the deeds
i dunno keeping people names i feel is almost the definition of actions have consequences and that means that you have to have the silver tongue to trick people not changing a bit of code in your nameplus ill be honest i like the individuality of the stupid names

the multiple overview proposal probably ends up doing the same thing but could be easier to useimagine you could do the following have as many tabs as you want be able to drag a tab out of the overview creating multiple overview windowsso you could have a window for gates targets drones and maybe friends while still having the option to switch between tabs eg swap from drones to looti strongly believe that having multiple small lists is significantly easier to use as having one large listbut i am not against the filter proposal having an option to show only the 5 closest targets in one of the overview windows would be kick ass
ignore develdrin  she is nothing but a common troll we should be used to them on the internet by now besides her argument has no validity and makes no sense like i said a common troll who is most likely just an angry person who hates themselves deep down hence why she is that guy or perhaps she takes the opposite stance because she does not want to be the same as everyone else which honestly makes her the same as every troll on the internet that shows and immense weakness of character so honestly we should feel bad for her as she is clearly a shallow and empty individual sad panda its funny these kinds of people fancy themselves intelligent beyond most and hence behave in a condescending manner completely unaware of how ignorant it really makes them sound go sit in in you corner sweetheart and contemplate the next stupid thing you will say i wait with bated breath for your retort youre hatred gives me power on a note more related to to the topic i do miss the jukebox itself as well glowing red dust is the  while the jukebox may not be necessity but rather a convenience due to the fact that someone put it on sound cloud thank you by the way my man it is appreciated by the mass of the player population and ccp would be wise not to upset the people paying their salary we the people buy your game and while some players may just be whiny bitches who if ccp catered to the weak link constantly which was blizzards downfall with wow you get just that a broken piece of garbage there is something to be said about listening to your subscribers most times as i play a rasti minmatar i just throw on some reggae and mine the belts ccp please reincorporate the jukebox thank you

i think local should be removed while at the same time dscan shoud get a big revamp
ill be honest the noctis is already such a good ship im not sure a command ship for this kind of thing is needed i could maybe see it as a module but thats it already we are getting to the point that the actual length of salvage times versus player interaction times are almost equal boosting the hard coded times wouldnt net you that much more per hr

what specifically would you like ccp to do to encourage more senior citizens to play eve and keep in mind there would have to be safeguards to prevent younger players from pretending to be older ones or using their grandparents as shills and that these safeguards would have to be simple and cheap to implementi look forward to hearing your proposal
i have no idea if this request is reasonable or not as i have no clue what the op is asking for
being the second oldest member of the csm next to trebor i wanted to toss my two cents inold age does bring in a lot of changes ccp has already addressed some with the ability to enlarge fonts asking for a ccp to give a seniors discount which is what i believe the op is doing is something i have yet to see in any mmo with the gaming population aging this may be the front edge of a growing issue in the gaming community and the more complex games such as eve will be the first to see itbut trebor is right    verification of age to keep some tween from getting a seniors discount is something that would need a lot of detail coverage sorry but we cannot just take someones word for it since i hear some players are prone to take advantage of any trust given themmmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
is age verification even possible for an international audience 
having never run missions i still kind of like this idea the main problem comes in matching riskreward and making sure noone games it if there is a gm or similar looking over them before they end in game then i could get behind it maybe have an editor like garys mod style of thingthe best thing though to keep the game interesting is not to be in hisec doing missions though there is a whole world of a game out there that is all about competition and brushing up against rivals its like going to the seaside and bringing a paddling pool
actions have consequences then say character bazaarthe only consequence in is eve is you do something stupid and you lose isk everything else is an illusion that is alive in peoples heads
after nearly a decade the novelty wears pretty thin i made this char when i was 14 in 2004again though there are real simple ways to preserve actions having consequences this is not an impossible design challenge
1 there needs to be an alias tab on your character sheet that shows your complete name history 2 your corp history should absolutely never be erased 3 your corp history tab should also include the name you were known as at that time 4 i see absolutely no reason for the sec status requirement who gives a  about people aggressing in lowsec the whole point is to keep track of scammers awoxers thieves spies and similar delinquents which have nothing to do with sec status 5 limited use is necessary but not required 1 per year would probably be sufficient finally im not sure its worth the effort what happens to the old names that keep getting taken how do you handle joe changing his name to sam and john changing his name to joe that could be incredibly confusing and best not permitted also you do realize this will create tons of name scams think about the new chribba scams where peopel pose as chribba over and over and over to steal with his reputation then again this probably already happens in the end this could be implemented with the above caveats im just not sure it is worth the troubles
the csm is currently in conversation with ccp on this issuei doubt youll get much traction for the 30 sec status requirement though
much thanks malcanis any method of renaming would be much appreciated
in a universe where your name is at times more influential than your guns  i would vote not to name changesas far as ppl imposing as me impostors that happens quite often and its against the eula so said pilots gets the punishment that serves themc
any name change of a character with such a large influence would quickly be propagated especially if the character was an infamous scammer moreover people with influential names would be much less likely to change them so it would be a fringe case at best for the influential especially if namechanges were prohibitively expensive or required a large sacrifice such as a  chunk of sp god forbidand again nobody is asking for people to be allowed to be given totally clean slates with no traceable historytheres zero rp justification to not have name changes available eve is a dark place after all and adding a low hoop clicking a tab on their chars info for people to jump through to read somebodys name history would not be the end of the world quite the contrary it would be a good follow up to the changes in the bounty expansion in a narrative sensehrm best kick a notification to people who put bounties on the namechanging char as well when they change names if anything like this ever gets implemented
im pretty glad i didnt let 14 year old me name malc 
that would not have ended well
ooh woah were actually getting ccp to see this and getting feedback thats awesomeim just hoping it goes through limited as being a onetime thing thatd probably be the best approach at least thats what i think onetime character change so it doesnt get our of controlim hoping it happens
lets make this crazy idea a realityi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
id move my entire corp into lowsec if these pos changes were made
before the high sec ice nerf it was common to see people using huge amounts of accounts to afk ice mine with isboxer but then everyone who ice mined then did it afknow you could certainly do it in null sec with large and xlarge grav sites 80 accounts may take down one of those dam spods but then again it would be a fox in the chicken house if a ganker found themonly other thing i could think of for 80 accounts is the potato farm of death 79 domis and a command ship the 79 domis set their sentries to assist the the command ship maybe super carrier the alpha from that should be able to bring down any subcap no tackle needed
i do agree that if eve was free to play and anyone could start a ton of accounts anything that gave even a 10 edge by allowing some automation would generate threads like these and even then i would not be vocal about getting it bannedif someone was to enter the ccp tournament with only 1 player and that player controlled 8 ships i dont see how they would beat any team that had 8 individual players for example and if they in fact did manage to do so and could repeat the performance to me that would point more to the fact that the eve combat mechanics might be lacking and not that isboxer is the problemisboxer offers added flexibility in running multiple eve accounts which ccp already tells us is perfectly fine if you guys really think it makes that flexibility overpowered then i suggest you ask ccp to make the eve activities more active and engaging and use of what you call keypress broadcast would become unusable
the problem isnt someone being afk cloaked its what he or she does when they come back to the keyboard and thats what people in sov null worry aboutthe whole insta gank covert hot dropping is the cause of this and being able to warp to nearly everyone doing something in sov null without launching scan probes until these issues have been fixed people who live in sov null still need a way to see threats coming into systemgankers dont go around killing other gankers because their favorite ship the bomber is pretty useless at killing other bombers generally bombers are only good at killing mining barges hence their main use anyone who has ever put a bomber together knows they are easy mode pvp all gank no tank just put torp lanchers on them and you have 400dps  dps at over 40km on the mining barge of your choiceits sov holders who want probes to scan down cloakers because good sov holders should be able to clear out the reds in a system even if the reds are afk removing cloakers for local will only smash a already partly broken systemwhen will people get the message cause an alliance trouble and they set you to red this means they dont want you in their space they want to blow your ship up and your pod to remove you as a threatmaybe we fix local and make it a sov holder and standing thing so reds nrds or anyone who isnt blue nbsi cant see it
yes because the fact we can already get safe in sov null 100 effectively is not already overpowerednews flash when an opponent cannot control events enough to force a failure in your defense that is an i win buttonyou are specifically asking to remove the stalemate that you are not even accepting any responsibility foryou only want it to be resolved in your favorand that mind boggling assumption that this is your space wtfyou have a building permit grab that outpost anchor that pos and customs office you are doneyou can only have gate control through persistent effort and if you cant control who comes thorugh it then you did not try hard enough blame yourself for that or accept you cant stop people from comingeither way you dont own the rights to being in the system since the game does not honor or respect any claims you might make in that directionget over the idea that you have non existent rights on that level in null might makes right so dont expect other players to leave your system because you are posting hereupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
lol sp is that a senior personthanks for your responses another eve player telling me to not play thats cold dude  so forget verifying age i forget how lying people aresighi know this is a teen game but eve is not a teen world to me my aunt lillian dragged me onto a roof to watch the first sputnik capsule race across the sky i was 12 i share a love of space that doesnt notice age groupsrock on
a i think relatively simple change of allowing players to set the default onofflast state of modules in the fitting menuin depth this means that if a player sets a module to be on by default it would turn on automatically after undock warp exit jumping or other occasions that may have disabled a modulethe setting of defaulting to last just means to retain the last state it was on that was selected by player input
thats a csm tag not a ccp tag beside his name 
first off malcanis thank you for making it a topic of the csm and second i dont much care about the 30 sec status i was just trying to make it less criminal friendlychribba and gamer4liff also had good input to the topic and what gamer4liff said i agree with the thing i cant stress the most though is to make it a one time deal per account to prevent this from being abused
i wouldnt make it a 1 time deal per account but rather have a very long cooldown 34 months at the min maybe even 6 months before that account would be allowed to name change again
sorry gamer4liff but clicking through peoples bio to see if they were someone else adds another complexity to eve that just isnt an enjoyable gaming experience let me give an examplelets say i live in a quiet system happily mining i know the locals and people who frequent the system there are a couple of people i watch out forevildude666  this guy suicide ganks minersbumpmeister  this guy bumps people off a belt he wants to mine himselfif i see one of these guys enter local i modify my behavior to suit the situationnow with name changes every unknown who enters local i have to click show pilot info select the alias tab i basically spend my gaming time checking the aliases of people not funall that name changes will accomplish is make known pilots unknowns again and in a game where actions have consequences this should not be allowedyes i am aware eve is a dark place people harp on about realism and we can do this in rl so why not in eve but it boils down to this eve is a game it needs to be enjoyable adding more tedium for the sake of realism will not help the gameplease note i have not addressed the char bazaar that is a necessary evil that i dont think should be allowed but i understand why it is in placejint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
if properly implemented you would get an evemail notification sent to you that he changed his name if you set his standings which im imagining you would if youre really keeping track of people by individuals and not their corporations that would be sufficient noticealso no offense but if youre mining in lowsec with a new unknown neut in system youre kind of leaving yourself open to attack at a baseline level regardless of any namechange mechanics if its really a quiet system i also wouldnt see a problem with somebody clicking and showing info on new people as they enter the system you say it like it would be an undue burden of time but it wouldnt be any longer than auditing new individuals entering the system normallygood input though and i see where youre coming from its good that we dont lose consequences of actions
in my experience the pirates with 100 sec are generally pretty proud of their reputation and would have no particular wish to change their name to escape that repthe criminals who would want to whitewash their characters names are much like in real life rarely the sort of pirates who get chased by the police you dont take a sec hit for margin trade scams or corp thefts or pyramid schemes or awoxing or spying sec status is a non issue here tbh
i was actually thinking about hisec for my examplealso even with setting standings a name change turns a known someone into an unknown someone until i spend time checking biosjint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
fair pointupon further reflection of the example though if you set them a standing as you should if youre keeping track of people individually and all their bad standing would still be preserved through the name change and youd see a fairly large red flag whenever they entered local chat seeing the standing next to their name if im remembering the existing system working like that right
jint has been posting in this topic since it was first created and weve been saying the entire time hed get a notification in fact its in the very first post hes either incapable of reading or trolling
so this would probably take a lot of work kinda restructuring of a lot of things in the game but it would be cool and add a lot to the realism factor of eve which is a big part of the appeal of eve in the first place planets that orbit the sunim sure any eve player with a basic understanding of astronomy has at one point or another wondered about this planets in real life orbit the sun so why dont planets in eve do the same thing stations anchored to these planets would also orbit the sunthis is where it would become somewhat tricky since if this is implemented every day after downtime or at some point each station and planet would actually move its position in space along its orbit this would make it so the distances between the planets and stargates would change on a daytoday basis so sometimes that warp from the station in rens to frarn gate or to the abudban gate in rens is 40 au but then later in the year maybe it is a 20 au warp im just making these numbers up for argument sakethe planets closer to the sun would take less time to complete an orbit and those further would take much longer to complete an orbit gates orbiting the sunwhether or not the stargates would move along an orbit in the same way as planets would be up to ccp i would assume they would since if you look at a solar system map the stargates appear to be on an orbital line they just never change position on itin nullsec this could be a huge change to the dynamics of certain areas for example in curse you can enter doril through the sendaya gate but only one of the stations is in dscan range from there and the outgates utopia and jorund are right next to each other but on the opposite end of the systemif gates followed an actual orbit around the sun of a solar system this would not always be the case sometimes the utopia gate and the jorund gate would be across the system from one another depending on their distance from the sun and chosen path of orbitone issue i can already think of is how gate and station tacticals would be affected if the gates and stations actually moved from their spots every dayim sure there are a lot of other things to consider with this implementation but i expect everyone reading this to comment critique analyze the possible outcome im personally a pvper and wouldnt like to see any implementations negatively affect pvp but i dont think that would be the case with this one
this has been suggested countless times and i still fully support it the only bookmarks i think we really need are the pos bookmarks since they dont otherwise show up in an easily accessible location if the planets orbit the moons do and if the moons orbit the pos does that means pos bookmarks would get screwedgate station and planet tacticals arent really as important imo but thats just my opinion and im sure there are those who vehemently disagreeaside from all that its really not a balancing thing its more of a technical issue that ccp has already said they dont quite know how to work out or simply dont have the time or resources to devote to itsupported anyways
since eve doesnt use a newtonian flight model having celestials moving while we fly could cause problems problems like the gate moving faster than the freighter trying to use it that can be fixed by keeping everything stationary while eve is up only shifting things during downtimebookmarks can be handled by binding each one to a celestial and moving them with the celestial
from what i recall of the other posts on this subject having orbiting bodies makes the servers meltdownsometimes we have to step back and say yes it would be cool but would it actually make the game and gameplay any betteri would have to say for the amount of work required it wouldnt make the game any different to how it is nowjint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
as far as i can see nikk your argument goes like thiswhen a ship is cloaked its properly cloaked no one can see the pilot in local intel the cloaked ships pilot cant see anyone else in local intel etheryou claim the effect will be gankers will not be able to see who is online in system without decloaking therefor will not benifit from the afk tactic you also argue that local gives too much intel to gankers and the gankers use it to form their target listfirst point would be ok if miners and ratters didnt live with the threat of insta gank from a covert opps fleet hot dropping in and destroying all their ships then hot dropping back out again before the defense fleet shows up even if the miners or ratters are bait the ganker usually only is at risk of loosing the cyno ship the people doing this dont usually have anything to do with sov warfare dont care about loot or isk and usually dont even care what corp or alliance their targets are in they just want to blow someones ship up for  and giggles this is the reason as someone invoked in corpalliance leadership that i personally dont like to see 1 miner or ratter being lost to a ganker from any corp that operates inside the system our corp alliance works in ever loose one non pvpdefence ship and the cloaky campers just start hanging around like pesky flyssecond point even if cloaks are perfect and the cloaker cant be seen in local they still benefit i cant leave my mining ship in a belt online and go to work come home do some quick mining without having to go though log on screens undocking and so on then go see a movie with friends leaving my ship online in space so i can check the rocks when i come home well gankers can and in hostile space with current cloak mechanics only difference being removing him from local others will not be able to see he is there so will have to treat all systems as if they have a cloaker threat in system even if their is no cloakerthird point from my own experience local intel isnt the main thing gankers use to target systems sovereignty mining index and sov holding alliance policies are yer they get to know their target systems and if new people show up they hang around more but an increase in mining index has a far bigger effect take the mining index from 3 to 4 and you are almost guaranteed to get some new gankers hanging around for a while doing the cloaky camp in systems in and around the one with the increase in mining index until they get bored of getting zero kills then they go awaybeing 100 safe not loosing ships when mining ratting or doing complexes in null sov space is currently not only the best defense from gankers its currently the only defense this has come about about because pvp ganking is so dam effective nerf covert cynos or cloaking then we might be able to talk about changes to local intel
thank you for numbering the points i appreciate this detailthis assumes more than a few detailsfirst my ideas come hand in hand with a method to detect cloaked vesselsi will be glad to link the thread if you wish otherwise i claim it to be the most balanced method possible in the absence of local intel revealing cloaked presence freelyhot dropping is a delicate procedure and only practical if both the target and the dropper has constant and reliable intel on exactly how many pilots are present in the systemby explanation it is the only way for a target to be attacked by multiple dps ships minus the obvious warning currently being provided you see a spike in local from half a dozen ships and you have no doubts regarding your lack of safetyfor the dropper you never ever want to drop into an enemy fleet since the only functional way a drop succeeds is by using overwhelming force often supplemented by targets surprise and confusion unless you have local to verify your drop zone is clear you are asking for a very expensive disasterpointing out the obvious if they cant see cloaked in local sneak the cloaked vessels in quietly before hand no load time and everyone can warp together to the targeti would never assume that you were a botter so no of course you cannot genuinely afk minethis would be a source of direct isk income with zero direct effort and would therefore break the eula of this gameyou could however cripple the fitting on your exhumer by fitting a cloak the same way your presumed opponents must dothen you would indeed be able to do everything you just suggestedthis is also building on previous assumptions debunked aboveit is enough to point out that doing a proactive scan for cloaked vessels before operating would be a practical stepyou may see cause to do routine patrols as well you would expect some effort on the part of a cloaked pilot to insert themselves into your system matching this by being vigilant seems fair so as you described your hunters are going to considerable effort to research your location and following it up with some rather cunning stealthy logistics to place themselves inside their target areayou on the other hand want to sit back on the past achievements your corp or alliance made by acquiring the sov so they could build the pos  outposts you reside inyou then follow this up with free intel requiring no effort from you beyond being at your keyboard to usein effect then regarding your safety we have a one time effort from your associates followed by minimum paying attention and not making bad decisions from yourselffrom the cloaked menace persistent need for research required in the form of tracking mining indexes knowing your targets policies on the alliance level and finally then they get to watch local to see who is present for shootingin a game meant to demonstrate a competition by effort why is one side showing a different levelupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
cloaks requiring some sort of fuel yes please other than that it works fine
for those of you who dont know ccp recently hired former ea exec sean decker to the position of senior vice president of product developmentthis is a very disturbing move hiring somebody with a known reputation of creating pay to win systems and generally considering gamers as cattle to squeeze every last drop of money out of through microtransactionseven more disturbing is the fact that he has still yet to come forward to the community and introduce himself maybe in an attempt to allay some of our well founded fears and concerns in synergy with the above point ccp has been very tightlipped about him save for the official announcement on their webpage link to ccp announcementmy proposal is simple the csm should use their leverage to get decker to address us the community short of that we need some reason as to why he is being kept hidden away mig
why should he from the commentary so far here theres pretty much nothing he can say that wont get a response involving flaming torches and pitchforks
its far better than hiding i mean really it shows that he actually cares to give it a go
i would like the ability to create folders inside of folders for bookmarks in the places tab itd allow for easier management of your bookmarks while in the places tab ive pretty much stopped making bms on my scout pilot because its a hassle to go through dozens upon dozens of folders while tryign to organize or find a particular bm and it was nauseating to switch computers and open the places tab to find over a thousand bookmarks lying about with no folders and insane names due to the increasingly conviluted naming schemes i kept coming up with just so i know where in space the bookmark is locatedid much rather wish to expand to different folders when right clicking in space than to scroll down through my local bookmarks in a system particularly when i have several dozen bookmarks of the type im looking for in that systemits no coincidence allowing for folders inside of folders is standard on pretty much any os or program its the best method weve come up with for storing information for ease of access to date
yes i know you have been saying that a notification would be sent out if you have that person set to some level of standingmaybe i am playing eve wrong but i personally dont have everyone i recognize in eve setup with a standing im sure there are people out there in the bigger alliances or regulars in the more lawless parts of the eve universe who have hundreds of people setup in their standings if people start regularly changing their names thats going to be a nightmare to keep track ofeven so with this idea we are now playing keep track of notifications about who is who and if you ask me it adds another layer of complexity which does not make eve more fun to play and it is a game which is supposed to be enjoyableas you can probably tell i dont support namechanges in eve never have never will im sorry if you think im incapable of reading im not or that im trolling also notfly safejint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
eve is a game of choices if you dun goofed then thats the end of it you move on
got a friend in my corp who petitions the lack of orbital vectors on planetsmoons and stations once a month hes never missed a month and is 7 years old in eve lolthats is dedication to a belief
it should require 1 mil isk per minute to stay docked safely in null sec stations
mate this is the eve forums you get a pitchfork just for logging in and a flaming torch for posting your first posthowever there are a few things he could say that would avoid the burning and the pokingjint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
actually i know for a fact he has posted on the eve forums
mind linking the thread i have sure not been able to find a trace of him
in the thread speculating about what sean deckers ccp name would be
thats descriptive can you link the specific postnamealso if you know he has seen the forums why has he not addressed the community seems a bit odd
if youre retired then presumably you have a fair amount of free time if you can raise 500m isk a month and you can then you can play for free via plex which is specifically in the game to allow time rich cash poor players to play
i have put this suggestion nested bookmarks into the little things thread hopefully it will make it through the winnowing of ideasm
huh i missed that could you link it for me mikei wish to gief supports
ive recalled a couple of other ideas so adding them here too1 in planetary mode while you are trying to survey the surface your best and most anticipated option is a relatively small region where most of resources of your interest located in a sufficient amount so you have to choose one of them from list find a couple of hotspots then switch to another  and here we are without a clue where those previously scanned hotspots now are there should be possibility to set some kind of surface bookmark with corresponding resource symbol and player typed comment to ease further exploration for more and more intersecting hotspot regions2 possibility to sell your colony through contracting system like any other property with some ability for a potentional buyer to estimate resoures distribution around it without the need to go there in flesh would be very useful3 possibility to issue courier contracts to outsource logistics allowing someone contracted to grab ur products from one customs office and transport them to another or to the station without the need to drag them first to the nearest station by yourslef will be of great help should allow person contracted for the job to access specified amount of goods and only this one stack of it to be transfered in the customs office
yeah and its funny how they give us a choice to change our entire characters appearance but not the name in some ways thats even moreso changing than a name changeyou could use the real world as an example whats a greater change changing your name or getting surgery to drastically change your appearance all characters from what i can see have been flagged for recustomization if you havent already done so so yeahgive my character a nosejob eyelift etc take the pornstar route or change their namehmm thats a tough one i cant tell which is a greater change
mags talks about posting serious replies and thorough statements yet when people have done this time and again his only retort is lol thats called losing any credibility in the discussion is what that is both myself and others have stated clear and logical reasons why it is absurd to allow bounty placement to be done for such fickle and idiotic reasons lastly mag suggested reading the tos rules to revillee yet rules 13 clearly show reasons why the abuse of bounty placement should be halted by ccp there is zero reason why anyone should be able to place a bounty on another player due to mere words typed in chat that they didnt like it is absurd
yet you have still failed to say why the is being abused 13 do not show anything of the sortlets read them shall we1 you may not abuse harass or threaten another player or authorized representative of ccp including customer service personnel and volunteers this includes but is not limited to filing support tickets with false information in an attempt to gain from it or have someone else suffer from it sending excessive emails evemails or support tickets obstructing ccp employees from doing their jobs refusal to follow the instructions of a ccp employee or implying favoritism by a ccp employeeno mention of placement of bounties there for reasons you may not like so lets look at two2 you may not use any abusive defamatory ethnically or racially offensive harassing harmful hateful obscene offensive sexually explicit threatening or vulgar language alternate spelling or partial masking of such words will be reprimanded in the same manner as the actual use of such wordsno mention of bounties there either just talk of abusive language etc so now to three3 you may not organize nor be a member of any corporation or group within eve online that is based on or advocates any antiethnic antigay antireligious racist sexist or other hatemongering philosophieshmm still nothing regarding bounties just more about racism and general antiness all of which we would agree is badso yes when i said lol i meant it because if you had bothered to read them as well as revillee you can quite plainly see it doesnt fit your argument one bit instead you keep claiming abuse but have failed as of yet to show exactly what that abuse is time and againrevillee claimed ccp broke third party rules by including players in that list in a game an mmo game their mmo game at that and you think i should take that stance seriously reallysandbox games mean you can build and do whatever you wish to reach your goals within the rules and boundaries of the game but it also means others can try to stop you and make you fail so that they may succeed in reaching theirswhich means there is absolutely no reason why someone cannot place a bounty for mere words used in a chat none whatsoever you may think it petty you may think it spiteful but you not liking it does not constitute abuse nor reason for changefinally let me quote a dev for you ive already posted it in the thread but you seem not to have read itrandom feelings of spite hmmm i think you may have a problem sondestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
mag you already proved you could care less about discussing the topic with any sense of logic so taking the tos literally out of context without understanding the wide scope it covers does not further your efforts in trolling the topicas i have said i already posted earlier in the thread how the was being abused and i will not repost my statement to enable your laziness so feel free to read it yourself
there seem to be alot of highsec ganking going on with really low sp characters in catalysts or other crap ships to rebalance this ccp should rethink how sec hits work for piracy ie if a freighter is killed then the aggressors should take a hit equivilant to the ships size classification freighters and bs would result in high sec hits whereas frigates would be the lowest they could even modify the amount based on the security of the system as well 05 would be different from 10it just doesnt seem right that a few catalysts costing 5m can easily down a freighter or t3 or bs in highsec without sever consequences losing 50m worth of catalysts is easily offset by suiciding anything of slight value
im on social security and getting money from the government please give me more handouts
ship spinning is a useless feature that should never have been readded to the game i do not support this at all
so far your argument is based on i feel putting a bounty on someone for reasons i dont comprehend or like is wrongthe basic counter argument that mag has made that i also made earlier in this thread is that the reason for putting a bounty on someone is purely subjective you cant honestly state that x reason is a good reason for putting a bounty on someone as another person will feel the complete oppositethis entire argument we are having is case and point of that you feel that putting a bounty on someone because you dont like them is a bad reason we feel that it is completely acceptable
false i never said i dont comprehend why those abusing the post bounties you are using an informal fallacy to base your argument on i understand very clearly that those abusing the are doing so to satisfy their own ego in order to bully other players into not speaking freely in chat or enjoying the game as it is without being harassed by those exploiting an underdeveloped feature of the game whether i like it or not is irrelevant and is not inductive of whether the is in need of being fixed or not i also can very clearly state that x reason is a good reason for putting a bounty on someone because bounties are not something that ccp invented it is based on a real system in the real world that being said its not legal in that system to place a bounty on someone for something someone says either again i am not the only one who obviously feels this way about the problem or the thread wouldnt exist just because you lack the decency or a sense of morals to see the problem doesnt mean anyone has or will ever put up with it why you added that last part we i am not sure since you are only one person and have zero authority to speak for anyone but yourself
whether people put bounties on others for their own egotistical reasons is not something you can say is bad though its a perfectly valid reason to those people who do it there is a man who lives in california who would beg to differ with you on that point he created a rather inflammatory film depicting a certain religion in a bad way then got a bounty placed on him by a politician on the other side of the worldor how in early american history bounties were put out for the scalps of native americans any would do even the innocent ones because who was really going to to notice the differenceeven now there are bounties being placed on other people for perceived notions of how things should besee this is where youve gone wrong  you cant enforce morality with mechanics at least not in a way that people cant take advantage of without resorting to ever more draconian mechanics that will chip away at the whole sandbox concept of eve bit by bit because youd be taking away freedoms to enforce behavior that you consider to be right there is no correct version of morality again our argument is proof of this ill keep hammering this point what you consider moral may or may not be what i consider morali personally dont see a problem with random bounties being put on people for what people say in fact ive done it myself in eve i often find that im more offended by what people say for whatever reason than what they do the most flexible and least mechanically intensive option for anyone ccp especially is to keep the system and tools as open as possible so people can use them for whatever reason they deem as right
and you dear sir yet again avoided the topic your attempt to side step the issue by saying im trolling the topic is an obvious ploy and rather sillyyou could prove me wrong instead of ignoring the topic and my answers to your posts show me exactly what in the tos is being broken as i already quoted and replied to your earlier posts merely point out where you show the is being abused a link or quote will doyou can clearly state that you think x is a good reason but as its not your place to dictate or decide other peoples reasoning its a rather pointless argument to makeccp may not have invented the  but within the game of eve their rules apply to their  legality doesnt come into it in fact one could argue the legality issue was removed when they changed the people posting saying there is a problem does not equate to there being one unless of course they can clearly show what the problem is so far you and others have not done this you even when repeatedly asked avoid doing soalso morals dont come into it either unless it can be clearly shown that the eula or tos is being broken in that way such as the use of racism sexism etc none of which are involved in this unless those getting the bounty said something they are after all the ones typingwe are playing a game with rules just like any other game people are allowed to use the tools provided as long as they stick to the rules complaining about morals in this instance is like complaining about regicide in chessive clearly shown what ccp think to random acts of spite in bounty placements clearly they dont have issues with their sandbox game being played as a sandbox game you on the other hand do what you are after is called a themepark which means you are either in the wrong game or need to adaptdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
the op although i do not suspect he has followed this logic through to the conclusion is suggesting that bounties gain a specific limitthey must be approved by either popular vote or limited to specific circumstancesthese are spiteful things in some cases and desperate attempts at justice in othersshould everything in the game have such limitshow would this be a sandbox game thenupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
shaflufferswhether people put bounties on others for their own egotistical reasons is not something you can say is bad though its a perfectly valid reason to those people who do it wrong again those exploiting the are using it as an excuse not 
see now were going in circles againyou are literally stating that there are right and wrong see valid and invalid reasons for putting a bounty on someone im pointing out that what people consider valid varies from person to person and that you cant in any way say those reasons you dont consider valid are excuses to those people their reasons are perfectly valid and saying otherwise infringes upon the freedom of the sandboxits literally no different than someone saying i dont like the reasonway you play this game you have to play it in a way i deem fiti never made any mention of the mans imprisonment or what happened in benghazi  seriously i was simply pointing out that he made a film which is a form of expression protected under us law and that a random person decided to put a bounty on the man due to being offended which illustrates my point perfectly because the filmmaker did nothing wrong legally in making the film it just really bothered someone who found it a perfectly justifiable reason to put a price on the mans head except the bounty mechanics wont cause all that or have caused any of that in the 78 months they have been active they dont change any of the current combat mechanics concord rules still apply and because of the way the payout system works you wont really become a target unless you fly something expensive even with a super high bounty on your headand there is no problem with that because again their reason is validjustified to them and thats really all that matters in this dystopian gamethen why do i not agree with your version of how things should be obviously they are not as universal as you think

this wouldnt change anything most of us who suicide gank are already have 10 security status or close to which is the lowest you can go why not i know real life examples are bad and all buta 200000 dollar shoulderfired missile has the capacity to blow up a multimillion dollar helicopter or plane as far as consequences are concerned players who suicide gank already take a security status penalty which is quite large when the security status of the victim is high lose their ship 100 guaranteed loss that ship insurance doesnt cover are not guaranteed getting loot or the loot they want at least 5050 odds that a weapon module or cargo item will drop have to organize and plan to take out anything beefier than an untanked hauler or mining barge no small feat the term herding cats applies here will have to deal with the faction police harassing them if their security status goes below 50 which means that they cant really fly anything bigger than a cruiser or so without the risk of getting scrammed webbed and blown up by said faction police will have to deal with the added threat of other players if their security status goes below 50 as you can be shot at by anyone and everyone without penalty anywhere in the game for as long as you stay below 50and why shouldnt a lot of organized cheaper ships be able to nuke a larger more expensive ship
not sure if 10 catalysts can suicide gank a t3 or bs but i do know they cant take down a freighter as that reqs several bss you might want to research a bit more next time you make a proposal
they have downed freighters with destroyers yust alot of them o wich still means its cheap but needs a bigger group to doit
to gank a freighter it takes with max skills about 95 pure gankfit catalysts that are entirely meta 0 fit to down a freighter in 3 volleys  85 if you overload with the same fit  60 if overloaded and tech 2 fitted which also raises the total cost to about 600 million compared to the 200 mil needed using just tech 1 fitsagain scrounging up and organizing that many people is no small feat and less desirable too as youll have to split up all the loot between all those people
maybe if you had an idea of the mechanics at work here you could be better informedplease tell us just how many gank fit catalysts you can put together for 50 mil then let us know what you could suicide gank with themasking for arbitrary changes to sec hits with little to no knowledge of the game is asking for troubledestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
and how often irl that happens in hisec areas like in washington or london how easly one can pull such a thing and if its not that easy to pull than for what reason irl world we have a whole layer of national security constantly working behind the scenes and of course by background story we have it in eve universe too but in fact it manifests itself only after the trigger has been pulled yea the eve uni is much more turbulent and wild but thatve already gone too far i have no problem with ganking someone with valuable posessions with not so cheap suicide ship involved that somehow reflect the need to make some efforts and spend funds to prepare and commit such atrocity in high secure area so to somehow balance this we need such level of concords reaction time and dps that will call for proportionate fund investment from suicide gankerand there are one other head of this hydra  because it not so costly of a trade it allows for sg for fun when ur just kill anyone you likedont like without any real profit and combine this with unprecendent ease of aquiring another fully functional not a trial alt in eve for the moment they dont really care and can switch alts from time to time as the topicstarter has already wrote they lose cheap vessel and blow up very expensive still they will profit in the long term and low cost of commiting such atrocities make possible for do them for sheer fun thats not so big of a deal and they get profit from it anyway not so big deal start another altbuy another character not really in highsec u wont find so much pvphungry and brave enough players and most of them have other things to do than to attack scary outlaw most will fear this is a trapbecause if we speak in terms of eve is real most of them would have been preemptivly stopped by national security and police and turned into examples why someone shouldnt mess with the service and because if irl we had an outrage with intense increasing of murders and property damaging in higly civilized urban areas these services would reacted quickly and came in arms to stabilize situation and get the city block or even whole city under control and that dinamic reaction of law enforcment agencies is completely absent from eve too so to compare it with irls state of affairs as it is is basically wrong eve consists of huge pile of abstractions and artificial farfetched restrictions added to the game just to balance things which ccp cantdoesnt want to simulate properly and this particular aspect isnt well balanced currently
if your so afraid of losing a frieghter then why not fly an orca a properly fit orca gets much more tank than a frieghter and so is much harder to kill and is cheaper than freighters
and 1million times

i think the op wants to have his tank running while autopiloting around
dunno if anyone else has it but i got killrights that can be activated on players on my overview but often it dont showup until i actualy click on the char itselfmayby i yust have to reinstall eve orso
it is a game of choices yes but there is almost always an ingame solution to overcome mistakes and the mistakes hurt but they are not permanently debilitating lose a ship stupidly dont fly like that again got scammed dont fall for the scam again undock with 20 plex in your hold in an ibis from jita 44 etc here the problem is constant and all but unavoidable the only solution is to purchase a new char with isk or start over quite immersion breakingthe game has been moving toward having no permanent way to screw up your char for a while now years ago you could not remap your attributes or change your face i see no reason it cant be taken one step further and allow people to change their names with proper and reasonable implementation

and my microwave prefreeze my paminto loaf thank you ccp for automating everything in our lives its far to difficult to launch a music player i have to alt tab to to play music in the background ugh
shahflufferssee now were going in circles againno you are going in circles because you keep trying to simplify the issue by thinking i am breaking this down as right and wrong you have posted that same comment several times in this thread it d
like i said i have read and replied to previous posts of yours not once have you shown where the abuse is because you dont like how someone is using the  does not constitute abuse or exploityes the tos and eula are far reaching and loosely based in order to encompass all ccp deem inappropriate but your problem is ccp dont have an issue with how its being used ive even quoted a dev saying as much i can provide links to this quote if needed you on the other hand have yet failed to show how the parts of the tos you indicated are being broken or show any member of ccp agreeing with you simply saying a gm said something doesnt quite cut itno people posting there is a problem doesnt default into there being one they have to actually show a problem simply stating it as fact doesnt make it so i acknowledge you have an issue with people placing bounties for reasons you dont like but that does not mean the is being abused or exploited it merely means you dont like italso including the term exploit will not make you any more correct than before it merely shows how desperate you areive read all you previous posts and have not once seen abuse being shown or proven if you had any faith in what you are saying you wouldnt have any problems doing what i ask or continuing to argue the point the fact youre now not replying speaks volumesi started not long after beta but both your time in the game and mine is irrelevant to what a sandbox game is you obviously dont understand what one is even though eve is classed as a sandbox game its not a true sandbox in the literal term eve has rules and boundaries but this makes it playable a true sandbox does equal anarchy but the fact you didnt know this doesnt surprise methe only thing you got right was the followingyes it does allow for all styles this means styles that interfere with yours and ones you may not like you on the other hand think all styles are fine as long as they do not interfere with you that is wrong and would mean a themepark not the other way aroundso as ive read and replied to all not yet seeing what i ask for ill ask againplease show me why the system is being abused if you feel youve already done this please show me where a link will sufficedestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
underlined conflicting statements morals inherently deal with proper and improper behavior the difference between right and wrong which differs from person to personi see no problem with putting a bounty on someone out of spite you do we will never come to agreement on thishowever you are trying to take away a freedom i enjoy so i will fight your efforts to curtail it you mean like the real systems of bounty placing that i showed through various articles systems that arewere much less structured bloody and spiteful than anything we have in eveactually yes eve is more like the wild west than you think it isthis is a future filled with greed economic poverty bribery soulless economics backstabbing slavery terrorists suicide bombers super spies prostitution psychopaths tribalfactional infighting torture mass murder genocide drug dealing extortion blackmail genetic manipulation living death anarchy orwellian security etc etcobviously we are either not reading the same lore or interpreting it the same wayread what i said very carefully i in no way said that his imprisonment had anything to do with his film it had nothing to do with it and yes there was a bounty for his head placed upon him by a pakistani politician in the order of 10k usd due to being offended by the film which again had nothing to do with his imprisonmentso yes if you want eve to be more like the real world its a very valid point to this discussion which again proves that the correct version of morality is not as universal as you are making it out to bebelieve it or not some people think and perceive the world differently than you do and forcing your version or what you perceive to be a valid version of what is correct does not jive with the concept of a sandbox which is anarchistic at its core see anyone if free to do what they want but other players are allowed to do the same thing for better or wose
shafluffersapparently you are abandoning the debate since you refuse to acknowledge the commonly known difference of dictionarydefined english words as well as disregarding cited argument points recognized by any accredited university my points are ba
to claim morality is objective rather than subjective is to deny the existence of cultures and societies where different moral values exist
in the eve sandbox why do people keep bringing up fairness and golly gee ccp put in a game mechanic and the players are using it as they see fit rather than as the devs had originally envisioned it call tmc thats gotta be newsanybody can place a bounty on anybody that seems the definition of fairness to me
oh pal u probably havent met cloakfan boys yet those will jump out of their pants sighting any reasonable suggestion to somehow fixenhance this quite simplistic and unbalanced in current its state aspect of the game and will die gripping firmly to the 510 years old mechanics they accustomed to

so then couldnt bookmarks be recalibrated through a ship scan warp to a planet and then your bookmarks could automatically be adjusted based on the bodys location in space or better yet a ship scan could determine how far things have shifter since your last visit based on the traversal of the planets around the staranyways i still feel that this feature would be amazing and promote more scanning making all space more like wormhole space and therefore so much more fun but i do see the huge technical difficulties but if theres ever a way conceived ccp this would be awesome and brings the game that much more close to real life and allowing the game software to move forward in the future to controlling our real space ships humans wont leave earth why should we the ships can do the heavy lifting through telepathy over wide band something will invent in the future 
im with you i think there should be roll back timer i know that with out this the system is severely broken in that you can earn hundreds of millions of isk per hour with the current system using the tactic described we were able to partially test this with the markee dragon stream if it wasnt streamed there wouldnt have been so many snipers and much more profitable but still it was proven doable
highsec could stand to be reduced in size by a percentile of its systems lowsec could be expanded by the same margin but what i cannot disagree with is that nullsec is broken from an accessibility viewpoint in terms of physical access routes it is in desperate need of at least twice as many gates inout as for power projection if this is a question of empires being too large and not using the space they already have then lets shorten bridge lengths lets condense them 20 to jump bridge range in the next patch if successful roll out to 50 of todays bridge range condense the empires by limiting their maneuvers and by necessity they will lose some ground piece by piece as for mining changes all i see is inflation going insane new players cant afford these prices a caracal today is literally 4x the price of what i paid for my first one and that was when i could barely afford one your average newbie i highly highly doubt practices all disciplines of eve and certainly is in no hurry to start the mandatory 24 alts this game demands in order to be selfsufficient bottingisboxing is the same thing as far as im concerned theyre pay to win by virtue of paying more  for higher productivity and only because ccp keep hamfisting players abilities to get a handle on resourcesproduction this bizarre and sad oligarchy of merchants and manufacturers i see regardless of whether they are nullsec alts or otherwise are strangling the game to death if you want to fix mining my proposal is simple make it impossible to manufacture t2 equipment inside highsec maybe even restrict it to nullsec operations only pretty much the same thing i have said for 3 years plex is overused by highsec players to fund their game because theyre inadequately able to supply their own materials and ships they have no real progression laid before them all advice i see given on forums and places like 4chan is spreadsheets in space zzzzz or join a nullsec corp straight away dont do the tutorials ccp alledeges the latter group have the highest retention rate but i doubt that its that much higher than everywhere else too much time is required to make it in this game the ratio of winners to losers is skewed with most being losers and a couple of winners in a previous csm summit a ccp person more or less outright stated that it doesnt matter how tiresome or tedious you make highsec people will stay there no matter what i know that my first adventures in to lowsec were hilariously dangerous as the spiteful little chimps dragging their knuckles over how good they are at killing newbs was punctuated with lost ships and paranoia instead of having lowsec corporations actively recruit members theyre encouraged by game mechanics to pillage everything that enters their space which only further cements lowsecs terrible reputation especially when combined with the low riskreward situation im getting tired of writing this is just running over old ground all of it related to the map and its interdependent game mechanics i have more fun on sisi than i do on tq these days and thats a very dangerous thing because sisi is pretty onedimensional
i cant see a reason for this just because you can already salvage so quickly in a destroyer or a noctis that this doesnt make a whole lot of since to me
ye i knowits just that it seems there can be so much more
the new crimewatch got invented last winter but there are a few things that arent goodthe criminal flag prevents you from warping or docking when you are not in a pod i want to see players that are fleeting from concord and dock up i dont know why this was an exploit as it was indide of normal game mechanics you should be able to kill a hauler at a station and then warp away fleet from concord and dock on station as soon as your weapontimer endedso the criminal flag allows only other players and concord to attack you can still warp and docksuspectflagthe problem you can play stationgames with it looting a can wait for someone that shoots you and then just dock and undock till the timer expiries then you take out something bigger and kill the guys that attacked youthe solutionadd a new flag called limited suspectflag or thiefflagthe limited suspectflag is only for stealing loot from wrecks and containers or remote assisting players in limited engagements with the actual system you can also use npc alts to protect wrecks from corpfights without theyr own risk this will not remove the stationgames but makes them harder as you will need to spend an utillity hislot for a remorerepair module and you have to wait if someone makes a suicide gank or you need an activaitable killright on you that gets activated by an alt but getting a suspectflag for stealing loot is too much the limited suspectflag allows all members of a corporation that includes npc corps too and his alliance to attack the thief for 15 minutes goodbye canflipstationgamesUFFFD
the criminal flag means you cannot dock and this is by design you should never be allowed to escape concords punishment for obvious reasonsthe suspect flag is simply a lower level of flagging and as such docking is allowed but if you decide to attack a pilot with a suspect flag on a station then you have to expect the chance hell dock and shoot you you have options in those situations and if you chose badly then you only have yourself to blamethere is no need for a solution as options are already available but i shall talk about your requestthe fact you chose to include npc alts in order to justify this new flag means its already off to a bad start if your corp needs to protect loot then they need to get organised and do that as a corp dont look to the game to hold your hand in this regardone thing almost all know is that station games suck if you wish to participate in station games then you have to expect this and understand what could happen breaking the new flagging rules to accommodate station games is not the answerdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
i think it would be amazing if the reputation tab was used more often with the ability to add comments to your reputation settings this would allow for the marking of people who just like to scam other players or allow people to be warned about just general d bags the current system really doesnt have much use except to see who you should shoot or not shoot based on your current alignments im not saying this should change just that the comments system would be pretty awesomeit would allow for the creation of nice people in the game because if they have a reputation thats going to follow them around saying they just grief people and are just annoying to be aroundthis also allows for positive comments which could potentially be integrated into the market system allowing for good and bad reputation comments being allowed to be added for people who place items at super inflated prices in the hopes someones not paying enough attention and loses a billion isk on some ammo then we could maybe get a sort market option by sellers rep eliminating more of the accidental buys yes i know there is the percentage settings and they do work pretty welljust a quick idea i had anyone else think its decent or maybe needs a bit of tweaking through constructive criticism
im not really sure what this gentlemen is asking for since you can now play for free and if he is retired there is no reason if he is reasonably good at the game that he doesnt potentially have the ability to earn enough isk for a plex or two per month i guess maybe hes asking to be able to convert plex back into cash so he can pay real bills otherwise i dont see a point to this post sorry maybe if you added more details to what your looking for you could change my mind
im sorry but i do find it amusing that someone who gave themselves a name ending in 4life misspelled presumably because the correct spelling was already taken is such a strong campaigner for a name change system jint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
ive had a lot a lot of time to think about thisthe reason for the misspelling is that i originally created the char with the correct spelling in 2004 but the tutorial bugged out and i couldnt progress so i created this one then deleted the old one with the correct spellingi was a dumb kid ok
good lord are people still wasting time with this
apparently morals have nothing to do with someone deciding what is good or bad and the isnt fair because fair in a sandbox game means respecting others play styles and not interfering with them because of anarchydestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
since when is making the use of the assembly hall for voicing matters that concern players a waste of time never it is fairly odd a csm of all people would say something as biased as that the last time i checked csms are to serve the players as liaisons to ccp due to their being elected by the players not make snide comments when a player makes use of their own assembly hall forumroannonfairness was brought up because fairness was in ccps direct quote is whyon a similar note it boggles my mind also that ccp just last year made it very clear after the 2012 fanfest panel bullying incident that ccp does not endorse harassment in any form yet the new is exactly that a bully enabler UFFFDi want to reassure you that ccp in no way condones the harassment of players especially those who suffer from depression or suicidal thoughts as we understand the possible consequences of such abhorrent behaviorUFFFD ccpUFFFDs ned coker said
the is a weapon it is simply less direct than a turret or missileany abuse of this weapon that is demonstrated to be harassment can be handled appropriatelysince the bounty has no meaning or harassment potential if weapons are not used towards that target should we also place more limits on these weapons that can be mounted on turrets or missilesupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
would be great1
i like this idea
1 would love this too 
no need to flame just look at eve kill getting past the 5 man talos gank and the 10 man brutix ganks you find 6 mails on the first page of 5b kills done by catalysts
it costs a lot more than 50m to down a freighterhint those catalysts need things like guns and damage modsits a fundamental mistake to try and balance things on hull cost alone for instance velators are free to balance a freighter against the cost of ganking with noobships youd need to give freighters infinite ehpthe paradox is resolved by including the factor of player effort yes 20 catalysts can kill a freighter thats absolutely fine because 20 catalysts can kill just about anything  you can easily kill a carrier with that much dps for instancetldr no
the one link you gave which was even remotely catalyst only was this one but at only 16033 damage its obviously a follow on hit after a failed first attempt one of which we have no idea of the ships involvedalthough a good attempt at side tracking it doesnt answer the tasks i put to you based on your 50 million limitso ill ask againplease tell us just how many gank fit catalysts you can put together for 50 mil then let us know what you could suicide gank with themdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
not really no the only thing that theres a lot of is people whining about it because of what a shock it isalso even there were a lot of them so what its not like the size of the ships used is in any way relevantthere are severe consequenes and the value of the ships involved is utterly and completely irrelevant if anything being able to kill expensive ships with cheap ships means that the game is properly balancedplease provide and pricecheck said fit by the way in none of the links you provided seemed did the cats seem to have more than at best being very generious 700 dps UFFFD most seemed to have had 400500
real life examples are badif you ram your car into my car intentionally you will not receive insurancethere is a very simple way to fix thisif concord is involved in killing you you get no insurance pay outif you really still want to nuke me go for it but it will cost you the whole amount as it should
would you rather players do thisthe topic of isboxer and multiboxing always get associated with botting automation etc and it always seems to have the same arguments against it most of the opposition from what i gather are from people that dont quite grasp the concept and functionality of isboxer syenergy or whatever the new flavor of the month is broadcasting keys to multiple clients is not the same as scripting multiple keys and commands to a clients in terms of automation autonomous programs do not require human input aside from turning on and running in no way can isboxer do that without an additional third party program or script can isboxer be used to macro andor keybind yes but that is nothing different that a logitech g15 or a razer keyboard can do and that is legal because it still requires input from a human bottom line is this if ccp went crazy and banned isboxer i would not lose a minute of sleep because i have as i am sure many others out there do the resources and capability to set up hardware to do what isboxer can with equal to or greater proficiencyedit do not pay attention to the above links article it is old and does not reflect ccps current view on the matter of multiboxing i am sure that some of you quote ninjas would read it without looking at the date or researching the article and have a field day
exactly my view that people seem to miss its a character you dont need to pay for while youre not usingi have a haulerfreighter second char i dont move things that often once a monthcouple of months so it just sits there and when i need a ton of stuff moved its therethis would be unwise and impractical to have a second account for what you are paying the extra for is training an account that never goes away or becomes inactive
on a more cerebral note i think its fascinating are we going to see a repeat of the incarna fiasco is hiring someone who comes from a company that has been literally sued for creative slavelabour conditions on its staff really the right choiceto play devils advocate ccp have hired him to control the products development and direction ea might be horrifying monsters but their strategies for successful business still work somewhat they havent hired him as cfo or any other top level position he still gets his instructions from someone else up the chain from him i can see this going one of two ways the death of ccp through some kind of elaborate corporate espionage act or ccps final acceptance in the mainstream through wod and dust
heres his profile
although its not very well explained i think you are suggesting that i can put a comment in your standings to say this guys is trustworthy and the rest of eve can read ityou really need to think these things through before posting them how can you not see how this would be abusedwhat if an entire alliance decided to get all its members to downvote you or all mark you as this guy has sexual relations with goatsor that guy with the 50 accounts uses all his alts to upvote all his characters sorry but its a bad ideajint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
i cant think of any way that this could possibly abusedsuch a shame that you conseptionism are a notorious scammer awoxer and spy and that i have no way of telling the whole cluster thisnaturally anything that i put into a rep comment is 100 trustworthy and reliable and people should believe me
the amount of moderation that would then need to accompany such a system would be ludicrousfor example given the opportunity i would leave a comment on the poster above me involving genetalia or an ascii emote because hes a jerk he smells and is the most trustworthy 3rd party service in the game
i do think this is a good idea
perhaps you were thinking of the meaning of liff

nikk essentially you are right those exploiting the current are using it as a weapon against those they cannot openly attack as freely as they would like since those players they target do not normally stoop to their level
you have succintly described what a is for
stoop to their level i take it then you have never won at a game of chess then as you wouldnt stoop so low as to be involved in regicidebut you are correct it is a weapon but a rather blunt one at that but it is working as intended destination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
what would this add to gameplay seems to me that it would be neat the first day then be totally ignored after that lot of work for what amounts to not much at all

highsec ganking is at an all time lowi really dislike people like the op  no matter how many buffs they get they still scream and cry for moresad
also the price is irrelevantthe entire idea that your ship should be immune to a ship that costs less or twenty of them is just pants on head idioticjust biomass yourself op you dont understand this game
someone gets it i do the same with some industrial alts that i need but havent been able to train up without stopping training on my combat characters
