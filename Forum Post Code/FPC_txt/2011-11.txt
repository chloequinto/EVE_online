aye 1
the suggestion that capsuleers wouldnt wear a bra when its literally a default part of the outfit amuses me
i have 5 accounts and every single character except two are female so i want the biggest bounciest ballslappiest boobs everalso bootie
bras arent included in birthday suitsthis message was brought to you in technicolor by a horny cynical iq
supportedregarding other clothing options i wouldnt mind the bra if we could have only the bra and no jacket but an unbuttoned sweater showing cleavage would suit me fine as well
so somebody already slammed out a nude mod im even more amusedmainly though its all the folks in this thread who hate and fear proper support that make me giggle and i suppose you could argue cloning fixes your sag problems but its still a lovely and bizarre demonstration of girl
i saw a cool name which probably isnt even a name but a description and i want it i am not capable of thinking of a name myselfseriously sometimes people do come back after a long time and you absolutely dont ever do this or they are pissed off and gone for good very bad business practise
i would be curious to know just how much server space would be freed up if they deleted all the trial accounts 1
dormant paid accounts toowhat right do you think you are owed if you paid 14 dollars for 1 month and then didnt play for 7 yearsif you do not pay for your car lease it gets repodif you do not pay for your house mortgage the bank takes it backif you do not pay rent you get thrown outonly in eve you pay nothing  you still own itput in a 6 month to a 1 year dormant state clause if that hapens your player gets copied to a backup serverif you come back  you pick a new name if your old one is taken and life goes onwhen an account goes dormant the player is forced into an npc corp as wellthere is no way for a corp to know currently if a player is active or notif i didnt pay for 1 year  i would fully expect to lose something and with my above suggestion i do not lose my skill time i have put in the game i just lose my magical name that i seem somehow so attached to a digital character
1 for trial accounts only
its not about whats owed or not owed and its not about revenge for not subscribing longer its about ensuring we dont end up in a shallow name poolthe vast majority of names are held on trial accounts deleting trial accounts is unarguably fair and will release 75 of the names at least the only benefit to deleting paid accounts is that it will release specific names people might wantin exchange it makes the chance of those people resubscribing almost zero think about it if you played for a while decided eve needed growing time and left it for two years came back and discovered that your name had been taken from you would you feel charitable toward the publisherof course not so from that standpoint trial account is all thats neccisaryand its 21 to subscribe for the first time
ccp makes a big deal out of reputation in eve for that reason i dont think past subscribers should lose their names there might be some previouslynotorious names in that last that havent played in years but their names should forever be associated with their charactersof course wiping out characters would wreck things like killboards that rely on being able to look up character names
i feel a strong urge to loudly yell certain angry words at reading thisedit not at you trebor i can tell the messenger from the source why the hell have an ideas and suggestions board and then a dedicated assembly hall board for pushing proposed changes further if you hate them if they just want to assess the relative frustrations of players regarding different areas of the game fix bounties vs fix insurance or the like they could do this a lot easier for both us and themselves this makes no sense
hey i never said i agreed with the philosophy and it is by no means held by everyone in ccp so these discussions have a purpose
can flipping isnt against the rulescan flipping in rookie systems is against the rulesthis prevents operation im bad at the game and need to kill rookies in frigs to feel better about myself
one of the best things that happened to me early on my second day of trial i think on my first toon was getting can flipped then blown up lost virtually nothing due to only being in frig with ass for fittings was taught hisec is not safe and was prompted to immediatly go read up on aggro mechanics so i wouldnt be dumb enough to let something similar happen again far better it happen in belt in the starter system than any time down the line when i was in a barge or exhumer im not trying to pretend like im performing some public service when i go out stealing ore but surely its best to discover these things early
idiot forum ive hit preview and everything i wrote went to waste 1 arenas for newbs pros seen it mentioend a lot 11 you dont lose your ship you just go into 25 hull when the other is declared winner or less we 12 repair costs in the station for the arena re at 60 the usual compared to a low rep npc owned station to get some isk of the market 13 hisec restricted to t1 frigs up to t1 cruisers fights 14 border hisec 05 arenas allow you to fly t2 cruisers 15 lowsec everything goes  subcaps 16 separated again into classes t1fits t2s faction officer  17 the winner gets the winnings the npc corp owning the arena pays a free repair and a  of the bets put on his head 18 people should get lps just like in mission running able to buy certain useful stuff off the market cheaper than the other guys do to the extra hustle 19 tweak it as such it becomes a viable income option for newbs pros comparable to lvl 4  5 mission runners 110 also allow teams of up to 45 with points just like at2 bounty hunting system made like any other mission system 21 every player is divided into classes according to theyre sp value so a 4 mil sp player wont go after a 20 mil onehm 22 when you accept your mission you get a number of 45 bountys around a 510 jump radius with a specification in witch type of ship they are in ex t2 frig gallente so you can pick a t2 frig yourself or a max of a t1 cruiser so the fight is fair for both players and pick a target 23 only the bounty hunter may shoot his target anyone assisting will get insta targeted by concordgateguns we 24 only the target may fight with the hunter anyone assisting will get instapoped in any hiseclowsec guns just like kill rights 1 time but by the npc and a 1 point drop in security just so this is not encouraged at all 25 the bounty hunter gets a target system where the target is the target is not allowed to leave the system dock up to change ship this is argumented in 22 but again the fight is fair  close types of ships 26 also the mission should not last longer than 2030 mins max so it doesnt become a nuisance for the player that has the bounty on his head 27 the player with the bounty on his head has a max of 2 missions assigned to him per day if he wins beats the hunter he gets lp to a criminal syndicate where he can also buy stuff so it is fun for both sides 28 the player with the bounty only loses 20 hm of the bounty on his head if he gets poped and gets added the value of the ship lost by the bounty hunter if he winshope you read it veil rat and hopefully there are some good ideas in therehave a sexy timeoedit also this might also open a path for the burglar career you can steal stuff from certain corps  npc corps mostly and that would make the npc corps add bountys to players and so the bounty hunters would have more targetsand so the burglars will win isklps from stealing from certain corps at the criminal syndicate and also lps for surviving the bounty attacks and so we have a fun cycle of pvp missions extra career options and a new way of making highsec fun and pvp viable  at your own risk of course
couldnt a system similar to the current ihub system be used upgrades or modules can be attached to a hub which upgrades sec by 01 destroying hub modules reduces by 01 the hub itself would go through a reinforcement cycle though instead of being destroyed it would just offline untill repairedrestarted thus resetting sec to the original valuethis could also be used to introduce players to sov concepts and wars in lower sec systems
i know im double posting but dgafusually i wouldnt take anyone from the orphanage seriously but unfortunately as other people may fall into this trap and vile rat is trying to do something to benefit you not specifically fecal stains like you but people in highsec i felt a seriouspost was requiredcontrary to popular belief the csm while primarily nullsec players are not entirely focused on one aspect of the game sure the supercap nerf is most applicable to nullsec i can assure you that the gallente buff is a boon to all and not just the evil overlord super elite puppetmasterssome of the ideas in this thread are actually goodposts and i applaud vile rat in his attempts to reach out and better a sizeable part of the game i am sure that all or at least most of the csm would back any well thought out ideas benefitting low and high sec as it is in their best interest to balance and enhance the game for everyone fun game  more players coming in  more people to play withshoot at
making isk is so painful and boring that everyone in high sec quakes in fear at the tiniest sign of losing it making isk should be fun again losing isk should be funnerpve overhaulcheaper pvp insurance for implants a melting pot low sec pvp arena with ridiculous prizes im talking vcrs and toasters peopleno one wants to play with their expensive toys this needs fixing
dumping security designations like highsec nullsec lowsec and just having a grade system that radiates out from civilization centers sounds great even though the convention is likely to be continued to be used for the sake of convenienceso do patrols rather than too many static unitseve can use quite a few tweaks and twiddles to be sure but the idea of pushingforcingpunishing highseccers into lower sec areas and into higher levels of pvp is just bad business and fights the nature of a species the majority of which wishes to survive and procreate which is why they create governments and military forces and police forces in the first placeand try not to fight warsand build cities that are mostly safe not places for gangs to land helicopters and loot walmart at gunpoint and fly away or dogfight over central park with live ammojust because some of the player base regardless of percentage so completely embraces their inner droog clockwork orange doesnt mean most of ccps potential player base will in fact its highly unlikely they wouldsell the advantages of going to lower sec areas if you want highsec people to go to lownullsec people like advantagesif there arent any you shouldnt expect people to go there humans are practical eve is a game people want to be entertained sell the entertainment in lower security areasif there isnt any you shouldnt expect people to go there humans are practicala lot of this business pretty much amounts to leave new york and come to somalia youll love it hereoh come on guys we all know new york is boringstagnantirrelevantsomalia is where the coolpro kids hang outpeople basically want to change welcome to new york to welcome to somalia and then complain about the poor tourist trade and how few people want to do business there people are basically complaining that the riskreward ratio is worse in somalia than it is in new yorkof course it ishumans as a group do not like the wild wild west humans as a species like to pick their fights as much as possible and to protect their assets not engage in weekly reruns of the epic high seas movie of your choice or worse yet the nullsec version of waterworld carebears run most modern civilizations now and there is no reason to think they wont in the next ten thousand years most humans would much rather be bill gates than vladimir putin thats just how things are try starting from that position and deal with the realities of human thought processes from that perspective it will make game changes much easier to filter through and implement at all security levelsthat said theres a number of good ideas in this thread keep goingheres a cookiemodified from original post enticing removed
this is the only paragraph i really wanted to comment on for one simple reason whats wrong with enticing hiseccers into going into lowsecnullsec theres literally no other way to get people out there they wont move there unless they want to
i will accept responsibility for using the word enticing where i should not have i will edit appropriatelythe fact is who in their right mind would venture out into lownullsec ingame or in a real life equivalent if they were not specifically looking for that lifestyle or there was a risk worth takingdraw them out yes force them out nocreate new reasons to come out rather than simply strangle the current reasons to stay in
literally the only thing i can see offhand that needs to be nerfed in hisec right now is incursions other than that what i think needs to be done is to both make sov incentivize using multiple small fleets to attack multiple solar systems so theres actual strategy in where fleets are deployed and what number instead of just pack 1000 into one system 6 times and move on to the next and increase the rewards dramatically for the individual pilot in lowsec and nullsec it would probably be best if it wasnt even a raw isk reward but just allround qualitative improvements for the individual pilot better research manufacturing refine mining you name it it should just be better and more lucrativenot every rebalance has to be a heavyhanded nerf to hisec colbert
addendumit shouldnt be too hard to get them to pass through lowersec areas more often but ts unlikely you will get them to move to lownullsec in any large numbers because they dont want to live those lifestyles and i dont think there is any way to incentivize highsec players to move there that will not break the spirit and flavor of ccps intent regarding those areaswhy are so many people trying so hard to get highsec people to play a style of game they clearly arent rushing out to play especially when the foundation setup of the eve universe those pesky star nations with their governments and military forces and police forces specifically supports and encourages carebear playwhat is wrong with wanting to build corps based in empire that operate in lownullsec and then run back to highsecthats the smart thing to do yes us sends troops out troops come back home eventually the us isnt going to move to the middle eastits supposed to not be such a great place to live precisely because people want free reign to run around and beat on other people nearly at will there will be less law enforcement more crime and fewer resources to go aroundthats the whole pointmost humans do not like living like that and so they will avoid exposing themselves to it ingame or outccp can have a free for all pvp game with less structure and more pvp if they wantand i suspect fewer subscriptionsjust have a hightech alien race take out the jovians and bomb the eve universe into submission and reboot it or they can draw in a larger more consistent customer base that wants to play their game because the game offers so many opportunities and choices than just nullsec for everyonewe enjoy making you sad and we want to do it as often as possible hahaha if they really can choose to be donald carebear trump or warren carebear buffet rather than muammar former dictator ghadafi some of them may well choose to become the dread pirate buylow sellhigh down the roadthe lownull sec people who are trying to get more players out of highsec into lownullsec need stop talking about what they want and concentrate solely on what the people they are trying to entice to lower sec areas wantyou want their business market to them not yourselves thats how its doneit all still comes down to if people want to move into lower sec areas and live lower sec lifestyles or notif they dont they dont move on its their isk to spend
low sec will always suffer from low population because its too easy to get killedthe tank vs dps balance is way too in favour of dps fights are over before they even get started alot of the timemost good skilled pvp pilots can one shot any industrial or mining barge and frigs are vaporised by the smartbombing bs that sits on most low sec gates this is not fun for anyone really it should take longer to kill your victim and strategy to win the fight should be a major factor in deciding the outcome and not simply lock scram and alpha which is how the current form of pvp seems to bethings i see that ruin the length of a good fight pvp in eve online is like a quick shag down an alleywaypvp in eve online should be more like a full on porn movie both sides enjoy a good bit of foreplay first playing with fiddly bits for a while to get ye all hot n bothered then follows the penetration culminating in the money shoti just wish the fight would actually last longer lol many women would say that about the sex in solo engagements most victims die within two to three volleys thats too quickthe money making opportunities in low sec stink tbhroids are just as crap as high sec missions are pretty much the same has high sec except you have no concord to keep gankers at bay this isk payout is the sameded sites in low sec are not that great eitherto entice more people into low sec why not quadruple the bounties paid out on npc kills for missioners in low secdoing an l4 in low sec would then pay 4x as much as the same l4 in high sec wouldadd abc ores to low sec albeit in smaller quantitiesadd hiden ice belts in low sec that have any type of ice in itreduce the taxes on trading in low sec and allow anyone install jump clones in any low sec system but charge a higher isk cost high sec is 250000isk but needs a standing of 80 with that corp low sec should only require a standing of 40 with the corp but also charge 1mil isk for the cloneincrease the yields when refining ores in low sec by 25 meaning you get 25 more trit if u refine veld in low sec compatred to high secincrease the rate of 610710  810 ded plexes spawning in low sec and for the love of god fix the faction pos  pos mod bpc drop rate make low sec the only source of the faction pos bpcsopen up 04 sec systems for moon miningreaction towers and capital ship production arrays
a lot of folks are saying highsec needs less reward for the low risk it carrieswhy what is the ingame effect people object tohighsec is all about as much lowrisk high reward as is possible and it is designed that way and no amount of constant denial and repeating of highsec should be have a worse riskreward ratio and be less profitable will make that any less truethat doesnt mean changes wont help but there are reasons why wall street usa is wall street and one of them is definitely where wall street is its in highsec and it is run by carebears who usually try for the greatest reward with the least risk and avoid getting into wars unless they can make a profitput together some numbers comparing highsec and nullsec and show justification for wanting to close a riskreward ratio and profitability gap that should already be fairly significant given the two environmentsheck you have more piracy drugs and human slavery than highsecat least you shouldpeople keep talking about higher payoffs for missions in lownullsecwho exactly is going to pay for thati know the deep pockets of highsec companies can pay for theirs and i am not saying payoffs should not be increased for missions what i am asking is what is the logical basis for asking someone to pay you more money which decreases their profit margins without a coherent idea of what extra value you bring to justify the increase in payagain all those resources automagically renew and you can do missions foreverand again you did choose to live there choosing to live above your means is not a good reason to pay you more
nopejpgsorry but i actually play games to you know play them its not cost effective and even just theorycrafting its implementation leads to massive design issues
concept i like itexecution noheres what i would do make a module that allows you to passively target someone while cloaked then the module will cool down for 5 seconds and after that time will automatically decloak you once you activate the module you cannot stop the decloak timer this will allow you to prime your weapons and engage an enemy almost before you decloak the victim then has to react target and depending on what ship your in that could be a while and then engage you enough time for you to get a few volleys off it creates the same effect without any complicated new mechanics its a passive targeting system with a decloak timer on it also as a side note if you use it and your already decloaked it acts like a passive targetertldr add a decloak timer to passive targeters and enable there use while cloakedmmos come and go but eve remains garresh
this would be horribly imbalanced considering the pilgrims lack of gunsedit heres a simpler solution to making recons more effective give them the ability to passively target one ship while cloaked so that upon decloak they can immediately engage that or allow them to use the passive targeter while cloaked forcing them to use up a mid slotedit and then i read the post above mine 
 are you saying people actually fly the pilgrimok i love my pilgrim but it doesnt have much use in a gank n shank black ops hot drop fleetmmos come and go but eve remains garresh
im through with arguing with the op who doesnt seem to understand how eve worksthis is by far a superior proposal to that of op supported
cant support the ops proposal even though i like the concept as it is to complicated and potentially unbalancing but the above idea has merit
going to have to chime in with the greek chorus here and say that while the op left me tepid this is brilliant were not just talking made the best of a bad idea here this i really like as its own thing its simple succinct straightforward and well integrated with existing mechanics can the thread be about this now could possibly expand on it maybe have it work only with cov ops cloaks so it is specifically a buff to stealth ships and not to any random boat packing a cloaking device and possibly a skill advanced cloaking to extend the decloak timer ideas anyone
i am ninja werewolf assassin backstab damage 10d6stun 100seriously bad idea recons are recons no damage get buddy to kill if you cant grind them to death slowly
agreed its not much use in a blops gang but that doesnt mean it shouldnt be equally buffedpassive targeters working while cloaked would make recons really excel at their jobs and i dont think would grossly overpower them
ccp and others have a dream of a independent nullsec but this is impossible or impractical for a number of reasons also want more of a draw to it other then moons with current nerfs to anoms people can make more or the same mission running in empire or incursions to draw more people to nullsec it needs to be self sufficient and have more rewards less empty space more people playing the player driven and owned partsto summarize quickly why nullsec is not independent would be to mention what only is currently produced by it which is a much shorter list then what is not moongoo isk high end minerals and loot from one type of faction including faction and officer mods ice exists in nullsec but it is of one racial type planetary materials and products are richer in nullsecwhat doesnt exist in any one nullsec region is all the above not mentioned a mighty long list of essential stuff to do anything but here are the key ones1 multi racial or faction equipment in any region unless alliances chose to be all one race of the region they live in none do they need equipment for 3 out of the 4 races that dont spawn pirate factions overlap races but each specialize in ways so ideally one would want access to all of them for fitting any pvp or pve gear high metas regardless are desired by people who donUFFFDt have skills for tech 2 certain fittings or saving isk2 34ths of ice ore towers and captials dont run without it you can change towers to whatever is racial in region but even then some are more desired for certain towers for mining industry or deathstar capitals are another matter you train for those in a year or more and some are more desired then others so choosing them based off spawning isotopes is unlikely matar are known for sub par capitals gallente have the covented carrier and super carrier add to that the fact it can be mined in empire in safety for little isk per hour makes people want to do anything but ice mining in null3 low ends that high end rare minerals are more to be hand or actually exist in nullsec leaves low ends the domain of botters and afk people in empire much like ice even if it is present in null that it can be done more safely for low isk per hour in empire makes most residents in null turn nose on it4 anything that cannot be produced by players or player stations ccp made a good decision in releasing planetary interaction to make things more player driven but still no player owned station or region has blueprint originals command centers not imported datacores or skillbooks all of these are required for many important things lacking them draws you to empire while you are their may as well do shopping for all of the aboveto address these here are the following ideas1 any faction can spawn in any nullsec region have the regional faction be represented in all belts and 50 of anominalyscomplexes so overly represented and in high quantity but have the rest be a mix of others2 in addition to the static ice have gravimetric spawns of ice mini ice belt that has limited supply that will be 50 one racial and a mix with the rest the few systems with static ice belts be ten fold more likely to spawn these then systems without them to increase desire to mine ice in more dangerous sec make the quantity of isotopes able to be extracted doubled for null what you can get in empire and 15 for lowsec removing static ice in highsec would have the same effect it as well but that would be a huge game changer i support changing nullsec regardless of decision made on it but i woudnt want other improvements tied to something that is very controversial and can be debated elsewhere 3 have the quality of ore much different in null then empire so have rich null versions spawn double the minerals and plentiful lowsec 15 and have it so the quality of ore chosen for each security are only ones found commonly that way you could also spawn all types of ore in empire and lowsec but morphite so empire can be resource independent from null as well but just be of lower yielding types risk vs reward 4 one option is having player owned stations spawning any npc community being that generation of these is artificial anyway who is to say that little robots or citizens inside player owned stations cannot produce these as well another option for blueprints command centers and skillbooks is have them be random spawns in complexes animomalys or rats that would give more rewards to players ratting without promoting inflation or too much minerals primary domain of mining down side of spawns would take away isk sink and the shear number of blueprints and skillbooks makes setting up a player driven market difficult at best datacores can be acquired solely from complexes that are more common and plentiful in the lower sec you go making researching more of a activity that is better to set up in nullother things to fix1 moons revised regional differences are ok but you canUFFFDt have it too unbalanced ie 90 of tech moons limiting reagent all in the galactic north 2 stations you only get one in null and its really bad compared with others found anywhere else considering you canUFFFDt get multiple in same system it should be upgradeable to do what ten empire stations can do all in one without upgrades being of the same quality still as one or more empire station in production refining researching and or office space3 anything elseby making each nullsec region able to be able to be self sufficient people will chose to be as much as they want
i was a carebear for two years before moving to null and i can honestly say that the ganks griefer wardecs and scams i either saw or was victim of were 95 perpetrated by hisec residents upon their fellow hisec residents the honest truth is at the time i welcomed these distractions from the monotony of the isk grind without them hisec would have been so boring after the first few months id have left the game now that i live in null the only time i visit hisec is when i jump into my 5 clone because im off line for a few days apart from logistics considerations hisec is of no interest to most of us in null we left that stagnant pond behind a long time ago and are better for it you hisec residents love to blame null for your woes but the truth is your doing it to yourselves most of the time and we are just a convenient way of avoiding admitting it
1 for obviously not reading my post not once did i blame null for my woes 1 for being yet another kneejerk highsec means nothing to nullsecits a stagnant pondits all highsecs fault anyway parrot if that were all true then nullseccers wouldn
highsec needs less reward for the low risk it carries other than that leave it be

taking some of this with me and dropping this second thread as wellgo to
when you wish to add names to your address bookwatchlist you need to right click and add contact for each person you wish to add this gets tiresome when you wish to add a lot of people in one go eg during a war deci propose there should be an easier way to add names in bulk like cntlclick on names to select multiple names or that you can setup a corporate level watch so that the members of your corporation has access to a watch list without each member having to create their own
so you can set up bulk supercapwardec target watchlists no the point of the watchlist is so you can see when people you want to talk to come online its not supposed to be an intel tool for seeing when people you want to run fromkill come online not supported at all
youre underutilizing a very nice tool to have friend
we do it now this just makes it so that 200 people dont have to perform the same actionsas with bookmarks its silly that these things cant be transmitted
jeez just when i thought id come up with an orginal idea google says someone beat me too it  i dont think this idea was really considered it have some great benefits if done rightincreased consumption with which to drive the economysuper capitals become assets that require an organized multi personcorpalliance effort to maintaincould lead to a slow down or decrease in super capital production as some of the raw materials needed to build new ones now get diverted to imaintainingi existing onesim sure there are others but it all hinges on its its done rightit should take big quantities of fuelparts to keep the things serviceable it should be hard for a single player even with mutiple accounts to maintain a super as is now most of my corp havent individually owned super capitals im not fond of real life comparisons but modern navies dont just buy aircraft carriers and then say hey thats it we just need to buy some fuel or replace an fa18 every now and again lol part oft he problem is that supers are one man shows that anyone with access to sanctums and 4560 days for free time can rat up their should be some kind of maintenance cost even if just an isk on like sov costs i do think pos fuels is the best idea else the super would fall into disrepair and be unusable or degrade in some waybut the other side of the coin is that super should be powerful enough for people or alliances to want to go through the pain of building owning and maintaining them ideally null sec would have fewer super caps but people would actually use them making for interesting times in space with the currently planned nerf the most likely outcome is that people will simply use them less because they are a massive investment that is not more vulnerable in a perfect world this would not be the case i stopped training for an aeon for this reason
because fw should be in lowsec for the most part highsec fw doesnt even sound good it will be the same except pirates cant bug youmake fw worth doing then people will join it and go to lowsec to pvp
if you remove the fw navy npcs you make essentially all space equal there is no longer enemy or friendly space there is only spacewe can already dock at the enemy militias stations which is ridiculous by itself boring
no need to change orcas tractor bonus with new t2 tractor beams coming in the range on an orca will be about 100km that is more than enough
i shrug capital tractor beams seem as though theyd be more appropriate to the orca and the orca pilots ive talked to about that agreethat said at present and as a practical note unless the rorqual is changed so as to make it viable in belts the capital tractor beam has no reason to exist if the orca could use them effectively which is to say presuming the final numbers work out such that the capital tractor beams would be more effective for an orca then regular smallship tractor beams then theyd be used and valuable if neither of these occurs then theyll remain a white elephant
interesting subject seems like there is no 100 right position beyond ccp should appreciate 100 of its subscribers solo or multiplayer
off topic posts removed
how the  was my post off topic you
ccp are a bigger joke than they was before anyone that thinks the people behaving like this are going to change is 
welp its gone to outright censorship of anyone speaking out wtf all i got consored for was suggesting all these threads should be compiled in the same place so we can keep trackguess ccp doesnt want all the lies used to cover it and the reason those are bad excuses in the same placeofc this is the same company still maintaining a vendetta after all these years so guess we shouldnt be surprised silly vikingsedit btw having a post deleted doesnt cause you to lose all the likes you got on that post
as the op for this thread i was perfectly fine with having those deleted posts in this thread doesnt it seem a little silly to be deleting posts in a thread about censorshiphow about this someone from ccp lists the qualifications to become uncensored and work with kugu to meet them despite what you may think of kugu the person the site has a life of its own that is seperate and has no agenda driven by himstop censoring kugutesumenutilize the community there as an enhancement to your gameshow that you are not the complete incompetents at comminity management you were in the past the guys you firedprofit
this is all it would take but itll never happen
they key point here is that someone or bodies at ccp are still sore enough over t20 to misdirect and shutdown attempts to address the censorship of kcomin short youre worse than my grandmother let it the  go and grow up
what part of my post was offtopic tinfoilsince its bleeped out i cant even remember what i wrote but it was probably something about how malware accusations and the idea that my eve account is gonna be haxx0red as a result of logging in is laughably falsestill at least the thread isnt locked now hows about ccp tell us what you need on our end to get kugu uncensored and we hash out the details mkay
wheres the rest of the thread did ccp really just delete a bunch of posts
so let me get this straightyou left the posts by your supporter rinm that are quite literally not about what is going on in this thread and instead about what went on in the last thread and where some of its participants are intactbut you removed the rebuttalsyou sir are a liar and a cad
in other news i shall preserve at least one post that proves the censorship is in fact negotiable because ccp was willing to negotiate phantom if he cant take a joke at ccps expensefrom xutechs lips to the ears of anyone in iceland who isnt suffering rectocrainal inversion
how nazl of you
my post regarding ccps attempts to advertise on our site while not offering any sort of incentive other than a magazine subscription was wandering at times especially the parts regarding the pitiful lives of xutech and vinata bromates but was completely on topic
i hear censoring a thread thats about unjustified censorship is a good idea ccps motto if it isnt broken break it if it is broken ignore it improving npe  dynamic new eden
now if this really bothers hilmar or somebody that much about making peace with what is apparently the largest eve fansite still standing i suggest they retreat to the bunker of fearless stick their fingers in their ears and hum real loud while someone mature enough to handle the task takes overinstead of standing in the open with their fingers in their ears humming real loud while the world watches them do it
so exactly how was asking how my accounts are at risk from my kugu lurking off topic id still like to know got any proof has anyone on this forum ever had their account hacked because of kugu
yeah seriously ccp devs had enough interest to delete posts that hurt their feelings but not enough givea to clarify accusations made by their security expert on potential threats to a large number of their customersstop gestapoing up this thread and give us some answers
because big brother ccp says so thats all the words you need now go sub more accounts so i can buy that new three wheel motorcycle thing hilmarfree kugutsumen
not empty quotin
so if kugu can hack my account without even knowing an account name possibly not even a character name then somebody at ccp has seriously  up and i think we deserve to know about itor darius is lyingpick one
essentially one of ccps idiot madmins dug himself a hole but rather than own up to it and laugh it off they censor everything to cover it upnot sure how you guys do things in iceland but the rest of the free world kinda looks down on that sort of thingseriously admit you made a mistake admit you have made mistakes for a long time now hilmar already said as much when he did his post about how they were killing eve and look at all the great changes that will be coming out in the next patch keep up this winning streak of bringing back the respect of the community and showing you are committed to improving all aspects of eve especially the community aspect which is in my opinion the greatest asset eve has
i gave you a chance to fix your petty asshattery ccp you blew it specificallyscreegs blew it by being suddenly butthurt over something he played a  part in when it happenednavigator blew it by trying to play heavyhanded internet cop on the last thread good job ya sod  the kcom crowd off even morephantom blew it by selectively deleting posts that he claims were off topic you do realize we are keeping score of your actions rightits clear to me now ccp will not change  the letter from hilmar  the winter expansion its tripe without a responsive community instead we have a group of nimrods who are still butthurt one of their own got caught cheating four years agoafter all the bumbling inept things you have done this year ex incarna nex store fearless after losing so many subscribers youd think these people could at least try not to insert their own foot when they open their mouths but apparently they are too good at it to stop themselves but as you love to say every action has its consequences so now comes the harvest of the seeds you have plantedyour butthurt fueled childlike vendetta has cost you 4 subscriptions today ccp some will laugh and some will troll my decision but i for one will not pay perfectly good money on your smoke and mirrors doublestandard bullshit anymoreso later on people im going to go find what i was paying ccp to get cause i sure as  am not getting it here
this censorship bullshit has gone too far now admit to your mistakes or dont bother respondingi bet youll take the latter
off topic posts removed please stay on topic thank you
not supportedapart from making hisec duller than it already is hard to believe this proposal would heavily impact the market at the least reducing if not destroying the income of many traders and manufacturers and the incomes of miners who rely upon them
if highsec became a no pvp zone then all the gankers and pirates would have to gasp go to lowsec and nullsec gasp alasthat would also mean they would need some kind of skill for pvp so ultimately it would not work
more money and no reason to ever spend it wonderful
remove insurance payouts for people who get concorded and for people who selfdestruct id be fine with thatif you want your hulk to be tougher put a tank on it youll give up performance but thats what happens if you want a tough ship its slower and carries less idiots who think that their miner should be supertanked so they cant be ganked dont understand that theres a reason reallife industrial hardware isnt armored
youre cute
i try
this idea is betterexcept the buff concord bit concord is fine as it is
also buffing industrials and barges is a bad idea
anything that removes ice from high sec as it is wil have a devastating effect on the economy you take it away from where the people live that are willing to harvest it and youll find theyll simply harvest something else rather than go where they simply dont want to be its really that simple drastic supply reductions in ice fuels will crush everything from research to inventions to t3 production high sec and wormhole poss would be brutalized people would leave simple as thatit may turn out good for a few but it would be bad for eve real bad
butbutbutif we dont remove ice from highsec and give it to nullsec how will the people in nullsec possibly make any isk at allthink of the childrensarcasm

ccp stop boost matarthey already have most agile and and speedy shipslets give em the best close ammono penalty reduction to hail or make same bonuses to all t2 close ammo
cry more
ccp stop this matar herecy or boost holy lasorsps blaster falloff too
did you even look at it after the changes after the changes its pretty much even with rf fusion no crying needed
you just got trolled
if its still worse than rf fusion for what hell they make this boost  hail vs rf fusion explosive damage 484 hp vs 46 kinetic damage 132 hp vs 92at all 11 more dmg with penalty only 30 for trackingyou know how big matari falloff isvoid vs cn antimattierkinetic damage 308 hp vs 322thermal damage 308 hp vs 23same 11 more dmg but penalty 25 for track 50 to fallofwe know that both optimal and falloff are critical for blastersi suppose that 25 to optimal and 25 to fallof would be fair for void ammo
supported hail isnt the close range t2 ammo that needs boost with the ac engagement range especially after boost the tracking penalty is effectively nonexistent unlike with blasters this leaves a flat dmg boost over faction ammo
im shouting because everyone else is
whiny  shuttup and stop littering the hall
i personally would like to see more buffs to things rather than nerf everything to helleven without the penalties hail isnt that over poweredthink void definitely needs looked at
void needs to lose the cap usage penaltyi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
this is an attempt to conciliate the demands of players who dont want to be forced into a style of play they dont enjoy pvp and the sandbox principle on the one hand we have players who dont want to be forced to pvp when all they want is either pve mine etc within the boundaries of high security space without having to live in fear of being ganked on the other hand we have players who want to be able to shoot and kill anything they see anywhere it goes players who believe that the one thing that makes the game what it is is precisely that there is nowhere in the whole of eve space that is 100 safei suggest that it is possible to devise a set of game mechanics that accommodate both in short05 to 07 keep systems with security rating of 05 to 07 as they are now that is systems where nonconsensual pvp is possible although it will provoke the intervention of concord or better the navy of the faction who controls the system 08 to 10 consensual pvp only for systems with security rating 08 or above dynamic player regulated security rating system introduce a set of mechanics to allow players to affect the security rating of a system through their actions it should be possible to affect the rating of the system through nonpvp methods as well as pvp and pve ones a good starting point would be current factional warfare mechanics that allow for a hybrid of pvp and pve but it should also be possible to affect it by nonpvpe means for instance these are some ideas about ways in which the security rating of a system could be increased other than doing pvppve players could donate isk to the UFFFDwar chestUFFFD of the navy that controls the system be it caldari gallente amarr or minmatar donating goods like ships hulls modules ammunition might be a better way to do this though build and deploy infrastructure in space for the faction this could be done by requesting a mission through a special agent who gives you the coordinates to a dead space pocket where players can deploy and anchor special type of sensors that will help the navy keep the system safe for instance when the mission is finished the pocket disappears and the server can redeploy it at a later stage if necessary another method to increase the security status of a system could be by contagion that is increasing the security rating of adjacent systems the principle of a selfregulated sandbox in which players govern their interactions would be respected but at the same time it would give those who want to avoid pvp a set of game mechanics that they can use to earn the privilege of a safe heaven where nonconsensual pvp is not allowed
no having anytype of safe system non consensual pvp just makes eve wow in space hell to the no
how exactly are they being forced again no one forced them to pay down load the game consent to the rules or log in are we supposed to accommodate for these sheeple because it makes them feel bad and why are we punishing the peeps that understand the game for what it is and has to cater to someone that do not want to play by the same rules and mechanics
hi i dont like to be forced to pay the prices market pvp players set for the ships modules and charges i need to play eve with i believe that buying things from other players should be a choice not forced upon meso everything in game should be available from npcs at 100 isk so i am not griefed by greedy market gankers
what the hell is wrong with people these daysyou knew what eve was when you downloaded it you knew what it was when you undocked and you sure as hell knew what it was when you fired on that red flashy in the belt that popped your shiney bargethere is no nonconsensual pvp in eve except suicide gankers but thats something else you choose to shoot at people or you dont dont shoot and you will never know about the bad people flying aroundeve is fine the way it is dont like it then why the hell play itdefinite no from me on this proposal in fact any proposal that protects people from eve game mechanics will get a resounding no from me
i dont like pvp and im a bit of a care bear but would have to say no its the danger of this harsh universe that keeps it funi dont mind the idea of a grace period for noobs but that would take a lot of work to stop the throw away alts being used for griefing
not this again please nothere will never be arenas highsec will never be 100 safe nonconsensual pvp will always exist in eve and the bad guys will get you if you have something they want instead of begging ccp to turn over eight years of game design why dont you ask for help on how to avoid losingedit let me spell out what banning nonconsensual pvp means two alliances go to war over a territorial dispute one alliance knows a number of the highsec mining alts operated by the other but now with these proposed rules those neutral alts are perfectly safe in spite of the fact that their every action contributes to an alliance that is at war they can mine indefinitely with zero risk even though they work for the enemyif you make a safe zone all the industrial and research alts would never leave that zone because they would be perfectly safe therein other words no
what i want contrary to what most of you are reading is not that they actually go and encroach the right to avoid pvp but that whenif they allow for that right to exist that they do it in a way that leaves it open for other players to challenge and contest it what is more i even claim the right to challenge the existence of any security status at all since a system of contesting security ratings would leave empire open to be downgraded to 00 if players allow itfight for itit may happen that ccp desperate to stop losing subscriptions and eager to attract new players makes the stupid mistake of messing with the sandbox by introducing a form of regulated pvp in empire so that people who want to avoid pvp entirely can do it with none having the ability to challenge them that would be the end of the sandboxinstead of having ccp come up with some immutable hardcoded way of UFFFDbeingsafeUFFFD i would rather have a system that leaves it up to players to determine with their ingame actions whether there are safe heavens in the first place and i think that empire is at the moment a safe heaven if we dont want for there to be anywhere in eve where a player cannot be ganked or even have the protection of concord at all then we just have to keep the security rating of all systems below 08 05 or plain 00 we the playerswith so many of us agreeing about not wanting safe heavens my suggestion would surely amount to as much as not having safeheavens at all perhaps even making all of eve 00 with the difference that neither the right to shoot anyone anywhere nor the right to not be shot in certain places would be ccp sponsored but player regulated
whelp neuts in local time to play battlefield 3but seriously though the one problem i have with afk cloaking on a philosophical level is that it makes you 100 safe just warp to something at 100 and cloak up or make an off grid safe and cloakthe one thing i really like about eve is that no matter what you are doing you are never really safe it doesnt matter if you are mining in highsec you can still get shotbut in eve there are two instances where you are totally invulnerable when you are docked in a station and when you are in a safe spot cloakednow ideally when incarna comes out real walking in stations incarna not playing dress up in your studio apartment incarna youll be able to kick in their captains quarters door and shoot someone in the face so maybe the docked up hostiles thing will be something we can get to later onbut in the meantime it baffles me that someone can fly into the most unsafe space in the game nullsec into a system full of people that want to shoot them on sight and just turn on a module on their ship that allows them to go afk for hours on end completely 100 safe id give cloaked ships the tiniest signature so that youd need an actual probing ship or faction probes to find them and even then itll take 10 minutes or so just long enough that if the cloaked person is moving around and actively putting effort into not being found theyll be more or less okif this was one of those pansy orcs and elves mmos if someone was hiding in a pvp zone afk you could just search the bushes until you found where they were hiding and beat them to deathseriously guys i dont want eve to be a game where you can be safer in pvp in a cloaked ship than some poofter rogue hiding in world of warcrafti honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
for one the recent addition of a 100mh isk faucet called incursionswhy should hisec be lower risk and higher reward than lowsec or nullsec what sort of incentives should anyone have for leavingif i could stand the gibberish language the incursions inflict upon everyone entering an incursioned system i could be making 100mhour or if i do what i normally do ie market fuckery i could earn as much as a supercarrier in a day or a week if im lucky in fact i just didnow tell me why i should leave that if im not in the game for the shooty style of pvp
and another thingi dont think anyone is locked out of incursions and i think we all get paid the same but maybe i missed somethingi believe its not the npcs that are more dangerous its the human gankersbasically people are asking for ganker welfare i chose to live in a place that by its very nature will be much more dangerous and much less profitable than other places i could have chosen to live and i want someone else to make up the shortfall for my poor judgement sam kinnison might have saidwe wouldnt have to worry about nullsec profit if you would just move where the isk is this is  nullsec nothing grows out here nothings going to grow out here you dont need food you need indy ships and luggage so you can move where the isk ison the other hand if the isk in nullsec is okay then people should quit worrying about the understandably higher profit margins of an area they chose not to live in and move onhere read this again it hasnt changedwhat on earth makes people think that overall nullsec would ever have a lower riskreward ratio than highsecthe reason for the existence of nullsec is to have an area with a more hardscrabble existence and a much greater risk than one finds in highsec on the one hand but the possibility of building your very own empire on the other you arent entitled to greater return because you assume greater risk you are entitled to greater risk that is all no one in their right mind would ever go to nullsec unless they wanted to live the lifestyle you chose and are now complaining aboutif nullsec were anything like real life lots of people would move out of nullsec and into lowsec and leave the nullsecs alone to get bored punching themselves in the face until the nullsecs got bored and moved towards nullsec of course that would mean lowsec would be stretched that much further and so the dominoes fall on the other hand it could give people a chance to create larger task forces in less time that they could use to raid nullsecgiven the current atmosphere in nullsec do you really think you will entice that many on the fence players into nullsec with anything less than absurdly inflated game breaking payouts that is almost certainly exactly what they will want to put up with the gankingyou are already asking for the same thing yourself you are basically asking for extra 5day because you chose to live next door to the bully who steals your lunch money but even though you can move away any time you want to you dont
well i always like to see more playerplayer interaction in the world of eve and i like the industrial part of the game so i have the following ideas that could also work in lowsec and 00 i will only writhe down the basics of the ideas1 real estateatm every empire station has a mixed slotlayout with a static number of mepe and copy research slots and manufactory slotswhat if players could buy half of them and change them based on deployable equipment only half of them to prevent the players from abusing the systemfor example you buy a pescince slot at jita 44 and a caldari frigatte manufactory equipment now you could change this slot into an manufactory slot that gives build time boni to caldari frigsto maintain them you have to pay a monthly land tax maybe they could need materials to run like posfuel and maybe they generate a mission from time to time that they are brocken and need some pi mats or so to get repaired during this time all jops are paused if the mission fails after 24 weeks the npcs buy back the slot cause of the player violating the contract or something repairs it and relists them for sale so you dont have slots sitting at inactive peoplein lowsec00  forbidden manufactory equipment could be used that gives better boni to production times no me improvments to prevent hat they become mandatory for everybody to be able to compete like production efficency to 5 nowadays something like the sansha cruiser manufactory unit that gives pe boni to caldari amarr and sansha cruisersin sov 00 the land tax will be given to the owner of the outpostto prevent that every slot is sold the first day i would like to see that only slots in former incursion constelations are bing sold publicy via auction this will also have a nice rp in the sense that npc corps leave cause of missing workers or sothe same can be done for offices but maybe as part of future wis developmentsto prevent that people go crazy over searching the right slots there should be some new buttons in the production ui like find fastest slot find cheapest slot and find next available slot the last one would be nice anyway2minionsin short they are like shipcrews but for industriewe already have npc scientists  technicans and others as tradegoods let us use them as our teams that do our scince and industrie jobsthey will modify production time of items or research time of me researchwe have the standart type that can do everything and gives a bonus of maybe 25 then we have race specific teams that give 510 to every job with there race objects and then we could have special teams for specific areas frigatt construction hybrid weapons and so on that give a 1020 bonithey will cost monthly wages if they work or not so managing them is crucialanother idea would be superminions special npc teams that give maybe 20 in two workfields or maybe 30 but cost more wages and can only be found in space loot or maybe traded for lp in the shopsthe other minions could be bought and sold directly from npcs maybe created from basic civilian npcs at a pos recruitment camp or maybe later in colonies on planets3licensesatm we have a small item in the lp stores called empire starbase charters that allow us to run a pos in highsecwhat if your corp could buy a license to online complex reactors in 04 systems or higher moonharvesters in highsec maybe or a pos in a 09 system those will have a monthly cost associatedmaybe you could buy a license to build an outpost in highsec4corpstandingatm corpstanding from your corp towards npc corps is calculated as the average of every member of your corp who has standing towards them practically this means if you bring a new player to work for a corporation your corpstanding towards them will drop until the new player is near the old average valuei would like to see that corps behave like players here and get a static amount of standing every time a corpmember finishs a mission or so to prevent that massive corps of 100 or more players gain standings to fast the formula should look like thatcorporate standing gain  basic gain value of this mission corporate member count2with this the one man corpcreator with standing for empire pos is stil a valid job but now they have to do something other than a storyline mission and waiting 14 daysto make the transition less painfull the actuall average value will become the new static value5corporate missionsjust big missions for whole corps fighting and industrial6viceroysits an old idea in eve many things have been written down already so i will make it shortcorporationsplayers that can gain a position in a npc empire and manage lowsec or maybe 05 to 07 starsystems with changing basic tax values market fees broker tax pi exportimport giving away licenses calling npc corps so that they maybe place agents in the system upgrading the gateguns and so on
a nice thread so i wanted to drop some suggestionsmanufacturingthe mechanics are a little boring at the moment and theres no real way for someone to set themselves apart from someone elsei propose that we change how factory and laboratory slots in stations work specifically that players must have a minimum reputation to use slots eg using a factory in a 10 system takes a very high standing this gives empire corporations the goal of focusing in certain areas where they have facilities available players would also be able to use slots of their corporation such as npc corpsthis would benefit new players who would find factories available for them suddenly and encourage more players to consider pos which is another mostly fun mechanic to become involved in
iv posted something about this before as far as high sec goes i would like to see some changes made to the bounty system and kill rights my idea is rather then lock the kill rights to the played that was shot down instead make them either claimable when its over for a time frame time frame tbd or they can put them up for sale either by a market sections or another pilot who has chosen to trade in kill rights i personally like the idea of something like the real world bondsman but with an eve twist for a career this pilot could either track them down for the bounty and loot or sell the rights to players who want to fight for a price of course or possibly the trader pilot could destroy the kill right contract for a certain isk amount from the pilots whos name is on the kill contract having kill rights be tradable to those that want to fight in high sec wil spice things up it will also give the people that cry its unfair something to chew on i myself like the idea of not knowing who is after me for a legal reason in high secjust some thoughtstre
off topic and spam posts removed please stay on topicthank you for all the constructive and interesting ideas so far
why not make ships modules etc show who made it id feel a touch of pride if i flew a ship or used a module which said made in bat country by lord zim
wasnt this the original idea behind t3 ships before they became another solo gank platform people would be able to tweak stats slightly like a remap find a good set of tweaks and people would go out of their way to track down a yeep pattern brutix
i dont know about that i meant more like an actual property attached to the hull or module which you could see when looking at the description attributes or somesuch
first thing comes into my mind is mining though i am no longer mining i started out with it and there would be alot of opportunities to make it more interestingi am a noob on rl minerals but i never have seen rocks which contain only one type of ore 1 use rocks which contain more then one type of ore be it in a layered fashion where on the outside there is veldspar then scordite plag pyrox omber etc you can do this all the way down to arkonor cause the amount would be very small like 10 units per roid or even belt 2 those roids would be much bigger in order to work3 when you break through the first layer you would get a warning that you are changing to a different type of ore and if you would want to recalibrate your lasers to it if you dont you get only like 510 of the ore out of it as a sideproduct4 depending on how good your skills are the better the amounts are youre getting out of a layer5 in 1009 you get only 2 layers in 0807 you get all the current high sec ore but in less amounts 0605 you get all the ores from the empire but in lesser amounts one more thing in 7 nothing which is worth much but which makes the whole belt more colorfull6 rats in belts are escalating up to like 2 cruisers and 1 bs in high sec when you dont kill the rats after 10 minutes they get help from 1 cruiser then after 20 minutes a 2nd cruiser after 30 minutes the 2 cruisers and 3 frigs get one bs more no more afking mining 7 make less static belts but more belts from missions say a mission gets random ore when the mission is completed the belt in there can be scanned down easily so should be blued wrecks those mission belts should work like the current highlownull sec ore distribution so a mission belt from a lvl 4 mission in 05 could contain even a small amount of arkonor as i have said not much  say like 520 units but this belt would be as colorful as it could get containing all possible ores in smaller amounts8 not recalibrating resulting in mining ore in a new worse quality like instead of dense veldspar it would be rusty veldspar which would have 90 value of normal veldspar main idea is to utilize the mining skills better make it more colorful more engaging more rats heavier rats called to action for recalibrating mining lasers on the whole the value of a belt  belts in a system could stay around as they are just with more items coming from mining into securityi admit it i dont like ganking much but only for the reason that it is cheap fun the game mechanic itself is totally ok to me but one should pay an adequate price for it i dont mean insurances that is to less of an adquate price i say its the effort behind it which makes it truly adequatesay a beginner miner who does play like 5 hrs a week needs 2 month to pay for a hulk the time effort behind it should be mirrored for the ganker let the security drop below 10 and let this status be fatal 6 examples1 ganking a t1 frig cost you the usual security drop for a 5 sec status player more say a frig is 1 with victim at 5 sec it cost you 52 ganking a retriever its 2  with 5 sec status it would be 103 ganking a hulk its base of 2 as it is tech 2 it will be doubled so 4 as it is tier 3 its 7 total at 5 sec status from the victim it be 35 sec status total4 ganking an orca its a captial industrial its base is 20 at 5 sec it would be 100 standing loss 5 ganking a freighter same as the orca6 ganking a bs would be 5  tech2 or faction would be 15 at 5 this would result in either 25 or 75 sec standing lossnow the idea behind is that for a heavy gank like for a freighter you get the maximum standing loss and you need alot of time to get the standing back in order that you cant avoid the sec drop results all capsules with less then 10 standing would be shot as well from concord no waiting orca in high sec to drop ganking ships for those sec standings ganking is ok but not the laughable small time to recover from the sec drop if you do a big robbery in rl you cant expect to be back in the laws good books after 2 weeks cant youfor a freighter gank you will have to live for average 2 month in low sec where gate guns dont shoot anymore positive side effect  low sec would get more populated salvager careermake blue wrecks be scannable very easy like on the first scan run at 32 aualso when a mission is turned it and the wrecks arent made blue  make them blue after 1 hr people might still want to salvage them after turning it in scanning careerone starts with static 110 plexes maybe then wants to get into scanning but those static plexes are camped all day therefore no further key drop until a player has left the final pocket no respawn in there rat escalation 5 minutes after the final item was taken or destroyed other then that make more and different scanning sites find industrial sites where you maybe find some t2 components like 50 nanotransistors or 500 crystalline carbonide find small gas clouds same as mining  not too much value maybe like a small belt thats it for now i know especially the sec standing idea will cause outrage among the pirate but hey its only fair that one has the same effort as the opposite player
a simple pollhighseccers who are on the fence about relocating to lowsec and nullsec what factor or factors are keeping you out of lowsec or nullsecthe primary reasons seem to lie somewhere between pvp ganking and profits thereforeplease answergankingorprofits or both in the case of both please state which is more importantor other please include that reason or reasonsor any other combination that gets your message acrossex both profits are more importanttrolling will be ignored and logging on with alts to skew numbers will serve no purpose
numbers will be tallied here
there are a couple reasons i dont spend more time in lownull the primary one is that i like to be able to afk for a while to run around and do stuff irl without worrying about my ship ive spent a while in whs but i always get bored because theres nothing i can do semiafk other than just floating in my bubble and i havent moved out to sov 00 again i tried it for a while because your options are either to join a massive alliance become a renter or get kicked out when your neighbors get bored
your original suggestion is a false dichotomy any attempt to measure responses along that scale is doomed to fail since the scale itself is flawed here are some other reasons for not taking the first train out to null sec lack of autonomy having to deal with obnoxious mouth breathers who think that eve is about choices between x or y time demands of living in nullsec to an industrialist a nullsec experience that makes sense is having a bunch of military types defending the realm while the industrialist busily constructs the infrastructure and war machines required for that defence to an industrialist getting in a spaceship and shooting stuff is the least constructive use of their timeto a nullsec warlord a nullsec experience that makes sense is having a vast supply of war machines magiked out of the ether with which their minions can go forth and brutally slay the minion of the other null sec warlord industry is only an afterthought a thorn in their side so to speak
i think the real game is in lowsec and that is what ccp needs to concentrate on for the foreseeable future as that is where the pve and pvp populations meet you want to entice people entice highsec and nullsec into lowsec make that arena fun for all groupsmore carebears will fight and droogs will still be allowed to run somewhat amok fewer people will stay in highsec and the trickle down to nullsec will happen on its owneverybody wins something high low and null concentrate on giving to the player base you want to get and maintain and making the game fun at all levels for everyone from highsec to nullsec but make logical changes not just react to the same tired conversation where people want to take things from one group to give to another based on the much abused premises of balance and fairness especially in a game that prides itself in a certain level of reality ex stop trying to make excuses for taking money out of the pockets of highseccers when it is really just a punishment tax for choosing their lifestyle or putting money in the pockets of nullseccers as a reward for choosing theirsi am not saying dont make adjustments just dont make them on selfserving emotional premises and dont make them based on the wishes of droogs who have an agenda that includes making other peoples play time maliciously and deliberately not funwhile they both need tweaking overall highsec can mostly fend for itself and nullsec is 100 a lifestyle choicemake lowsec the las vegas of evesimple question for anyone on the fence about taking the plunge into less safe waterswould you prefer pirates of the caribbean in space lowsecorwould you prefer  a clockwork orange in space nullsecedit added high low and null to make everybody more granular for anyone who may misunderstand the implications of everybody as the first person to reply to this post likely would have had he taken the time to actually read it in the first place
stopped right thereobviously another give everything to what i do since thats all that matters thread if you want to make a suggestion or two on how to improve lowsec then finebut dont expect anybody to be on board with ccp diverting all attention to any specific region or section of eve
editedbeing this response was based on not reading my post in the first place it merits zero considerationnot wasting much space on it
you can make people go to lulzsec by making it into something other than lulzsec1 make it safer than highsec  sov null tucked deep within the blue ass of large alliances where you dont see hostiles for months on end2 make it into highsec  every grey apoc around the corner can possibly gank you but only if youre carrying something worthwhile
lowsec will never be anything because of yarrtards why kill that rifter because there is no penalty but now that person will never want to go back to lolseclets say a mission corp moved to lolsecthe local pirates let them be  gaspa month later that mission corp puts all its loot in a freighter and decides to take it to jitathis is when the pirates strike not vs the drake but the freighter with loottoo bad this wont happen because yarrtards have to kill every shuttle that flys by
i would have liked to see some kind of suggestion for improvement rather than just ordering ccp to make it better i think a major issue facing the lack of interest in losec is twofaced the benefit of operating in low security space is access to more valuable resources such as some rare ores and moon harvesting this is a similar model to wormhole space and null security space risks are higher but the rewards are theoretically justifiable to the loss incurred in combat against strong npc opponents and pvp the problem with this model is that while sleepers and loot from wormhole space are significantly improved over nullsec or hisec the added resource value of moving into losec from hisec is negligible when compared to the risks faced with doing so the risks are basically no greater than joining an alliance or corp in null sec and operating there if losec is going to see an increase in usage something needs to make it worth while to spending time there i think removing ice from hisec will be a good way to increase pilots utilizing low security space perhaps there are other incentives
yes lets post about the way certain faggots like to play the game and of course do not  with the way i play mine
to join the general how i like to play i would like to be able to rent a system from the factions pop in a station drop a few poss on the moons stick some custom houses on the planets and do my care bear thingfor the rent id like some faction police about with options for pirates and thats pvp players to evade them but make it hard and allow me to build up the gate defences also would need minimum faction standing of say sec status 5 to rentmaybe even increase sec status if numbers grow and peace becomes the norm in a system but that needs space to grow with new systems in null as well not to happen in faction war areas though where while that needs work should be for the militias to fight it outyes ill need to run the gauntlet moving my goods yes i wont be as safe as hi sec yes at first ill be raising a big kick me sign for all local roaming gangs but so what it would be fun and give me a path to null
no they meet each other in high sec and they trade there eve is not about how you want to play it the majority of the players lives in highsec so if ccp wants to cater for its clients then they should not focus on lowsec
can a suggestion be given to ccp what exactly to doyou want to draw more people in lowsec what you propose ccp do to do thatthe argument why it would be important is here and along with what may happen but no inbetween on how it will happen
what i dont understand apart from this is very uneve like is that why it has to be matar only come on everybody can fiqure it out that it is only good for the rapier with its arties even if something like would make it into eve  it should be balanced across all races
wordswith a skill like a very powerful sniper shot youll just have 10 people in recons one shotting battleships i think ccp is trying to go away from that direction and get skill involved in playing
alright lets shoot in the dark herenew skill the prerequistes are chosen becuase thay make sense and that they also are some of the prerequisites for the recon skill and covert ops cloaking devicei feel that 5 seconds is more than enough time to do what you need to do i think the decloak timer starts when you begin targeting the ship rather than after the target is confirmed locked so that this isnt overly abused to gank frigates and so that smart pilots can still excape with some quick thinkingmmos come and go but eve remains garresh
wellno because the skill itself would forbid it cannot shoot a target thats has been shot at recently or is being shot at so of those 10 people only 1 would get the shot in
in reguards to the original post i will say that there are way to many changes and rules simplistic solutions are the best kindtruth of the matter is that high damage low hp ships exhist in eve in the form of stealth bombers and the upcoming tier 3 bcs the role is already filled and there is no need for something as complicated as you original post to let recons do what bombers do already if you dont believe me look at all the havoc a single bomb can wreck on a gate camprecons are amazing ships and there capabilities are really amazing as it stands already they are primarily an ewar electronic warfare ship class and they need to stay in that role to avoid being overpowered adding this type of ability and making it recon only really is a good way to alienate most of your potential supportersi have outlined a good solution and tried to make it as simple as possible while still trying to achieve the result you desire this ability as it stands even the way that i have presented it would make lowsec recons only there is no need for excessive damage output from a highly effective ewar platformif you need dps bring bombers if you need ewar bring recons if you need versitility bring t3s and if you need manueverability set up a blops fleet these are the basic standards for covops warfare and they work amazingly well save for the blops i would much rather have a t2 orcaminicarrier as the portal platform more options would be nice but they arent required and would need to be balancedtldr ops idea is bad not supportedmmos come and go but eve remains garresh
another point while being able to be self sufficient in resources doesnt mean that trade still wont happen either way as it stands i live in a nullsec region with very limited market supplies of planetary pos fuel null is ideal to produce it but laziness takes hold and it still is imported same can be said of any other commodity or resource risk vs reward is one factor driving what a player does another is effort and lazinessand if a region is better for producing a product then min maxers might be focused on just getting what is most able to be had getting oxygen isotopes or serpenties in gallente space even if already have plenty of both for not personal use but exportingby having self sufficiency be possible as it isnt right now people running a player empire would be more able to do it to whatever level they felt
highsec should be self sufficient move moon goo deadspaceofficer mods to highsec
i agree with anything but key components used for tech 2i am not completely opposed to faction or officers existing in highsec but still more rare then lowsec and moreso nullsecone in 100 missions has a faction spawn one in 100010000 a officer
if hisec doesnt get everything it wouldnt be selfsufficient would itthe very premise of self sufficient null sec is anathema to the design of the game eve online is a pvp mmo with selfsufficiency what is the driver for conflictto make null sec more attractive the design of the game should be skewed the other direction each region in fact each constellation should become more specialised in what resources are available for exploitation if a system has rich moons it shouldnt also have rich planets if a system has many moons it shouldnt also have plentiful asteroids the distribution of ore by security status should be tightened up so that some resources are only available in low sec others are exclusively available in null sec and even then some regions of null sec should be richer in a others in b others in c even within the regions the balance of ore distribution should be uneveninequality of resources choke points in logistics routes there are many options for incorporating more conflict drivers into the game making all null sec homogenous will reduce conflict drivers why would i want to invade your space if we both have the same resources the only driver will be the simple desire to blow stuff up many players are driven by economics others are driven by industry only some players are driven by nihilisma self sufficient null sec will lead even the nihilistic players to calmer lives that is not good for a pvp game
very well said making each little empire in nullsec able to completely shut itself off from the rest of the galaxy and just do its own thing doesnt exactly lend itself to an interesting and compelling game experience if every region were able to shut itself in and be selfsufficient wheres the impetus to expand wheres the need for trade just because the nullsec guys dont want to come back to highsec doesnt mean they shouldnti think its time we change the way we look at the eve universe when you live on the frontier you have to go into town to get stuff from time to time thats what the empires are the island of civilization in the middle of a vast untamed wilderness
no part of eve should be independent they should all have to interact at a reasonable levelpossibly some balancing should be in order more isk avalable in lowsec more risk in hisec tempered by making suiciding less prolific the risk should be real pvp not getting ganked by 10 fully insured ravens nullsec should have things that only work for small gangs basically a balancing of stuffbut no no where in new eden should be self sufficient
i have not read your intire post but i share u my vision about what is flawed and need to be improvedlets talk about the supply demand fist of the resources that are availeble first in the current situation there is not enough supply to even start producing stuff in 00 the small supply that there is is heavyUFFFDd marked up and ppl dont bother to pay 25  prices on what it normaly in empire cost its cheaper to ship down if u lthink of what is the best option to get self sufficiant the only way for an alliance is to get enough industialist to work togheter or get a industrial corp in alliance that get supplies manufacture and sell them by getting supplies i mean mine moon do reaction mine ore and ice react pi and invent all t2 stuff neded for pvp this is a hugh task example a few examples to build a avarage pvpUFFFDrs loss in a month form scratch your looking at 7 t2 ships minimum there are hundereds of ppl in 1 allaince next to that all the cta replacements lets take a realistic example of cta replacements a hellcat armageddon t2 fit rigged per fight an avarage of 30 ships dies for a there are fights atleast once every 2 days minimum thats 15 x 30  450 t1 battleships u need a army of miners to mine the trit alone every month for that u need 900 t2 heat sinks 900 trackign enhancers 450 mwdUFFFDs ect its hugh too hugh for non organized industrialist to take on the point of the story is that the quantities and the versitility of the ships blown up on 00 is too big to let 00 suppy 00 people but its all about isk isk isk mark up in 00 is a common thing 203040 even 50 mark ups are not uncommon a mark up is a extra price ontop of jita or high sec cost why bother building stuff if u can just simply buy it in high sec ship down and mark up by 30 the profit u gained from producing it localy may be close to jiat cost maybe a few  below why not buy in high sec and take that profit multiple times by corurier it down with a jf once or twice a month with 6 jf trips the only solution i forsee 00 becomming selfsufficiant is by making it cheaper or easier to get supplies here and manufacture it here it must become more profitable to mine harvest react build stuff in 00 only solution is by making 00 a direct compeditor of high sec supplying and industry business the biggest problem in that wya is that 00 is lawless and has more danger the second downfall is accesibility of systems in other words travel and station systems are more dangerous and risky  not always accesable to make nullsec better sufficiant supply side must be better rewarding and station should give better bonus to manufacturing and refining make industry cheaper in 00 combines with trasport cost it will level out and it attracts more ppl that switch over to pvp and stick to the game its win win situation
high should have moon goo makes sense itshould be less or taxed based on standing with the factions space your inofficer deadspace should spawn in highsec also but very rarelow should have higher chance and null the best chanceeverything should be self sufficient but null should have more then low should have more then high
moon goo in wormholes sweetwait everyone should be able to be selfsufficient right
the lack of slots or proper refining or manufacturing in stations basically makes industry in nullsec 34ths importing things being that items and some ships are a more compact version then the minerals use to make them it saves space to ship items in the first place used and dont bring in minerals it is possible to make isk by moving items to null i think i have done it alot still do it i got billions on the markets but still its a nuisance that manufacturing the needs for a alliance is impossible for all but the smallest i think mittani said something along the lines of vfk manufacturing all ammo for a week would just permit 15 mins of shooting for a alpha fleet that dont use much ammo to begin with the issue is the lack of able to being self sufficient and running a independent space empire without npc stations not a lack of ways of making pure isk this about something more then just having isk something greater sure everyone can just keep supplying alliances by the olny practical means currently which is using allot of resources accumulated and produced in empire in jita aid of npc stations and moving that by jump freighters but that seems kind of hollow to having a player driven space empires
i suggested differences in resources the majority being one racial or faction type but the possibility of getting others and nullsec doesnt need to be homogenous number of belts can be different and sec status can be different along with static ice belt how exactly the fact that only south east space has angles spawns drive conflict in the galatic north with serpties and guristas or that serpenties have oxygen isotopesbeing able to be self sufficient in powering capitals and towers doesnt mean fighting wont take place you have neighbors sole hostile some not also people may eye your space or you may eye another a person will always want more resources for more things it also means that to get resources needed for a player driven space empire you get more of it from nullsec the current nullsec game is just getting loads of isk high ends and moongoo in null then using that to buy supplys in empire of all things not in your region in other words jump freighters and jita conflict will always exist a alliance holding half a region will be richer if they hold a whole one or multiple ones major power blocks have long standing feuds and grudges with rivals not even desiring space they will still deny it to others out of spite raids occur just to blow up ships causing loss of isk for no reason other then inflicting suffering with no long term strategythe current game doesnt encourage any kind of independent living frontier though the stations are crap tbh its just encourages people to go for min maxing of getting rare resources and industry being shopping in jita and freighting it up how is that and people using slots in npc stations which are not crap compared to player stations and geting things only npcs produce in npc stations enhancing your game experience if i shop for a skillbook or check a research agent every so many years what does that do for you are you happythough thinking about it revising moons though may not be good because due to limited supply of products only one market can be supported in jita anyway and might not really make manufacturing tech 2 in null desirable so scratch that
eve easy mode
because tediously adding contacts is hard and requires skill
i would personally love this but at the same time as another has mentioned would make this intel tool far too easy being a smart intel gatherer should have its hard work be a benefit i do agree though that a corpmate should be able to share hisher list corp wide to eliminate tedious repetiveness throughout the corp in short people should be required to do their homework to create an intel list but the entire corp shouldnt have to repeat it
lol yea no eve easy modemore like eve boring modei fully endorse this idea
this does not fix the problemstupidly rich alliances and people own them if super caps take as much fuel as a pos or ten to function in all ways that would be considered acceptable loss along with risk losing a 1550 billion isk ship for pvpalso being generally alliance asset more so the regular caps one person can always check up on it and people who have them generally play the game to the extreme anywaythis gives a added cost to using them for just functioning and drives pos fuel consumption other then that nothing
leave supers alone hoboif theres one thing i hate more than goons its csm goons with a bias against supers
hey folksim bringing this up because its very anoying that you cant change your clone and his implants in wh space i have one booster char and it would be nice to use it for shield and mining boost as well you can do that but you have to choose 1 imp before move ini live in a c5 so if i wanted to change the clone i have to scan my way out thorugh several whs into hs make the jump and move all the way backso my idea is thata clone jump light you have a ship or pos module only use or anchorable in wh 00 maybe somewhere else but it dusturbs the peace of balance so i leave it with wh space for nowyou can clonejump only in the same wh system the moduleship is in you cant jump from other spacewh or whatever so if you get podded in wh you still screwed and have to fly all the way back in time between the jumps i dont know 12 hours or soit would let you be a little more flexible with implants but not to overpowered i think
not a flame but a firm no you live ina wormhole by choice you get the enormous isk that whs generate so you have to have the uncomfortable nature of wh living sorry but no i cant agree to this
nice proposal well balanced doesnt overpower anything the only thing id wonder about is what requirements youd have to meet to be able to clone jump but being in wormholes it would be silly to tie it to a sec status for any faction probably restrict to the corp that anchored it and require biology v or something akin to thatgood proposal
id say it should be simpler you go to the pos mod it makes a new jump clone and stores your existing one this lets you pull a blank clone for pvp and store your clone with implants that you use for pvp to retrieve your original clone the one youre in has to be destroyed the major risk would be that if a major attack came and your corp pulled blank clones and then lost badly you could find yourselves watching all your expensive clones go up with the pos so theres some balance and inherent riskim not sure this would have much impact one way or the other and im not really endorsing it just saying it has potential to be balanced and not upset wormhole mechanics
i dont have a problem with them but id make these changes1 the pos module for this should cost fuel to use each time you jc2 can only have 1 mod per pos and takes a large pos to use3 can only be used once every 48 hours reduced with skillsother than that i dont have a problem with this idea
noprimarily for the reason and yes its a double edged sword the lack of jcs is the main offensedefensedenial strat when it comes to assualting an whs systemgranted im sure there are numerious argumentsbut im fully perpaired to deal with the lack of such a feature based on the uniquely tough nature of whs livingin shortgetting podded in whs is a guarnteed way to getting evicted for all intents and purposesunless your smart enough to keep a back door openjc would elimiante that need rather easily if not make it easieralthough i do like some of proposed modifications to this proopsalbut honestlynot needed stop the evemail spam
i think in the op he said that if you get podded you get kicked out like normal his idea is that if you have a mining clone and a combat clone you can jump in one for whatever specialized task you have in the wh but if you get podded while mining you would still be kicked out of the wh like normal
bumpity bump we need carbon sounds
faction navies are easily tankable anyway
the only way i would really support highsec fw is if you were able to flip sov in high sec and physically move the lowsec aroundimagine if idk nour system next to tama was taken over by gal mil keep the ratio of high sec to low sec systems the same so make the gal side low sec system farthest away from the new overtaken system a high sec system the new recently conquered high sec turns into an unstable low sec areathis seems like it would be fun just allowing fw to be in high sec is silly it will just invite more mission bears and station games and we all know how fun those are
hmmm think the only way you could do this is by having total faction war but i dont think it would be a good idea noone likes to be collateral damage in a total warespecially carebears

i would really love to be able to take my rorqual into the belts so the big important question is what would it take for me to do thatyou could give him a big strong tanking ability that would negate a lot of the smaller threats but wouldnt do much about a t2 bs gang or hotdropyou could reduce the cost of having it so it wouldnt sting so much to loose it but i dont really like that idea i like the current pricing structure and the benefits from the ship already are pretty cool as it is giving those benefits away for cheaper seems like a poor solutiongive it a strong offensive capability along with shielding would allow it to take a lot more but youre still in a situation where your mining gang is crying out for help whilst your rorqual is locked down and in most cases youd still loose itrandom suggestion give its siege mode a micropos shield significantly less hp than a small pos but enough to withstand a small gang attack for a while would require targetted interdiction from a heavy interdictor to lock down even allow your mining ships to retreat into if attacked although theyd still probably be safter warping out
a minipos shield around a rorqual for the miners to retreat into thats quite an awesome idea and would indeed allow for a rorqual to offer protection to the mining op but at the same time it wouldnt present an actual threat to the attacking force which means that the mining op would still need other ships to defend it from the gang but those ships would have the time to get there while the attacking gang is busy shooting down the rorquals forcefield i approve thats probably the best belt rorqual option out there
given the recent drama on unbanning kugu dot com and the reasons brought forth by sreegs great pr there really an asset to ccp and the final statement by navigator that kugu dot com is not a registered fan site which in itself makes you sit and scratch your head wondering what on earth the ccp community team is possibly smoking heres a fun proposala lot of the sites on the approved fan site list have articles about botting in essence promote botting and other forms of cheating yet are still approved fansites considering ccps stand on this matter is apparently if you promote eula violations youre censored this should be applied to all sites equally so a proposal for the csm to take to ccp revisit all sites on the approved fansite list see if they still meet whatever terms were there and if they are found to promote eula violating activities remove them from this approved fansite list and censor them on the forums then repeat this exercise on a monthly basis if ccp truly wants to be seen as more open and transparent this would be a good step from whats been seen so far ccp talked the talk but isnt walking the walk  itd be kind of sad to see hilmars tearjerking post be just another piece of pr fluff with no actions to back it up

how does your idea affect suicide gankers using smart bombsthe ability to suicide a ship in the pursuit of causing death and destruction is integral to the hisec experience while i would prefer that it was impossible for someone to blow up my exhumer while it was harvesting ice and i was busy doing dishes or feeding the chooks i have to accept that it should also be possible for me to blow up someone elses exhumer in order to improve my profits from trading in ice productsin the meantime i feel that some of the penalties for unsolicited pvp activity in hisec are akin to a slap over the wrist with a wet noodle not to be confused with his noodly appendage barges should be buffed a little theyre battlecruiser sized with less ehp and fitting than a cruiser concord penalties should be increased and faction standings should be impacted as well not enough to deter the random freighter suicide gank but enough to make life difficult for a handful of dedicated people trying to interdict ice belts in hisechisec certainly should not become a pvpfree zone except for that region of space where my exhumer is harvesting ice for 10 minutes while im afk of course since on that grid concord should simply explode anyone who has any offensive modules fitted
pretty sure this person is trolling so why would off topic post matterthat was the goal
if high sec  0 pvp  highsec removal l4 missions to low sec  losec 03 systems  lowless space  removal gate guns  standing hits 03 system  current high sec incl l4 agentsin short i only agree on this if current 105 system get removal of all ice only contain pye and trit in belts and only contain no agent above l3 level current low sec should get devided into systems above 03 gettign the current high sec and sysems below 03 become law less space with no gate guns and standing hits a breeding chamber for 00 recruits
gtfoyou do realize that eve is a pvp centric gameyou must be a troll
as long as that includes all forms of pvp then sure so no engaging in any activity that could be to the disadvantage of another player including trading resources like minerals trade goods ships or modules and no way to earn convertible isk
as a bit of a care bear no thanks to the idea of making hi sec nonpvp the risk is what makes it funconcord buff not neededconcorded insurance removal ive always agreed withbuffing hulk etc maybe but only to survive a cheap ships alpha strike no more but they should be able to gank you on the 2nd shot a difficult one though so i prefer the concorded insurance to balance losses a bit

or alternately a more skilled mininggang can already be out in the site when the new player shows up and offer to hire them ive experienced this once back when we hired our first outsiders
pretty good but needs probingactually to fight botting youd want these sites to only be probeable there are haven  sanctum bots that can use the system scanner if you are worried about new players there are two things you could do1 making a probing tutorial mission that comes before the mining tutorial mission hell you could use that bigass tv in the captains quarters to play that one youtube tutorial video2 leave belts there but only fill them with veldspar and scorditei would give them one or two rare ores that do not appear in highsec but not all rare ores that show up in null people fight for sov out there for a reasonalso in lowsec being in a probed site is actually a safety feature when hostiles warp in they have to actually probe out the grav sites instead of just shotgunning the belts or running a quick system scan and heading to grav sitespeople already mine in grav sites out in null all getting rid of belts would do out here is maybe stop some botters although i doubt that anyone would want to bot mine belts out in null id be tempted to leave belts in nullseci honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
rookies are given the astrometrics skill book for free along with a core probe launcher and a bunch of core probes probing is no more an obstacle than shooting enemies with noncivilian weaponsusing the cq screen to play tutorial videos sounds like an awesome idea i also like the idea of leaving veldspar in belts but only veld since it is the holy oreleaving the veldspar belts means that roaming gangs have celestial targets to hang out at while waiting for good fightsno mining bots in null
bookmarks would negate that that or you just put two miners in a belt and make sure only one leaves at a timethats just laughable i claim this rock in the name of me but i claimed it first nuh uhseriously people think this stuff through before you actually click postbots can fleet they just dont because they dont need to it would be simple to manually put a bot in a fleet or to automate it joining to an advertised fleetusing an orca is plenty rewarding right now when i did mining as part of my exploration i ran two hulks and an orca when i could have run three hulks why because it was a lot easier and more productive than three solo hulks
its a smart idea and it makes sensehowever thats not the issue the issue is hundreds of thousands of bookmarks created as a result back in the day we didnt have a warp to zero on gates option which led to the result of hundreds of thousands of bookmarks created it created a heavy strain on the serverwith ice and asteroid belts having to be scannable instead of seeing it on the overview the same problem arises summary of eves last four expansions

as i posted in the other thread have aoe on ship death for capitals only as the sub caps dont have the mass to go criticalso in theory only orcas and freighters would have aoe in hi sec and i think most sensible people will see it getting ready to die and vacate the area if they dont want to go with itas these ships are effectively defenseless any splash damage that results in concord intervention will be given to the partyies involved in the kill this might actually be a good thing as it will make suicide gankers think twice about popping a capital near a station or a gate or maybe not if its for the lolz and even people involved in a wardec might think twice too a further level of protection for capitals in hi secfor too long the death of a capital ship has been rather weak its a capital ship for crying out loud when one of them goes boom it should be absolutely freakin awesome not a wimperi can see a good use for super carriers after the nerfcyno into the middle of a fleet and your own side shoots it before the bad guys get out the waytrue suicide bombers in eve
i like the idea of aoe blast damage from ships and structures but it would need to be across all of eve and i can see a real possibility of it feeding the lag monster the idea that only capital ships have the required mass to go critical and produce aoe damage is a good one and worth looking into

this is a tired argument about losing subscriptions for years because you have non consensual surprise seks and yet it keeps growing the reason that we had lost subs as of late is because ccp  up an expansion they addressed the issue realized they  up and now we are moving on
if ccp really wants to keep dicks out of starter zones while players learn to play gamea few starter systems should exist for each race that are dead ends so no traffic to go to other systems and have all rookie mods seeded for 100 isk each mods that require no skills but also are very bad versions of tech 1 the same said place also has training agentsand only people who have trial accounts or ones less then a month old can reenter the newbie zones have it be a feature at the gate you warp to the gate but you cant jump in due to security protocolthis would curtail people breaking the one sacred rule of messing with noobs harrassment or otherwise while not having it interferer with too much of game 23 systems each race thats 10 sec and a dead end no one will notice they leave its fairgame with whats in rest of highsec sucide ganks and market gamesit will be sort of like current system but one gate in and the starter system is dead end and chars a month or older are barred from ever entering itit kind of breaks the open pvp rule but ccp is banning chars who do it anyway so why not just have any oddballs bared from messing with noobs anyway
absolutely notreally thats all that needs to be said
stop there cancel your subscription and uninstall eve
a lot of dcks responding to your proposal op  but hey its evethis is one you should look at though  this post outlines some pretty good reasons against safe zones
i could accept rookie systems being safe zones for characters less than one month old after which they must leave and never come back but anything more and i could not accept it as reasonable
more than a month really dont get mad hear me out a buddy of mine had his hi sec hulk ganked a while back no bigggie right bought a new one and all is good but some math and some beers later we figured up what that would mean to a new miner i used his numbers i have mined less than a dozen times a hulk is about 60 hours play time if a hulk is all you have and a good bit more if you lost the one you just bought and now you have to earn a new one in that scenario first subscription player gets ganked for the bulk of his investment in the game you are an idiot if you dont ragequit and find something better to do now if you are 12 a year or so into the game and you get ganked you should be able to deal with it if you get ninjaed and you dont have logi and an orca to hot swap to pvp you are an idiot so i would favor a longer safe zone but i would make it time dependent not sec dependent that actually works because when it is not being used as a shield for protectionism it is true that eve needs more players and a larger player base there are systems with a dozen residents out there and to me the intent is a more populous dynamic selfish  that i am i want that and i cannot see a way to achieve it by the current system
instead of mining in hulk mine in covetor its insurable if you lose it you can replace it for fraction of cost of new hulk sure you will be making less money but you will also be target of lower priority which means you are less likely to have to reinvestmanage the risk and resources and find your comfort zone thats eve
why is it that in a bacon sandwich people only see bread and lettucethe key of what i am saying is that ccp should never do anything that upsets the sandbox and that i want even more freedom than we currently have for the players to shape the sandbox what i want is that instead of having the security rating of systems fixed by devs we the players have the means to set them through our actions the reason why ccp has not allowed anything like that before is because it is very likely that as soon as the flood gates open all 00 powers will start a war on empire and grind down the security rating of all empire systems to at least below 05 that fact is the bacon in the vegetable sandwich that almost all of you have overlookedif ccp is seriously considering the introduction of game mechanics to allow for some form of consensualpvp if they go down that path what i want is that they tie it to the security rating of a systems and make that security rating dynamic so that instead of intervening in the sandbox they actually make it even wilder than it currently isif an allince or the whole of 00 wants to keep empire with a security rating of 00 i want them to be able to do it and i think it is only fair that it should also be possible for players who want to increase the security rating of systems to have the means to do it that way the sandbox itself would find its ideal state of equilibrium without ccp putting any artificial pressures on any directioni dont have the actual figures of subscriptions only ccp does but they are the ones hinting that they may have to do something to curb UFFFDsurprise but seksUFFFD in highsec they are the ones who are looking at it from a business perspective and may reach the conclusion that it would pay off trying to appeal to new markets even if that were to upset current players after all there are millions of people playing wow and just a few hundred thousand playing eve this time i am genuinelly concerned about them actually messing with the sandbox

if you really want to improve high sec empire space how about a sliding scale of concord reactions that lined up with sec status null sec alliance members should not have unrestricted access to all areas of high sec this would increase the need for trading hubs in 05 and 04 systems with shadier merchants criminals who gank in high sec should have concord consequences that last longer then 15 minutes lets say 7 months in 10 six months in 09 five months in 08 four months in 07  three months in 06 null sec alliance members should be allowed diplomatic status with only one empire at a time on the condition that the null sec alliance makes all players that stay in the npc of that empire blue in thier alliance example goonswarm federation is allowed access to gallente empire space and npc like cas are blue to goons if the alliance breaks the agreement and shoots npc members they lose the agreement and can not negotiate a new agreement with another empire for 90 days unless they financially restore the losses to the npc member and expel the pilot that broke the agreementgate camping  station camping should be time restricted hang around a gate longer then 1 minute and each additional minute earns you two minutes of docked time example spend 16 minutes camping a gate or a station and then get a mandatory 30 minutes in the nearest station transported by autopilot an all the risk that entailspos need to be upgraded the limitations of the cpu and power grids need to be something that a player can improve upon allow moon mining in 06 05 and 04 systems allow more then one command center per planet per player allow command centers to be deployed on planets on behalf of corporations and tended to by designated corp membersallow corps to have trade deals with null alliances so they can get null sec items for high sec items allow high sec corps to use capital ships to defend their pos and customs offices against attack allow jump bridge connections between null alliances and the high sec corps they have trading deals with do not allow the capital ships to use jump gates or agress any player in the system where they are defending corp assets unless they are at war allow jump bridge access between high sec corps and wh corps for the duration of the static wh connection allow player owned outposts in high sec systems that have no npc station along with all the upgrades possible the high sec alliance would not get sov rights an any player passing thru could reap the benefits as wellthese are just a few of the changes that could greatly improve eve play for high sec careers and smooth the way for more use of low null and wormhole space imo
more than anything this is why i spend time in highsec i dont have time to go on 3 hour roams but i enjoy playing eve i think highsec can be improved a lot by focusing on this fact a little bit and making it easier for instant fun instead of focusing on making more moneygetting more assets
well i had a small idea this morning that could help with this problemit would be nice if we could ask agents to get a short medium and long mission based on the average time they need to complete a data ccp has atm its really random what you get and you cannot reject them infinitely oftenso you could log in look onto a clock and say to yourself you only have 20 min left and start a quick short missionif you have a whole evening to fill you could start a long onelph and iskh should be nearly the same for all
wow dude bitter much from minutes to months long penalties system supercaps to defend ur highsec assets you really went all out with your selfserving load of crap every single bit of it and im a guy who would benefit from your spiel try to think in terms of everyones benefit not just yours
bitter no not at all for the record i am not a super cap pilot and do not have any alts that are so your concept of this being self serving is simply wrong my thinking was to increase the pvp possibility and to be honest the chance to build and sell super caps in all sec levels of new eden so you think more pvp is bad if i might have a chance to win the fight right if we have assets that need to be protected in high sec from war dec why shouldnt we get the same tools to defend our assets as they get in nulli guess fairness which i could possibly benefit from someday when a customs office i pay for is sieged is a load of crap in your estimation so you think its legit that a suicide gank that destroys an investment of a billion isk should get the harsh punishment of staying docked for a whole 15 minutes while their friends or more likely alt loot the remains of a care bear mining ship yeah that is of equal value how could i have been so blind
othernull sec in its current form and status is stagnant its owned my a handful of major alliances and it would take a goddamn miracle to unseat them any new alliance or corp wishing to move into null must join one of these major alliances or pay ridiculous amounts of isk for renting time and time again i watch and witness attempts to gain footholds only to get steamrolled and kicked back to high sec within daysliving in low isnt all that appealing either security status losses are laughable so are gate and station guns the way its currently set up its nothing more than a pirates playground not a viable nor profitable place for a corp to call home unless its a pirate corp low sec systems with stations are home to pirates low sec systems with no station need a pos for a corp to use thats all well and dandy but those big null sec alliances come rolling in and mow down poss in low sec just for sportnull and low sec are flawed down to their very core mechanics and it would take some radical changes to get me to live out thereoh and industry has no place in low and null sec gathering the resources locally isnt feasible importing the resources to produce goods locally isnt feasible either due to the limited industry slots available in outpostsstations my skills are heavily devoted to industry yet the only thing these alliance leaders want and tolerate is having available grunts to fight on the front lines thats not where my strengths lie so my ability to contribute in a way the alliance leaders want is very limited in short industrialists simply have no place in null and low secsummary of eves last four expansions
low sec is full of yarrtardsnullsec is an ocean of blues i wouldnt mine joining a nullsec alliance if it didnt have so much drama and  that i rather stay awaylowsec is more dangerous then nullsec but with less rewardsalso i like how highsec works every person you see isnt a ganker so it feels rightthe reason lownull is broken isnt gameplay but the players
post this idea in its own thread rather than having people have to look at the random rant thats started this one before finding it i personally think it s a great idea
main problem ive always had with low sec is the security penalty for killingpodding peoplewhy fight in low sec with an automatic penalty if you shoot first when i can go to null and avoid this penalty thus allowing me to wander anywhere i like in eveeasy solution to get more people into low sec is remove this penalty true you will probably have the hardened null sec pvpers breathing down your neck but then you will have lots more people to shoot at
null sec is often far away and not connected directly to empire and most people go to null for the rewards and conquerable things i dont think they would have too much of a problemalso the pvp environment would be different no bubbles cant see anything wrong here it would offer something different lowsec is lawless anyway so why not pvp without limit no sec hits
how clever you want to make low sec into an extension of null sec how about no sec penalty if the killer stays in that system for say a 30 minute period without docking cloaking or passing thru a gate while evading or defeating a roving concord cop investigating patrolling the system if you are clever enough to avoid getting caught by the roving concord cop or tough enough to kill him  the concord cop should be as tough and as crafty as a sleeper and brave enough to stay undocked uncloaked in the system for 30 minutes you get no penalty to your sec status add some real risk and reward
your entire op merits zero consideration since you didnt do anything but demand more attention from ccp you think lowsec needs more attention tell them why and suggest ideasdont just come in like a little kid and start making demands with no reason at all
not really liking this idea at all the recons already have a role as previously stated and i dont think allowing them to instapop unsuspecting ships is a great idea i personally can see this being used to gank haulersbarges as anything smaller will warp off and anything bigger you wont be able to kill its a solo sneaky pvp option for gankers i think they get enough help from the ships and bonuses we already havenot supported
yup thatll doyou might want to startt a new thread for this i get the impression noones reading past the op any more
one issue i see with a lock someone when cloaked for a sneak attack idea is that instead of that itll end up being an instant heavy tackle for an incoming gang most of the time rather than a sneak attack theres a reason for the targeting delay i dont think this will actually add anything worthwhile to eve
unless you massively redesign the pilgrim force recons as a class arent going to be sneak attack ships some of them yes but not all so a supervolley as proposed in the op or anything else intended to facilitate quick kills would completely imbalance the ship class making one of them significantly less useful than the others
you are not talking about null being selfsufficient but rather every region  what would be the bloody point if there is zero incentive to interact other than to form the biggest blobthere should be more and a higher degree of differentiation between areas of space to make active trade a necessity for longterm success and controlling space should involve dramatic increases in maintenance costs so that a lot more egos are involved in managing itmoons should be removed in their current form and all products added to pi reaction charts with distribution of key elements manually done by ccp in accordance with whatever scheme they see fit to useit should be possible to steal products from planetary operations to encourage patrolling ones space and protecting ones assets  ccps grand plan to make tax offices destructible doesnt actually add anything of value to eve other than tedium like all other ehp grinds yet another fail idea from gottahavebarbie devsproduction should be boosted and options to specialize individual manufacturing nodes read stations implemented mineral bottlenecks should be solved by a combination of a revised mining system introducing denser rockscomets and allowing for temporary local boosts for isk to pe value of prints usedin short no single entity should be able to be 100 selfsufficient without having to trade invade or blackmail other entities  ever we want strife and thus we need as many points of contacts as possible  maximize number of egos and force interaction if they want the best
there are more than enough resources in null sec to produce stuff locally its just easier to ship the stuff in from hisec there are a number of reasons why nullsec miners dont like wasting time mining feldspar nullsec miners are far less populous than hisec miners so they bring in less of anything than can be shipped in from jita there are a limited number of production lines refineries and other infrastructure required for efficient industry in null sec social pressure from null sec alliances pushes people away from mining and industry in general some null sec alliances are so  that they try doing stupid things like regulating the local market ie you must sell stuff within 10 of jita prices which removes any incentive to mine or manufacture in null sec spot onthe stations dont need to give better bonuses just have lower losses or running costs increasing the transport cost will reduce the willingness to import stuff from jita removing the supply of highend minerals from drone poo will help significantly too
how would self sufficiency encourage blobbing i would say deficient junk encourages it considering that you would need to be blue to people to trade with them if one region has oxygen and other nitrogen you blue eachother and you got half of the isotopes needed how is that driving conflict if super power takes over multi regional areas with different ice and spawns will that not be blobbingself sufficiency would involve interacting within your own space with corp mates alliance and allies to get everything you need one person finds one resource they sell it with others actual null sec trade interregional trading or trade in the same region in null is nonexistant direct trading between hostiles will never happen hell neighbors tend to have the same resources as you anyway is fountain and syndicate going to trade oxygen isotopes and shadow serpenties mods with cloud ring everyone brings things to jita thats not encouraging any sort of dynamic trade its just a market system blob i dont know what fantasy you or ccp was thinking it is or should be but its all just spamming crap to one central location then shopping like you are in space wallmartdifferences should exist in space like one resource more then another but the current system is total impossibility to be self sufficient with key ones for fueling certain races capitals and poss on the other side of the universe how is that driving conflict
ok its true i didnt pay much attention to one of your many many threads as i would to most posts i usually readto be honest since you have already compared myself and anyone who lives in null in those threads to crack addicts along with a number of other unsavory epithets i find myself unable to really care enough about your point of view to bother listening anymore
the op originally posted a thread asking ccp to focus solely on lowsectherefor this thread is invalid
just like we get in incursions it is possible for a sansha mothership to spawn then i think that it would maybe be a brilliant idea for capital rats to be introduced into the null sec region all the nerfs recently that has happened to null sec this would be a great balancetheese ships would be like a thanatos for serp rats chimera for guristas and so on or the dreadnoughts these ships would only be able to spawn in 1010 complexs or because of the new true sec systems then i think a 10 system should have more benefits than a 08 or 09 witch at this moment in time there is the barely little difference maybe create a new anom for capital suggested ships such as carriers this will then bring ratting in carriers back witch will balance null sec because there will be more reason to have a 10 system and there will be more risk in ratting with a carrier because theese new anoms will actually test a carriers tank and not only that pvp fleets or roams could be in for a nice kill witch means more risk  more reward if you get me these capital rats will have like 7 or 8 times the hp of a battle ship and will have around 15  25m bounty on them these ships in a anom shouldnt drop anything special maybe a capital mod at best witch would balance the capital market but in like a 1010 complex these were to spawn they could drop like a carrier bpc or fighter bpcs or just some faction  officer mods with making them the officer  overseer of that complexthis would take a lot of work to do if they was to bring these rats into place but with such possible reward it could sort out the problem with the high sp pilot over crowding low as a pirate or over crowding wormholes and it will make nullsec alot more interesting as it would actually be worth having or fighting for 10 systems rather than settling for a 08 or 09 please post comments or suggestions thanks
it would encourage rating in capitals and supers and create more challenge more investment more rewardsmaybe not bpc because its not like bs spawns give those awayten times the hit points of a bs ten times the bounty seems fitting rewards and sporadic cap sized mods fightersthey dont need faction mods themselves but can have factionofficer versions that are even harder that drop thosei see whatever farming system having a cyno jammer in itthis idea while cool might have unwanted effects
using self destruct to ride the pod express to your med clone allows you to do everything a clone can do except store implants unless you dont mind destroying them and suffer through a 24hr delay using your own corp offices or the corp offices of frog you can travel to any station in the universe in 2 minutes if you preposition your cache of shipsammo you could fight anywhere in the universe any time you wanted and then hop to the other side of the universe for even more pew pew so the primary objection in these two quotes is moot the ability already exists
wonder what those little color coded buttons dark blue to red when you add a contact are for empire merc work combating mercs is made very difficult by the little things like this not to mention groups alt rep during aggression literally anyone in the vicinity can insert themselves into any fight between two other groups at war and can just dock up with no timer or the fact that the address book is bugged and shows people online that are not any way we can make the stuff already ingame work first i think thats all nayrl is saying
watchlist  contacts or standing its one thing to set standings for someone so you know if theyre friend or foe its another to watch and see every time they come online or log off
interesting comment from a csm i would like to know honestly what exactly do you hate about them please be both detailed and specific because i have only read about them and seen one once
voting no wormholes are hard and inconvenient and theres no reason to let people mess around with jcs thereif you want to bring specialized implants into a wh to help with something then you put those implants at risk for everything you do there and if you lose them or find them inappropriate to the task at hand tough
i was always under the impression that a pos was just a paired down station that you needed to fit all the mods for yourself so fitting a pos mod that allows a change of jc would be fine based on the ops ideasupported
i dont think jump clones are the proper term more the ability to keep a spare clone on hand that you could while actually in the pos swap into in order to get a different set of implants into play so if you got podded for example with all your juicy combat implants they still are lost and youre still in high sec hoping you can get scanned back in
righti have the feeling if people read the words jumpclone and wormhole in one sentence they go crazy without reading the resti dont have any problems that it needs a huge ammount of cpu from the pos tower or some fuel and i really dont see the problem that you can change your set of implant in a wh you can change that in 00 low and hs so where is the problem about whs you decided to live there okay you coudl make big money ok also but it is dangerous also many ppl seem to forget and believe me some things are anoying enough every day because of some game mechanicsi think it doesnt disturbs the balance of eve if some wh inhabitants where a little more free to switch there implants under some restrictons
voting no all of the inconveniences that make wh life more demanding are the reason why the rewards are so great chip away at the difficulties and you also chip away at the rewards
how many players actually use the already existing sound i like many dont it would be interesting to find out if enough do to justify a change if one is needed
theres no sound in a vacuum if anything the sounds should be internal radio control warning and damage sounds of the ships were in
fw can be played in high sec without worrying about the navies join fw go to concord controlled genesis problem solved im kind of surprised rvb hasnt done this tbh lol maybe ccp should put plexes in concord space too
while the tone of the op is not to my liking the issue at hand is an important one also the issue of the preview button adding my support that this needs to be fixed
the broadcast window does require work
thinking about it you probably dont want the pos bubble effect going off every time the rorqual sieges it has the potential to be inconvenient to friendlies after all and in the event that someone wants to munch on ore inside a pos as is currently normal you dont want the two systems interferingaccordingly id suggest an expensive script named something like defensive matrix reconfiguration which can be loaded into the industrial core unlike most scripts this script would be somewhat bulky and require expensive ingredients to produce this script would shorten the duration of the siege mode probably by about half both doubling fuel consumption over time and making it easier to make a quick getaway if need be while the core is active under this script the rorqual would project a smallish forcefield no more then 10 km which would exclude all nongang members no passwords here just a question of infleet or not infleet while the forcefield is up the rorqual would have capital ship immunity but not the immunity to remote support such that it can receive reps should a friendly support force be deployed to defend it in a pitched fight obviously a rorqual with this script loaded cant use it inside or near a real posa rorqual with this script active should probably get an arbitrarily huge bonus to shield hp such that it can actually tank a bs gang for a few minutes perhaps a quarter as much hp as an unmodded small pos but if the rorqual is reduced to zero shields while this mode is active the forcefield drops while leaving the rorqual sieged and helpless for however long is left on its timer not sure how to actually implement the change between vulnerable traveling rorqual and protected siege rorqual requiring a bunch of shield logi on hand anyways to rep the rorqual to maximum shields just because that numbers gone up seems wrong but i dont want to let the rorqual simply cycle its siege to refill its hp in the middle of a fight maybe activating the siege changes the rorquals max hp but keeps the same proportional shield strength between modesas a final note a rorqual with this script active is still able to target and interact with things outside its shield unlike the weak mining ships it is protecting this allows it to still make use of its capital tractor beam items transported this way can pass through the shield without incident and probably gives clever rorqual pilots a way of contributing usefully to any battle fought in their own defense
want more bang out of the rorqual allow it to be used in high sec in any system that does not have a npc station give it a micro force field so it could survive annoyance ganks and suddenly what is now a pos module becomes the center piece of mobile mining operations as it was designed to do the force field would serve as a 12 hour protection for the mining fleet as well this is the best option it gives the rorqual a chance to call in combat support which means more pew pew but all rorqual ganks would be exempt from concord intervention you get a force field and the chance to call for help from your corpies or friends that is all of course no concord intervention means no sec status loss for the successful ganker
sounds like selective censorship to meregardless though ccp goes by this excuse i think theyre still butthurt about getting called out which if true is rather pettywatch out the mittani ccp may just ban you too and censor your name for calling them out on their wrong doingssummary of eves last four expansions
the idea is that even if they have an excuse this excuse should either be gotten rid of or applied to all sites regardless of whose it is  otherwise anyone with 2 braincells can see that ccp as an entity is still severely butthurt about the whole kugu thing considering that if ccp as an entity has stated they wish to be more open and transparent the current censorship there is only one site that is actively censored should either be applied to all sites that encourage eula violating activities or to no sites at all its simple really this is a relatively small thing that is not putting undue demands on ccp its not asking for the moon the stars and the answer to life the universe and everything no its just asking that a rule that apparently exists be applied equally if this is something ccp cannot or will not do then the whole oh my were so incredibly sorry well promise well be better thing is nothing more than a piece of pr fluff that has been thrown up so the playerbase will shut up for a while this is ccps chance to man up and prove beyond a doubt that their statements are true
think what the op is getting at is that if ccp allow the solo aspect of ship spinning very debatable that this can even be considered as an activity as such he wants ccp to allow more content for solo play to appease a very tiny part of the player base no doubt i will be corrected if i have this wrongi will point out that this is a mmoguess what the mm stands for give you a hint solo isnt mentioned anywherei have read a number of proposals on the forums of late that seem to indicate that a very small and vocal minority dont actually want to play eve at all they want their solo miningship buildingratting empire with no risk or pvp whatsoever that my friends would no longer be eve and you would have solo content as you would be the only one playing itdont support this proposal at all
the incarna release forced us into a single player resource hog that boged down the gameship spinning redeams it again in allowing something other then a blank image to take the place of captain quartersi multibox and my cpu is not a godbox i cant do captains quarters on each or any account when doing sowhats the problem they can fix things for a multi player game till then ship spin
goodness such a big supporter of mm  wonder why you are the only  aka solo  member of your corp dont you play well with others all single member corps should be banned on the basis of not being mm to stay consistent with your theme rightsome players of eve are not afraid to venture out into the void alone while others need the support of numbers to do anything at all i feel pity for those players like smiling menace who need to be in a gang all the time safety in numbers right heroso if i read this correctly when players are doing missions lets say level 1 distribution they are not really playing eve at all because they are 1 player in one ship without the need for other players to do anything but gank them so you believe all pve that does not take more then one player is not playing eve at all rightmaybe ccp should design a class of ship that takes more then one person to operate that way no one would ever not be playing the mm way they could name it the herd class so you sheeple would feel saferdont support those afraid to undock alone at all
is it just me or did this thread get stealth edited again
wowyou paid for 4 subscriptions per month obviously have plenty of vested time and whats making you quit is that this site wont allow people to link to another sitei understand people not wanting censorshipbut if this is making you that upsetyeah you should probably quit and do something less stressful
1 please release a better support bra before doing this as i think my shoulders might snap off if this was implemented to and just let the puppies free
brarmageddon 
they should also tweak how the timers work to encourage more pvp for example in a minor plexif you start a minor plex you need to run it for 10 minutesif you kick an enemy out of a minor plex or enter a plex they started you need to run it for 8 minutesif you are kicked out of a plex for more than 90 seconds the timer restartsthese are just some ideas they may not be the best the intent is to discourage alt plexing and warping out and encourage people to stay and fight for plexesmake faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
one thing id like to add i dont think that cloaks should work in either fw plexes or fw missions cloaks dont work in enemy highsec it makes no sense theyd work in these either99 of the people in fw level 4s in particular are flying stealth bombers they enter the mission cloak slowboat 100km away from the entrance and do the mission in complete safety from the other side also sorry if this has been mentioned elsewhere the entry requirements to the sites make no sense why can a faction frigate like a dramiel or a daredevil enter the small sites but an af intereceptor or eaf cant thats just crazy and it means that 90 of the ships at least the ones i see used in fw arestealth bomberdramielhookbillslicerseriously either ban faction ships or allow t2 variants
no just the pirate faction and t2 leave the navy faction to have entrance they arent nearly as powerful however if the dessy changes are true this will no longer become and issue
i was just thinking they should create a new rookie plex this would allow only vanilla t1 frigates  no faction frigs destroyers or t2 then the minor plex would allow everything a minor plex currently allows including destroyers but also allow interceptors and assault ships for the minors i think the destroyers faction frigates and t2 are all fairly well balanced and it would make a nice variety for the rookie plex the vannilla t1 frigates are also a very well ballanced group of ships and understanding how that pool of ships works would be very good for beginners who can be overwhelmed if there are too many types of ships edit what are they doing to dessiesmake faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
this is for the best you have all my plus ones
from what i understand most miners bots and otherwise use bookmarks anyway
can a bot do the little probing mini game that might fix italso i thought of one more thing to prevent bookmark botting the new belt replacement grav sites would have to only have a few minerals and respawn somewhere else on depletion maybe at the rate of 23 hours of average highsec belt mining that way the bookmark would only be worth while for a small amount of time i have seen the medium and small grav sites out in null last for a day or morei honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
change the game mechanics to make wardec exploits impossible there are a number of exploits currently possible that are abused on a regular basis which are easy to fix1 changing corporations while in space while next to a war target to surprise them or to get them concorded fix  while in lowsechighsec prevent members from joiningleaving a corporation while its at war if theyre in space and a war target is in system2 wardecced corporations may join and leave an alliance to escape any wardec this is commonly used to save reinforced towers without the attackers having any chance fix  there is much debate how to fix this possibilities include corporations do not drop wardecs upon leaving alliance corporations with reinforced towers take longer to drop wardecs an added delay for corporations to leave their alliance if at war etc3 dec shields a dec shield is when you have many alt corporations wardec your shielded corp such that any future incoming wardec costs against you will be inflated substantially these are fine if the incoming wardecs are actually being paid as then it actually costs isk to maintain but thats not how theyre used you can toggle a war mutual right before the bill comes and the incoming attacker does not have to pay for that week and then untoggle mutual to restore the shield this allows dec shields of infinite size to be maintained for free while still costing new attacks much money fix  if a war is set to unmutual then the aggressor has to pay the bill within x time or the war is declared invalid4 a corporation that has left an alliance cannot be wardecced until after the next downtime fix  a corporation that has left an alliance can be wardecced5 corporations join an alliance 245hrs before their tower comes out of reinforced alliance fleet surrounds enemy fleet who then instantly becomes valid war targets without any warning this is a version of 1 fix  when a corporation youre at war with is accepted into an alliance it sends a warning message that the war will carry over to x alliance in 24hrsthese have been known issues for many years and recently 25 have been declared legal because they fired a good portion of their gm team and didnt want to regulate them fixing these issues by changing the game mechanics will eliminate the need for gm intervention and help reduce costs to ccp while restoring some much needed balance to obvious bugsexploitsi have been offering free wardec removal to any corporation in efforts to bring attention to the situation there is no reason what i do should be legalhere is a graphical representation of the exploit that is now possible
this is currently considered a petitionable exploitmy solution is that wardecs should follow whatever entity they are applied to if you wardec an alliance then corps dropping from the alliance can escape the war if you wardec a corp inside an alliance that corp can drop from the alliance so that the rest of the alliance gets out of the war if you dec an independent corp and they join an alliance the war is extended to alliance members while remaining active on the corp if the corp drops or is kicked the dec stays with the corp and the alliance loses the wardecbetter fix a mutual war remains so for a full billing cycle if youre going to declare mutual youd better be ready to commitseems rather obvious to meagain this is a petitionable exploit i got this explanation when i asked a gm about a warning i received shortly after the no wardec exploits postthat is considered an exploit as that gives other players no chance to see if you are an enemy or not however if you change corps while docked in a station that is not considered an exploiti was told in the same conversation that this rule is a stopgap until the problem is patched
other than the obvious ccp made their point quite clearthey will no longer consider war dec evasion tactics a punnishable offensepetition if you think its an exploitotherwise your waisting your breathyour complaining about something your doingthen why continue doing it this is confusing stop the evemail spam
one of the best ways to bring attention to gamebreaking loopholes is to abuse them so badly the developers have to fix it
thats like begging to get banned stop the evemail spam
ive run into this before it can stem from reasonable causes takes too many resourcesinterferes with other stuff in the pipe and notsoreasonable causes notmyideavalue0 not going to speculate which it might be but it doesnt matter as long as someone can take a look at iti dont think the system as proposed would eat that many clock resources the only thing that might be a pain is calculating the mineral index values of all the exploded stuff but that can be done effectively offline like recalcs for insurance values i didnt know about that until recently hell you could do it in an excel sheet and import a comma delimited file into the db once a quarterlikewise theres no need to hammer the server with a payout calc request every time someone goes boom it can always be delayed like rat bountiesnot sure how many more pages could come out of this theres not a lot of disagreement here just some concerns over the mechanics involved details i havent run into anyone who thinks the bounty system asis actually works
thats the point and the problem obviously those who are in power are not very interested in a working bounty system nearly everything has a higher priority the question is why is this so who profits from that game mechanic being broken and uselessas i mentioned before your proposal has charme because it is simple and seems to be able to do what it is meant to do it would not be that much investment to design it and to implement it with this a whole new profession would be introduced to the game and finally there would be a means to pay back the rampant highsec killers and the lowsec highwaymenso why is there no working bounty system what is the reason that this is systematically ignored since eves inception
ok so having no safe zones might make sense but how would it hurt to add in the ability to play pvp missions  ieusing force balancing mechanics similar to alliance tourneys and such you dial in ur agent and select 1v1 2v2 3v3 5v5 total fleet ship points up to 10 or less etc and both sides can gate into the mission area and have some fun wo the normal neutral reppers all over the placeship destruction or not kill mails or not  up for debate maybe let people choose when selecting the mission and make rewards proportionate  mr noob is after all going to lose and lose and lose and lose so might be hard to replace his ship every time or not whateveri think this would make pvp more accessible to newer players  and provide an alternative to having to play the bad guy pirate thief can flipper just to get some pvp experience maybe then theyd be more willing to move to nullsec as the new crop of meatshields cannon fodder or gank victims the nullsec folks are looking for
ok thats actually kind of a good ideaok so this would be an addition to or maybe replacement of faction warfare since people rarely do fw as intended anywayok so everyone on your side fleets up and one of you picks up the pvp mission meanwhile other people are fleeting up and picking up the pvp mission in other nearby systems then the eve servers do a load of math in the background trying to match up opposing fleets based on number of people character sp shiptype etc then it spawns an arena mission area in a nearby system with two entry gates one for each teamnow before they get in the arena they are still neuts to one another so if they try to jump one another someones getting concorded unless they meet in lowsec then all bets are off next the arena gates only let in the people who signed up for the mission and if you warp out you cant get back so no reshipping also as with all complexes you cant just warp straight to the site the only way to get in is through the gatesthe last fleet left standing gets a can full of swag or some lp or something for their troublei honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
please lets not have arenas in eve  it would totally cheapen the rich and dynamic sandbox that has been grown over the last 8 years sisi test server is that waywow is that way 
and cojones should be that way vedit dear god the censoring is awful
sisi does not count  a noobs arent going to be using it b it doesnt solve the issue of neutral reppers c it doesnt solve the issue of being forced to be the bad guy in order to partake in pvp and no pvping with corp mates doesnt count eitherand im still waiting to hear  how exactly does it hurt anything in the game to add this what would it take away i know people are afraid of it as theyve stated time and again oh no it will kill the sandbox  so how exactlycurrently there is no way to arrange consensual pvp that isnt plagued by neutral reppers canbuddies hiding around the corner or that doesnt require using your own corp mates  non of which is real pvp anyway
first off all those terrible things you listed are apart of eve that is what gives the game its flavor consensual pvp can happen as a matter of fact you consent to it when you log in every timethe only issue here is that you have a hard time coping with the way the game is played flagged pvp is the antithesis to the spirit and foundation of this game once you start introducing this kind of game play you start to weaken the foundation and then soon the game will follow suittldryou dont get eve
to have a legitimate concern all that needs proving is1 there has been a change of attitude in the part of ccp towards empire dwellers from the good old UFFFDhtfuUFFFD to the present day in which war declarations have been watered down to a form of consensual wars since it is now allowed to exploit game mechanics to avoid war decs in addition to the beefing up of concord of recent times2 subscriptions are in declinestagnated quarterly economic newsletter qen is no longer going to be released which was our main source of information regarding the number of subscriptions still looking at the last information that we have available in the last qen of 2010 and judging by the events of the first three quarters of 2011 it would be fair to suspect that the number of subscriptions is in decline or at the very least stagnated
yes nerf lowsec pirates they shouldnt be able to dock in most of low sec stations if they want to dock go 00 pirate space
are you planning to answer this or are you content with your thread going down in flames as a troll
baaldor what did i claim that you demand proof for would you mind quoting itthem
and there it is
i really hate repeating myself but for this thread im more than glad toeve is a pvp game no matter what aspect of it you play mining competition for belts better ore sale of oreminerals manufacturing competing against other persons on the market for better profit margins marketing competing against other persons for better profit margins undercutting buy lowsell high etc combat blowing  up that belongs to others whether or not they want to fight scanning scanning down sites first running them first mining them out first manufacturing competition for building materials offering better rates researched bps etc whs see combatscanningmining null sec see miningmanufacturingmarketingcombatscanning contracting aggressively searching contracts to get better deals before others do sell  first or get that high paying courier contract first planetary interaction competing for better planets and setting up low sec customs officers before others dowhat it all comes back to is eve by nature is a pvp game even the developers hold to this and the fact that nonconsentual pvp is an intended design featureif you cant handle the above the following actions will help you give me all of your stuff find another mmo better suited toward your play style make sure that you have given me all of your stuff biomassi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
wtfbbqpwn senses tingleingthat or the op just got thread ganked  stop the evemail spam
you are right i cannot back that claimi changed paragraph 3 of my third post because i cannot back the claim that ccp is seriously considering the introduction of game mechanics to allow for some form of consensualpvp at this point it time i can only say that it is a suspicion that however is irrelevant to whether eve would be better or worse with the changes i suggesteddo you agree that eve would be better if players could fight to change the security rating of a system because that is the key if you agree then we are on the same page or at least on the same book if you disagree then you are as much against the sandbox as those who think that nobody should be able to shoot at them unless they give their full consent
i agree that the main feature of eve is pvp i even agree that pvp is the best feature of eve i am just asking that devs let us players fight to shape eve at the moment there is an artificial division between 00 and empire i want those walls down and i want players to be able and willing to fight i am afraid though that the only reason why people would want to fight in empire is precisely to uphold their right to be left in peace i would be glad to put the right to shoot at them on the table if they are willing to put on the table the right not to be shot
and herein lies the rub carebears live in high sec and dont want to be shot period you make it so they have to fight to maintain the ability to have more security and the subscription rate is going to go down faster than lindsay lohan after a dropped crack rock why because carebears dont want to fight they want to grind missions mine roids mine ice build stuff buy more shiny ships and be left aloneso the proposal of them actually having to do something that may involve violent conflict to maintain the security of an area yeah probably not going to go over very well and would more than likely destroy the fragile balance which exists i am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
op should get a thumbs up just for the entertainment value of this thread butno thumbs up from me i do however need to go to the store for more popcorni will assuredly run out reading this thread
i didnt say those things were terrible  they exist plague to some joyful mayhem to others and in fact they will continue to exist  unaffected by consensual pvp eve is a pvp game  sure  but it just doesnt appeal to 80 of its residents so far as something they like to take part in  and there needs to be a way to bridge more people into it  so i still dont get it  how can adding more pvp pvp missions or some sort of arrangement be a bad thing
this is a terrible idea and there is nothing to reconcile placing nonpvp areas completely disrupts the games uniqueness and mechanicseve isnt designed to just look like a cold dark and harsh world its designed to be a cold dark and harsh worldccp wranglereve is an awesome scifi mmo in its own right but the above sentence is why i love this game and have been playing for all these years we just went though the summer of rage because of nex wis and ccps lost focus on fis in my opinion having nonconsensual pvp areas even in noob areas is much worseim pretty heavy into mining and trading check my kb stats in all this time ive only ever lost two barges due to my own stupidity ive mined in all areas of new eden including wormholes low and null hulkageddons and countless war decs instead of saying mechanics need to change im of the mind that the people who complain of ganking or nonconsensual pvp just suck at the game
i quoted what i mentioned earlier as far as n00bs getting that rainbow bridge to pvp there isnt any there are a megafukton of corps alliances looking for rifter heros little nubs that are sporting wood because they can now fit a point and a webthe issue is not the mechanics the issue is with the barracks lawyers in the npc corps that has never left it because it scares them yet they chest beat thinking they know wtfwhat is worse is you have a help channel with supposed informed ccp drones that know even less and please drop the link showing your 80 of the residents as proof the problem with this kind of thread is that we have peeps wanting something to change that is totally fine but said peeps continue to use false claims anecdotal facts or exaggerationsit is like you are afraid of the response and the truth and by slinging bullshit you are hoping to get away with it
it sounds like most of the complaining is about hot drops which are honestly kind of cheapwhy not let the cyno jammer also block covops cynos
because the whole point of the covert cyno is to bypass cyno jammers you dumb 
but the whole purpose of cyno jammers is to jam cynos good god we are caught in an endless loop of dumb eryuh oh the two of us better post as our alts in noobcorps so we dont look like idiots on our main accountsactually the point of covert cynos is to jump in a very specific type of subcap without needing to buy a titan also covert cynos dont pop up on everyones overview which makes them  you know  covert
no need to attempt to convince us otherwise of your anger towards pvpers your requests have already shown us that despite you not having the skills yet to pilot a supercap your admitted future benefit is sufficient for self regardless aoe weapon systems are a no go in highsec plus piloting capitals are part of the benefit to nulland then you talk about defending the upcoming customs office to which there has been very little fortold of what it can do debating your defense of a nonexistant component of gameplay yet is laughable they may not even exist in highsec at the beginning rendering again your point mootand then theres the truth of the matter you want drastic penalties to ganking boo hoo youre mad and now you take a 15 minute gcc and you think giving someone no empire play time for 1 UFFFD 6 months a just sentence are you 12 itUFFFDs not everyone elseUFFFDs fault that you donUFFFDt know how to a tank your ships properly or b are smart enough to hide your cargo indeed you are blind thereUFFFDs plenty of ways to protect your assets it starts by using your head htfu this thread isnUFFFDt an excuse to perform a reach around of your own fail
it is always so cute when posters with infantile arguments call someone else a twelve year old almost as cutesy as their weak and idiotic assumptions that anyone having an opinion different from their own must be licking the wounds of numerous defeats because of poor game playing skillsi have never lost a ship to another human player on any of my accounts and i have never been podded on any of my accounts with just under 8 months of game play that is nothing spectacular but it does make moot all the phony assumptions that my positions are derived from wanting to get pay back for being ganked i did get my ship blown up by concord as a newbie because i shot a wreck instead of a rat also when relatively new i was told it was safe to go to the asteroid belts during an incursion the sansha taught me otherwise i quickly lost a well rigged industrial ship and the even better rigged cruiser i foolishly sought to salvage the first wreck with needless to say the rapid loss of 2 ships to the sansha was a lesson i paid to learn lol i lost a brutix to sleepers but i am addicted to sleeper loot so i have made that isk back many times over in many different wormholesi dont afk pilot i use cloaky haulers and or an orca or freighter to haul valuable cargo from low sec to trading hubs no i dont use the orca or the freighter in the low sec segments of any cargo haul i have good skill training in warp drive operations i use warp stabs and the rigs that get my slowest ships to warp as soon as possible as a noob i use to industrial mine in an iitty so i learned to stay aligned to jump points and tank with the best of them i watch dscan and am aware when someone starts to use probes in any system i occupy i watch local and have trained all my alts minimally to use cloaking devices an i spend time scouting routes in covops ships to establish safe spots and nondirect routes to gates for emergency exitsi have to ask you cordo are you projecting your pvp fails upon someone who has none out of ignorance or lack of intellectual capacityyes i think the penalty for ganking is no penalty at all i also think that the bounty system is broken and no cordo i dont think that because someone placed a big bounty on me some people playing this game have these things called independent thoughts and ideas they hope might improve the game cordo you dont have to agree with all of them or in your case even understand them but the forums are the place in this game where players can get their ideas and thoughts vetted by other players with the intellectual capacity to analyze statements and make superior counter arguments sort of intelligence pvp cordo you are a shuttle facing down a titan in this match of intelligence pvp all your incorrect assumptions totally fail
capships are a benefit of low and supers are a benefit of of null and player sovereignty also a wellfit pos is a near assured deathwish for anyone in hisec  but you have to keep up with the defence if they incap your guns fix them if they rf the pos get shield repair boats on it soon as the rf timer expires also have more stront ready have a standing fleet ready in case of wars furthermore if capssupers were allowed in hisec it would be akin to having a level 20 or 50 or 80 or whatever character in other games and then walking into the noob starting areas  ie theyd essentially be solo wtfpwn mobiles hell even in lowsec all you need is a single dread or carrier and you get instant fear from the hiseccers who may be passing through lownull seccers not so much if youre still talking about hisec you wont have to worry about your customs office getting sieged as playerowned offices are only being introduced in lownullwspacefurthermore if youre setting up a solo customs office ie oneman corp or something and expect it to be ignored in lowsec  well lets just say its a poor expectationyou can always have friends around to scoop the loot 
its easy to predict what will happen with the customs houses  the large alliances will sweep in and claim them and lock everyone else out or tax them  carebears wont care  and were back to square one  but hey it will be entertaining for a few months until were back to playing eve goonswarm edition
actually i think the reinforce timers on the new customs offices are short enough based on that devblog that your average nullsec alliance wouldnt have enough patience to babysit every planet in one high sec regionif you set up a customs office in highsec and jacked the taxes up to 100 people would just go a few jumps until they found an office with lower taxes if someone wanted to force people to pay high planet taxes theyd have to take over every single planet of that type within 20 jumpsthats waaaay too much effort for a nullsec alliance and probably too much effort for most huge highsec alliances thats assuming large highsec alliances even exist i just assumed that highsec is just a bunch of solo mission runners selling monocles to one anotherid bet that one corp or alliance would be able to lock down and babysit only a few solar systems and theyd keep the taxes relatively low to compete with the nearby corps and alliances with their own planetsi vote yes let people set up player owned custom offices in highseci honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
i have a very simple reason for not going out into low sec or null sec often it costs isk to go there if i go to either im almost guaranteed to lose my ship to some gate camp or in the case of null sec a blob this is counterproductive so unless im specifically looking for a fight and willing to lose some isk i stay away from both i never go to either in order to make isk as that would require too much of my time in null sec and low sec just isnt profitable for isk making as it is compared to the riskwith that being said i would like something with similar risks as this to get a fairly good rush but not guaranteed instadeath such as a way of smuggling banned goods between empires or making bounty hunting a more profitable venture essentially things that have been suggested before however the most important part of all of this is it has to include other players i cant stand doing missions of any kind or anything similar this essentially means some way for players to pool money and one charactercorporation winning the money like a bounty system where players increase the bounty with their own isk and then another player can gain kill rights or have some flushed out system
yeah dont care what they do with hisec customs houses  the hisec planets are not worth much  i bet ppl would mainly stop using them if they become destructable in hisec  there wouldnt be much financial incentive to builduse them compared to the ease with with gankers would destroy them just for fun
well we all know how irritating it is sometimes not being able to understand which system the fc is ordering the fleet to warp to so i propose that we change the system names to something which is easier to pronounce for the sake of efficiency in the gamei understand that some of the planets and systems were named after beta testers and i really appreciate their work and would like to take this opportunity to thank them on behalf of entire new eden but the reason they beta tested was to make eve online better and the way it can be made even more better is to simply change the planet and system names that is what they would have wanted and that is the best way to honor their memory
fc  set destination to linked system in fleet chat fc everyone warp to hof hofjaldgund gate not too hard to work around it
orfc everyone warp to hoteloscarfoxtrotnot that hard stop the evemail spam
or that
im all for making things easier  but with multiple languages playing the game you might cause more problems than youd solve
at this point it is a fact that that because of the hard to pronounce names people misunderstand where to warp even if the fc says hoteloscarfoxtrot and with regards to setting destination its not always that you warp to the set destination plans might change suddenly no matter what you say at this point people are having difficulties because of the hard to pronounce names ive seen with my own eyes people having these difficulties so for their sake and everyone else in new eden who are having the same problems i urge every capsuleer to support this proposal
i fully understand your concerns and have thought them through but as it is now most of the planet and system names if not all are in icelandic even though the majority of the playerbase speaks english and understands english better so by changing the names we would not make problems but solve them and that is what we should do if we want to move eve online forward so if you are not against eve but want to see it prosper support this proposal and if not well there isnt much i can do
warp to the firstsecondthird gate right click  stargates  third gate  warp assuming your overview isnt set up to make this really easyproblem solved
i fully understand your point and it would solve the problem but unfortunately only for mining fleets in fast fleet action people only have time to use shortcuts to warp quickly so i am afraid that everyone will still have to support this issue and ccp will still have to urgently change this
new eden is not in england or america they dont speak english as a result the names are not english
stop right thereits very clear to us that you are obviously not famialr with the nature of fleet operationsi suggest you take the time to talk to fcs before you start spouting off noobish gibberish like some kid who thinks he knows everythingas its already been statedthere are multiple languages invovledchanging things for your sake on behalf of us is not what i call a good excusethe system names are fine as they areits a flavor of uniquenesswe dont need to mess it upyou pick a method and you stick to itchanging names wont change a damn thingits the same mechanicsand your reasoning for change of plans is ridiculousthe rule in fleets is simpleyou do as your toldor your ass is poddedend of discussionsome may not be as harshothers worse yet if you cant follow instructionsyou have no business being in a fleetmany corpsand alliances have an entire sop on the subjecti seriously doubt you have any experince to base your complaint as opposed to proposal on this subject at bestin shortthe solution is to get a good fc and to listen to your fcchanging the coat of paint wont change a damn thing stop the evemail spam
there are other clients than english but the language that the majority of eve players understand is english here in denmark for example people start learning english from 4th grade
so you speak for everyone else thenthis coming from a 12 day old toonin an npc corporationyeahsureuh huhyeplets force our language on every one else thats gonna start a flame wari bleieve that is my exit signalquitely exits out the back before the fist fight starts stop the evemail spam
ive never encountered this problem tbh its easy to broadcast destinations and when giving commands it doesnt matter if you pronounce the system name correctly all that matters is that you are able to differentiate it from the other options available within that system if the name is unpronouncable you use the first few letters and digits to achieve the same thingim also not sure what the name changes would actually really achieve since this is a global game some people are going to have trouble with some names and others with different onesyoud propably object if all the names would be changed so they would be easy and clear for me to pronounce since finnish is my native language on the other hand i can guarantee that i wont pronounce all the words as they should be if they were chosen by a native english speaker for example i just dont see any particular reason why ccp should start catering to any one group on this issue its propably best that they leave the names as they are
i have a better idealearn to pronounce the system names betterlook at me solving problems again woohoo
no just noit would be like changing new york to something else just to make life easy for someone thats not a native english speakerthe names we have in eve may be difficult to translate but these are the names we have and i never want to see them changed to something mundane how bad would it be to have bourynes changed to bristol or emogranlan to blackpool no freakin way dudeleave our names be not supported
short and sweetboth highsec and lowsec both have a number of static 110 and 210 plexes which are frequently used for small scale frigatedestroyer pvp often solo more and more these are the only places one can find solo frigate pvp in lowsecthe 110s and 210s in highsec are all camped 2377 therell be someone in them if you log off on the gate and spam login as soon as the server comes up removing the static 1 and 210s from highsec whilst leaving the lowsec ones in place would reduce the supply of small c and b type modules which are everywhere nowadays thus forcing the price up and encouraging solosmall gangsmall ship pvpi dont think players should be rewarded for camping a highsec complex constantly
i too would like to see the problem solved not the supply with lowgrade mods but the perma camping right now the higsec statics are of no interest to others then the guy camping it
supportedthe lowsec ones arent really camped because of the ability to shoot the person the high sec deds were meant to be a way to get noobies into exploration and give them some good isk thats not what they are used for anymore might as well relocate them
so your solution to new players cant use these complexes people permacamp them is to remove the complexes or more accurately move them to a place new players are even less likely to be able to use them thats like punishing your kid because the dog pissed on the floor
i am not in favor of removing these sites from hisec spacethey are part of the new player experience except for the campers who need to feed their epeen on new folki do agree that there is a problem that of the permacampers and n00bhunters unfortunately i do not have a fair solution at this time allowing concord in hisec ded is a bad idearestricting access to players under x time in eve is an even worse ideamaking a game mechanic to restrict players campers from doing as they want is also a bad ideano simple solution
remove them as static make then scannable like the other plexes just with a strong signal strength farming them becomes harder as you cant just sit in the last room waiting for it to respawn or as anomlies rather than signatures
that makes a lot of sense to me
i like to build stuff  and doing so well takes more skill than any gank  and when i do want to try pvp i dont want to be forced to ruin someone elses day  yet somehow im made out to the bad guy bc i dont want to waste time gankin or playing docking andor blob gamestheres nothing in low or null for me to want  i dont care how much isk there might be out there  its hardly worth having to sell my soul
tell me more of what youve learned about lownullsec from your extensive experience in fna is that a corp in mvn
if you would like to post this up and cite me then fine but im not in support of this idea i love my recons and i know that this will make them horrible wtfomgpwnbbq i came up with the ideas to show that there are simple ways to change the rules without making them to complicated and still get what you are aiming for in this specific case the sneak attack which is already a viable tactic using bombersmmos come and go but eve remains garresh
tags have always been a problem for cashing in lp but have become far more so lately i dont know the root cause of the current tag shortages but its clear to me something should be done so i have a fairly straight forward and obvious solution1 add 15 new missions against each of the 4 factions 60 total missions yes i know thats a lot of work with five of them being lvl3s five being lvl4s and five being lvl5s mostly ungated as gated ones are rarely run2 add an option to existing agents that when selected allows players to run missions against opposing factions exclusively rather than having the usual pirate killing missions mixed in i would support adding an option to do the opposite as well so players could run antipie missions only instead3 adjust some tag drop rates the republic fleet captain tag for example is one of the rarest tags in game and yet is used for practically everything4 no item or bpc should require 400 tags i dont care if they do cost 5k isk each a hard limit of 100 tags should be applied any itembpc that requires more than that should be adjustedalternatively the tag requirements could be deleted and add isk requirements instead but i think the current tag system is better tbh it just needs some adjustment
im not sure this would help your problem though im not sure your problem is an actual problem that requires addressing its generally advised that missioners simply turn down faction missions because they eviscerate your standings anyone who is doing them is doing them because they think the additional payout from tags is worth the standings loss if prices fall people will stop doing them supply will drop and then prices will rise againincreasing the drop rate per boat might help itd let sellers make the same iskhour while increasing volumetricky though
heres the issue as i see it no matter what happens the balance of standing hit vs extra isk is always whats going to determine the tag market if there are more tags dropped they will increase supply for a short time but then as tag prices fall fewer people will find it worthwhile to run the sites supply will drop and price will rise again and itll be back in the exact same spot as it is right now the reason that it is worthwhile for some people is the extra money they make from it if the tags go down in value the extra money will go down and fewer people will do themthe only way i can see to permanently increase tag supply and lower their costs would be to reduce standings hits in the missions that drop tags if theres less standing penalty more people will run them and they wont need to make as much isk off the tags to feel that its worth the standings hit thus driving down tag prices
which tags are under supplied
i dont think you understand under supplied means not available at the price i want to buy them for
op doesnt understand how trolling works obviously
and ader systems stay the same crap how they are now no m8 if make than in all systems not in one per region eny way alliances not interested in sec statuses and ratings or  like that that way no one fights about good sec statuss so noo need make worse than that is need back all santums and boost 00 for more income risk vs revard in 00 need to be best in all eve but that is not so 
i think reducing the timer would make it too easy to travel around things can get blown up when they travel but not when they  i like things getting blown upi guess they could try to majorly chnge the way implants work like you suggest but it just seems easier to simply allow more clones maybe make it a level 5 skill or whatever but the number of implant sets is growing while the number of clones is the same make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
like theyve said above people are already doing this  so its not allowing anything new  its just removing unneeded boredom1
this would also require some form of clonejumping i mean the wis way of clonejumping
this and engine trailssupported
i am completely against the bouncing boobs ideanuff said
as long as it is only trials that never activated1
trial accounts that havent been activated after a month after their trial expired should be purged automatically a trial is there for you to see whether you like the game or not not to reserve yourself a character name in case you decide to play it three years from nowi am not sure about paid accounts which went inactive a long time ago i would like a solution where you keep your name unless someone else actually creates another character with the same name when that happens you get renamed to caldari citizen 1234567 and get a free character rename ticket either way there definitely needs to be a long timer on it a year maybe two after your account went inactive
im a pirate i might be on the receiving end of bounties and i still approve as it stands now the guys that most often collect bounties from pirates are other pirates or alts if its a nice  juicy bounty thats just not how it should work itd be awesome if there were groups of players who specialised in bounty hunting that could result in plenty of gudfitesi heartily approve of anything that unbreaks the bounty system even if it might be just partly there may not be a perfect solution but this one sure is a lot more perfectish than what we currently have1
much appreciated im looking for pirate feedback on the proposal since theyre the most affected by bounties part of the proposals idea is to encourage more reasons to go into low
ok the one problem i have with the hurr durr go play world of warcraft argument is that people actually will hurr durr and then go play world of warcraftif you tell people to get out of your game then they will get out of your gameand in the long run low subscription numbers hurt an mmoi honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
fair enough pointim afraid that the addition of arenas on tranquility would really spoil the game for me the way pvp works in eve is one of the major things i like about the game even though i dont partake in much actual pvp myself i know it works in other games and im sure it would work in eve from a pure mechanics perspective but for me it really goes against the style and spirit of the eve universe would it break the way i play the game no it wouldnt but for me it would spoil the universe i play in to some extentnow to provide a more helpful answer than i did in my previous posteve is a sandbox  that means a fair amount of content is playerdriven rather than handed down from ccp im a fan of this setup and i really would hate to see eve turn into a wowstyle onrails gamerather than asking ccp to introduce new game mechanics or features to make arenastyle pvp a possibility you actually have the power to do it yourselftake a look at rvb for example  two corps red federation and blue republic that are permanently at war you can simply sign up for one side or the other and jump into solo and smallgang pvp with them they also run small fleets arranged between fcs in both corps and limited to a certain number of ships or certain shipclassesif you want arenastyle combat with rules pointsystems prizes etc all you have to do is set up a corp or a pair of rvb style corps to provide this that way you are in control of the rules if you want to use the same pointsystem that ccp use for the alliance tournament all you have to do is copy  paste if you dont agree with their system or you want to tweak it then its in your power to do so if people dont stick to the rules of your arena you also have the power to kick them from the corpthe sisi test server is a perfect place to do this kind of thing if you stay outside the main ffa arenas as you can buy all the ships and mods for 100isk there is a station for this in each region i believe another advantage of sisi is that unless youre in an ffa area other players are not allowed to interfere with youthere is literally nothing stopping people from setting this kind of thing up  all you have to do is get off your butt and do itunfortunately people would rather come onto the forums and petition ccp to add new features and change for me fundamental game mechanics than do a little bit of work themselvesso its not so much that i want to see players go back to wow but that i want to see that kind of thinking left behind with wow there are already a lot of games like that but there is only one everant
no eve is pvp like it or not everything in eve comes down to pvp if you mine you are gaining minerals to build ships which somewhere down the line become pvp stuff even if the fisr 4 steps are more mining ships eventually it will feed to pvpmarket that is pvp missions making isk to get better than other people  pvp missioning just to make isk to better yourself you will at some point sell loot or do somethign that ends up in the hands of pvpif you make any area zero risk all that will happen is it will become clogged with pvpers alts to make risk free isk such as my mining alt and so onthere must never be a place where pvp can not happen randomly
well there is ship spinning pvp doesnt happen randomly thereif you choose to take advantage of that moron selling a plex for 350m and a plex    its you who ganked yourselfif you choose to take advantage of that moron buying afterburner is at 5m isk per and get stuck with his load of overpriced afterburners  its you who ganked yourselfif you click the undock button youre clicking the bring it on guys button personally i think that for some of the activities seemining they need to make it feel more like pvp ie there needs to be more feeling of these are my rocks dammit and conflict caused by people absolutely trashing a system on saturday right now all we have is meh ill go next door perhaps bringing back the 1 or 2 respawns per week mechanic
fair enough mal thanks for your insights imo the current mechanics around pvp are already contrived and artificial enough and the barriers to doing the things you mentioned hassle enough tho not insurmountable just unlikely for new players to do to make it worth providing an in game battleground system or pvp missions worthwhile but seems like a legitimate difference of opinion  matter of tastethe real question then one which ccp will have to decide is which method would best sustainincrease eves subscriber numbers with the least impact to existing playerbase
thisthis would increase competition for roids and this maybe make the carebears a little more protective and violent also it would make mining less of a start game for free iskies type of thing might turn some of the carebears into real industrialistsi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
hmmmm  the current harrass the mining fleet via can flipping until they warp out mechanic isnt workingtrying to turn carebears violent  meh theyll just go next door to another game that makes them feel more powerful more easilyand i know most of you will simply say great let them leave what do we care htfu  but i hope you wont be that short sighted
i dont mine rif i was speaking of a newb who does mine in whos case a hulk gank considering he is new and not as well informed of such dynamics pretty much ruined his entire investment in the game oh wait no i wen mining a couple of times in a maelstrom because i was hanging out with a buddy and bored do you have any idea how pathetic t1 mning layzors are
so let me see if i got this right special ships for low and null are good but allowing those ships for defense only in high is bad yes i see the light that is completely fair after all you pay a higher subscription rate then high sec players  wait no you dont  well then is must be because most players choose to live in low and null and naturally the best benefits gravitate to the majority  oh dang im wrong again most players are in high sec null and low is just full of the best whiners how about a super awesome pvp ship only for high sec oh i forgot you dont give a  about anybody in high sec unless they are a target
so how would that work  something like this  hey bill im going mining today for a few hours why dont you just hang around to scoop up my salvage when a nice ganker blows up my ship  you will thanks buddy you are the best if your ideas were not so simplistically unworkable they would almost be funny
oh but you forget eve is a pvp  i mean gank game didnt you know that when you signed upyeah its 100 gank everywhere all the time  you just dont know how to play the game if youre not out there ganking everyone or being ganked and liking it  its the only way to play  and dont you dare change it  itll completely break the game winning
if people stopped using them then the supply would go down while demand stays the same making pi more profitableif people jack up the taxes then then people will charge more for pi so youll still make money when mineral prices go up ship and ammo prices go upcustoms offices have reinforce timers and probably structural hp levels so neut ganking is not an option you can pop a hulk with thrashers before concord gets there but not a structure like a pos theyll have to wardeck you which gives you a fighting chance at leastand yes a massive alliance could roll up with more battleships than you have corp members and blob you but  sad to say thats life if you want to hold something then you need enough power to keep it from othersi have had fair fights before they existand if you are only outnumbered a little bit like 34 or 23 if you are a bit more badass ultimately if you are better at flying your ship than they are then you can win try taking a 10 man gang around lowsec some time it worksi honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
you are right  thats the theory  at like 1015 the pi yield of nullsec tho  not sure anyone would bother much  it would definitely add raiding targets for pvp hooligans tho  so win  i guess  not a valid option not to love pvp rightactually id say do whatever will attract keep and retain new players the most is what id advocate  would be great to have some solid data one way or the other based on behavioral studies of new playersyes i believe you  and what would be useful is a better way for new players to actually find those fair fights more so than the normal a  ones before they unsub ive been playing long enough that i personally no longer care ive got plenty of alts  i just go play somethingsomewhere else  but i hate to see new friends or members leave time and again
duplicate post sorry
lets have a little hypothetical situationyou actually get into a player corp and we dec them over our rightful claim to the ore belts in some system you try avoiding it by sitting in station sidenote not necessarily a bad thing to not give the other guys kills we find your poorlydefended tower in hisec we get a gang together 10 pilots or less and decide to shoot at the pos you bring a triage carrier out and soak all the dps we can lay down wed love to bring our dreads  but cant  because its not defence how is that fair to usnow if you would have taken the four seconds it takes to pull up a pilots corp history you would see that i have lived in corporations that are primarily not combatoriented hell after nearly 45 years of playing i still have embarrassingly bad combatrelated skills sure i have a corp here or there that had a good bit of combat involved even did a stint in nullsec  my only recorded kills are against war targets and have been stupid lucky i dont seek out fights or even ganks and am perfectly content to keep things that wayas for my comment about having friends around i never said that you should have someone babysitting you in a belt  only the implication that you can bring friends along too or put another way  get into a good corporation and actually work with your corpmates
fair to you because of the mythical risk versus reward mantra that permeates new eden because you and your 10 pals believe a pos is poorly defended you feel entitled to be able to destroy it who promised you that you dont want risk vs reward you want a guaranteed win you researched the hypothetical little corp and thought it a quick easy target you were wrong boo hooyes you cant bring in your dreads because you are the aggressor  but fear not after wiping the floor with your 10 pilot gang im sure the war dec over the rightful claim to the ore belts will visit your pos in short order after your initial defeat while your pilots are in disarray if you are facing a competent opponent  then you might get to use your big guns in defense as the fairness needle swings back to you
i never said it would be quick nor easy just that it was poorly defended pos are a pain to take down no matter where you are  doubly so in hisec when you cant bring in big gunsso you can bring caps to defend your pos but i cant bring caps to defend my fleethow is allowing caps on one side and denying caps on the other fair
could you please please make the distance to locked targets more visible next to it or on top of it or something for me its a constant problem that i cant always see it its so small i have a high rez monitor maybe make it bold and slightly bigger or maybe a bright green or something i know for a fact im not the only one who wishes for this the numbers are so tiny and so like every other text next to it that before i know it im either out of range or too close i would like to be able to see that info without actually superfocusing on the tiny area of the screensort of passively see italso related to distancebut thats just wishful thinkinghave the speed turn red if its decreasing and green if its increasing kind of makes it easier to keep track of whats going on when you are fighting 234 ships at once which is often the case with meyes im expecting fierce opposition from the hardcore micromanaging everything must be super hard to do crowd
too much imformation crowding the space would make anything larger than 5 ships in a fleet impossible to navigate accuratelynot supportedas a counterpoint all of this information is in your overview and if your having a hard time seeing it on you amazing monitor i would support that overview font size can be adjusted also this issue might be fixed with the new font have you looked at it on sisi
granted this may be a trivial desire compared to some of the other issues that the council deals with but its also a relatively quick and easy fix just give me the option of hearing the original strip miner sound file when im chewing on rocks for hours on end whos with me

sell custom ship textures in the aur store wanna pink thoraxmaybe allow your corp icon to be painted on for a simple isk transaction
screw micro transactionslet us paint our thoraxes pink for freeseriously though we just had a huge dust up over incarna and a big part of that was the 80 monocle thing i pay close to 15 a month for this game and i am not going to buy a bucket of ship paint for another 50 or whateveri honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
it could be nice to be able to buy pre determined ship textures for a certain amount of aur another thing to get aur forjust things that are cool but do not give unfair advantage and ofcourse not for those insane monocle prices more like 50 aur for a texture for example the texture stays in posesion of the owner but only one ship can be painted with it if the ship gets destroyed you can use the texture to paint a new ship but you can not paint two ships with the same texturethe reason for pre determined textures would be obviouse ofcourse but for the people that dont get it no flying pink dildos
shhhhh they already took away my golden retriever dont tell them about the pink dildosi honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
i do not want qauffe pajamas i do not want a monocle i need to pimp my cane that ccp we might actually pay for
fleet commander broadcasts warp to for a specific gate entire fleet rightclicks broadcast and selects warp to whats difficult about that there is no need to rename anything since very few people need to use the namesalternately spend some time with your fleet commander and get to know their accent and quirky pronunciationor i could support your proposal and inform you that UFFFD being australian UFFFD i have a hard time pronouncing any names other than bruce i have no problem with all systems in eve online being named bruce youre welcome
there are ridiculously few systems that you could get confused which stargate to warp to with the first 3 lettersthe odd names add a flavor to the game and do not hinder normal operationshowever i could see the situation where under panic confusion would be had but that would be the case even if the systems were named tom joe and harry
youre lucky at least your systems have namesi have little patience for anyone unable to refer to a merely unpronounceable name by the first three letters or whatnot since thats more or less the only way to refer to systems in null id advise that you simply get used to heading to aitchoheff and whatnot since in null its all stuff like jaytacsee and aywunarrnot supported or at least not before names get handed out to the null systems
i support adding nulllike names to all of highlow sec systems for easier identification could always keep the old names for rp sake  say abc12 caldari prime it would make the moments when i just really need to get a fleet through gallente space much les of a pain in the vocal chordsa related and somewhat more practical issue is one system connecting to two similarly sounding systems making it sometimes unclear which one the fc actually meant especially if they have a strong accent one particular example i remember offhand is zkyv in pure blind which connects to fnm and sm
i have no qualms with the naming conventionsi actually like the names of every single system in the game
so your proposal is to change the names of presumably a large number of systems in order to make the game a bit easier for fcs or fleet membersnames that have been part of the eve galaxy for what 7 years or morefor me this smacks too much of dumbing downi like the eve system names just as they are  especially haajinen which when pronounced by a certain fc sounded absolutely hilarious as others have already mentioned there are a number of ways in which to convey system names for fleet warps etc eg linking in chat using abbreviations or spelling broadcast window setting destinationswaypointsperhaps if youre having trouble you could investigate some of those first instead of trying to get the whole galaxy altered
agreed make them anomalylike in that they spawn and can be picked up with the system scannerthough ive been to 6 sites in the past 2 days and none of them were camped
while im not sure about building this sort of thing directly into the client i do find myself incredibly drawn to the idea of yelling fire ze missiles at my computer to activate the cruiselaunchers on my raven
assuming the changes to 00 in the winter expansion are a success ccp would be prudent to devote the next expansion to improving lowsec
when im writing in the chatbox while dockingundocking i exit the chatbox after the loadingscreen fix it
1 thats a bugproblem with the game not a proposal to the csm post in the right section next time2 clarify what your problem is is it that the chat window loses focus after the loading screen or is your chat window actually physically closing
oh yea sorry for not posting it the right place where to post it then but your right when i read the thread again it seems kindof confusing the problem is that it loses focus after the loading screen
issues and workarounds
i like the suggestion brought up as modification to the op ill think about a constructive reply  bombers are nice but extremely specific which reduces greatly their overall viability except for very specific tasksand god forbid anyone targets and actually shoots you
when a frigate can get up to 600 dps on a battleship solo and then on top of that is given an area effect weapon that deals massive damage im really glad that it can be instapopped if looked at sideways same goes for the tier 3 bcs its all a matter of pros and cons strong enough that you want to fly it with glaring weaknesses that make you think twice what op suggests or even my modification will make recons to powerful more specifically the arazu and the rapier frigates would never be flown again in pvp for fear of a recon ambushing yoummos come and go but eve remains garresh
actually atm what saves frigates from a rapier or arazu is not the dps of the recon its the lock delay between decloaking  lock time which can be around 10 seconds that is plenty of time for a frigate to warp out i do not think that my suggestion would affect frigates that much the stealth bomber is highly specific it also gets killed quickly by drones bombers are useless solo you can only kill the hopelessly stupid and negligent alonei do not agree with the cloaking targeting on recons that would make them far more powerful than the critical strike i was suggesting no frigate would escape it would be locked and scrammed webbed before he knew what was happening and giving it zero survival in that encounterfrom what i see ganking frigs is the main concern a modification i would make on my op would be a 50 tracking penalty on the critical strike as to make it harder to insta kill  gank moving frigs after the strike the guns would return to their normal tracking that would make it very hard to crit a moving frigate after all the posts i still do not see a really valid objection to the actual ability of the recons but to the actual execution
i agree i am against insta locking of any kind without the target being able to see it coming and with some sense protect itself dont like no can defense anything
this particular property is for gun  missile recons not for the pilgrim the pilgrim is a special kind of recon by no means is this supposed to be a property for every recon or cloaking ship for the pilgrim i would give it something that fits its general roleidea font know what yet
right as i said this is only for gunships
thats not what it would do i think you missed half the op
if this isnt overpowered i dont know what is i do not agree timer or no timer being able to lock someone while cloaked and being able to insta engage is bad
i support the op with some mods to prevent insta popping every frigate
your original post is far to complicated to even be considered by most people they dont even address the issue of you op because its far to restrictive and rules heavy in essence sneak attack has no premise in eve because of the inherent abilities of starships the ability to constantly have automated programs standing guard and keeping defences primed and optimized is the glaring issue and chief arguement with the oprecons are ewar beasts and really dont need any change to make them better or worse as a ship standpoint ecm is something completely different and im not arguing that heremmos come and go but eve remains garresh
sigh these forums really  me off spend 10 minutes writing up a nice response only for it to get deleted and never posted here it goes againwhy do we need more tags i have solid proof and didnt think i had to give it but apparently i do when was the last time you saw an imperial navy adaptive nano not the energized my guess is never they are superior to t2 and have no disadvantages compared to t2 other than cost but heres the problem they cost 20m isk to produce in tags 0 isklp and are inferior to ctypes which cost 1015m isk obviously no one buys them except as collector itemsbut that is with current market tag prices now take a look at what the npc buy order prices of those tags are suddenly that item would only cost about 5m isk to make if tag prices reflected ccps intention for them in adaptive nanos would be a good item to make and i suspect farely popular but since those tags are worth upwards of 40x as much as ccp planned they arentyou want to know what tag is worth 40x as much one of them is the republic fleet captain tag npc buy order price is 50k isk current player prices are around 2m isk that huge discrepancy alone makes many of the amarr lp store items impossible to sell at a profit since deadspace and pirate faction drops of equal or superior stats are in fact cheaper im not interested in increasing tag supply to improve my isklp rate on popular items its to make the other 90 of the lp market stuff actually worth makingas for people rejecting the missions goes i think its hard to predict what people will do back when i was a high sec carebear i never rejected missions against opposing factions i didnt know anyone who did either ive played fw on both sides of the minmataramarr front and guess what i still dont care about killing the opposing navies in truth the only people who seem to care about the enemys faction standings are missioners who post on this forum i dont think ive chatted with a single player in game who rejected such missions so i can see it going either wayin any case i included the options to both get antiempire faction missions only or antipirate faction missions only or the current mix it should make everyone happy will it increase tag supply overall i think so but even if it doesnt it gives the option for people like me to generate our own tags easier perhaps even with a surplus to sell to the others like yalli dont think there is anything to oppose here really im proposing the addition of a few new missions at various levels and the ability to select whether or not you want to fight opposing navies i think that doing so will bring tag prices down to where ccp intended for them to be but even if it doesnt are you really against any of this
the fundamental problem with your approach is that youre misunderstanding the point of npc buy orders theyre not supposed to represent a cap on tag prices or to indicate what tags should sell for theyre there to ensure that antifaction missions always provide at least some baseline isk reward the rest is left for the market to decide same as with most any other item in the gameand as it happens i dont think in anps would sell all that well at 5m even if the tags were available at npc buy prices dark blood and true sansha anps have the same stats and are available at around that price but i cant remember the last time i saw one on a lossmail the real issue is that if youre going to go for a fancy anp you can pick up ctypes for only a little more isk in absolute terms and theyre much more attractive
i dont support the general increase of tag availability the supply of most tags is just fine just some of the more rare ones could be tweaked
i have never had an issue with tags when im cashing in my lp you may be doing something wrong

forum pro tipdo not make a post about how you need more isk in your space when your character portrait has a monoclei honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
when toggling a rack to be overloaded all modules in that rack are effected by the toggle while sometimes this is intended and necessary there are other times when this isnt needed an example of this might be a pilot that is in a guardianlets assume for a second that the guardian pilot has 4 remote reppers and 2 energy transfers and that guardian pilot likes to maximize his rep cycles currently overloading the rack as it stands now also overloads the energy transferswhich more times than not is unnecessary not only is it unnecessary the extra overloaded modules produce more heat than that specific pilot wants across the rackwhat i propose is that the overloading toggle for a specific rack not affect the rack the module is in but rather the location in which the module is placed for example energy transfers are high slots itemsyes but you can drag specific modules from their high slot location to another location on your hud for whaetever reason ie you can drag them to a low slot location but they remain as a high slot itemthis has a positive effect of the overloading toggle not affecting modules you dont want them to and doesnt break any current functionality with the assigned hotkeys to produce the current effect im talking about the following key sequence needs input to successfully overload your 4 reppers without touching the energy transersshiftf1 shiftf2 shiftf3 shiftf4 f1 f2 f3 f4the changes i propose would reduce this toctrl3 f1 f2 f3 f4now the above example pertains specifically to my example guardian but this is a positive thing for any ship that use different modules for different things and would like to overload them at different times it gives players more control over what is and isnt being overloadedcheersedit id also like to point out that heat would effect the nonoverloaded modules as they do now im not suggesting they dont

supported dont you love buying a character for its skillsbut its name is 2334wtfu great isnt it
or could be the book1989
well i think the idea of a rookie plex no faction no t2 and then an everything as a minor makes more sense whilst some of the empire faction frigs arent as powerful as the pirate ones the hookbill and the comet totally outclass every t1 nonfaction frigate the plated two web and tracking disruptor hookbill fit thats become fairly common 
i am not convinced about the intel channel idea not because of the intel it provides but because it is a more limiting mechanism you just logged on what do you seei posted these ideas in one of the other faction warfare threads what do you thinkfaction war intel mini map  2d region based intel map available through militia office highlight activity shows number of plexes taken lostmissions completed and militia ships destroyed in the last hour and importantly shows current plexesmissions in progress perhaps with some delayed intel say 5 minutes so it does not take the place of proper scouting and maybe only for the region you are inregarding system occupancywar taxes  controversially i would perhaps propose a tax on high sec based corps based in that factionUFFFDs space this tax only exists where there is a significant imbalance in the systems held the worse your faction is doing the higher the tax the more isk is goes to that government not a huge percentage tax though perhaps just 2 or 3the payout for pvp kills and flipping systems would then be higher when a faction is losing seems unfair but it is to create a balance so that everyone does not just jump on the winning side and that perhaps the militia is reinforced when doing badly due to greater incentives this would require more than just the swinging of a few systems to trigger maybe when you have lost say 30 or so and perhaps your own rewards would drop if you faction becomes too dominant

in the skunkworks we collect warnings by finding new things that havent been labelled exploitsccp has specifically said that they wont be considering most wartime corp and alliance shenanigans to be exploits this means that if we want them to fix those mechanics with a patch we need to abuse the hell out of them until the pressure to fix them pushes them to high priority
what i would like in this bounty reform proposalinsurance gets taken out of the game no insurance for anyone theres enough isk fountains in game and manufacturers would enjoy the buff to the value of the items they produce and to their value as players in game to other pvpers id be making deals with industrial buddies all the time to stretch my isk out to the fullestyou can put a bounty on anyone you want you still cant shoot at people with bounties in high sec unless theyre at war with you or youre willing to risk a suicide ganksuicide gankers get a bounty pay out just like any other pilots in gamebounty hunters get a high percentage of a ship hulls worth whatever feels right items dont count and you have to beg the loot gods to drop the good stuff in your wrecks like every other pod pilot does i say dont count items in your marks ships because1 factioncosmosofficer items are contract only and tend to violently shift up and down in price all the time especially officer items2 if for some reason you get that sweet sweet estamel invuln on that burn eden nightmare you and your buddies have been tracking around new eden for the past couple of weeks you wouldnt like it if you were payed doubly for the item in bounties now would you yes you would but deal wid itbut yeah these proposals sound like a wet dream with insert favorite porn star made into reality so the possibility of these suggestions ever even being considered is null unless trebor sees something in these ideas that makes him as much as meoh man im fapping so hard at the idea of a much darker scarrier eve bounties for everyonealso page 4 snypa
would it be possible to please either increase the bonus for t2 rigs to warrant the astronomical price increase or lower the production requirements to match the measly 5 bonus gainedfor certain items like cargo rigs for which the bonus is cumulative over long periods of time its ok to have a big price difference but for ships that get blown up every 3 hours the 5 its nearly worthless in the grand scheme of things and the overall damage absorbed or dealt i would suggest instead of a 5 over t1 riggs have a 2030 bonus to whatever attribute they modifymoderator  could you please clean up the posts with the  in them i kept hitting quote instead of edit  thanks
why are you t2 rigging a ship if it gets blown up every three hours
the difference in potential between meta3 and meta4 items is often smaller than 5 yet the market prices are ten times greater t2 rigs may be getting some love soon UFFFD there has been talk of manufacturing t2 salvage from lots of t1 salvage
precisely my pointthis is why you are asking the question the prices of t2 rigs are outrageous vs their benefitsother the other way aroundfitting t2 rings should make a significant difference in pvp not just the expensive km which is what they do now i dont see a justification of a 100 mil rig for a 130 mil ship for 5 more armor its preposterous




and yet arbalest hmls are more expensive than malkuthccp have already hinted that they will be looking at being able to manufacture t2 salvage from t1 salvage rather than getting angry about the prices of t2 rigs look at the reasons that they are so expensive rather than increasing their bonuses or reducing the materials required to produce them what about increasing the availability of the materials used for t2 rigs
anybody else notice the trend here presented by all these pvp tearspvp must be everywhere industry must be in places where pvp can ruin its day a very lopsided and 1 way argumentits like asking irans opinion of america there is no common ground
you really dont get eve and should stop thinking your ideas make sense perhaps thats a bit rude rather you should play eve a bit more so youll understand why thats a bad idea this has nothing to do with pvp vs industry and has everything to do with once you implement a nonpvp area into eve it will drastically change the scope of the game whether you can see that or not doesnt really matter but it is nevertheless truethe idea of a pvp safe haven would in practice drive margins of items down due to invincible minersproducers and just in general goes against the very creed of eve a risk vs reward game

velicitia wrotetbh a lot of the trouble is there is absolutely zero competition for rocks i can warp in with a fairsized fleet and absolutely trash an entire goddamn system and none of the other industrial corporations will take offence to that the only thing that will happen is meh well wait til they respawn tomorrow and then get the rockscan flipping and decs out of the blue from pvp corps that only care about padding their killboard with easy targets are honestly part of the problem the issue is threefold here1 rocks spawn too damn fast they used to spawn on mondays and fridays give or take and you had to be there to get the rocks or get nothing this was changed to better accomodate rookies whose 10 and 09 systems were getting trashed by bots2 there are too damn many sources of minerals3 there are too damn many industrial corporations you can look in nearly any station in hisec and see offices held by 5 man newbiefriendly industrial corporation 123432235 possible though likely flawed solutions1 put the rocks back to respawning every few days to encourage claiming resources 10 and 09 systems can respawn every day or at least with more rock in the case of every few days ive run through a number of newbie systems recently and have seen rocks with tens of thousands of m3 in them  you should not see this in hisec if barges and exhumers become a problem put in something to inconvienience people wanting to stay in newbiespace in these specialised ships hell even something as absolutely daft as no concord intervention if youre gonna gank them  in other words leave newbie space to the newbies2 not really sure here getting rid of trash drops from all rats may help here  this one is delicate though as meta 13 modules might be considered trash to one person and treasure to another assuming that the bounties on them are factored by a combination of rat difficulty and what loot you may get then possibly increase the bounty payout to compensate3 this one really needs a lot more than quicksimple fixes i mean its impossible to give a newer guy access to researchproduction slots without letting him have the ability to view and cancel all of the rest of the corps if theres only research happening this isnt necessarily a bad thing meh you lose a slot for up to 30 days it sucks but isnt the end of the world  but if theres production happening say 30 battleships you lose everything in addition to this the simple fact that they can see what you have in the cooker can be potentially hazardous fix for this should be allowing for at least tworesearchproduction installer can install researchproduction jobs but can not see whats in the slots if theyre taken like what happens in an alliance research tower now  you just see that the slot is unavailable for 2d 4h 5m cannot deliver anything researchproduction manager can deliver jobs as well as see whats in the oven ie the current setup0 are you proposing that small industrial corps are a bad thing please elaborate  interesting  im guessing youre not implying that hisec should go the way of nullsec so we can all become meatshield 209135 1 no rocks meh still not worth going to nullseclosec where youll simply lose your hulk  better to just leave the hulk in dock and go run missions instead2 hisec belt rats drop nothing of value  no one cares about them3 hopefully already being fixed by team 10 million papercuts or whatever tho not likely to affect the pvp questionthe pattern im seeing here over and over is hmmm we need more pvp inroadstrainingbridge for new players in hisec  but the proposal isnt really adding anything  rather people keep gravitating towards well lets just start removing perks from hisec until people hate it so much theyll be forced into losec and nullsec do you really think theyll just up and start loving losec and nullsec when there are so many other options other games available to them that offer instant pvp action sure we all know these ppl probably are never going to be the nullsec hardcore youre looking for  but they could be paying subscribers  but to them why bother with gatecamping having to play the pirateganker etc when other games even dust are going to let you log in and get right in the action every time  reliable adrenaline pumping pvp  less real maybe  but there are already less real parts of eve all over the place and were able to adapt them into the big picturenot to mention just how much pure pvp could a game take after all are there any actual pure pvp games out there where losses are real i mean there must be some balancing point of pvp vs safety  both for new players and simply for pvp losers to be able to recoup their losses so they can try again since in eve losses are real  for the old bitters in the game eve pvp is basically equal to wow pvp battegrounds simply respawn in station and slap yourself into a new ship from your tech moon fund or whatever go find some more noobs to gank etc  but for younger players its still real  insurance can help the very new but only to a point i dont even bother with it myself  its really only useful for the very new or suicide gankers  you can only lose so many bcs in a day before it affects your wallet as a new player  its part of the beauty of eve sure but im just saying there must be limits if we want to retain playerbase
tldr  i dont want to see people pushed out of hisec but i do want to see people pushed to realise that there isnt as much of a hard split between pvp and socalled pve activitiesin a sense yes i am implying small indy corps are a bad thing the problem with the small corps is that theyre no different from one another rather than have 1 25 or 50 man strong corporation that can realise the goals theyve set for themselves supplying massive amounts of shipsmineralswhatever to their local markets you have 5 or 10 5man corporations that all can barely scrape by because they dont bother to realise they would be much better working together i think a lot of this is the general eve mentality coupled with the simple fact that no one really wants to be in these types of corporations youre right in that im not trying to imply people should strive to be a meatshielda lot of the problems are most likely caused by the terribad corporate mechanics that i mentioned furthermore corporations of this nature smallindustrial seem to be where the ideas that people should be allowed to play alone without any risk to their hulk ie stop suicide ganking me because theyre just pve people are propogated i used to be in that boat then there was one wardec where i finally decided that enough was enough and i was going to defend my ability to mine with my guns i had three of my corpies follow me out and we all died horribly  after the engagement though they convod me and we worked out the framework for a mutually agreeable relationship however my ceo at that time didnt like the plan so nothing came out of it i never said go to lownull for the rocks though it is an option really i want to see something that causes the miners to want to either come to trade agreements or fight with the other mining corporations in their area obviously fighting always has the risk that the miners are actually combathardened vets looking for easy kills  but then theyd dec you first probablythe prevalance of rocks is honestly a bit mortifying  its just too easy to get materials nowfair enough but what about the mission rats you can get some nice stuff running l4s yeah the solution was simply throwing an idea out there i think having fewer small corps will help with the pvp thing if for nothing more than because you will have more people around to help in case trouble starts i mean seriously a 5man indy corp has nearly zero chance in the event theres a wardec  a 25man corp might not have much of a chance but if theyre all on together ie not 3 here 4 missioning over there and no real sense of camradierie 25 frigscruisers may be able to inflict a few expensive losses on the other guywe need more pvp inroads so that players stop thinking that eve has a real split between pvp and pve content like other mmos have  like those battlegrounds in wow you lose nothing by losing except maybe trinkets or something hell in wow you dont even lose your stuff when you die  it just gets a little beat up and you fork over some isk and get everything fixed up again with no tangible lossnot sure about your comment about people simply starting to love lownull low is stupidly broken right now and pretty much worthless and ive been out of null for far too long to really know whats going on i dont want to push people anywhere in eve if people are happy with the low yields of hisec and dont want to deal with the risks of lownull for the better rewards in theory anyway then that is their perogative as far as pure pvp  eve comes pretty close or at least it used to theres much more of a walled garden feeling in hisec these days i suppose it was there when i started but my travels through null and wspace have opened my eyes to this yeah for nullsec people with alliancefunded ships and stuff i suppose there is a reduction in the feeling of crushing loss when something bad happens especially with the fact that supers seem to be a dime a dozen these days and youre also right about the rookies having trouble with isk most of this is caused by one side not being able to see things from the other sides point of view if you would have asked me these questions 3ish years ago i would have firmly been in the hisec should be safe for me to mine stop ganking me crowd i have however had the misfortune of being in a nullsec group as part of their miningindustry team which has let me see things differentlydoes this mean im out to gank newbs or wardec people for the lulz no but it does mean that i can see the reasoning behind something like the goons invasion into gallente space
sorry i have to agree we really dont want an eve wow in space  would have be called weve 
ummmm  it still wouldnt be wow is space guys  bc there would still be nonconsensual pvp everywhere just like today  and when you lose a ship you really lose it  it doesnt respawn like in wow i think its a big stretch to assume that adding consensual pvp would decrease the amount or level of nonconsensual pvp in eve  i actually think it would give ppl a taste of adrenaline so theyd want to go out and pvp for real more i just completely dont get the eve has absolutely no place for consensual pvp attitude  in a game where there is already consensual pve you choose your missions the missions are canned etc and current pvp is little more than blob warfare or derr  gankabily  you would complain about adding a new type of pvp that is no less contrived than those  and a type of pvp that is industry leading as far as what most ppl want to play  and this includes games like dust which will be essentially consensual pvp since you basically log in and start blasting the other team that gets matched to you presumablysorry just smells like fud to meand  cue the you dont get eve posts  now
yeah sds very familar  i wonder if peoples loathing to join large corpsalliances tho might have a lot to do with ppls innate willingness to avoid other ppl  i mean many ppl are naturally shy distrustful and eve doesnt help that some are lonersintroverts etc  and  10 man corps really do have something larger corps may not  a feeling of family which a lot of ppl want and which tends to die once your organization grows beyond a certain sizei actually think it might be a huge tragedy if ccp doesnt foster solo play  which a lot of hisec is actually  i didnt join eve to play with 35000 other ppl  i just joined to play alone  i bet there are plenty of other ppl like me  yeah the bitter vets can complain that its not designed to be a solo game or htfu  join a large nullsec alliance already whatever  the fact is its just not going to happen because a heck of a lot of ppl just dont like thatthere are parts of eve you just cant play solo other parts you can  and why cant that be ok as long as the eve universe is big enough to support all types of play  yeah  theres no reason eve battlegrounds would have to be like wow tho  other than providing a matchup system  eve could still keep its supposed harshness tho pvp to the big nullsec guys really is the same as wow since they probably could lose 1000 ships and still not feel a dent in their moon mining incomeagreed yeah  the great lows that are possible also leave room for great highs  iow if you didnt allow goons to do their ice blockade  you also couldnt allow some other major coalition of good guys to say completely blockade them out of hisec etc or do some other incredible feat of gamesmanship that no other game system can allow 
it was designed as pure pvp the game has changed didnt you notice that ccp is in financial trouble thats not just because of incarna its that the paying masses of 75 high sec players are fed up of beeing ganked
well that article certainly isnt filled with assumptions and tinfoil
on the upside you can profit greatly from assumptions and tinfoil
ehhh what the information is already there right below the locked target im simply asking for a different presentation what are you actually not supporting
bleh bleh on my part
you will be pleased to know that strip miners now have noise on singularity go try em out there are catches though there is a distinct startup noise a distinct stop noise and an operational hum the lasers will be restarted any time the orientation of the asteroid changes too much so youll get a series of stopstarts as each laser in turn restarts as part of the process then when the asteroid is depleted you get the usual asteroid is depleted voice along with all three stop noises happening together which makes the sound a little louder and the disappearance of the operational humthe operational hum isnt quite as loud as the previous strip miner noise but i found that i could make it prominent by placing the camera between the exhumer and the asteroid such that the lasers were going through the plane of viewbut dont take my word for it head over to singularity and try it out for yourself
if you have custom ship textures then well need to make new models for most of the shipstake a look at the megathron navy megathron vindicator and kronos they are basically the same hull painted different colorsso you wouldnt be able to tell the difference between a pink mega and a pink vindicator so for example the macharael does not look like any other minmitar battleship hullnew models would be kind of cool now i will support this idea except for the microtransacion parti know eve is ccps cash cow i just wish they didnt treat the player base like the udderi honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
this basicallyi have been clamouring for customizeable ship colours on the old boards for years i stopped last summer the thought of needing to pay extra for a basic feature such as this in a subbased game is simply ridiculous and instantly took away any interest i had in it aside from that according to a recent video blog custom ship colours are coming as part of the socalled v3 initiative that redoes all current ship models started out with the scorp a while ago and allows them to modify ship colour easily on a shader level i guess model distinction will be upheld through those same shadersgood news that but if they go the nex store way i sure as hell hope therell be an option to turn off display of this sad travesty
ive only spent a small portion of my eve life living and working in low secmuch of that time i never really felt threatened weather i was doing industry related things or missioning its lowsec i know for a fact that theres something fundamentally wrong with that even as indy person i expect more pew and danger then that in low seci hope some of these changes if implemented will help with that
also the instant obsolescence of seven years worth of documents blogs videos bookmarks podcasts notes and memories there are a lot of routes i know by heart renaming half the systems because some people find them hard to pronounce would mean that id have to relearn those routes and unlearn the old ones that would confuse me
im pretty sure theyd update automaticallyi certainly dont support renaming those systems that have funny but sensible empire names i still do mind the random names in 00  how about allowing corporations to suggest a name for a system that hasnt got one yet once they have held sov and an outpost in the system for 6 months or more and built some upgrades ccpd still have to check names for appropriateness
or we could just stick with what we have because its fine plenty of ways to get around mispronunciation have already been given
most 00 players i know are as attached to our system names as highsec players are to jita
i guessed as much  actually lets get rid of both nao ott i wouldnt want to force anybody to rename their home but i imagine it could be an incentive for space holders that invest into upgrading their space to leave a mark so to speak
i have been zipping around low sec and 00 for many years and either using the first three letters broadcasting has never failed me if i am unable to get it 1st time i just ask the fc for a repeatnot supported
yup still have fond memories of getting the  kicked out of me in nol and jl  spent some time in 1dh toofor those of you who care  nolm9 and jlpx7 cant remember the rest of 1dh off hand though havent been there in years but still have the names burned into my memory
bump because im stubborn
its a good idea and i even like the secret auction part of it i would like to see a healthy competition with other missioners and have agents only spawn so many missions every hr at given intervals this will help spread missioners out and will also make planning multiple missions viable in a single system i would also like to add that multiple mission arcs be made in to mini epic arcs and have the difficulty ramped up on those missions maybe to be like mini incursions where youd need 23 people to be able to survive iti would also like to see incursion like mission spams where a constelation might have an angel invasion and missions in that area increase in frequency and intensity spawning only angel kill missions drawing more missioners to that areai would like to see having kill missions spawning on lowsechisec 0107 fringe systems making the harder kill missions in lowsec only level 5s while the easiest are only found in highsec level 12s mining and hauling missions trading between the higher sec 0810 with the random acception for greater rewardschanges like this might make me actually want to try to mission again dynamic pve would be so much more excitingnote always copy your post before pressing the buttonmmos come and go but eve remains garresh
quick side note to the silent auction it must have a max payout listed in the mission discription interface so that players dont super overbid in the hubs also i can see a massive ability to grief missioners by bidding 1 isk on every mission so that you get every mission in a system any ideas to fix this if not the silent auction will have to go and itll be first come first servemmos come and go but eve remains garresh
i like the basic idea of mission distribution like the games freelancer and the x seriesi dont like the idea that the one who clicks faster gets a mission let it stay on a per player base and everything will be fine
why not but i think missions on the board might not have to be recognizeable as epic ones before accepting instead players might encounter some kind of complication on the mission that allowed them to branch into an escalated epic mission conventional agents on the other hand would still offer epic missions as part of the storytelling and factional advancement they offerwhile it makes sense to spawn certain mission types selectively just as difficulty and rewards should be adjusted to system sec id rather see the likelyhood of such missions being spawned increased in those locations there should always be a chance to get lucky and find an atypical type of missiondifficultyreward missions on the boards always show payout and maybe a bonus for expediency as well as a collateral the collateral is subtracted when you offer your bid and payed back either if someone else has outbid you for or at successful completion your default bid is the payout offered in the mission but you can bid to do the mission for a lower reward if you want to do the mission for no reward you may do so expect rewards in that station to go down significantly if players complete missions for freethis should really not be much of a problem idle bidding is discouraged by the collateral and the fact that you can only have a limited number of active missions while they can be aborted you lose the collateral and incur a standings loss and aborted missions return to the board right awayof course teh goonz can and will grief that but they will only be able to do so very locally as missioneers are not in any way restricted in moving to another stationsystemconstellation indeed they will have to move about in order to maximize their profits more interestingly pirates might keep track of accepted missions especially highcollateral ones with valuable cargo at a station and set up ganks correspondinglyindeed forum slaps me soundly every time i forget
thats actually why i included the bidding option it brings a certain competition to mission running but avoids depending success on faster clicking instead missioneers will compete by undercutting each other as it should be
problemwhen you have the client stretched over multiple monitors certain windows end up split between the monitor and players are unable to move them for example the options window when you push escape is straddling the two monitors making it hard to use and read also windows such as the damage notification texts or were going to destroy you kos messages end up in unfavorable positionsproposed solutionhave these unmovable windows adjust with the center of camera for instance i run the client on two monitors i have my camera centered in the right one with my overview and all sorts of other windows in the left one these problem windows should shift to the right along with the center of my camera
simple requestadd tier one battleships to maraudersadd tier two battleships to black opst1 marauders ships like the dominix are amazing ratters damage type versatility etc navy domi is a great examplet2 black ops i dont know  frigs and cruisers both have 2 hulls why not battleships t1 for utility  bridge t2 for damage  warp cloakedui 3 logisticsu pilot of all t2 logi and my shiny archon deceased also a chimera which may or may not be horrid i dont make games i play them i get that ppl are passionate about change i post here to plant seeds you see your idea as is holy  you win so lets post and see what the devs and our peers use
why
fore easier carebearing in 00 what else there is no role for additional bos or marauders if there was in first place and ccp pointed that out
they already are scannable cosmic signatures in highsec the lowsec statics make lots of sense frig pvp enthusiasts use them constantly and they really are last remaining bastion of lowsec frig fightingseylinn and oicx in particular are hotspots for frigate fighting in plexes
thisthere is no need to remove it there is a lvl 4 now where you can enter pocket 2 only with a keymake it bound key to that one gate not transferable dont let a keyholder respawn as long there is someone in the whole plex either staging area or final pocket dont make the final target respawn in the final pocket as long there is someone escalate the final room if someone is staying in there for longer then 10 minutes or so after taking out the final target  like with 25 cruisers at once make the spawn of keyholderfinal pocket random  as it now seems people stay in there on perma running shields turning on their alarm clock and come back after 90 minutes or so for the final spawn and its good
since these are meant to be new player experiences why cant ccp build in a system that only players under x days old can enter them make it like the ship restrictions you get in ded plexes
one of my fellow explorers has a route that takes him through past six of these places and he has timers for each so that he knows just when to arrive to get the respawnmore randomization would be a good thing in eve
make it so and ffs dont make them spawn right after dt  randomize them thoroughlyotfloppie what happened to your character picture

one of the most interesting parts of this game compared to other games is exploration and the implementation of various and realistic rare phenomena at space that you can explore at your own risk getting the feeling youre truly lost in space one thing that makes it really interesting is the worthy stuff you find there but i think the most atractive part of these sites is that they pose a challenge players can test themselves at them specially at whs but the biggest challenge of living in space is the environment itself you may be at the strongest ship ever built in an epic battle against others but if just a nearby star decides to go supernova youre screwed if an area is dominated by exotic radiation no stargates or cynos can lead you there youd probably die instantly if you could go thats what happens with some named regions of the eve star mapthis is when i encountered violent wormholes and spatial rifts at mission sites for if you dont know what they are these are their descriptions violent wormhole though the wormhole seems stable the exotic radicals pouring from the tear imply that using it would be catastrophic spatial rift a natural phenomena that rumour says will hurtle those that come too close to faraway places wary travelers stay away from them as some that have ventured too close have never been seen againthose are both large collidable objects but apart from their nice looking they dont interact with you except forthe violent wh which damages you over time so i though they could be mixed with the natural challenge idea and heres itthese objects suggest they lead to a very dangerous place due to their nature so they could be found through scanning as cosmic signatures fitting into the unknown type you can find them as you find normal whs you can jump through them but on the other side youll find a very different kind of whspace one which is dominated not by sleepers or pirates but by natural dangerous phenomena in the map these unsafe systems would be the proximities of black holes pulsars or very active nebulae or just spaceripping rifts youll be saying those are already at whspace and do interact with you which is right but not realistic if a small laser turret can kill you why not a whole star pouring radiationyou could find these dangerous places though violent wormholes that wouldnt hurt you by themselves andor spatial rifts for added variety each of them could lead to differet kinds of unsafespace for example violent whs would lead to systems dominated by black holes pulsars and would be harder sites while spatial rifts could lead to interstellarintergalactic space dominated by emptyness but also by hardhitting nebulaecold or whatever designers were inspired to add these sites could be easier but could also be the contrary both sites would be single systems and could be found at known and wh space no unsafespace web like with whs as them spatial rifts and violent whs could dissapear eventually but inside these sites new ones would be opened like happens inside wh space leading to who knows could be known or wh spaceso after that wall of text what would be the point of risking your ship there well there you could find even rarer ores deep space ice gas lost devices substances or even being able to do sun mining that would be getting antimatterdark matter generated near these active objects this part has been suggested at another topic in the meanwhile your ship would be affected by the environment in various forms apart from just getting damaged over time examples asteroidsice storms were the smaller the ship the lesser the chance of being hit radiation pools were tank is required or even black holes truly sucking you etc different loadouts and fitting would be required at each location adapting to the challengesif natural resources are good enough im liking the sun mining thing more and more players could stablish their pos there if these systems never close only the ways inside nullsec rules would also apply there for idUFFFDf someone wants a even more epic battlefor ending the point of this stuff is to make players not feel like the kings of space since space itself is always above them while atracting them with worthy things adding the new nebulae would look even betterwell thats all please let me know what you think what youd like what you wouldnt etc fly safe 
other factorsnot conductive to my preferred playstylelow sec empty boring no markets to speak of not worth the troublenull sec membership requiredthats my perception i might be wrong of course
too few options for lonewolf play  that includes the use of second accountsnecessity is the plea for every infringement of human freedom it is the argument of tyrants it is the creed of slaves  william pitt
this idea isnt a complete writeoff but your proposals of how this would be implemented and the type of commands you would issue is far too complex in some cases it even undermines the functionality of the game in a crewdriven environment which i can see eve steering into wayway down the line at some point this functionality may even be a massive benefit here is a concept of spaceship command that i think you are trying to convey
plus imo it would deepen immersion making the player a bit more like the ingame podpilots who are directly jacked into their shipsin addition to the need for disabled assistance as mentioned before there are other health and safety aspects  think of how much carpal tunnel this would prevent and yes ive used siri and yes it is cumberson but still helpful especially when multitasking such as when flying a spaceshipthe accuracy of voice recognition isnt just good now  its fracking awesome  in a loud room lots of noise both apple and windows phone voice recognition get it right 98 of the time now for methe hooks would need to be built into the game of course  not like dragon naturally speaking or a generic control interface bots maybe theyll use it  but they already do have their hooks directly into the data streamdont really like the idea of setting up macros since eve doesnt allow that and it would change the game  but simple commands equivalent to mouse commands yeah that would be cool in my book
want to make low sec more enticing to high sec increase the gate guns damage by about 50 guaranteed success to get high sec people into low sec more often and will probably end up browsing the beltsexploring more often in low sec in the processpeople being able to easily tank the gate guns in a 04 system and able to do a large gate camp on said gate makes me not want to go into low sec unless im specifically in the mood for a fight which doesnt happen often since it also means im ready to lose a ship
ccp has stated that it will be tweakingrevamping faction warfare soon enough this is one of the largest defining elements of lowsec space with an improved faction warfare model which yes lets you pvp militia targets without penalties we can hopefully see some of the highsec players divvy up their allegiances a little and find new life breathed into lowsec
when is the next csm election and what are the current rules for participation as a voter and or as a candidate
and i am completely against your idea of renaming systems because you dont know how to read nuff said pat least i didnt put in the idea of one of my corpmates to include nipples through shirts and wet tshirt contests in stations
i never said the systems should be renamed    maybe youre thinking of someone elsenuff said
i ammy apologieslol you know how to read better than me it seems
saint john i wouldnt know
this thread needs a bump it is one of the few threads on these forums that is actually worth the space it takes on the forum server
since leaving a corp or alliance to escape a war dec is legal i dont see why it should not apply when it comes to saving towers as long as its done a way that is legal and within the rules of the game
i gather concordokened insurance payouts are rumored to be gone from sisi while im aware there may be ways around this get killed before concord arrives for one how  if at all  would this affect the proposed bounty systemalso bump  shouldnt let this one rot on page two anytime soon
shouldnt affect the proposal at all the shipmodules destroyed payout stands at 25 because of altkilling insurance which isnt affected by the sisi change thats the only impact insurance has on it
who here doesnt know that tech 2 salvage only comes from1 tech 2 ships2 faction ships one out of a dozen or hundred of nullsec spawns3 officer ships many people have never seen these in years of playing the gameyea they are allot rarer any pubes take them down recently for salvagingmaking tech 1 salvage turn into tech 2 would decrease supply of one for the other and bring prices much closer to one another
this could use some more visibility i think
i support this it gel into the current system of repairing a player with global flag making you flagged toocome on csm its about time this was fixed
bumping for awesomenesshopefully the pos changes this winter make this thread obsoleteonly time will tell
i agree with you that eve needs to provide opportunities for solo play in both pvp and pve as there are a lot of people who like to do things on their own be independent or whatever you want to call it trying to force people who enjoy this play style into joining up with other people probably wont work so all you can really do is provide opportunities for them to do things with others if they feel like it and maybe incentives for doing so for me personally i spend my time in a mixture of solo and group play  im happy to run missionsexplorewhatever by myself but will join up with fleet roams incursions or mining ops every so often when i have the time and inclinationnow im afraid im still going to have to disagree on the arenasmatched pvp system for me having ccp implement such a system still goes against the sandbox and the lore of the galaxy if its something players want i still believe they they players should create it by forming their own corpsorganisations to implement it again im going to point to rvb as an example of people already doing this sort of thingone of the things that i really dont like about an arenabattleground system is that it would make it too easy to find fights too easy yeah you heard me a big part of pvp currently is the process of finding opponents or prey or victims  the process of intel gathering scouting scanning roaming  the decision of how to act on that intel and what to do when new intel comes in the point is that you generally have to expend some effort in order to find fights that youyour fleet can manage of course pvp sometimes comes to you but then its the other side that has put the effort in to track you down and of course the fight is now on their terms  or is it  i fear that if getting pvp fights becomes too easy  just a case of joining the nearest battlegroundarena queue and waiting your turn  that a lot of real galaxy pvp will wither and die especially the intelscouting side something i really enjoy doing btwits my belief that the plexes in faction warfare were intended to promote some of the more balanced pvp that people are looking for when they bring up arenas by restricting fights to certain classes of ships im not totally against these as you still have to look for a complex thats occupied scout out the occupying force to ensure its manageable gather intel to ensure that a reinforcement gang isnt waiting in the next system to spring a trapi guess my point is that pvp in an arena happens in a bubble  there are no consequences to it apart from the loss of a ship theres very little effort required to find the fight no scouting or intelgathering required and no chance of aything unexpected happening reinforcements for either side traps thirdparty involvement etc in short none of the things that make eve pvp so varied interesting and unpredictable
people who say eve is pvp and will always be did you ever consider it is mainly that way because the people who didnt like that fact quit while cfo is trying to save the ship in a competitive market of evergrowing mmos they need to do something that can at least somewhat appease both sides pvpers should be able to pvp if they want as well as people who dont want to shouldnt have to telling people if they dont like it then dont play is the mentality that has gotten ccp to these subscription numbers
if the amount of stupidity present in your post had mass it would collapse into a black hole and suck the entire universe in with it
actually no the game being what it is is what got ccp to the subscription numbers they have now them not developing the game for 18 months is what caused that number to go down a bit from their peak
get the hell out of my sandbox punk
while both of these are true on some level the trouble with it is in doing things like this its stupidly hard to get things done and continues to lead to the feeling that ccp needs to cater to these small fish groups more if the intention of the game was to foster hundreds of small corporations there wouldnt be skills in the game to allow for corporations in the thousands while yes i was saying that having so many small indy corps was a bad thing i dont necessarily have a problem with small corps in general i do agree they can be quite fun its the were the 10 pilots of super awesome mining corp inc and we demand that everyone leave us alone to mine in peace mentality that small corporations usually foster i have a problem with now if sa mining 510 man mining corp looked arount their system and then started working with alpha team combat division 510 man pvp corp and dynamic heavy industries 510 man industrial corp to secure their system from interlopers say rock bashers mining and omega squad things are better for everyone sa mining gets to mine fun for them dynamic heavy industries gets a reliable source of minerals maybe even a little below market more profit  more fun for them and alpha team gets reliable deliveries of cheaper ships more splosions  more fun for them the player interaction amongst these three corporations has just led to more fun and safety for everyone involved and what they can accomplish now is significantly greater than what the three corps could do individually eve is a mmorpg if you want an engagingrewardingeasy solo game youre playing the wrong game its that simple hearing i want to play alone and i dont want to hear anyone say this is wrong is no different than someone complaining that the other team is shooting them in dust or battlefield or call of duty yeah this is a bit blunt but you knew that this was a multiplayer game when you downloaded the trialthat isnt to say there are not things that can be done solo  but that solo players shouldnt expect to get nearly as many nice things as the people who want to work togetheryou want a matchup or arena system go make it why does ccp have to give us everything why cant the players build it themselvesyeah yeah the alliance tournament is put on by ccp  but it is a completely different beast in that it is an annual production and winning actually means something to those who are involvedas for moongoo youre assuming that the grunts on the frontlines have access to the isk that is generated sure alliances will help their guys out same goes for corps but the assumption that the grunts on the frontlines have access to all the alliances wealth is simply flawed losing 1k ships is still a blow  even more so if they dont have 1k ships in reserve because now they need to get new ones which means shipping in minerals or shipping in hulls both of which bring the risk of getting caught in a freighter by the other guys
i do like the idea of the sandbox principle but it also has its flaws while many peoples sandbox is wanting to mine and be left alone there really is no option to make that happen in said sandbox therefore it cant be shaped that way
what
miner mining wanting no fight cant happen in sandbox understand
not fighting absolutely can happen in eve for miners or industrialists they just have to find a system with a low population if you choose to mine in a system with 100 neutral pilots thats your prerogative you do not have to mine there in a relatively risky system but you choose to  ie you getting ganked was your own faultwhat miners and industrialists to a degree have to realise is that they are the grease in the larger industrialmilitary machine that eve is as has been pretty well shown by the goons in their recent escapades into gallente space it is very easy to throw a spanner into the works and cause the machine to grind to a halt that hundred million tritanium you just sold to someone will be used to manufacture weapons that will be used to cause someone potentially you to explode
only real solution i can think of is giving cloaks a fuel bay that can only be filled in stations or ship maintenance bays the afk cloaking will likely be addressed someday but i wouldnt count on it being soon seriously rat in fleets and run different anoms at the same time if your that concerned about cloaky mcafk sure someone is losing some iskhr and another is gaining but why are you in 00 with other people if your not willing to play the game with them
so covertly jump into a jammed system and not so covertly blow up the jammer to not covertly bring in an invasion fleet
look dude youre really barking up the wrong tree with your own assumption in regards to fail and youre not the first carebear to think he was intellectually special and expect special courtesy on the forums or in game your simple pot shots of wit you think are so clever gains you nothingsince youve misunderstood as others have tried to make you understand is that this game is pvp focused it has freedoms unlike any other game it never once proclaims itself a place where we can all get along they wanted the space is a cold unforgiving place that you can do anything survive adapt endure profit out courtesy for newcomers many warnings and tutorials were placed to teach and make players awarei could really care less about your lack of experience yet those with such little experience cant possibly expect a game thats been around so long to up and change many long standing game mechanics just for a certain unexperienced player cause his opinion is far more intellectually advanced really you dont just need a welcome to eve line insert here i add welcome to reallity when you produce something with actual thought behind it for a benefit to gameplay of everyone ill give you a listen so far for someone that professes intellect you certainly are narrow mindedps i would hardly call my record pvp fail so keep an eye out on local cheers dude 
ccp makes money off people who hear about 1000 battles and sov fights and people collapsing alliances with spies not people who hear about mining or running missions while reading a book
my thoughts on hisec are here
the award for the biggest retard in this thread clearly goes to youoverall besides the flaws the have been pointed out over and over which need fixing empire could profit a lot from making it more dynamicincursions are a great example they are not fixed in an location and encourage interactionrivalry between players their only downside is probably that the rewards are too high compared to the risks but thats not the topicthe idea someone posted about granting rights for various things in a system to corporations or alliances sounds like an incredible good idea if implemented well a thing like this would probably work even better for faction warfare it would add a player driven dynamic of which few enough currently exist in highsec but then thats currently one of the few things that draws people into 00 so if that comes to hsls as well thats one less reason for people to go into 00
after reviewing you pvp record i would certainly not call it fail impressive number of solo kills which in my small mind is what demonstrates superior game play when compared to most who whine the loudest here in the forums when i research them i see 10 to 20 people involved in the vast majority of their kills even 2 people to pod a capsule you i will keep an eye out for in local id be stupid not to but to the others who need 7 8 or 9 of their swarm around  they are no threat because id notice them long before they could rally the courage to do anything i just have no respect for cowards an i openly admit iti hope we have many good fights cordo and that i eventually eek out a slight advantage in the you vs me
i want to thank the academy for this award  having it presented to me by the person is was named after made it so much more special
no those are highly specialized characters with monthyears of training but ccp is condemned to grow and that you can do only if you dont concentrate on one type of player mining or running missions sounds boring to one but for some player who cant commit themselfs for more then 34 hrsweek thats all they can afford its like in politics with 5000 people you maybe can have a very strict opinion of something if you grow and have now 5000000 peoples needs to you have groups of different interests and you need to find a common program
a few points though most have already been mentionedwardecs  really need sorting out since the gms have walked away from the issuemissions  needs more variety and branching storylinesinsurance  its absurd that its paid for criminal acts anyone killed by concord should forfeit paymentstock exchange  iirc ccp looked at this in the early days though nothing exver came of itbounties  sellable kill rights or private contract for a pod killsmuggling  high riskreward might help bring some life back to lowseclowsec in the early days used have a number of communities like villages almost set up in small pockets and the corpsplayers would keep their area clean of pirates or sometime the reverse if set up by pirates perhaps space is too crowded now to make this work and cap fleets can quickly roll over any oppositionthe lowsec problem is that if itUFFFDs made too lucrative the nullsec alliances will simply expand their boundaries on the other hand if itUFFFDs not profitable enough why should anyone from highsec go there except for pvp perhaps as an experiment some lowsec systems could have a permanent cyno jammer in place to tempt some smaller corps to set up operations
i have don it now for an extended time and the more i did changing mining in high sec would indicate changing it from the scrapso why not change mining all together letUFFFDs take a look on the economy of the game from the understanding of a selfsufficient player driven economy circle the game is pillared on 1 mining ore pi moon recycling2 production3 market for the sole purpose to supply in one or other way 4 pvp some call a sandbox i rather call it an economic simulation placed in hostile environment set the notations beside letUFFFDs focus on 1 mining in the relevance of a selfsufficient player driven economy the retrieve of raw materials i combine here moon mining planetary interaction and ore mining under the terms of rme raw material extraction whether this is form moon materials pior ore mining i explicitly leaf out rme trough recycling drones and modules as it would well exceed the size of the proposala brief history of ore mining in the gamein 2003 it seems appropriate for a new game to adapt to the general play style of almost any mmp games at the time with some sort of mining the economy of eve evolved during the last 8 years and being more dedicated to other materials than the basic ore miningto my consideration and in the progress of economical evolving the present ore mining has become outdated and therefore obsolete i focus hereby strict on the cost investment maintenance and reward point of viewcost reward scheme 1moon mining low and 00 high cost 2 pi all median to low cost 3ore mining all low cost with pi you set up your factoryUFFFDs and take in the profit with no risk to the installationwith ore mining there is just an initial expense of the exhumer and nonother than a gank as for pi there are possible implements on the way to rise the ristcost factor which will give it a more realistic place within the simulation sandbox by private owned custom offices and a possible role in a future dust involvement leaves mining ore as a classic rme with only some little changes ever since however it contains no real cost factor to run a mining operation and take the profit no fuel cost exept the rouqual the other factor is ore mining as today can be done semi afk ore full afk which is not in the sense of the game however the action of mining itself commands doing it in afk moode or at least semi afk even the godfather of mining halada postulated in his well lauded mining guide UFFFDstaring for a sustained time on the mining laser will have you end up in the psych wardUFFFD he was seriouse on itwhilst two of the rmeUFFFDs moon mining and pi are for a good reason mostly automated processes ore mining isnUFFFDt but should be as a side effect a bot on a moon pos a bot on a pi installation are obsolete and ineffective as the material retrieving processes is already automated and only need attention requirement to restart the process of course you can place a bot to do some steering but as for pi the available resource amount change and therefore require player attention similar could apply to ore mining a proposalno more asteroid belts in any system as known player driven mining and refining colonies the source1 ore belts around a complete planet and not just some rocks somewhere in a system once mined the roids respawn on incalculable time and size some death nuts are amongst them2 ore asteroids are of significantly size revealing its ore similar to pi i prefer 1 as better since there already is pi the equipmenta pos similar mining colony means with the profit coms the expense the excavators are operated from the mining pos small medium and large determine the amount of excavators yes they can be installed on high sec planets with a significantly lower resistance than a low sec or 00 miningcolony they are simpler to set up and faster to be demounted as the regular pos and as such more mobile the calculationbase calculation can be the amount mined by any human operated vessel in the belt for a max of 2 hr i personally think this is the max time one can pay attention to it without slipping in some sort of hypnosis afk mining is not considered in estimation 8000mUFFFD volumes could be the amount of one excavator for 24hr as the excavator can run just like a moon harvester or a pi installation adjustable from one to 24 hr the miningcolony can be upgraded to do refining jobs the excavators run on time by damage just like mining cristals new player modussince mining is a source of income for new playerscivilian mining excavators with a loading capacity of 600mUFFFD24hr ore shall be transported to player owned mining colonies for refining or saled dirctely on the market i expect the fast majority of the mining community will dismiss this proposal but again i do believe attention should be paid to the fact any action in the game supporting afk and watch your favored tv show in the meantime is not what the game is design for any action within the game obsoleting the request of direct attention is an open door for botting and thus should be left to automated processes in first place assumable big alliances will not go for this proposal just as they state unanimously they donUFFFDt have any bots running in their hidden 00 systems but it is illusive to buy into this argument the temptation is just too big so more time to actually play the game and lifting ore mining in a more realistic market situation equal to moon mining and future pi on a second thought may even attract to a better use of low sec
tengen saninteresting ideas you have voiced here having mined for longer then 2 hours in a large grav site and belts in general initially i think your extracted ore amount is far to lowputting all the ore around 1 planet would just increase ganking and miners are not going to be in favor of that at all i would suspect the easy way in which ice fields have been interdicted proves that beyond a doubtmore mobile mining pos is an interesting concept but most miners are not going to set up a pos for 30 minutes before they can mine for just 2 or 3 hours not very reasonable or practical now an ore belt that encompassed an entire system like a ring where you had to keep moving to target with scanning skills rocks worth mining would increase player interaction while not concentrating miners into nice neat little target clusters and would make it far more difficult to automatemining was one of the first group activities i participated in in eve and it created lasting bonds why that is reviled in an mmo eludes meseems like a rorqual with a temporary force field projector that burned fuel could accomplish a lot of what a more mobile pos could be tasked to do because this might actually stimulate more group play i wonder were the howls of no way are going to come fromsomehow a roving band of orcas hulks retrievers and race specific mining frigates destroyers and cruisers would be a site to see with a rorqual trailing behind them or in the center of the mining op to process and compress the ore seems like a move in the right direction to reduce the bot ability to out mine humans and to get players to fly their rorquals outside of their pos forcefields while interacting with more playersi think your idea has merit but i am not sure the plus will out weigh the minus without careful calculationof course i would implement this ability in all segments of space from high sec empire to null including wh space
i like the sound on the test server  sounds like something out of a factory great mining sound imo
dont pay for it then let other people waste their money
no itll make the server work harder for no good reason provide no benefit to players and will make this game look well stupid
disclaimerthis is not a good old day threadi never did much nano during the time i mostly flew locus zealots 60km pulses were winthis wont be a return to 10k sacreliges or 17k machariels taking no missile damagethis thread asumes that t2 is a good thing or at least more people flying it is a good thing becausea it gives old players reason to spend isk and use there sp b gives new players something to aim forc this will create more reason to fly different types of gangi imagine this will create much whining but here is why i think t2 and cruiserfrigs need a balanceat the moment there is a massive blur between battlecruisers and ships in smaller hull sizes this has lead to the fotm being drakes and hurricanes as im sure you have all noticed they are too good at killing takle and too powerful vs heavy assault ships guardians and zealots with afterburners sig tanking is what weve been reduced too and i rarely even see that these daysthere are few t2 ships that can really beat bcespecially drakes as medium range has become king the battlefield has become greatly shortened as pure speed died the inability to cover allot of ground quickly is gone new combat probes also add insult to injury to this problemi belive medrange ships definatly have there role just as they did during nano but a greater mix of fleet comps is desperately needed to breathe a bit of life to pvp in eveso number one instead of giving web bonus improve webifiers as a whole giving them 20 boost in strength re yay gallente and huggins this will make very closerange ships more viable as they have more pure takling power in combination with the new scrams this would be a very powerful combination aswell as better disrupting guardian blobs and suchsecondly increase speed of all cruiser hulls by 20 give t2 mwds 5 more speed and faction10 also make faction nanofibres add more agility and faction overdrives add an extra 1 speed people will spend isk for stupidly small bonuss give destroyers and below 25 increase in speedlast but not least give interceptors back there role as fleet warpins recreate the most enjoyable and exiting role interceptors have had charging towards 200 man sniper bs fleet with hope by nerfing combat probes making the scan time roughly 5 mins or so max skilled people running anoms and such will still be easily catchablewhat this means in real termsa single nano vagabond will go from rougly 2700 ms to 3400ms before overload fully faction fit around 3770ms a dual nano crow gistii fit will go from 4560 to 5536 before overload drakes will still be vastly powerful and viable as will sig tanking logistics will have a much tougher role of staying in range of fleet bringing back the days of pulling people away from guardians and such quickly and making scimitar piloting  hard but funnegatives i can see finer balance issues need to be adressed but i think they need to be adressed anyway reserved for peoples issuesthis does not adress the issue of commandships which i think is more a case of pure boost but thats for another thread as is offgrid bonus and suchrage button on
i like nano shipsgood times
increase scan time to 5 minutes thats pretty ridiculous and needs some serious justification i think your trying to limit the ability of a fleet to quickly warp on top of another fleet but i think your suggestion is way out of line perhaps increase it to 30s scan time but not 300s that just eliminates combat scanning wouldnt increasing the minimum warpto distance from 150 to 250 be better although a lot of people would find their gate tacs useless as for your speed boost i agree that the speed difference between bs bcs cruisers and even frigs could use a review but that is massive game changing stuff and needs to be done carefully i honestly think the speed boost from an ab should be larger but the speed nerf of a web needs to be more pronounced mwds are moreless balanced
did you think that response through at all how are they going to autoupdate spreadsheets and youtube videos
tell you what sir you come up with a list of what 2000 unique names for all the systems in eve that are all easy to pronounce and ill fully support this idea please post your list here so we can all see them i expect to see something by wednesday  iella
or the names we give themfor example nearly everyone in irc refers to 4lnem as four line its not hard to say and everyone knows what you mean including the nonnative english speakers ebyos is referred to asebay by most of my corpmates though in alliance fleets its normally just ebhonestly it doesnt matter what the name is as long as everyone you need to communicate with knows it by that name names are an arbitrary human convention pick one and stick with it
following that convention  i remember tparg  being referred to as trap never flew there myself though
sorry i guessed i made the part i was referring to clear by underlining it in your quote i was lazy and apparently wrong
made a random i wish in another thread where that was all people were doing and it was suggested i post as a proposal so here goes8posted 20111102 2257  report2to join the general how i like to play i would like to be able to rent a system from the factions pop in a station drop a few poss on the moons stick some custom houses on the planets and do my care bear thingfor the rent id like some faction police about with options for pirates and thats pvp players to evade them but make it hard and allow me to build up the gate defences also would need minimum faction standing of say sec status 5 to rentmaybe even increase sec status if numbers grow and peace becomes the norm in a system but that needs space to grow with new systems in null as well not to happen in faction war areas though where while that needs work should be for the militias to fight it outyes ill need to run the gauntlet moving my goods yes i wont be as safe as hi sec yes at first ill be raising a big kick me sign for all local roaming gangs but so what it would be fun and give me a path to null
if youre aiming for null why not just rent some null spaceanything that brings npcs in to look after space youre claiming for yourself is bad you want it you defend it
another post where the op is simply stating his how i want to play unfortunately you have to look at the bigger picture and think about how other players are playing the game eve is not a system defense game you cant just build a nest somewhere throw some isk around and expect everyone to fly around you whilst you do your awesome thing and if every high sec player did this the game would need thousands of extra lowsec systems like the poster above me is saying join and alliance get some contacts talk to people and rent a system in null that is what my corp and alliance is doing at the moment and it took a long while to sort out but this is what eve is all about collaboration its not just about making the game awesome for solo highsec capsuleers with too much isk and not enough risk
nice to see the expected comments what i want and yes if you read the post it was me commenting somewhere else on a how i want to play post is a stepping stone out to null and no i dont want to join some massive established alliance or pay rent when in null spacei would still need to defend what i had in low sec but with some security but a lot less than concordat the moment its a cliff face drop from hi to low which is one of the reasons it is so emptyi do love the join up and become a part of a big group lines not everyone in this game wants that and those same people usually complain about hi sec care bears who never leave it all im suggesting is a way where there is more risk and some extra gain to entice smaller groups out of hi sec without something just expect hi sec to stay as it is and get busier everyday but with graduated riskreward options people would move out
soyou want npc 00 then i hear stain is nice this time of year
it has been a little while since i have been in the 00 game so can you confirm that100 now has npc naviesgate guns to help out pod pilots2 00 is no longer controlled by established alliancesseems to me that any playercorpalliances that is using npc to help them defend thier space andor doesnt want to be a part of a comp alliancenap isnt really wanting a stepping stone to 00 unless 1 and 2 have been put in the game while i was not looking
nope as i said low sec although the same could work there in npc 00 but they are generally a bit small for that and it starts getting too close to sov
well as i havent said this was sov in low sec but rather renting from a faction as a stepping stone to carry on building to move out to 00 i cant see what you are getting at00 should rightly be what you can take and hold through your own might with no convinient security force to help you hi sec is minor holdings on planets and pos with the full might of concord to protect youlow sec should allow for something in between where the sov is still the faction and supplies some security but players can control more and have to bolster the security to protect assets
1all of eve is based on what you can take and hold by your own might2concord does not protect you concord only provides consequences for the rapists3 lowsec already does what you say it should even if 1 and 2 were not true your proposal does not do what you sayby increasing npc protection you move the stepping stone closer to being high sec this means that there is a larger jump to 00 so you are not doing anyone who wants to go from high  00 any favors by making things more relative to now safenow if this is a low sec is too hard thread at least be man enough to admit it
in that case why didnt you post it as a proposal but as a random wishwith your i would like tos and maybes thrown in people here are not likely to take this seriously but as a welcome bait for trolling and namecalling i believe you might serve your idea better if you proposed a clear and concise change and illuminated what previous discussion came up with as both advantages and disadvantages that way youd let readers make an informed decision whether they want to support the proposal or notsorry if that sounds patronizing but it grates terribly how good proposals everybody agrees on end up on page 2 after a couple of days by vague ideas that are discussed heatedly
given the recent rabble against the csm we need a way to verify if an account voted or not to stop the flood of i didnt vote for csm they do not represent me threads i propose the followingwhen an account votes in the next elections they are marked as either voted abstained from voting for a candidate in consequence this will give 3 states an account can have for a period of the csm voted abstained from voting for a candidate no marker what will this changei believe this is a fair solution because people who voted will be represented by their candidate and those with no fitting representative can opt for the abstention option to show a lack of representationthis gives everyone a voice and is a huge improvement compared to the last elections because with the actual mechanics there is no chance to participate without casting a vote to someone who might end up in charge but doesnt represent youadditionally this is a huge improvement for the poor souls that deal with feedback regarding the csm and its actions because they will be able to tell if someone spend at least some time checking out the candidates or just didnt care and start whining for no reasonwho should support this proposaleveryone because space democracy only works if as many as possible participatethose that did not vote in the recent elections because they had no suitable candidate
im not sure you want to distinquish between voting for someone and voting abstain
this is intended as a marker to differentiate the between people that voted for a candidate because he bought their votes they believe in him be made great promises the ones that look through the candidates but simply dont find one suitable enough and last but not least all the ones that suddenly wake up and realize their vote might have had a meaning and now cry about how unfair it the mechanic isright now everyone can claim to not have voted because there was no option to participate without voting a candidate so people without a suitable candidate were forced to not vote at all or risk electing some moron who might end up in the csm
im just saying that not everyone wants to display that to the world if nothing else make it so its something which the user himself can choose to displayie by default dont show if anyone voted but if they so choose they can choose to show if they voted or didnt vote and if they voted choose between showing whether they voted for a person voted abstain or maybe even voted for a particular person if they so chooseotherwise chances are people are going to use this in completely unrelated discussions as a basis for ad hominem attacks
its not a bad ideai do see a problem with it in that everybody i voted for didnt win so even to me showing that i voted means jack  either wayit doesnt negatively effect me and i cannot see how it would negatively effect anybody elseso1
while i understand your thought process its one of those things that would have to be optional basically as zim described just a cautionary but imo necessary step
right now a pilot must upgrade every time after they die this is very annoying especially for the casual playersmy suggestion is to make clone upgrading be for a character and not for a specific clone this means that as long as your sp is below the sp limit you will be able to die over and over without the need to reupgradei wouldnt even object to an massive increase of the upgrade costs as compensation
let me see nope all seems correct and in order to me if anything make clones mroe expensive it would be good to know that when you kill someone the cost is high
agreed clone prices as they stand are at such a small amount that all you got to do is blow up one or two ships in a lvl 4 mission and you can afford a new one
no stop the evemailUFFFDspam
its like people dont even bother to read the op and just say whatever first comes to mindi think the overall idea is sound but i doubt it would work too well there are those that die a lot that this might greatly benefit and then there are those that die very little that this wouldnt benefit at all personally i would rather see a system in place that automatically creates the new clone when you die and automatically withdraws the money from your wallet based on the last clone you purchased and where it is located you would still have to upgrade your clones when needed and if you didnt have the money to purchase the clone then the money is not withdrawn and the clone is not created requiring you to come back and purchase the new clone laterprimarily it would be for those of us that tend to forget about our clone when we are podded thankfullynot too often since even when i do die aura on my droid phone freakes out at me every 5 minutes telling me to update my cloneto the ops idea howeveri can see another option in place leave the current clone system as is but maybe an option to buy clones in bulk say increase the cost of the clone by x10 and you get 10 clones of that level ready to go use all 10 and you gotta buy another 10 same general idea just a little more limited without breaking the current clone system that is in place this may also create more of an isk sink since there will be many people that buy 10 clones and perhaps never use them
so where can i find l4s with 5 million isk ships ps after a year doing l4s is like stabbing yourself in the eye
those are definite improvements of the current system i would be happy to see such things in place
youre obviously not having fun ever consider other games
dread pirate scarlet of course p
i support this completely i also have this problem i would be excited for this change
1 agreed
right now in jita theres no compressed ores for sale the compression efficiencies on the rorqual are terrible compared to many modules also the fact that you have to compress in lowsec or 00 is huge disadvantagei think we should push to have ccp revisit the rorqual bring the efficiencies way above any modules also perhaps consider bringing the rorqual to highsec because logistics of the whole thing being in lowsec00 is a big hamperplentiful compressed minerals on the market benefits 00
no the rorqual should never come to hiseccompression of ores is to make it easier to move them from mining location to refining location also in wspace to cram more ore into the refinery array who cares that theyre not in jita anyway
compressed ores are supposed to assist with the miners bringing more ore in less trips from point a to point b for refine no one who can consider themselves an established industry player in low or null will sell ores because they should have perfect refinegoing out of your way to sel ores on market is like trying to sell an unbuilt car on a car lot taking it further if your out in low or null with a rorqual wth are you mining to sell did no one inform you profit margins are higher to just make a finished product build some ships and sell them to corpalliancemates or on open amrket in lownull trust me plenty of fw people will be looking to buy freaking caldari and minmatar lolfit fleets suiciding deathstar poss for lulz makes a great market to sell ships in
yeah its because my bouncy boobies arent getting in the way i guess
all my characters are maleits the wife that has the female characters d
sadly it looks like ccp is going the other way judging by sisi the maximum size of busts is shrinking and the shape now looks much less natural and more like implantssigh
my immersionmycelluliteps no bouncing moobs
the intel channel would not allow players to post in it it would just say things like cearain entered minor auga frigate then when i leave it would say something like cearain exit minor auga pod they could have all the intel on who is in what plexes when you first sign in or you might have to wait either way you will find pvp 10xs faster than you can nowi like the map idea  if the map worked well however my map always cause major slow downs and crashes in my computer also there shouldnt be too much of a delay i dont like alts too much so requiring a bunch of scouting is not really my thing the idea should be that there are so many fights spread out that there are just constantly pilots jumping in plexes as fast as they can not the slow ass scout out the enemy form a fleet and then have them dock and ship bs that happens now btw having this intel channel or map system would make it so spys would be less of an issuemake faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
what about if fw plexes were bubbledno warp out zones
dont get me wrong i support the intel channel idea if its an intel channel or nothing then i would take that i just believe that the same information can be presented in a slightly more user friendly wayi also have problems with the star map what we need is something much simpler and more focused almost like dotlan but live and specific to faction warfarethe slight delay i would prefer although maybe 5 minutes is to much you see i enter plexes to provoke a fight or limit the ship classes that i have to fight and a few minutes delay means i can engage people within the current system without the hordes descending on me however if i am just sitting orbitting a timer then it should leave just enough time for someone to get too me and try to stop mei am also normally a solo pilot a little bit of the unkown is prbably good for usregarding bubbles in plexes i have seen this idea before but i feel it may put people of rather than encourage people to pvp within them and may result in a lot of sniper camping
people would probably try to sell their characters that are in the plexes because they would realize without the ability to warp it will take years to get anywhere else if you mean no one can warp out until the plex is taken that is different i think the problem there is the pvp will not have the same complexity that is involved when you have to keep someone tackled it would be a sort of dumbed down pvpmake faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
be careful what you ask for if ccp revisits the wardec system they may not just close a few loopholes but overhaul wardec mechanics entirely this may or may not be to your advantage depending on your play stylealso you forgot the biggest war dec exploit of all  hiding your iskearning high sec alts in npc corporations
quoting myself from another thread
1would make my life in the hole easier
supported
since no one brought it up in the most recent dev blog video they said they will be adding pos fuel pellets so that you combine the current pos fuels prepos and build fuel pellets which are then a generic fuel you take the pos and drop inthis will make management and planning so much easier for everyone that runs pos especially for those that run multiple
that will be nice
really simple with destroyers getting reduced signature radii they are basically the same size as electronic attack frigates this doesnt make much sense ive seen a sentinel in space right next to a thrasher and they are not even close to the same sizeapologies of these are incorrect but last i checked the new sig rads will becatalyst 65coercer 62comorant 68trasher 56 compare these to the signature radii of the existing eafs and their t1 equivalentskeres 55 t1 maulus 48sentinel 53 t1 crucible 46kitsune 58 t1 griffin 50hyena 51 t1 vigil 44 this one is really unfair since one of the bonuses is 3 sig radius as wellplease fix this up it means these little guys which are probably the least tanked ships in the game are basically the same sie as destroyers
also boost their tank  and maybe give drone immunity to them
a reduction in their sig radius boost to speed and boost to resists would make the forgotten electronic attack ship a viable option for frigate gangs 1i am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
im just wondering does anyone else agree with the fact that we need new gms not once have i ever had a petition that i have put in resolved in my favor by a gm not only that but its weeks before i even get a response yes the gms are more than happy to tell you no give you some link to some rule that sometimes has nothing to do with the issue that you are referring to then simply copypaste prewritten scripts that all basically say i am sorry i dont care not going to help you in most other mmos the gms at least help sometimes and most other gms at least seem like they care about your issues gms here are impersonal and just dont care we are the customers for this great game i would like to hear from other players on their experiences from gms most everyone i have talked to have negative opinions of them and most agree they just dont care pilots of new eden we must unite and demand better customer service from a company that has liaisons that just paste scripts into windows and dont even want to help us the whole point of a gm team should be fairness and willingness to help players lets hear your thoughts pilots and see if your opinion of the gm team is as low as mine
i think its just you because ive had several favorable replies from the gm team including the replacement of a flight of ogre iis that ended up being left in a mission site due to a server crashi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
key steps to getting petitions resolved quickly and hopefully in your favor1 dont petition stuff that totally isnt against the rulesgonna get replaced yes we understand that youre torn up because you lost your ship because youre bad at the game or dont understand the mechanics no its not getting replaced2 dont be all uppity and insulting in your petition they just gonna ignore it for a week before cp the shittiest form response they can find and then laugh at your subsequent rage posts and demands to have it escalated3 argue your case seriously use supporting evidence precedent and examples offer proof if you can get it screenshots video whatever this part can either be incredibly easy or next to impossible due to the fact that a lot of gms are drooling morons with little understand of the game hilarious i know but its true this means that its either going to be easy to convince them with your argument or impossible as they are too stupid to grasp the points youre makingso while petitioning is totally hit or miss depending on which gm you get there are certainly steps you can take in order to maximise your chances of a good resolution
no we dont need new ones we need competent ones that can read english and actually do there jobs by knowing the mechanics of eve which 95 of them dont know anything and will just give you the same old answer of the logs show nothing
1 i agree i have never petitioned something as trivial as a ship loss i dont lose expensive ships and i dont care about the ships i do lose i can get another if its a bil or under that can be made back in a week or so2 not really uppity these gms are just idiots who seem like they dont pllay eve3 no matter what valid points i have argued most gms just dont care or understand and i totally think a cactus sitting at a computer in the middle of the dessert has a higher iq than most of these gms we need some competent gms playing people who actually play the game not just some high sec carebear who mined their whole career and got the job or some guy that was a gm on another game as for your final point as i said i havent really talked to anyone that has a good opinion of gms in eve so back to my point more customer service less idiocy and they should have some experience playing the game as a player not just a forum troll or those useless volunteer guys who chat all day in rookie chat wtb a real gm
and omg so happy that you got your ogre iis back that is so awesome im talking about real petitions not interested in some carebear who lost his drones on a mission and qqd about it
forgive me if im wrong but i thought you were supposed to be petitioning things likenot being able to join a fleet ie the game always returns that you have refused the requestare already in a fleet when you arentunable to purchase from the market for whatever reason the games says you cannot purchase that maybe it doesnt see that youre docked or it thinks youre 57 s awayunable to join chat channels the game says that your chat queue is full or we when in reality you may only have 1 chat window openthese are the kinds of things that i though you were supposed to petitionbut if you are crying to the gms yeah theres no apostrophe its plural not possessive about losing stuff the you are probably not going to get it back face it you lost it thats your own faultwhat are you petitioning about that you think it should even matter whether or not the gms play the gamethey are supposed to make sure the game is running correctly and you losing your stuff means that it is running correctlyme gets off her soapbox
i do not agree my last 4 interactions with regular gms and senior gms went very well even though in one case i didnt get what i wanted however they were quick to escalate it when i asked and the senior gm explained the central issue with my request ever since about 2 or 3 months ago they seem to have begun to coordinating their responses more effectively than in the past some of my corpmates and i even ran a test by submitting petitions under a variety of characters and accounts to see if we were getting the same response we did as long as they keep working hard to coordinate their responses im happy
i do agree that the gms are sometimes rather blunt and ignorant to many issues my best example is before maze was changed i warped in a tengu to one of the rooms this was when the rooms with 12 gates were all organized in a perfect circle my tengu dropped warp dead center of this clusterfuck of gates i got stuck no matter what i did i could not get out needless to say i was killed by the rats and lost my ship petitioned this and was told that there was nothing in the logs pretty much meaning sucks to be you what pisses me off the most about this is not only did i lose my tengu skill points expensive mods and my dignity but they  changed maze a week later to separate the gates out wtf ccp all i ask of our gms is to have some  common sense and dont think we are idiots and going to miss the obvious
the gms have been quite helpful to me the only complaint i have is that they dont always make it easy to find when they make rules changes which resulted in me getting warned for something i thought was legal because the rule change was buried in a forum thread
or the dreaded invisible agression counter that everyone knows is there and half of them get taken cared of the other half given the diplomatic fingerso yeahbut in all honestythe gms attitude is likely based on the fact 75 to 80 of the stuff they see is just utter tripeand the legitimate cases are overshadowed as a result stop the evemail spam
increase the cost of wardecs and add some sort of scaling based on the number of pilots involved in the conflict hisec wardecs are basically economic warfare so their costs should reflect that the current fees are way too cheap given how fast you can make 50m isk now with incursionsbreak the 001 isk market game in some fashion raise the fee to change an order or make the fee scale based on the total value of the market orderdo away with regionwide buy orders and make the maximum range only 20 jumps at level v more niches for the small traders to live in the marginsbreak the market hubs  maybe add higher fees for putting up market orders in the existing trade hub systems to encourage a migration to the surrounding systemsmake the security status of the system have more meaning  such as gatestation guns podding someone who enters 10 space if their security status is too low or preventing wardecs from being allowed in 10 systems unless you pay a premium fee for the wardec
the point just sailed completely over your head so let me help you outi said hear about i didnt say actually dopeople dont sign up to play eve because they can mine or run missions while reading a book they might in fact play eve that way but that sort of gameplay is not what gets eve recognition in the press or the minds of the public what actually gets people playing and talking about eve is the fact that these huge sov battles and spy shenanigans happen they are integral to keeping people signing up because they represent the public face of the game the part of it people who dont play eve talk aboutin short the maintenance of this type of gameplay is much more important to growth than any other aspect of the game this is why were getting fw changes because they represented an opportunity to expand that sort of gameplayon the other hand improving the experience when mining and missionrunning is the key to player retention since it represents the activities of most of the playerbase and while i personally have nothing against the current mission setup except the relative uselessness of l5 agents to the grand scheme of things its an idea that simply didnt work as people didnt follow them and lowsec remains as derp as it has ever been mining needs to be heavily rethought i havent seen anything in this thread that really sounds attractive so ill instead repeat my usual refrainunder the current system of mining humans should not allow humans to mine hulkageddon and the gallente ice interdiction are mercy kills its mindnumbingly boring and inane and must be somehow made more interactive and more profitable if it is to be considered a worthwhile activity as it stands the only reason its even remotely worth tolerating is because its enter beltactivate stripminersdisengage brain anytime you go disengage brain in a game something has gone terribly wrong
ngtm1r i like your insights re nullsec being the glitzy pr engine but hisec being the retention key  i disagree with you about mining being boring and repulsive however  achieving a large and efficient mining operation with max skills is quite a satisfying accomplishment to many people  more so than bored low skilled hooligans or highly skilled old bitters doing the derr warp in with our disposable noob frigates and gank that hulk will ever be  both styles reveal much about the character of those who engage in them  and in eve both are free to existimo eve is no different from basketball  some play basketball competitively nullsec and join leagues nullsec alliancessome play basketball with their friends in the parking lot just for fun hiseca competitive basketball player can come play in the parking lot with the amateurs sure old bitter gankers  but its no glory achievement and the amateurs will eventually get a clue and leave safe dockthe competitive players are what people watchthe parking lot games are what most people playwhy not keep both happy
you cant1 a large segment loves the sandbox and thats why they signed up to eve2 another segment signed up to eve but wants segregation which is the very antithesis of the sandboxthe question is why did 2 bother to sign up to a sandbox game if all they wanted were private sandpits
assuming not using drones they die horribly fast and are slow  one can max out at 2646 m3 per minute in hisec using your 2 hour estimation thats 317520 m3 in lowsecnullsecwspace you top out at 2966 m3minute using your 2 hour estimation thats 355 920 m3 your numbers are far too low even when comparing to 2 hour segments limiting yourself to 2 hour segments is also flawed as there are some people who given the inclination will mine for a full day for whatever reason actually it is exceptionally useful in stationless systems ive been known to throw up a tower in a system for a few hours when mining though generally like to keep it around for the entire weekend

i think that is a seriously excellent idea which actually would not only benefit highsec but null aswelli would love to see every belt purely full of veldspar or scordite ore scanners would instead of scanning a whole belt scan a single roid and tell you its contents then as ronan says you would have to mine through the lowend ores to get to the highend onesi think not only would this be more interesting but also add a complication that makes botting a fraction more difficult im not stupid enough to think that something like this would stop botson top of ronans suggestions i would like to suggest that the number of belts in all systems in eve are halved entirely and the removed half become nonstatic hidden belts this could even result in a minor chance someone would consider mining in lowsec if they werent sitting in a static belt

wait whatyou just went from solo walled gardens should be ok to i like playing with other peoplequoteno i have said from day 1 that ccp should appreciate all styles of play  solo play should not be the dirty family secret about uncle willie when i build ships invent bpcs or do pi that is solo play  at least until dust541 comes online  i want the option to do both or either depending on my mood and the time i have to be online if you think because i want stiffer penalties for ganking means all i want is a walled garden its not worth it to argue with you imo the way the game mechanics work now it seems like we have a one size fits all crimes model which imo is inadequate and not reflective of a real risk vs reward model i do not pretend to be an expert and engage in the forums to express my opinions and see if my ideas can fly when tested by other players who have different points of view an experience levels i come here to learn and become a better player because frankly my ego is large enough where i dont need to only champion popular points of view and get automatic pats on the back from an alliance contingent
i seem to have noticed something recently that i do not remember happening beforei lock onto about 69 targets and send out my drones and start firingas the screen gives me my messages of my drone damage my damage and the info from enemy damage those messages now seem to overlap at the base of the locked target icons if there are enough of the you can no longer see the distance to target in the locked target icon you have to use the overview window with itis it possible to move the messages down by about 1 line or so
file this one as a bug report youll get the problem fixed faster
i htink that generally the gaps between speeds of the ship sizes does need to be made larger maybe not by much but someting like the op says may be in order maybe a bit less
no definitely dont kill the scan time on probes remember that some people use them to explore too 5 min to scan would kill probing i can scan an entire site in 5 min now that change would make it take the better part of 30 min to lock down a single site and dont kill ongrid warps either many people use them for legitimate purposes tooi think the simplest solution would be to make it so you cant lock anything completely when its less than 100k km from you or so so anyone wanting to make a fleet warp to a sniping fleet will first have to drop probes then warp away to a celestial then scan then warp over to the targets this will give sniper fleets plenty of warning to warp off if they choose to disengage
if you think the only use for combat scanner probes is scanning down your fleet while in battle you dont do anything else with probes and shouldnt be recommending a sweeping change to their functionality without considering all the issues
because sniper fleets should get a free pass rather than take riskswhy have i seen this attitude about snipers several times lately we should make it so they can always escape by preventing fleets from easily landing on lazy snipers
im not saying give them a free pass but a 1030s window if theyre watching is more reasonable than about 3s warning im mostly just thinking that it would keep snipers somewhat viable without making them impossible to get to i dont think that its an endall solution but its a suggestion to work off of
i love the look of the primae and noctis ship designs the detailing and texturing is superb and they look like actual space vessels in comparison the mining barges look very dated and the texturing on them is quite ugly even the new strip miner models look better produced the designs for the mining barge models need an update drasticallyprimae
at least theyll get updated textures soon enough if not with this expansion i am almost certain they will in the next
the models of the mining barges are fine theres no need to change them update textures sure but dont change the model
ccp is likely going to do a texture overhaul here soonbut theres no reason to add this to the long list of things needing to be fixedlow priorityyesbut not earth shatteringpapercut list perhapsedit inappropriate part removed ccp phantom stop the evemail spam
true i dont disagree with you but nevertheless the ships look out of date and will look even more so with the new graphical improvements coming up in the winter patch
this theres nothing wrong with the ship model itself its actually one of the most believable ship designs in the game it looks utilitarian and basic the way industrial hardware should look a texture reskin wouldnt hurt
because it will make the miners tears that much sweeterbecause you cant see textures on a cloaked stealth bomber anywaybecause blowing up prettier shiny things makes life that much more interesting
please allow corps to do more war decs having the ability to do only 3 is severely limiting especially as alliances can do unlimited amount understand that its alot cheaper to dec corp to corp but only asking for a small increase to say 10 war decsalso on a side note can we remove the time it takes to war dec it effectively takes 2 days minimum to actually get the war active again of a pain so can we change this to be same as alliances and insta war dec then wait 24hrs i dont see the need for a corp vote if the ceo sanctions it anyway
a pet peeve of mine but more importantly an example of what i think a porposal should look like  discussissueinfo tabs suffer from bad layout restricted useability and lack of interesting background information while players have long learned to cope with the former two the latter has become intolerablesolutionadd a couple more properties to info tabs  dimensions to sublunar objects in space population and gdp to celestialsdetailsall properties would be added to the list of attributesdimensions would reveal length width and height of ships stations and big dumb objects helping out with the sense of scale eve so often lackspopulation and gdp would be randomly generated for celestials modified by celestial type size and sec status they would offer just a little more insight on why we should care about those pretty marbles in the skiespros  adds flavour satisfies curiosity squelching curiosity engenders more of the same and through that increased identification with the eve universe wont require much work will hardly require any qa population and gdp may offer a basis to some later pi feature will not realistically wreck some other aspect of gameplaycons it is quite useless info tabs will go on sucking clutters up my view even more takes artists away from fixing those bugstldrsome uncomplicated additions to info tabs would add much flavour and satisfy curiosity of so inclined players have a heart dammit
this sounds like a job not for any actual developers but for isd the developers are busy doing big important things that only they can do but grinding out flavoronly numbers for every item and celestial in all of eve yeah that kind of thing would work best as a volunteer projectas an isd project supported heck i might join such an effort myself so long as it doesnt distract the devs from anything important im all for it
this due to the fact that youre adding pure unadulterated fluff it should definitely be purely a community volunteer effort no devs involved wasting time on meaningless fluff with that proviso i can see how it could be interesting to a few people i personally couldnt care less about seeing meaningless information like that but if some people in the community want to do it and it doesnt affect me i dont mind
im not sure it could be done by isd alone  i doubt theyll have the tools to do anything like that if anything anyone might start an effort to enhance pedia entries for planets and stuff on their own that might at a later point be integrated or linked with the info tabs ingamehowever any modification of info tabs ie to add another entry to the attributes table will require a few minutes of dev effort if they did spare that they might as well put in a seed that gives a weighted random value to all planets isd might or might not be able to adjust those values afterwards considering the amount of physical nonsense that mars planetary attributes climates getting warmer at more distant orbits somebody needs to have a look at those numbers at some point anyway
empire temperate planets should have population details
true isd probably doesnt have the tools to add extra slots to the existing info tabs that said it should be fairly trivial to get them a database which they can populate with reasonableseeming numbers and which once populated could be imported into the game itself to add extra fluff to the universe
it would be trivial if isd were actually an active entity not sure what their status is but no matter which branch they do not seem productive this job here would probably be down team yarrs or team ms alley and neither showed any activity at all in recent months hell id do this myself if they let me but i feel intimidated by their signup form
currently dev blogs seem to appear at random times when most us timezone and probably most eu timezone players are at work this would be fine except for the fact that these dev blogs sometimes have massive effects within eve almost immediately after they are posted for instance the pos changes announced today 20111108 resulted in all heavy water in high security space being bought up and relisted at 510x the previous price from 20 pu to 100200 pu almost immediately the massive advantage in timing for those players who can log on at any time has no justification in addition initial feedback from the community which is all the devs probably read is even more strongly biased toward hardcore gamers with far more time than the vast majority of players that pay to keep eve running therefore i propose one or all of the three1 dev blogs be announced a week ahead of release 2 dev blogs be released at a fixed time based on peak user time3 dev blogs be released only on weekends and holidaysobjections1 ccp will share less info w us if they are restricted to posting dev blogs at certain timesccps decision to share or not share information with us independent of how and when to share such information it is a simple matter for ccp schedule dev blogs
while i can kinda see your point about market uses i dont really think we need that much limitations on when devblogs can be released and they definitely shouldnt be weekends only i think there should be a notification that shows up for everyone another item that pops up same as when someone likes a post you make for those of us who dont always check the devblogs page but i dont want us to restrict ccp trying to share information with us thats just stupid weve been doing our best to get them to share more information with us
the important bit
1 reallywe will be annoucing a dev blog in a week on stuff news at 112 what about people who working during said fixed time3 what about people who work on weekendsthat has to be the most utterly pathetic troll ive seen yetthe following phrase comes to mind  you snooze you looseget over it stop the evemail spam
oh cmon we just went though damn near a year of players saying we want more communication shoot jita statues and now that ccp is giving it to us people still complain ccp cant win for loosing
bad idea just continue with the current release timings
jesus christ nitpick muchthis is hardly something the csm needs to worry about
cry morebiomass queue is over i am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
while i wouldnt mind prior announcements about major dev blogs i certainly dont feel the need to force that upon ccp your suggestion is fairly ridiculous by the way it comes across as heres a better suggestion how about ccp releases dev blogs on the devs work time and not on the devs personal times given that ccp is a european company and while it has offices throughout the world most of its developers are in iceland with a batch in the us too we will understand that implies dev blogs come out during the standard european and us work week and will try not to act like whiny selfish bitches pouting because devs get evenings weekends and holidays away from eve
fyp
how does the bookmarks updating fix seven years worth of documents blogs videos podcasts notes wikis guides and memories
are you suggesting so im not not that anyone really gives a twit about all that anyways  some people will keep referring to mumbai as bombay and nobody gets confused besides chill girl
if i make a bookmark to sit 170 km off the kaaputenen gate in niarja and name it niar  kaap 170 i completely understand the meaning of the name but ccp cant change that with any sort of find and replacethats what im talking about not the actually coordinates of the bookmarksits completely unfeasible and would put far to much work in the hands of the players to fix all their data because ccp changed 8 years of established game content
these system names have been here since the games inception and people have managed up til now besides easier to pronounce just means something people are families with which in turn means that these wonderful system names will be replaced with generic and boring names
that is one of the dumbest justifications ever please dont use it
yeah noone cares at all about all the guides route planners blogs recruitment ads wikis or thier own memories noone at allnopenooneget out
i quite like the idea of letting corps that have had sov in a system for a long time give it a name however i think it should be a bracketed attribute such that the original alphanumeric name remainsone alternative that i quite like is giving all systems two types of names a real name and a code i guess it would be possible to then allow players to choose which appears bracketed or somethinghowever i do not really see names as a big issue i would prefer that they spend time updating lore or other essentially aesthetic aspects of the game firsthe quite clearly underlined just bookmarks therefore his comment was just aimed at bookmarks the implication was that it did not belong in the list of things which would not update however the point another raised about the names we give our bookmarks is a valid one
would disagree with the first point there already is a massive drop from hi to low which is why many people stay in hias for low sec being too hard i do spend time there now and other than the choke points out a lot can be dealt with by being attentive to your surroundings but i wouldnt build there as a small corp as you might as well throw the isk awaybut thanks for the usual troll pretty much as expected
i did in a thread where somebody else had taken that approach and it was suggested i post herealso i expect that if it was to become a workable idea others would contribute and refine to something useful as i dont claim to have the answers to all of low secs problems or even claim this is the right idea its a thought that springs to mind and as so far all i have had is the expected negative stuff and join an alliance time i havent been disuaded that its a bad optioni doubt it would be the best option and would expect that people with better knowledge of eve than me to say why it wouldnt work how it would unbalance the game or whether its something that could be adapted to provide something that would encourage people out of hi rather than the majority of comments that either say make hi care bear heaven or nerf it completelythere has to be draw to low other than faction war or the few loners who play there
people already pay ridiculous amounts to rent nullspace systems and they dont get any npc help and need to invest more isk for upgradesso it seems a bit off for anywhere the same ammount of isk you get npc help and do they shoot anyone red to you or everyone not blue could stations still be docked ini support maybe having more npcs guarding lowsec no instastop god concord regular navy ships that would make it much more low security vs no security it is currently but to have it become exclusive like nullsec in access to stations no wayits low sec for a reason and sov is held by the empires so it technically regardless of your friendliness to them still belongs to them its a lawless frontier compared with high but that does not mean they will willingly relinquish itand btw moons can be taken in lowsec anyway if it meets the right sec status sov holding and moon holding can be very independent just that all the good ones have been staked out forever ago changing hands between powers
was not wanting concord there far too much and not sov eitheri know about moons etc in low sec protection would have to be no autodeath scenario like concord but something that could be avoided and hunt you at least while in system faction still owns and does not attack as you direct only on agression if you built a station you would have to conform to docking rights of the faction to a large extent if not complete its always seemed daft to me that you can dock when being shot at so it would need something to allow agressors or decd corps locked outi can agree that factions would not want to give up sov but if you were in good standing with them and the need to keep it there as a corpalliance and were willing to pay them tax and effectvley fund a safer area of low sec to increase trade and other income why notanything spent on upgrading the system if that was an option would have to be accepted as open to anybody not set as shoot on sight by the faction so that it doesnt become a private semi sov excluding other people if thats wanted it would have to be null and hold yourself if it was to work it would need the same costs as sov for upgrades etc but without the exclusive rights still be unsafe but not completely lawless a place where you can break the law and get away with it without simply having to tank the gate sentries but rather have the local coppers trying to find and kill you who you could fight back against with a chance of winning or play with brains and avoid
as with any election the choice not to vote means that you are agreeing to go along with what the rest of the population decides when you decide not to vote you forfeit your right to complain about the results edit and if there were no candidates that you supported you should have run for the position yourself

bounce is needed
pics
i think youre missing the point the point is to increase realism not just to watch boobs bounce up and down as happy as that makes me although incarna hasnt been used much im sure ccp has big plans to make those characters they worked so hard on an integral part of the eve universe i support all the bounce realism we can get
ah yes that is truethered finally be a use for the retribution though 
agreed who knows what kind of crazy ass system they have behind it all though
gerbils for power and monkeys for code
i think modifying the faction towers to use the same fuel as normal towers is ridicilous the whole point of investing in one of the faction towers is reduced fuel costs so it will pay for itself now i understand that in trying to simplify the game and making the fuel costs more simplistic i get that however a bigger fuel bay isnt going to do it in so far as a fair trade offwhat i propose is this and incremental increase in the powergridcpu output for the tier 1tier 2 towers thereby retaining some of the fuel savings and allowing the simplization of the fuel situation at the same timeplease give this idea serious thought as it would only be fair to reap some actual benefit to faction towers people paid their hard earned isk forthank youlucid phoenix
i think its a bit early to jump the gun on this unless you have access to more information already maybe there will be different sized pellets or the pellet consumption rates will change depending on standardfaction towersplease dont start crying over simplification everytime they change something to remove tediumoverly complicated mechanicscomplicated  complexthings can be complex without being complicated if youve ever been involved in helping maintain 20 towers balancing all the fuel loads to travel around 50 systems to stock up towers is a horrible boring task that will be made better

hmm a penalty to cargo size is almost no penalty at all but at the same time a bonus to hull is something you have to be halfcrazy to really exploit much and people who try are likely to pop moreall told i approve supported more hull tanking would be hilarious in general
supported the surprise lulz tears and rage is worth it
 this
i endorse and support this message
hull tanking definitely needs more love but t2t3 ships would have to get improved hull resists
by having a  gain it is much more likely to be used by caps gain much more then a couple thousand boastadd to that with a damage control a fast way to get good all around resists
there are stacking penalties to eanms and invulnerability fields perhaps stacking penalties should apply to reinforced bulkheads as well 
theyve always been pretty helpful and speedy on my petitions although i rarely petition and usually only for a loss because of an unscheduled server drop you say that petitions arent resolved in your favor  how do we know that youre not just petitioning completely unreasonable requests although i do agree that it shouldnt take weeks to get a response
this is an old subject brought up by the csm back in 2009 to site my source refer to this link
without holding a particular opinion about what might be ideal docking and undocking distances from the various civilizations stations i disagree with the general premise behind your argument i do not believe that equalizing all aspects of player experience and necessary tactics across racescivilizations enhances eve at least not indisputably it may make the game more fair but it degrades the worldliness of eve as a sci fi simulation as a virtual universe of space exploration industry and combat over the years but especially recently there has already been far too much compromise of the fictive imaginative dimensions of eve in the name of playability and fairness where the notions of what counts as playable and fair are derived from instantaccess arcade and p2w games rather than the lived experiential duration of mmorpgs however this is not to say that the docking and undocking distances ought not be revisited for sense and if not fairness then some more intangible balance if there is a docking and undocking debility specific to caldari and amarr stations there might well ought to be some countervailing specific ability other civilizations stations lackdifference does create complexity which many view simply in its negative difficult and unfair aspects but many differences distributed also create the preconditions for and texture inworld knowledge such differences ultimately make for the special significance and pride that being in and of a virtual world for some duration deservedly brings its veterans who would expect or deserve respect be sought after for knowledge and opinions for playing tf2 since it started games are fair life is not its a fundamental choice which is eve to be more like
not supported and the other 2 outposts should have warpin radius up to 2500m same as npc station and rest of outposts
im not saying shorten the warp in radius im saying the docking radius is extremely small compared to the other stations including npc fixing it would not be a matter of fairness rather what is the mechanic behind those 2 stations having such a short dock radius i think what is happening is thisthe docking radius is a set perimeter if you where to draw a circle on a piece of paper and pretend that is itthen you put the station inside that circle some stations are shaped odd compared to others realizing that amarr and caldari stations are pretty wide compared to the boxy look of minmitar station and long thin of gallente so when you put them inside the dock radius some spread out closer to the perimeter of the radius while others fit closer in the middle keeping this in mind that would mean if you warp to the station your 2500 off the station lands you either outside the dock radius or inside the dock radius depending on the shape of the stationsince that appears to be the case as it is now why would it not be logical to change how that mechanic plays out because more realistically the dock radius should be distance from the station itself or the hangar entranceso somebody please argue with my logic there because i think this would be an excellent thing to fix
i have recently read this letter and would like to pass it on as a relevant issue for the csmi am certain that this letter raises several questions of interest to eve playersare we playing in a sandbox and do we have the freedom to raise issues we feel strongly about with ccp

what in the hell
1 when youre building ships its not solo you took the minerals moon andor station factory slots i could have used2 when youre inventing bpc its not solo you took the moon andor the station lab slots i could have used3 when youre extracting pi goods its not solo you took the materials i could have used dust514 will just add an it can be destroyed by others element to pi4 when youre ship spinning its solo though soon to be fixed if that counter on sisi is any indication sure its not that big of a deal in hisec that you took my lab slot for 2 hours or a manufacturing slot for a day  well between the two of us anyway now lets expand that to what could happen because you tied up the manufacturing slot i was going to use also assume the winter expansion is outi get delayed in making 10 tornadoes by 12 hours or whatever some group of former wspace residents found a new entry to their former wormhole but its close to the expiry 4 hours or less whatever is low enough to get the its nearly collapsed description they cant get 10 tornadoes because theyre not on a close enough market yet at least 10 jumps out well they could try to get them but theres no guarentee they can get back in time the invaders choose to use other bcs canes myrmidons whatever because they cant get enough bs through the wormhole the invaders are able to cause damage to the pos of the guys that kicked them out and maybe even end up having a fullblown fleet engagement  but they cant rf the tower because they dont have the dps so they get kicked out again by the new owners obviously this is just an example and has flaws and we all know that there will be tons of tornadoes and the other tier3 bcs out within hours of dt lifting  but i think it shows pretty effectively how even little things such as a few hours delay on producing a ship can have an effect on many peoples gameplay
if eve monitors its boards someone at ccp should have read this post and either agreed that its a bug and put it on a list  or didnt care and it will be unfixed
they dontnot the people that you want to see thisfile a bug report stop the evemailUFFFDspam
obviously not the real minigin post was not limegreen
maybe because every god damn item in the game just about every item at least requires minerals yea all the titans and super carriers in 00 minersin before someone says loot reprocessing
actualy you use thos goods wath they making  all the time  almost 90 of trit is imported in 00 so you use that ting al lthe time  eve when you shot single bullet  if you dont wish to use it than you ned mine your self  but ader ways you wil use it any way veldspar give out to low trit to suport 00 and wuld be worth off mining in 00 
actually jay pava lives in nullsec and his only occupation is industrymining as i said in the op  yes i would like to see a mining barge update i dont look down on other players because i live in null in fact high sec players are invaluable to me because i cant be in two places at once i dont appreciate trolls coming back to my posts and antagonizing the people who actually have something to say especially from a toon that was activated in september and has never been part of a corp you have nothing of value to say and your walloftext ranting is becoming very boring please move on
this
why so you can hang around at jita undock with 10 corps you can shoot at the same time instead of 3
i think i have explained why not sure why your obsessed with jita undock that only really works when you dec lots of alliances to make it worth it by the way if you decced 10 corps even if they had 100 players each that would only make 1000 players say 30 alts to make it 700 and they not on at the same time zone then those in that time zone wont be on at the same time you prob have 50 players online at any one time if your lucky and chances of those undocking at jita any time soon is next to none would be very boring indeed10 corps is hardly asking for much is it
3 is enough by the way your small increase from 3 to 10 is a 233 increase too much maybe 5 but again i think 3 is enoughi dont have a problem with the insta war dec you are right that it takes way too long as it is now to get a war started i approve of that change
compared to alliances this is miniscule when alliances have unlimited war decs could you explain when 3 is enough enough in whose eyes not mine especially with this silly dec shield
so pray tell what is it you do thats making 3 such a limiting limit
pretty much the same as the jita quote most corps are not very big if you can only dec 3 corps they amoount of targets you may have online at any one time could be tiny then chance of you actually finding them is even smaller being able to dec more corps at least give you a bit more of a chance to find some targetsi would actually prefer it was unlimited and the cost increased x2 each time24816 32 64128 mill etc etcso it still remains relatively cheap at lower end and get progressively more expensive
in other words what youre doing is part of the reason theres a limit there in the first place
well not really is it 3 decs is tiny we have decced a say alliances with a combined count of 15k players and still find it difficult to find a target even if you decced a corp you had full intel on etc they amount of people online and online in your tz would be very small so whats the point of even deccing anyone what so you get one kill maybe in a day and waited ages for it seriously mate think about it before posting just random comments war deccing is a profession at least make it a viable one if you just want to dec corpswith the dec shield in place now which is just stupid its even more difficult we might as well just do away with corp to corp war decs then i am not really sure why your arguing against it tbh
you do realize that the answer to your limitation is to become an alliance right small price to pay for unlimited wars stop the evemail spam
working as intendedor ccp can just give you free kmsbtw u mad bro
well its not a small price to pay is it the cost increases quite considerably as decs growas i stated war deccing is a profession its not a viable one wiht only 3 decswith respect none of you have given any real arguments against where i have given arguments forseriously think about this logically instead of just being awkward for the sake of it you might as well just do away decs for corps theres just no point as a profession at allplease dont say working as intended we know its working as intended thats why im proposing the change
i support wardeccing as a profession
for that reasons need to limit war decs to 1 and per month 
roam wh space its not that difficult to figure the mechanics of whs  and everything is a target on the far side  whs leading out of jita are good targets and the surrounding couple of systems
50 million per dec for unlimited decs is too expensiveoh damnhell just froze over stop the evemail spam
find a different profession or move to space where wardecs dont matter or would fighting someone who knows what they are doing and might shoot back a problem
wartargets shooting back is a real problem for empire wardeccers ccp should nerf wartargets so they cant shoot back seriously op if you want more wardecs form an alliance nbd
if wardeccing for the kicks is your thing wouldnt it seem ideal that you would do some research on the people you dec to know whether or not they are going to give you targets to shoot atunless you are actually war deccing people for traditional reasons such as someone from another faction slept with your daughter or you dont like the way they looked at you
its not 50 mill per war dec tho is itit get exponentially more expensive if you want to troll at least do it properly
lol not one of you have come up with any reason why this should not change no arguments just trollsat least give valid arguments if you are going to disagree otherwise your just trollingwhere have you guys been for the past 8 years when wars where implemented
part of the reason the number of wars was limited to three was as a kind of builtin antigriefing mechanism to prevent larger corporations from permadeccing numerous much smaller industrial corps or just many small corporations in generalif you want to be able to dec as many corporations as you want youre going to have to form an alliance it is one of the many benefits of doing so that comes with that huge pricetag war decs cost significantly more once again to prevent the permadeccing of numerous small corporations as a griefing tacticbesides typically it is illadvised for one to spread themselves thin by fighting wars on multiple fronts as they commit tactical planning logistics and resources to multiple fronts thus leaving gaps in security etc etci am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
the fact that you dont like my answers doesnt mean im trolling
the fact is your not coming up with any answersdrake instead of getting mad all the time why dont you try use the energy and post something constructive i know this is hard for you to do judging by all your other posts but if attention seeking is your thing then hey i was having a look more into your forums replies to other people and by god you just like to be a complete idiot dont youi mean every post you do is arrogant i mean people have a look at his posts wow your like a petulant child nothing good to say about anyone or anything just an attention seeking losergtfoalso who said we wanted to do unlimited war decs only mentioned 10 said it would be nice to but the proposal says 10its interesting to see when alot of you guys are wanting to make high sec carebears more of a target for free yet for some unknown reason you want to derail this weirdyou are just like a bunch of kids hanging on the street corner just being idiots and causing trouble for the sake of itboring
maybe one daythis isnt free reigning empires all about your corp your corp is a resident of whatever empire and concord monitored space you need to spend time convincing the authority bribing them to do it filling out paperwork to do it and whatnotlegalized sanctioned war should not be too easy
going with no
i meant itd be trivial to set up the database very nontrivial to populate it youre looking at multiple data entries for every place and item in the game but yeah if this were to be implemented thered have to be some kind of public announcement  call for volunteers its an epic task requiring of an epic amount of work almost certainly beyond the current scope of the current isd projects but within the scope of isds mandate
lets let the devs focus on actual issues not fluff 1
one mans fun might be another mans fluff on a more serious note fluff does have some justification  i dont think youd enjoy eve quite as much without any fluff is especially good if it doesnt cost much and yet holds some appeal for a sizeable group of playersof course its up to this thread to determine there is that sizeable group
not something that ccp or the csm needs to be concerned with dev blogs should be posted when they are ready to be posted
no theres no reason to have an inuniverse game change simply because some fcs arent imaginative enough to figure out such a simple issue
the introduction of drone damage was great and all but when im piloting a ship that doesnt solely rely on drones for damage itd be nice to see the damage im doing with my primary weaponsan option to group drone damage as an average over a period of time or the ability to turn it off entirely would be nice
i brought this issue up recently in features and ideas feel free to make a comment and support the thread
heres a counteridea leave lowsec as it is take concord out of 05 put faction police there instead then you have more of a stepping stone from high to low and you dont have to turn low into some kind of weird npc policed wasteland instead of just a wasteland
i dont know what are you smokinglow sec is pretty safe for starters just use mwd and cloak to get almost anywhere with perfect safetythen you have gate guns which keep campers off the gate most of the day counting out some more frequently camped systems where you are not forced to go by any meansfurthermore if you want protection you can either pay someone or gather a corp or alliance who protect you it is still lot of safer than 00and because non factionwar low sec is pretty much most useless space to be at the moment youre pretty safe almost anywhere you go just look for some system not next to freaking jitaif you use even a little bit of brain low sec is probably safer than hi sec at least you know every neutral with guns probably tries to gank youjust saying
valid option the only negative i can see is the full care bear tears and that what is left of concord space would become even more crowded i would still prefer some graduation rather than the cliff face from 05 to 04 though and spread into low as about half the systems i fly through in low are just empty but anything rather than the cliff face would help
and valid and from experience ive sat in empty systems for hours with a lot less hassle than high but the choke points out are the problem and i must admit i dont fancy cloaking my hulk unless ninja mining through worm holes i dont know any corp of players that will sit around alert for hours for a level of pay that would make the work in low worthwhile and i dont blame them makes mining exciting if nobody turns upbut the point that low sec is useless and empty is surely a good reason to change something so people want to go there and do something as most in high sec are care bears noobs indy alts and small corps it seems sensible to pitch at those who would be willing to move for some gain
or just use it for the part of the forum where it matters assembly hall i bears no meaning elsewhere so that would be sufficientand to clarify you would not be marked with a certain candidate you voted for but a a simple marker that you voted for someone that person may not be part of the csmi guess we were thought different values therenot voting  not interest in the electionsspoiled ballot  no person that made it on the list is suitable to youof course in eve it is easier to get accepted as candidate so yeah everyone would be able to run in theory but you need a lot of commitment and time to ne a real asset to the csm and not just block a seatand as pointed out above i dont want to know who someone voted but ifif you deem that so important have one account voting and another not so you always got the chance to lie about itand what does your 0 mean are you indifferent to the matter
what if i dont want you to know whether or not i voted
bump because i modified the op and because i really think this would add something fine to the game
hell god damn no so much csm time has already been dedicated to missions over the years  the mission overhaul wasnt even that long ago
yes they added useful journal entries for convenience and  thankfully  a handful of epic arcs after you ran the latter missioneering was back to the dreary business it had been you focus your criticism on a point i noted requires some effort by ccp better spent elsewhere id argue the effort required would not be that great but that is of course debatablehow would you comment on the pros i listed in the op
supported missioning is a critical staple to the independant minded player and should be treated as such no one should be made to join a megablob just because theres nothing else to do
uuuggghhhh kill yourself
it is possible these are just lower poly models in sisi not surebefore  after

large payout reduction for highsec is already in effect rest is convoluted and unneeded changes that serve no purpose not supported
in effect as on tq or a suggested add in the winter expansion  in response to the added ideasthe main change would need to bethe rest of the fluff on the page was to facilitate the risk v reward balance that currently is not present in high sec incursions
in effect as in tq theres the lower reward in both isk and lp plus lack of mom bpc drop in highsec
something i posted on my blogsanshaUFFFDs nation has invaded and occupied the constellation concord doesnUFFFDt have the firepower to deal with the incursion alone and has called on capsuleers to help in return for the aid of capsuleer fleets concord offers rich rewards in the form of isk and loyalty points makes sense so far rightthe problem is those capsuleers donUFFFDt do what concord asked instead of hastily repelling the incursion most of the pilots who arrive only care to fight in small groups against the vanguard sites where they can make the most isk the sansha headquarters and mothership are ignored far longer than is necessary because they arenUFFFDt the easy money i donUFFFDt know about you but if i were concord i would be rather unhappy with these guys iUFFFDd hired to help clean up the messto fix incursions in a way that would be consistent with the lore my suggestion is simple make concord impatient it works something like this extended farming of vanguard sites results in diminishing payouts over time the longer the incursion lasts the less valuable vanguard sites become this is due to concord wanting capsuleers to resolve the sansha invasion rather than making sport of the small sansha fleets i would suggest keeping the current payout as the top level with a 10 drop per day until it hits 60 for the last half of the incursionUFFFDs natural lifetime at 60 million isk per hour incursions would still pay more than any other highsec activity the payout for the mothership could drop over time as well creating a compelling reason for taking on the mothership quickly put a hard cap on the payout for an entire incursion each highsec incursion is worth x isklps once that is used up the incursion disappears not all of those have to go together i think we could get by with just 1 and just see how it affects the economyanother idea might be to simply renorm the payouts so that vanguards pay less across the board with the larger sites being increased
ok i think that you have missed my point by a large margin to bootfirst of allthe current lp  isk payout for a hs vanguard site is presuming maximum of 10 in fleet105 million isk2500 concord lpthis is what it was at incursion release and this is what it is at now payouts have not been nerfedand as stated in my opening post people run an average of 8 of these sites in an hourthe primary objective of this proposal is to address the lack of risk over the rewards gainedthus the below change would first and foremost address the fact that an obseen amount isk is being printed allbe it through combat at little to no risk to the player the isk payout for the 3 types incursion profiles would also changehigh sec would be half of current payout isklow sec would take on the current high sec payout profile isknull sec would remain unchanged isk
why is everyone all of a sudden interested in how other people play eve and demanding they have risk attached to everythingseems to be a thing on these forums that hi sec activities make too much isk so nerf everything to hell nerfing everything in hi sec will only lead to bored players leaving evei know theres not enough challenge in lownull so i suggest to increase the risk versus the insane amount of isk they can make from plexesrattingmoon goo that all rats in lownull be given the same stats as concordthere now i support this proposal give all parts of eve massive risks versus rewards and everyone is happy amirighti am also going to have a wild stab in the dark that the op isnt one of the incursion runners what next no farming level 4 missions no plexes outside of null noone allowed to earn more than 10 isk per hour until they move to nullhow about you play eve your way and let others play it their wayi give up can only hope ccp ignores threads like theseeditoh and before the op screams incursionbear i have never run an incursion and dont intend too no matter how much isk it pays in any security level of space
no one in this thread is telling incursioners to do anything else no one is saying play eve my way or anything like thatpeople are making over 100m isk per hour in highsec vanguards thats the same level of income one can get in much more dangerous nullsec activities that is why we have a problem with highsec incursions they are imbalanced and pay out rewards that do not reflect the risk and effort that goes into them this in a game that for eight years has portrayed itself as one where risk is required before reward
but you already said in your op that they do run the risk of losing their ships in the incursion sites and its only down to good logistic pilots that they dont the risk is already there so are you penalising good team work and good logistic pilotingi think what you are really complaining about is the 100mil isk per hour not the fact that there isnt anyenough risk a stealth whine that carebears earn too muchand you are dictating to people how they play eve if you get your way and nerf the hell out of incursions to the extent they are no longer really worthwhile then people in hi sec stop running them and another part of the game is taken away from themwould you spend and hour or more shooting at rats to get virtually nothing in return no well then why should anyone else be expected to do thisleave hi sec alone its fine the way it is buff low and null sec instead to make people want to leave hi sec to do something more lucrative or interesting
you do realize that number is only partial pay right go to lowsec if you want to see full pay and no half of what is already partial pay in highsec is too low and putting current highsec partial pay in lowsec is too low stop trying to nerf everything that you dont understand and stop trying to dedicate how others play when you dont understand
okyou obviously still are missing the pointthe risk you run when it comes to losing ships in pve activity is 0 as long as you know what you are doing and dont leroy jenkins your self out of stupiditythus no incursion runner should ever lose a ship especially now that running the vanguards has been perfectedwhat im trying to say is that in high sec there is no risk to the player for running the incursions and that the reward is to highthe primary proposed change wouldfirst bring the levels of isk currently being injected in to eve via hs incursions down to a more economic friendly levelsecond make null the place to make bank in incursions while keeping bpc drops to low secthird keeping lp payouts the same would make hs incursions more about the lp and sec grinding as far as the i dont know that im talking about comment you made i have a good understanding of current hs incursion vanguard risks and payoutson the point of lack of rewardat 50 of current hs vanguard payout1 site would be  525 million and 25k lp8 sites in 1 hour 42million isk and 20k lptotal fleet1 site 525 million and 25k lp8 sites 525 million and 250k lpi would like to think that that is still a v generous payout for running a hs vanguard sitefyi i relay do suck at pve in eve and as yet touch wood i have not lost my marauder or logistics ship in any incursion site i have been in
yeah so this is more of the same nullsec codswallop that translates as carebears get paid too much for risking so littlegreater risk in no way shape or form entitles you to greater reward it just entitles you to greater riskwhy not pay everyone the same and you stop looking for nullsec welfare or stealing candy from carebears because you chose to live in a  dangerous neighborhood if you want the ease of highsec move to highsec and quit whining about how much they get paid and how much they dont spend smoking ships like an addict smokes cracknullsec boo hoo we want more money because we chose to live in a  dangerous neighborhood and the cost of living is sooo high and thats sooo unfairbut if you wont give it to us at least steal it from those carebears who chose to live someplace safer and save their moneyhighsec you could just move to highsecnullsec no way you silly carebear nullsec is where all the cool kids arehighsec whatever im going to go relax and have a beernullsec heycan you give me tree fiddy
hi there smiling menaceim am not1 a mission runner2 a null bare3 wh 4hs mining barei am 1a lowsec pvp player2 and incursion runner in the vary sites that i want to nerf3 an exploration plex runneri have participated in many aspects of this great game and it is not just my personal opinion that hs incursions are scued in the risk to payout department as you will see in my above reply the payout would still be substantial is the proposed payout change was implemented i dont want to nerd everything i would just like to see the scaling of rvr that ccp intended not the current waterfall to plughole ratio that is reflected in hs vanguard sites
may i please refer you to my previous postim not a null barethat is all
actually most of sov null consists of backwater systems tucked deep within the blue ass of large alliances where you dont see hostiles for weeks on end why else do you think 90 of online toons at any given time there are botshighsec is where any grey apoc parked around the corner can potentially gank you with a rack of 1400s
i couldnt care less what you are this is more of the same punish the carebears and reward the noncarebears as if by playing a game differently you are somehow special and deserve something extra you arent special because you like pvp or live in lownullsec those are lifestyle choices and they are supposed to be less pleasant less economically viable places to live this is more we want lownullwelfare and we want the carebears to pay for ityou just want tree fiddythis is a game remember its purpose is to entertain the people who play itpeople sing the praises of the dark dangerous gritty realistic sandbox that is eve when they are busily screwing other people over and stealing their stuff yes its part of the game and i have no trouble with it at all in principle but when confronted by the dark dangerous gritty reality of economics for example a stronger capital base and greater buying power in highsec people go running to ccp waving their poop filled diapers crying about riskreward ratiosnegotiate and enforce better treaties with your neighbors and reduce the amount of fighting and you will have more money if all you are about is the fighting then we dont need eve at all we just a laddertier system so people can do nothing but fight 247365maybe ccp could slow down resource renewal speed across the board that might help reduce the spaceships are eve crack mentality that a lot of people seem to have as they burn through ship after shipi thought you guys were all for that dark dangerous gritty realism like fighting harder for fewer resources in relatively lawless areas you know where there will be more danger and less money and stuff to go around a clockwork orange and mad max and all that we should get greater rewards for greater risks since when is that any sort of model of dark dangerous gritty realitythat is nothing but welfarebear pure and simplewhats that you say its not as entertaining you dont feel like you are getting the reward you feel you are entitled to for taking greater risks as though greater risk brings anything other then greater risk its a game and so it should be easier meaning more carebear right you do remember this is game and the relatively higher risks are something you volunteered for and can get away from at any time you want rightyou make it sound like low riskhigh payout is a bad thing oh wait it is a bad thing if one is not reaping the benefits from itquit patting yourselves on the back for voluntarily living a third world lifestyle when you dont have to especially when you turn around and try to get welfare from or punish carebears for being smart and behaving like most humans would if eve were a real worldmaking more money more safely pick up your lownullwelfarebear cards on the way out
okim not complaining that some guy in hs can make more isk than i can in lsim saying that current hs incursions are far to easy for the isk they producethe core proposal would fix that and still maintain incursion running as one of the more lucrative professions in hs whilestemming the printing of isk that is currently swamping the eve economy at the vary least you can agree with the basic principal of eve that is risk for reward hs incursion fleets are 99 of the time formed from 2 channels or corporationsalliances everyone knows everyone people fleet with people they can trust and have flown with the risk is negated by this vary fact and you are rewarded for not realy putting your self in harms wayjust to re iterate i dont want hs incursions uber nerfed just brought down a peg so that its not the 1 definitive hs occupation
there you go again dont you read what others say hereyou are dictating what people do in eve you just said it again so because people are smart enough to band together with people they know and promote team work to make things easier for themselves you want to punish them for this are you nutsagain this is just a stealthwhine that carebears earn more in hi sec with good teamwork than you do in low sec your own posts confirm thisas previously posted before if you dont like this move back to hi sec join one of these 2 channels and make some new friends whilst earning isk its that easy
1 any boost to eafs is a good thing at this point
yeah eafs are the little orphan children of eve and have been for sometimesupported
and given that their focus is electronic warfare kind of makes sense that they would have better control over their signature radius
i havent made that many petitions but the ones i did do were answered fairly quicklysome of them werent in my favour but they did explain why they made the decision they did and did provide links to back this up whilst not the answer i wanted i cant complain about the service i receivedi dont think this thread is really fair tbh as we dont know what your petitions were about and could all just be trivial things which would lead to a negative responsealso dont they come down hard on anything that discusses moderation
i wouldnt petition anything trivial sorry im not the carebear who is qqd about losing some ogre iis not going to discuss any of my petitions but they are very few and far inbetween and none are trivial maby i am just getting some bad gms but the current petition has been waiting 11 days now for a solution and no answer as of yet i would just like some service and from what i can tell some think the gms are idiots and some think they are ok but im not hearing anyone say omg great customer service best gm expierence ever i mean common shouldnt that be what they are striving towardedit and none of my petitions have been about ship losses
if you talk like that to the gms its no wonder they treat you like  youre an  stop being surprised when people treat you like one
while im very happy to see that many of you speak kindly of us gms and the support we provide i can also understand many of the concerns raised in this thread in regards to those i want to add a few points to the discussion first of all we actually do have a mixture of new and older gms working in customer support even if the employee turnaround within customer support is relatively low as most of us love to work on eve and for ccp there are always some gms being recruited into other departments of the company and some that leave due to some other reasons those are replaced by fresh blood which are very often eve veterans andor former isd members that have performed well as such that being said of course we also need to look at many other skills to determine whether someone is well suited for customer support such as good language skills and communication strengths the guy who knows everything about eve will not necessarily make the best gm this we know from experience regarding our response times we do our best to keep them down as possible but of course this can vary on the petition category the current load of incoming petitions at any given time and the issue at hand but just to give you an idea of what you can usually expect here are some average first response time numbers for our main petition categories all petition categories last 12 months  32 hours and 31 minutes last month  16 hours and 31 minutes stuck petition categories last 12 months  1 hour and 4 minutes last month  41 minutes billing  account petition categories last 12 months  22 hours and 6 minutes last month  12 hours and 6 minutes technical support categories last 12 months 32 hours last month  11 hours and 52 minutes of course these are only averages and some petitions may need to wait for longer also these are only first response numbers and there may be more delay in between replies when petitions drag onare escalated etcon reimbursement of losses in eve im not sure what to say as you have probably heard it all before the fact remains that eve is a very very competitive game and in some aspects on the brink of what is technically possible so our task is not always that easy of course we know that players lose ships and items to bugs and server issues but we can simply not apply some kind of blanket the customer is always right method of deciding when to reimburse and when not to we believe this would ruin the experience for everyone in the long run and thus we try to set clear policies that are equally fair to everyone and equally unfair in some cases and stick to them usually this means server log verification is required aka our logs show nothing that being said we will always keep working with the dev teams on improving those logstools so that we have the verification needed in more cases and getting the bugs we are frequently exposed to through petitions fixed with the current focus on eve within the company good things are happening in this area furthermore we can keep working on finding the right balance between canned responses and manually typing up long personal and poetic replies to every petition with detailed explanations of everything and nothing that would in turn slow the whole service down for everyone finally remember that if you are not happy with how your petition is handled you can always request that a second opinion is given by another gm andor a senior gm and finally again use the rating tool to rate different aspects of our services after a petition is closed it really helps us focus on where to improve and tells us how we are doing overall overall rating for last year was 77 of 10 based on 63731 rated petitions not all that bad but can of course be improvedwinter is cominglead gm panzer
thanks for taking the time panzer
as outposts are assembled by player corpsalliances how about dont use caldari or amarr outposts problem solved i think so
so basically you are getting nice bonuses with these outposts and have to suffer a small problem in returnbe extra careful when you undock and check intel channels first and make sure there are no hostiles in system or near by before you jump in and try to dock your jf again problem solvedif you cant use the intel channels at least tell me which system you dock your jf in
this post is not intended to argue for the ability to play station games with hostiles in system like you can with other stations yes fixing this issue would allow that but is it really a big deal 2 station unable to do that out of all of them not a big impact nothe purpose of this post is to point out the mechanic behind docking radius is separate from the actual station model so warpto 0 and undocking from the station model puts you either inside or outside the docking radius based on the station size this concept was simple to develop but impractical in a game play sense the practical approach would be to base the docking radius from the station size ex not actual figures 2k dock radius added from station radius if station is 200k the docking radius would be 202k in size right now if the docking radius was 200k radius and your station was 199k you would land 201k outside the dock radius and have to slow boat while if the station was 180k you would land at a comfortable 182 well inside the docking areaso its not a matter of checking local or crying about losses its a matter of mechanics that need to be reevaluated to make sense and act more flexible to the uniqueness of each stations form and shape
honestlythe ops got a pointthe mechanics are always the samebut in this case the stations general dock zone isnt the samehes just asking for them to match across the boardnot a unfair request at best stop the evemail spam
they not cald bonuses that survival you cant manufucture in ader stations only amarr ones so you and than only with 20 slots with is verry low for 00 manufucturing lines so basicly problem without bonuses
it seems pretty logical to me that research and manufacturing outposts are more dangerous than mere refinery or office outpostonly thing which has ever bothered me to any extent is extra big dock range of gallente one ships dont look like being even close to it and can docki wish we could get rid of docking games and actually catch people in spacetm but that is not going to happen very soonand then its not like anyone is actually taking anything to 00 outpost they cant afford to lose right
god i feel unclean somehow by responding to a goon but here we gorecruitment channel is started by ccp so they can determine whats allowed in their channel if you make your own channel you can determine whats allowed in your channel scamming is not banned in the game just banned in their channel
you miss the point from any point now any one scammed can just say i was in the recruitment channel and they scammed me waa waa waa and the player who scammed elsewhere gets bannedscamming is now completely dead according to the new customer service teamhow long until causality is also bannedboo hoo hoo my corp only hangs out in the recruitment channel and now someone has scammed us out of everything were only recruiters waa waa waa
wrong what they do is checking chat logs in their channel their channel their rules
so you obviously dont know what youre talking about okay fair enough were all glad youve laid your cards out on the table
scamming in the recruitment channel is seriously stupid and an all time lowi have nothing agianst the scamming profession but when you get a potentail gaggle of new pilotsnoobsguys seriously looking for a new corporationalliance this place should be free of such thingsthis is just 1 channelyou guys have localand every other bloody channelsomehow i feel this isnt going to hurt your devilish profession a whole heck of alotso in short dont like it sucks to be you go cry somewhere elsecry some moar stop the evemail spam
haha did he indicate they would actually bother to check logs they never have before
cry me a riverccp is running a business you know mouths to feed and bills to pay youre driving away noobs  their customers any other company would have deleted your accounts ages ago instead of giving ccp credit for tolerating you tards for this long you whine about itbtw u mad bro
thats not the point the point is that in ccps rush to make the game safe for new players by removing concord insurance payouts and no scamming basically anywhere because now the person just says you did it in the recruitment channel theyre just going to drive away the current player basethats been ccps constant problem pissing off what they have in hopes they get something more and the something more never materializes and for a company that just had to lay off 20 of its staff losing more customers isnt really that great of an ideaand you can say boo hoo all you want but there will be a tipping point where the loss becomes unsustainable for a small company like them and they just have to close the game outat some point its time to stop reaching for the sky and take care of what you have at homethis might as well be a blanket ban on scamming in a game made famous by scams because its so easy to work around its and you are a  high line scams have resulted in more eve subs then any advertising theyve ever done the scams made eve
no scamming anywherereallyproof or gtfoseriouslythat has to be the most pathetic excuse ive seen yetmaybe you should take a step back and realize that ccp wants to make sure pilots have some semblience of confidence that when they join a corporation and not worry about getting ed over out the door stop the evemail spam
silly tard goons  evebtw your stuff and sov can i haz
the game managed for 8 years without this type of safeguard why is it needed all of the suddenits one of the dangers of eve and it weeds out the retards with no common sensedid you even read that before you hit enter
all i want to know is how does ccp plan to implement and regulate thisit just seems like a bit of a weird thing to put into a sandbox game can we get some clarification on how this is going to work out is it a simple no scams in that chat or are there grey areas like if you pull someone from that chat and scam them afterwards thats okay with the current thought being they could just reference that they were in recruitment chat and suddenly youve broken a rulei dont even scam often but either way it couldnt hurt to at least clarify how this is going to work out
its called a sandbox people the means you can do sandboxy things like scam more to the point no scamming in this particular nonphysical place makes it difficult or impossible to say that a scam did not in fact take place there in whole or in part ccps notorious inability to log things means i doubt they really even know who is in the recruitment channel at any one time if they dont talk so people could claim to have been scammed starting in recruitment and moving to private convo or local somewhere or some other channel and there would be no way to verify the truthfulness of itthe position on scams that occurred only partially in recruitment needs to be clarified at the very least
ccp is safeguarding its own bottom line there should be no explanation none is neededmore importantly u mad bro
you sound like an old friend of mine named telk needless to say literally everyone stopped listening to him after about 3 sentencesexplain how there is no bottom line needed in a sandbox game i have nothing wrong with protecting noobs i doubt even goons has a problem with that but this current idea has a lot of grey areas that at the very least should be explainedthat or at least refine the idea to something more clearcut like scamming a character of a certain date or sp totalbut seriously every time you post u mad a kitten dies
the original letter is very clear about its purposein other words if the change in wording on the recruitment channel is not a sanctioned change by ccp please revert it if it is an official change in policy please explain itin addition i would like to know why such a change occurred without public scrutiny and feedbacki dont think that list of requests is unreasonable and i do not think it should occur without comment and scrutinyit should not simply appear out of the blue and we should not accept such large changes to the game when they occur on a day to day basis out of the blue
oh noez think of the poor kittensgrey area intimidates some of the tards out of scamming even outside of channel which means more noob retention which means adding to ccps bottom line while retaining concept of sandbox in theory it also creates tears rage and butthurt in vets who have it not thus entertaining me working as intendedah the epitome of goon intellect if i were you id keep quiet theres only one way this can end enjoy the grey area while it still exist
i have a hard time caring about this
its just one lousy channeland you scammers are treating it like someoen ran over your dogyou guys ever spend any time in recruitment seriouslyits bad enough we get the markettards who sell crap in thereyou got localyou got every other public channel out thereccp hanging up a no scamsell zone sign in recruitment means dont pollute the watersin all honesty you people make it harder for us to recruit when your scaring the bloody propects off casue your robbing them blindagaini have no problems with scammingbut this is just one ing channelget over yourselvessheeshgo hang out in jita or something if its that big of a deal or make your own recruitment channelswhy arent you screamnig about not being allowed to scam in the help channel eh stop the evemail spam
this sounds a lot like the war dec rules reasoninglets keep it grey so ccp can just ban people without having a clearcut set of things you can do and things you cant doeven this eventually was put into more black and white terms so as to cut down on the amount of work gms had to do can you imagine all of the petitions escalations and burdens of proof theyd have to go through with this rule having grey areas also makes it harder on the gms unless they literally just start banning people without proving their reasoning because that always ends welli mean if thats what ccp wants to do fine but that doesnt really make sense to me in a sandbox setting where the very essence of player interaction is what drives sales and new players coming to the gamebecause theres a small difference between helping someone learn how to play and inviting someone to a corporation in a game where scamming is not only tolerated but advertised
i for one play the game because of the sandbox not despite itshould the freedom to scam or be scammed be removedthen the sandbox is deadi for one would like to hear from ccp on thisthey seem hell bent on destroying everything they built in order to placate the wow rejects that really never understood what eve had to offer in the first place
i made the relevant part of the motd bold and underlined for those that didnt train reading comprehension to level 5its very clear that no scamming is allowed in the recruitment channel does not say you cannot scam cheat steal and lie your way through every other aspect in eve goons can rest easy now that their main entertainment stream hasnt been removedno more tears required ladies go about your business now
like ive been saying its just one ing channel stop the evemail spam
so what happens when you scam me and i just claim you did it from the recruitment channel you know that channel that is spammed 237you expect me to believe that ccp keeps accurate logs of that this the company that cant tell you if your ship was in a tower or notall you need do is make the claim and with ccps recent heavy handed ban first ask questions later it opens up a world of problemsnot to mention that corp scamming is as old as the game why is it suddenly illegitimate to recruitment scam
so let me get this straight you are saying that as ccp dont keep accurate logs allegedly that if i were to scam you and you cry that it was from the recruitment channel that ccp would check the logs that they supposedly dont keep accurately anyway to see that i did in fact scam you from the recruitment channelif they dont have accurate logs as you claim then what is the  problem scam away they will never be able to prove it according to your theory but i can definitely see a flaw in your river of tears the inaccurate log argument works both ways you are really dumb if you cant see that ccp will probably never check the logs either way for the scammer or for the scammeeonce again for the pl idiots they only asked that you do not scam in the recruitment channel made that last bit stand out for you as you seem to be unable to comprehend the easy bits
bolded the part were all concerned about bub the way thats worded makes actions outside the channel subject to the arbitrary whims of whatever banhappy butanjockey is manning the gm posts nowadays
sigh no you emboldened the part scammers are concerned about i suspect the vast majority of eve doesnt even know there is a recruitment channel even if they did i doubt they would care that plgoons cant get their jollies on scamming the gullibleif you are that worried about being banned dont scam anyone if you dont care scam away
god you are dumb
since you are so dumb that you need everything layed out plainly for you a goon was nice enough to do it for younow the easy opt out for any scam is to say you were first contacted through the recruitment channel you then probably get whatever was scammed back and the scammer bannedi know as dumb as you are that its hard to get your head around that but youwait for itdont need logs to prove any of itall they need do with that wording is suggest you contacted them after you were in the recruitment channel and suddenly theyre a criminal which is stupidrecruitment scamming is an old tradition in eve scamming period is an old tradition in eve thats brought a lot of business this basically kills it in one sentence by giving the person scammed the option of just saying he met me in the recruitment channel then scammed me outside of it
what you mean that channel that opens up every time you join an npc corp or start a new account no this is stupid thats the point eve wouldnt have half its players if it werent for the high profile scams that have gone on in it cited as one of the biggest draws to the game the old ghsc scams
sorry its been a long time since i was in an npc corp or started a new account so i dont really remember which channels were open on default bit sad to be scamming new players as they dont have anything anywayi dont mean to be rude here but i have to call bullshit on 50 of the eve player base only playing because they heard about some scamsi will bet you that in a straw poll the majority of players that joined in the last few years didnt even know about most of the major scamspersonally i think you are all reading too much into this and creating drama where there is noneyou are trying to work out hypothetical scenarios that have no basis in fact scam and get banned when not scamming in the recruitment channel then i will see your point of view until then be careful out thereeven the gms will scam you
im sure goons are smart enough to figure out that the way around this is to have a single representative in the recruitment channel and make the scam recruitment offers from an uninvolved third party arent theyor if it turns out that victims dont need logs to prove that they were scammed you could just contract a heap of stuff to someone you dont like then tell ccp that they recruitmentscammed you omg how easy would that be to exploitwhy are you complaining about this instead of forming new metascamsi swear the reason you guys love the mittani so much is because hes the only one with a brain
well going with your utterly stupid scenario why not just counter claim that he scammed you from the recruitment channel first a doubledouble scam i know as dumb as you are that its hard to get your head around that but youwait for itdont need logs to prove any of itjesus dude use your brain before postingright just to make myself really clear on thisyour argument is anyone can make any claim that they were scammed from the recruitment channel but dont need logs to prove anything if thats the case the argument works in reverse for the scammer tooit all falls apart if the claims made in this thread that ccp dont keep accurate logs and dont check them is pure conjecture and bullshit spread by certain elements in eveeditand by the way the longer you keep this thread going the more chance that people that have been scammed will use this as an excuse so
ccp one step forward with the winter patchthree steps back supporting the standard of retardation and communication blunders
albeit attempting to argue with the empire dwelling pubbies in here ill just add my voice to say i do not like this change to the motd of the recruitment channel
i see a lot of complaints about goonwaffe scamming newbies newbies dont have any isk why would we scam them
ccp still being ccp
i dont know if you can have his stuff but you already have as much sov as him this is a good pointedit this entire thing could be solved by a dev coming in here and saying yes this is our new policy or no this is not our policy
no they dontrecruitment channel can only be managed by gmdevsif thats what it saysits policyperiodim enjoying the oh  panic posts by the scammersnever mind the fact they are only interesting in policing recruitment chatbut it seems everyone wants their tin foil hats and to say the sky is fallingok chicken littles off you go stop the evemail spam
ah another new fool with no conception of ccps schizophrenic history on gm pronouncements at various levels any the logs show nothing idiot can change the channel anyone with experience with the petition system knows that such people are reversed on appeal to higher authority 50 the time and then reversed again and thats reversed once more because icelandersthe first layer of gms are often regarded as a joke they rarely seem to know anything about the game or have more than a nodding relationship with logic thats why someone wants to hear from a higher authority
the only fool here is the one ignoring the obviousbut since you cant see the obviousyou only have yourself to blameso pleasegrow upgrow a brainand go to your cave troll110 stop the evemail spam
dont worry they dont need to argue with you or even try to have a relevant discussion with youall they have to do to make you look dumber than you currently look is flood all the major news outlets with another nasty story about ccptheyve shown theyll revert a change in a heart beat if it causes bad pressstupid goonies spent the summer fixing your game they must be  right
okso quit your subscriptionbecause thats what it really took to get ccp to changelets be honest now my foolish friendoh can i has your stuffs 8 stop the evemail spam
yea bad press totally didnt have anything to do with the subscription numbers or new players trying out for itmy bad
never in the history of the world has an exasperated minion said or done something that contradicted actual policyluckily all it would take to solve this mysterydebatewhathaveyou is a dev coming in here and saying yes this is our new policy or no this is not our policy
drake darconis you know better than this you know full well how the whole ccp thing works and by extension you know full well how this is going to pan out someone is going to get scammed and they are going to use the but i was in the recruitment channel a while ago they must have seen me through that even though the char doing the actual scam isnt even near the recruitment channelyou have to be able to see that in a game where people use neutral alts to provide logistical support to game the system or flip cans etc something like this is going to be abused to get revenge because they were being dumbfucks and got scammed
how about yes this is our policy and it applies to all of eve not just a channel when a dog gets too feisty it gets kicked very smart of you to try to stir up trouble against ccp and rest of eve player base whatever clarification comes it wont be the one you delusional tards are looking forenjoy the gray area while its still around
how about hey why did eve online turn into hello kitty online where everyone is protected from their own stupidity by daddy ccp
if thats what they say thats what they say im not trying to stir up trouble all i am saying the only claim i have made is that this issue could be resolved by a dev coming in here and saying if it is or isnt ccp policythat is the only thing i am claiming that the question as to if this is or isnt ccp policy could be answered by a ccp dev coming in here and saying if it is or isnt
i was having a pretty good then you reminded me there are people as stupid as you out in the world
i can somewhat understand ccp not wanting blatant scam ads clogging up the recruitment channel because of new players even if i dont agree with it but this part right here this includes but not limited to using the recruitment channel as a platform to find or target players to scam is completely  tbhthis will get abusedare all you hurfblurfscammertearsarejuicynomnomretards really not able to see this are you that stupid
dont see the big deal there are many other playeroperated chat channels with no scamming rulesif you dont like the new rule set up your own recruitment channel and advertise itdhd getting banned does more good to eve than all other changes in the winter expansion combined
and those are governed by ccp are they2 hours and 10 minutes to read the post above you and you still post this golfclap
why would anyone look for a new corp in an unofficial recruitment channel which is just like the official one with the added feature that you might get scammed why would any legitimate recruiter be using an unofficial recruitment channel rather than the official ccp approved scamfreezoneperhaps ccp should apply this no sandboxing allowed policy to other aspects of the game maybe a region should be a designated zone for 1v1 combat only where ccp ban anyone who uses dishonourable tactics in pvp maybe highsec ice belts should be a ccpapproved mineronly zone where suicide gankers are banned and all dead hulks are reimbursed by gms maybe jita 44 should be for fair trading only and any form of market manipulation is a petitionable offenceafter all if we dont like the new rules we could always go and sandbox somewhere else
in a player run channel if i break the rules i get kicked from the channelin a ccp run channel i guess i get my account bannedthe main currency in eve is not isk or aur its trust in a player run channel i have to trust that the people running the channel are going to uphold the rules that theyre not colluding with scammers to take my money those people have to earn my trust either directly or through the opinions of other people i already trust in a ccp run channel where scamming is banned it completely removes trust from the equation nobody has to work for my trust because it is provided for them by ccpthis is why this change is stupid
the logs  they show nothing
the recent update of the channel motd is not a policy change scamming was not allowed in the recruitment channel before and it was stated in the previous motd however the channel was still being used to scam players hence the update and clarification of the UFFFDno scammingUFFFD policy for your convenience i have included a copy of the previous motd welcome to the recruitment channel this channel is intended for those players looking to find a new corporation as well as those looking to enlist new players other activities such as nonrecruitment discussion and scamming are not permitted in this channel an additional recruitment source is the alliance and corporation recruitment center section of the forumsgm thunder senior game master eve online customer support
the butthurt by the scammers in this thread is pretty epic but let me try and inject some semblance of reasonat no point did anyone from ccp gm dev or otherwise come out and say scamming is not allowed in our evewhat they did say is quit scamming in this official channel created and moderated by us ccp we dont like itas for the argument that all they have to say is but but they started the scam in recruitment that only works on a small subset of scams to begin withif you post a scam contract in jita and someone accepts it  no problem as long as you didnt spam the damn thing in recruitment which if i understand the rules of the channel you shouldnt be doing anywayyou should be perfectly free to post your leaving eve double your isk scams all over jita local if you like not using the recruitment channel therethe real issue here isnt that ccp is changing what you can do in their channel the real issue is that they suddenly cut off an endless supply of free targets no ones told you you cant keep scamming youre just going to have work a little harder at finding victims
i believe a lol pwnd is in order here
actually by my interpretationhe just clarified the older rule of no scamming in the channel which goons dont do anyway
so now whats going to happen is scammer will sit an alt in the channel and use another character to contact the target never mentioning the recuitment channel but still using it however since the scout is never mentioned there will be no evidence to show that it was used this will result in no real effect except that newbies that also happen to scam will have a harder time scamming idiots to make it have an actual effect you would have to ban recuitment scamming as a whole and that wont end well thus it is probably better to simply warn players not to trust anybody than to try and stop scammers from using the channel for intel
um yeah thats what i was getting at  everyone got all butthurt about this sudden policy change in the channel when in fact nothing changedthus the lol pwnd
except that the clarification raises more questions than it clarifies since it appears to outlaw scammers using recruitment to identify targets but carrying out the scam in another private channel since a huge number of recruitment scams have previously been carried out in this manner i wonder if the gms are prepared for an avalanche of petitions from idiots who were scammed months or even years ago since until this clarification nobody was aware that such activities were prohibited
except the policy has changed theres quite a big difference between you may not scam in this channel and you may not use this channel is any way to aid your scamming because is impossible to prove whether a mark was found through the channel or not we now have a situation where anyone in the recruitment channel is effectively immune to the consequences of their bad decisions
now see there is one pretty big difference with the current motd and the old one this paragraph right here this includes but not limited to using the recruitment channel as a platform to find or target players to scam this paragraph makes you almost invulnerable to any form of scam that involves the scammer talking to the scammee in any way by simply allways be in the recruitment channel and once scammed claim you got targeted through said channel there is also the possibility of using the channel to get ppl banned by fabricating scams and claiming you got targeted through the recruitment channel atleast temporary during an investigation since ccps policy on bannable offences seems to be guilty until proven otherwiseedit tldr yeep beat me to it and made it clearer than i did goddamn goons and their posting prowess
and which part of that was insufficient to the point you had to add and this includes but not limited to using the recruitment channel as a platform to find or target players to scam does this mean that you have outlawed and will return assets and ban people who have scammed if the person being scammed has been in the recruitment channel at the time they got scammed a day before they got scammed a week a monthjust how hazardous have you made scamming with this change
fyi you are not a very astute person this isnt going to protect anyone and will cause nothing but heartache for you and your fellow gms the people this policy is intended to protect newbies dont have anything worth stealing unless theyre dumb enough to plex their way to wealth right after they first subscribe if theyre dumb enough to plex their way to wealth they should be allowed to learn the hard way that easy come easy goif anything youre only going to make things worse underhanded tactics are like sand the tighter you clench your fist the more of them that will slip through your fingersedit btw ccp should probably clarify the consequences for violating this policy that was in place the whole time heh kicked from the recruitment channel banned from the channel return of assets what
stop building walls of cat shit in my sandbox
the current motd states that gms are not responsible for any deals made outside of the channel but it also states that the channel may not be used to find targets this seems like a very vague we might or might not enforce it deal with it clause could you clarify this its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
i find it utterly pathetic that this thread has devolved into spliting hairs and consipiracy theroys has anyone actaully ever been done in by said policya policy thats been in place for a rather long time according to a seinor gmdid it occur to people that most i was scammed petitions are likely tossed unless someone can produce a chat log as it wasare you people really that daftdensestupidwhat is this really aboutseriouslyyou say this policy wont work yet you  and complain your brains outwhat the hell is really the problem here again or is this just a glorified troll the gms and get away with it cause your big and bad and all datthis is just utterly beyond stupid im surprsied the gms havent locked this therad down and told everyone to stfu as your all throwing a damned fit over policies stop the evemail spam
meaning you cant use channel to find targets then pull someone from channel into private chat in order to scam them thus evading rule is it too obvious or were you hoping that the motd doesnt say what it says
it was just implemented so nono the changes went deeper than thatthen why the addition of this includes but not limited to using the recruitment channel as a platform to find or target players to scamwhy didnt it say that then the wording is wide enough that if i were to sit in the channel with this char or a neutral nongoon char and pass on information to another goon who then proceed to scam someone whos in the recruitment channel itd be covered under that rule because wed be using the recruitment channel as a platform to find or target players to scam and since the information about players who are scammable would be transmitted out of game thered be no way for ccp to say either wayin other words gm thunder has with that update created a situation where people will either be able to petition any and all scams theyve endured if theyve logged in to the recruitment channel or hes created a rule which is unenforcable and as such will only make people who do get scammed by people who arent in the recruitment channel all the angrier because theyll be under the impression theyre safe because theyre in that channel
this here sums it up nicelyand yes i admit the second point i made has conspiracy theory written all over it but in my experience what can be abused sooner or later will be abused
with the way the newrevised policy is now stated it leaves even more loopholes and unanswered questions than the previous policy of course people want clarification rather than simply running around like useless sheeple especially when something they find enjoyableprofitable for their continued enjoyment of the game overall is threateneda clear proper fullyformed response from the gms is needed here with detailed explanations of just exactly how the recruitment channel may and may not be used whether or not people may use the recruitment channel as they have for years with compiled precedent to back up their previous usages in regards to using the channel to get marks into separate conversations and whether or not the changes to the channel motd reflect changes in the gms handling of scamming cases in regards to the recruitment channel that were previously not authored in any viewable form to the playerbase
lmao this still going oh dear god i love how some people in this thread assume the rest of eves as underhanded devious and as much a douche as they arewhy assume anyone will cry wolf about being in the recruitment channel whilst being scammed when they are nothell most of eve probably didnt even notice the change until this thread chances of it actually being used in an underhanded manner have gone up significantly now that youve put the thought in their tiny minds dont you think way to go and shoot yourself in the foot guys golfclap
does this guy really not understand that he has made a substantial policy change by including the platform clause not clarification that was clearly not included beforeif this is a considered and purposeful policy change then fine if it is one gm changing the rules on a key issue at his own whim then he should get the chop asap
nobody scams newbies you dumb  they dont have anything to scamthey scam vets looking for new corps
meh i always assumed the people who fell for the goon recruitment scams were people who coldcalled the goons looking to join because they heard about the goons elsewhereit should be pretty obvious if someone posts looking for corp in recruitment and you scam them 15 minutes later that you violated the rule recruit in local set up a recruitment channel of your own and follow the rule not that hard
uh scuse mewhat is this bs over the little so called statement of we dont scam noobsthats utter tripestop fooling yourselvesyou scam because you cananyoneanywhereanytimeexcept therewhich is got your shorts in a twist to be sureagainutter pathetic epic fail stop the evemail spam
so if i stumble upon someone in local whos also in recruitment and i scam them whats to stop them from reporting me to ccp for using the recruitment channel to target him
just because they hear about them doesnt mean they do themthe player base is heavily weighted towards highsec and with it carebearsthats just how it is according to ccps own numbersmost of the money is in highsec not lownullsecif all of lownullsec quit tomorrow eve would stagger a bit and probably survive just fineif all of highsec including the carebears quit tomorrow
it seems logical that a lot of the null seccers are more experienced players who like the chairman of csm6 have not paid for a subscription with cash for a long time ccp would go from a dynamic player controlled based microtransactional economy to a micro profit making company rapidly at the very least it would hamper their ability to maintain developmentas a person who enjoys this game i want to see it flourish and not wither on the vine just because a contingent of whiny afraid to undock alone players want their sandbox frozen in time an only get game improvements that increase their already huge advantage over other players
are you still going on about how buying plex is losing ccp moneyand youre still seriously going on about whiny afraid to undock alone players while youre sitting in hisec
i dont live in high sec  you should have asked first  and yes hive players are afraid to undock alone  know your own history its easy to research  hive players are the ones who were not smart enough to fis without getting sploded all the time so they swarm together so they can achieve a safety in numbers like any group of rl gang members they are basically gutless imo
ok so youre not in hisec but youre still going on about how buying plex is losing ccp money
zim i feel it only fair that i disclose that i am not a child or a college age young adult who is regurgitating stuff they have only read about without real world experience i have been an employee of a large corp as well as starting  running my own business llc in real life i am a 100 capitalist but not without a moral compass now that my employees do the work i have time to play online games and dabble in other enjoyable distractions with my time when no disasters require my direct intervention while i am here at the officei can tell you most business models are more profitable when they have a clean connection between their product and its consumers middlemen and volume discounts reduce that maximum profit potential in measurable ways why anyone would argue that is not an easily provable fact is just amazingsince the exact figures are ccps confidential data we can fairly only discuss business models in these forums the models i use are pretty difficult to ignore by anyone really trying to have an exchange of ideas if you have access to facts that make my models inaccurate in regard to how ccp financials are actually being distributed collected please share them and i will update my comments to reflect your input absent that my model stands waiting for a better one to replace it
if you were to run an mmo would you implement a way for people to buy timecodes for less than they would pay if they did a pay pr 1 month subscription
based on the success i perceive that ccp is enjoying i would think i would but that of course would be tempered by what my profitability models projected i would have to take in to grow the company free products find other ways to support themsleves like endless commercial pop ups which most online users dislike and think uniformly would hate to see in eve the we got ganked pop up in the forums being an annoying examplei dont see the ccp employees owners as being the clueless dolts that the current csm chairman often portrays them to be instead i see a pioneering company that is changing the face of online gaming and is on the precipice of merging macpc and game console playing into one immersive player driven universe i want that to be successful tbh i need ccp to be successful because of the concept of mutual self interest as long as they keep making money i can enjoy this growing evolving complex game
actually i just checked i pay 15mo for my month to month subscription and ccp sells 60 day timecodes for 35
 this  plex do not lose ccp moneyi sub yearly  10 per month give or takeyou use plex  1750 per monthwhos making ccp more isk per month hmmlook dont even bother saying that it costs anywhere near 750 a month for them to keep the plex rng running
are you saying that only ccp sells plex this is not true online merchants legally sell plex do you know how much they get to keep and how much they have to pay to ccp to get the plex to sell are you sure ccp has a flat rate that they charge all resellers of plex regardless of the volume of their sales of course you dont know so you sit in front of your keyboard tapping in your opinion and pretend they are facts good luck with that
 you prove my point company direct to  consumer  maximum profit is it really that hard to understand
i came to eve from a retail box product in a game store chain the product cost 1499 us dollars out of that 1499 ccp had to pay for production shipping and the retail merchants profit if i had bought directly from eve online they would have had all the costs i just listed eliminated and made more profit but in business the concept of loss leaders  discounts work did ccp make maximum profits on that first sale no they did not they traded that short term profit for the chance to make a long term consumer out of a new customer in my case it was a good investment on their part i cant tell you how long ill have to stay a subscriber even at the lowest annual rate for ccp to be fully reimbursed for the related costs to attract new players but i would guess they have a business model that doesbecause that is the way successful businesses operate they know their costs within a time frame and then project what sales goals over that time frame will get them to the profit point they have targeted
um ok youre either changing what youre arguing or youre awful at elucidating what it is that youre actually arguing because what i thought you were arguing was how plexes and by extension people who use them to keep their accounts up and running were costing ccp money now youre saying that what you really meant was that fex shatteredcrystal is getting the 60 day gtcs for less than 35 and selling them on for 35 so obviously ccp is losing moneytheres a few things youre not taking into account when making this assertation however and thats the fact that the gtcs ccp are selling are physical items that are sent to you via post this costs money which means that while ccp is getting 35 in the end result is less shatteredcrystal probably purchase these in bulk and as such probably gets a discount they scan it in put it in a database and waits for people who needs a gtc to purchase one from them its sent to the customer via email which doesnt cost much shatteredcrystal wins ccp winsin fact ccp probably wins for multiple reasons when you can get the gtc within half an hour or less after youve ordered it youre more inclined to actually buy it than if you have to buy it and wait a few days for it to arrive in your physical mailbox so the velocity of the gtcs is higher
i admit to sometimes being awful at how clearly i may say things that quickly gets multiplied when someone is trying to protect their tearful leader they attack a comment that is clearly factual because it put their icon in a poor light i believe the business model that best supports the long term viability of ccp is what should be advocated by players who voluntarily stepped up to accept elected titles to work on behalf of the greater good of the greater player base to do less is shortsighted destructiveness
pray tell which comment have i attacked which is clearly factual
ok so back to square 1  ccp does not lose money on selling gtc as compared to a sub  we all agree on this apparentlygtc have an opportunity cost associated with them for ccp  sell them to us poor slobs at 35 per or sell them to eg shatteredcrystal for say 2750 per who then sell them to us at 35 per now were assuming its a i sell to you you sell to the players relationship between ccp and shattered crystal et al and not a youre just getting a portal to our rng and well pay you n per month based on how many gtc you sellsince neither of the parties you me other posters has access to the volume sold from one source or the other or the sales model we can assume that ccp makes up for the differences between direct sales which they do and selling through resellers via sheer volume sold at the other retail outlets if they didnt then they probably would encourage buying from them directly rather than through the likes of shattered crystalbox sets like you bought are simply another avenue for them to get people hooked so they start paying their 10  15 per month and may seriously just be a breakeven product assuming a certain number of accounts sub that month
prey tell isnt that what forum tears are made of lol i was not reflecting on your comments zim even if i dont agree with you you have demonstrated the willingness to follow a discussion to a conclusion
why not just move your locked targets to another part of the screen would be easier than ccp allocating their dwindling workforce to work on a very small problem especially as distance to target is on the overview anyway
i didnt know you could move the locked icons on the top of your screen anywhere
i play a fair bit of fallout new vegas and one thing that keeps me coming back even though ive got 500h of gametime on it is that i havent completed all the achievements sometimes i wonder what to do next in eve we already have the medal system so perhaps medals could be corp awarded or concord awarded this already exists to a limited extent with fw imagine if you could make these public in your toontitan kill medalbillion tonne destroyed medalmajor power leadership director of exec corp of alliance with 1000 membersmined a million units of asteroidscircumnavigation bronzesilvergoldunobtanium  visited 255075100 of the eve systemsmaster interdictor scrammedbubbled 1000 shipsdeep space adventurer completed 100 sites in 00etc there could be levels of each bronzesilver etc that would supersede each other with the entry levels being friendly and low for new players they should all reflect actual gameplay accomplishments instead of just training
dear god consolitis in eve too
personally i like achievements i would vote for them
we already have certificates and corps can award medals for anything they can think of both of these can be made publickills stats are again public on the various killboards so we do already have these things in placethink ccp have better things to be getting on withdont support this idea at all
no because there are so many things in this game which arent something that an achievement system could monitor also because there are so many ways people would just game the system to get more achievementsi dont see it adding any play value to the game and will actually hurt fleet performance when the guy you need to be doing one thing goes off and does something else so he can get some stupid medal
from the other thread the biggest fight seems to be that offgrid ganglink ships do have a counter probing but probing these ships is rather difficultwhy not have a significant stacking penalty for activating many many ganglinks like boosting sig radiusslowing the ship down if you want an basically unscannable offgrid booster that can move with any kind of speed you have to use only one maybe two links if you want 6 ganglinks your ship will be hella slow with a massive sig which can be easily probed
my god the tears adapt or die
i like you can i keep you as a pet
this was recently postedfirst off id like to recommend we all refer to this as the skunkworks warning if you dont know why get over to cp to find out what weve been up to that is the likely cause of this okay fine dont but i will i cant speak for all the members of skunkworks but i have been advocating for this change since we started all this two weeks ago i have no objection to this as i agree its not right that someone can commit an act which yields aggression without knowing theyve done so as ive said before sometimes the best way to get something fixed quickly is to abuse the hell out of it until ccp has to move over 200 highsec incursion kills in two weeks is apparently enough to cause a patchthat said this patch removes the last justification for logis not inheriting the 60 second timer that prevents them from docking or using gates to escape aggression theres no excuse for them to be allowed to aid someone engaging in aggression without being flagged for that aggression as well so this is my proposala logistics pilot cannot dock or jump through a gate until 60 seconds after they stopped repairing an aggressing target or their rep targets own aggression timer runs out
not supported its a logi it cant shoot you bring more dps
remote support is a force multiplier and either enhances the performance of the supported ship or hinders the performance of its enemy they shouldnt get a free pass just because they dont directly fire on anyoneedit ive never lost a ship to the neutral rr whores who dwell in highsec ive even killed a few its about making the game mechanics consistent and reasonablealso youve demonstrated a consistent lack of comprehension of how aggression mechanics work in other threads im not sure youre particularly qualified to comment on this with any kind of authority
honestly im all for this change me and my buddies used to use neutral rrs in highsec all the time then we got broed of it i guess we just got over analytical about it one day and reasoned that in rl you get in trouble for aiding and abbeding criminals so why not in eve after that discussion about 4 or so months ago we just got bored of the tactictldr this makes highsec pvp more balanced and less onesided  riskfree makes sense logically and encourages more people to recruit suicide australians for their gankfleets all reasons im happy for this change
i do agree that logis shouldnt walk off scotfree when repping someone who has an aggression timer or whatnot however you cannot make the 60 second gatestation aggression timer be refreshed to its full 60 seconds each time you rep someone with said timer otherwise the 60 second timer will keep bouncing back and forth between capchaining andor mutually tanking logistics ships rendering them unable to disengage from the fight with the gangs dps this leads to the logistics becoming separated from the dps ships they dockjump through you dont because your timer is going and going and going andor simply being forced to sit there and get blown up unable to tank the incoming dps by buffer and speedsig alone which will make logis worse than worthless in lowsec among other thingsfor more details see aamrrs thread in the assembly hall speaking to the same topic
so shut down your cap chain so you can dockjumpbetter yet ccp fixes this right so that this is taken into account and aggression cant be recycled in this way it has to come off a target that is truly aggressing
fixing pve with incursion therapywhat i am about to suggest here is incredibly radical i mean the text book definition of the word not the UFFFDthatUFFFDs totally radical manUFFFD version if your happy with pve the way it is in eve do not read the rest of this post because what iUFFFDm suggesting will drive you nuts just back out and forget you saw thistldr all rats are racial incursion rats wherever you find themratting changesinstead of offering racial incursions have each system be as if its under a racial incursion all the time minus the whole control penalties and warning sirens etc system security status no longer determines the size of the rats but the frequency a racial incursion rat will appear in a system after its destroyed 10 noob systems will have 0 chance of rats spawning considering if an incursion style rat appeared in a belt it would wipe out anything there there dps and tank will be equivalent to sanshas yes omni damage as well these rats will also be smart enough to warp off if theyUFFFDre loosing a fight to encourage players to pack tacklethis takes care of ratting bots because these rats wont be able to be soloUFFFDd any longer this is the big change to missionseach mission will be like a small incursion that can be run by 5 10 people gates will be present at all of them to limit ship entry type just to make it interesting this means lvl 1 UFFFD 4 will be less about quantity of rats and more about what size ships get used to run themhow do you make t1 frigates not suck in these mini incursions all though assault ships will be preferable for dps and survivability the incursion rats that would appear in these lvl 1 missions would have bad tracking so a t1 frigate could still evade their fire merlins and punishers people will dig for these similar adjustments must be made for other t1 ships like cruisers and bc clearly bs can handle incursions of all sorts weUFFFDve seen this lvl 0 missions old school lvl 1 missions nubs have to cut their teeth on something they can soloa lvl 1 mission would be like only taking down a hand full of ships in a single wave with maybe one trigger for an additional wave frigates assault ships t1 t2 logi destroyersa lvl 2 mission would be like taking down two waves with a couple of triggers for additional waves frigates assault ships t1 t2 logi  recons and t1 cruisersa lvl 3 mission would be like taking down three waves with a couple of triggers for additional waves frigates assault ships hacs battle cruisers t1 t2 logi  recons t1 cruisersa lvl 4 would essentially be a full on vanguard anything youUFFFDd use for a vanguardother then isk and faction standing each type of mission lvl 1 UFFFD 4 must have unique rewards maybe in lvl 1UFFFDs thereUFFFDs a very small chance you might get a really rare implant or bpc dropping like 1 in 10 maybe in lvl 4UFFFDs your likely to get a decent implant and bpc more often 1 in 3 lvl 2 UFFFD 3 could be in between these in varying degrees or maybe mission rewards you can exchange for aurum the idea hear is lvl 1 4 missions arenUFFFDt about you work through one to get to the other but to offer different kinds of missions for people to fly you want a big bs fleet fight great run a level four you want to tear it up with assault ships do a lvl 1 each fight will have a different feel to them you know how people say which makes more isk faster lvl 3 or steady lvl 4UFFFDs people should ask themselves these questions about all these types of missions the only thing that should limit a groups income from group missions should be the ships they fly in them and there technique not the mission levelagro will have to be managed in most of these who ever warps in to the incursion first gets agro is how incursions currently work then rats cycle their targets that may have to change with these where every one gets into position the tank gets in position pulls agro reps start up and people start laying on the dpsif it doesnUFFFDt already exist there needs to be a threat table for ewar like 1ecm 2 sensor damps 3tracking disruptors 4target painters anything that makes a rat loose their lock clearly would make their group go ballistic if sensor damps set to range disruption could potentially make a rat loose their lock this would pull agro from rat groupsif ccp increased the number of agents in null sec their wouldnUFFFDt be a need anomilies at all because the rewards would be comparable ded complexes would have to be probable incursion missions essentially that are staticsome people are saying at this point its impossible for noobs to figure this out i say with the right npe teaching them about transversal and ewar etc you could lets face it pve in hack and slash mmoUFFFDs is already that complicated run a 5 or ten man dungeon in any mmo and thereUFFFDs tons of steps and dos and donUFFFDts to win sticky fights its what makes pve relatively interesting in those games were merely applying the same philosophy to our game and ours happens to have a more complicated interface face roll left click doesnUFFFDt win the day all the time in evethese changes could clearly increase the relevance of mission running corps these missions need to have multiple objectives destroy a prototype battle ship and blow up the ship yard that built it too to do that you have to move explosives to a can next to it or farm them off spawns till those explosives drop something along the lines of that i do agree with the wrong kind of npe new players will find even in groups these missions impossible but with the right npe experience and a little player given guidance they will apply the same things they have learned in hack and slash party mmoUFFFDs to ours your not corrupting eve with the features of a on the rail hack and slash mmo your giving players from those games a reference point into our vibrant dynamic world
change sov null sanctum and belt rats to incursion rats this will fix sov null not supported for rest

fixing mining heterogeological asteroids mining asteroids that have a variety of ore in theminstead your overview shows the cubic meters of an asteroid estimatedyour surveyor then shows the ore content of the asteroid in percentagesyou lock the asteroid and as you activate your mining laser you go into focus mode where youUFFFDre zoomed in on the asteroid you actually see the veins of ore in it then you set coordinates for your mining lasers to travel across the surface of the asteroid how this interface works could be stripped from pi its just visually it would look different these targeting coordinates would appear as little icons on the asteroid you would essentially rotate the asteroid and pin them to the surface of it each time you did this you would have to put down the same number of coordinates and there would have to be a minimum distance to set them apart to get max yield on the rock so for instance lets say you scrunch all your coordinate markers together on a omber vein in a roid if theyUFFFDre too close together you might get more omber content in your yield but far less m3 in your yield over all then if you would have set them the proper length apart the more of those points that land on an ore vein give you more of that ore until its gone once the cycle is done you will need to repeat the process or if the ore you want is gone from the asteroid switch to another one that has it in order for this to work cycle times and yield would have to be increased for normal mining lasers for this to be viable it could probably stay the same for strip miners and since ice only yields one unit a pop im not sure how best to alter the yield on ice miners itUFFFDs a puzzle slightly similar to how pi works why reinvent the wheelcongratulations bot mining is dead the peasants rejoice this could give people the opportunity to get small amounts of rarer ores in higher sec small traces of low sec ore would be found in empire and small traces of null sec ore would be found in low sec the roids containing the best mixes of rare ores would appear null sec this also solves the wh conundrum you just set it where worm holes are a complete mixed bag all there roid ore content is completely random and not based off high low null asteroid ore content rules maybe to limit intake you just have it be where the c class of the wh determines the size of the asteroids in italso the different varietyUFFFDs of a single ore could appear in only certain areas of space take veldspar in empire mining a roid with veldspar would only be basic veldspar but in lowsec it would be condensed velds and in null sec it would be dense veldsparthis would either give an opportunity to add more mining skillsanother isk sink or create more roles for the present mining skills very much like in pi some or one of your mining skills would be about locating the ore veins on each roid accurately this adds an element of technique and exploration to mining people who whine about this being too involved should be glad this change could actually makes it engaging to mine if its that hard to do guess what once the bots vanish and people stop mining because they have to put their book down every 5 mins and take three minutes to scan and mark mineral prices will go up and people will want to do it again actual animation for mining could get slightly more interesting because of a change like this as the laser pulses it also could get moved around like its tracking the coordinates that were placed on the roidwhich ever laser cycles first your or others grabs the yield to kill carpal tunnel inducing click this stuff has to be simple right click hold spins the asteroid left click drops a pin maybe a little slider thingy to show ore content and concentration like in pi to those that like to mine with like 6 characters and a 7th in an orca if you cant your competition cant you can still get the hulk out their and the orca if people are wielding fewer accounts at once thereUFFFDs fewer minerals on the market people will pay more for them and you will still make a killing while at the same time pulling more UFFFDactual individualsUFFFD into the noble but maligned profession of mining ccp if your worried youUFFFDll loose money because of this you wont people who mine with that many accounts pay for them with plex thatUFFFDs why they doplease believe me when i say iUFFFDm not trying to butcher some one elseUFFFDs cash cow iUFFFDm just trying to make mining more interesting and screw botters at the same time
it would be useful to have a motd for a gangfleet channel where basic fleet information such as ship types could be posted making fleet administration somewhat easier original 2008 proposal2008 csm submissionlast reference i could find to this idea was 2008 and i think its worth revisiting
off topic posts removed please stay on topic and polite
undecided on this onealthough it does seem trivial it does add a little more depth to evehowever there are other more important things to take up ccps time so i would probably add that one to the nice to have if you have a spare moment category
another thread that i hope ccp totally ignoretotally disagree with the op agree with everyone elsefact of eve life someone will always be at a disadvantage due to tz issues either put up with it or move to iceland
as it should be what you would like is for these ships to be even more vulnerable than they already areminers already have the worst job and worst pay in the game with the highest risk because they are in the worst possible combat capable ships   shields armor repsand youd like to nerf mining even more because youre a piece of  grats 
now that ccp are doing stuff id like to see one of the longeststanding gameplay issues get a little attentionso imagine that you put a 500m bounty on malcanis whom im sure we all agree richly deserves it under the current system i will simply jump to an empty clone and pod himself with an alt collecting your 500 mill less the cost of a new clone malcanis 480000000 you 0 the current system is worthless to youtransferrable killrights tied to bounty contracts with payouts based on hull and destroyed module value are the most obvious solution with plenty of scope to make exploitation reasonably difficult that stops me using a joe random alt to create the bounty although it might enourage me to use bait alts i am ok with people doing thisfor instance we could design the contract system so that the person placing the bounty contract can restrict who can accept that bounty by taking a cue from the fleet finder the bounty contract could be restricted to people in my corp people in my alliance people i have set a positive standing or even anyone i havent set a negative standing or just anyone the looser the restrictions you set the more people can accept it and show me their ammo but the greater the chance that someone you dont want to accept it ie me or my friends will be able to collectlikewise bounty hunters could accept for themselves for their corp or for their alliance bounty contracts accepted on behalf of corpalliance are paid direct to corpalliance when collected this is to encourage the formation of bounty hunting corpsalliances who would encourage aggrieved bountyplacers to set them blue and who would thereby depend on their reputations it allows groups of less powerful players to work together to collect a bounty but it also allows for solo bounty hunters bounty hunting corps which carelessly allow malcanis alts into their ranks to steal the bounty contracts will quickly lose their reputation and be excluded from further businessand the payout per kill on the bounty should be limited to less than the irretrievable loss from that kill allowing the bounty payout to cover multiple losses if its high enoughunder the system i envisage i would have to have an alt who is in a corp or alliance youve set to ve standings to even accept the bounty contract that 500m bounty would then be paid out according to the losses that i suffer for example if my clone costs 20 mill then the bounty paid for podding me would be 10m if i was wearing a pair of 4 implants which cost 12m 12k lp from the lp store then a further 24m gets paid for podding me likewise the bounty paid for destroying my ship would be 23 of the effective npc value of the hull  which we could usefully define here as the cost of a platinum insurance premium so if someone blows my maelstrom up they get 35m or so cant recall the exact valueafter the killrights expire so does the bounty contract with any remaining unpaid bounty being repaid it might be worth extending killrights to 60 or 90 days or possibly making them cumulative but i am against making them last indefinitelythis way even if i do manage to somehow get my alt in a position to accept the bounty i will find it difficult and unprofitable to use that alt to collect it not impossible but at least that way the bounty you place is very far from simply being a free gift as it is now
sounds much better then the current implementation where ppl use it to look cool in overview that will effect all suicide gankersso at least the goons will not support it sadly
looks like a sound plan from a quick glance and certainly a huge improvement over the current totally useless bounty systemtry to obsess about goons a little less the topic has nothing to do with them and from personal experience they are generally supportive of ideas that improve the overall gameplay in eve
thats funny because i do actually i know its a shocking thought but there has to be lots of people in the game for us to be able to scam and grief effectively the better this game is in general the better our game gets even if it means that we ruin the game for some people who are too gullible by scamming themas to malcanis suggestion i know i said in the other thread that i saw some holes but i reread the proposal a second and third time and the holes i thought were there isnt actually there or if theyre there theyll need someone with more time to spare than i have it seems a fairly solid suggestion and it would certainly make the act of actually putting a bounty on someone worthwhile instead of just being the free gift it is now
actually i just thought of something whats to stop someone from essentially griefing someone by repeatedly putting up a bounty a gentlemans agreement
the bounty contract requires a killrightincidentally in addition to the ability to restrict the contract offer to corpalliancestandings id like to add the ability to restrict the offer based on sec statusedit i just realised that the bounty contract doesnt require a killright if the bounty is placed on someone with 500 or lower sec status anyone could put a bounty on a red flashy criminal and grief them with bounties forever i am fine with this if people actually start doing this it will be a fine boost for losec if any criminals get sick of being bountyhunted theyre free to rat their sec up at which point the killright on them due to sec status effectively expires and the bounty contracts on them become invalid
the bounty system has needed fixing as long as i can remember supported
a similar idea was proposed a few weeks ago working up a proposal is on my todo list
excellent a working bounty system will solve so many hisec issues and create some really good gameplay possibilitiesthe important thing is to plug as many of the exploitation holes as possible and i like to think ive struck a good balance with my proposalcoming up this weekend malcs thoughts on wardecs
supported
value for value this is the core of working bountyhunting system everything else is flavor
being able to restrict who can accept your contract is pretty important too
something i thought of but havent really worked through all the details of what if the bounty hunter was paid out from a mixture of the bounty on the targets head and the criminals normal insurance payout
nah im not in favour of that because it penalises legitimate gameplay the idea is to promote pvp not discourage it
yep missed that oneagreed
have it be that you can only put up a bounty after a concord recognized act of unprovoked aggression against you low or highsec that causes a ship loss and or pod loss within the same time frame you have killrights when in station in the bounty thingy people with kill rights can apply bounty to any ones they have kill rights forbut yea any sort of loopholeexploit should be fixed or we could have a worse problem then a unused feature
that onewhich i think is more elegant in its simplicity even though it eschews the topic of killrights baby steps you know 
they will
doesnt exactly mean anything but a dev blowing smoke out of his ass until there is an official dev blog on the matter any dev that wants to step up to the plate and let us know what the current plans are in regard to this threadyou are more than welcome to
basically just create a system similar to pieach asteroid is targetted scanned and redgreen sectors are present on the roid to show mineral depositsred areas are targetted and mining commencesasteroid changes size approximately every x numbers of cycles after minerals are drained and roid is pulled apart slowly by operationsrescan and recommence mining on new sectorsstop the devaluation of iskbotters  rmt  plex  isk becomes less worth the effort real miners have to put in  less miners  more botters able to find a foothold in the marketkill all bots
kill all bots
yeah sorry fixed 
ok but let me point this out to you generating this similar to pi takes a few seconds to get in and out of and assuming you haev an alt watching the belt so you know that a ganker jst warped in it would still take you a while to exit out and run all i see is this making it easier for gankers to nab miners since miners would be zoomed in on a roid and unable to see the area around them
wait you mean miners arent half afk and are actually paying attentionthat said bots use ocr so no it wont stop botting
yes lets over complicate mining to an extreme levelvery bad bad ideanot worstbut not good either stop the evemail spam
supported for hull tankingbaby my love is bomb come on the bomb the twist
1 i dont run incursions so i have little personal interest in making them profitable outside of some faction items i sell to those who do2 i am interested in risk vs reward as a driving force in eve in general i do a bit of bounty lp whoring for casual play and income depending on the agents yield this earns 4060 mil an hour i use a somewhat bil or so give or take expensive ship because i just want to run them fast and get on to other elements of the game that are less profitable and more interesting so your math of a consistent 80mhr means that an incursioner in a ship that costs twice as much as my mission boat is earning 140200 of what i am in addition to this he has to have a trusted team online at the same time and coordinated enough to make dozens of jumps in which time they are not earning anything to start earning their iskies for the day both of us are at fairly low risk their reward is higher for a lot more effort and organization than i can be bothered with that does not seem unfair to me raising the payouts in null sec is probably a good idea given that holding sov securely takes a hell of a lot more organization and involves a lot more risk as far as i can see the highest reward for the lowest risk in hisec is ganking and ninjaing both involve minimal risk when done competently and have large payouts for the time invested if risk v reward is your concern take a peek at that dynamic
ok gainking in hs is a compleatly different matterthe effort of moving to a different incursion system is totaly on the player the fleet that he will most likely join is already running incursions and when he gets there he will join a fleet from one of the incursion channels and hay presto hes now making bank for minimal effortin actuality when a dedicated incursion runner will remain in one constellation for the duration of the incursion sticking to 13 systems for vanguards when that incursion dies the channel moderators pick new incursion focuss for their respective tanking choices and travel to the designated constellation they will rinse and repeat this so travel times dont relay factor in to it all that much as stated b4 a change to payout of the isk would bring incursions in line with other hs pursuits while still retaining the edge in iskphnote that i dont want to change pl payouts if anything i would increase all lp rewards by 25 after all concord lp is the most versatile non transferable asset in game
i just threw ganking in as the high end of low risk high reward hisec activities though ninja has it beat what i was really pointing out is the degree of effort and coordination to me implies that incursions should pay significantly better than missions i dont have to wait for missions to spawn i do not have to cultivate a motivated coordinated group of individuals to run missions i can decide to get on and earn for an hour and stop without risking losing this support infrastructure to someone who plays more often if i have a 60 hour week and do not play much my agent still has a slot open for me what i am saying is a get an awful lot of latitude for earning a little bit less which seems fair to me
so can recons have a smaller sig too bellicose sig 110 rapier sig 130 iirc
as a fellow recon pilot i could get behind that  but id rather see the eafs get some love we have other tricks up our sleeves as recon pilots
supported eafs are a deadend skill not needed for progression to another hull are seen as generally poor ships and too expensive for what they do anything done to change this is for the better

good reply and good information to knownow about my missing ogre iis
yeah i put a billingaccounting enquiry in well over 24 hours ago still nothingits basically keeping me from playing admittedly i caused the issue but still taking a long time to even get an answer as to if they are willing to fix itkinda blows your averages out of the wateredit although also i think our gms are pretty nice and decent guys ive sat and chatted with them over questions i had a few times and got myself some decent answers to questions had i asked the questions on the forums the threads wouldve just been trolled to deathie not just a machine based automaton like gms in wow etc they have opinions and will answer if asked pretty cool that they will do that
i dont think you understand the concept of average
i replied to your petition now and hopefully the issue is fully resolved
surely is thanks a heapsee what i mean
i recently had a character stuck issue where an old cyno alt of mine needed to go through the character creation process  a gm contacted me then requested permission to log into my account and created a character on my behalf i had done this process of creation before but this particular character wasnt cooperatingthe gm  gm libra luna  was even nice enough to reply to my thank you and have a great weekend response i have to say i felt good as a player and a customer having had what felt like a personalized interaction with one of our gm team membersso while not always convinient my personal experience is that having something tangible for a gm to compare against ie log server helps protect all players  thought granted the log needs to be much much better  could you imagine the 1000s of petitions when someone in goons or another major alliance find a bug and then all go crazy using it to justify a replacement requestone question i have for gm panzerin games i have played previously the gms work off an unofficial policy that first replacement request is always no this then weeds out bogus claims only those players that demand an escalation are taken seriously and then their petition is actually investigatedrather than ask if ccp applies this specific procedure and create emo rage for the community services department  let me ask if this tends to be the industry standard on handling petitions and if ccp has the same or different more innovative approach to handling reimbursement requests such as clearer filters to distinguish between items lost in a stationhangar and something lost due to combat
also one thing more comes to mindgm panzer has the customer relations department ever considered internally maintaining a metric on players that submit legitimate reimbersement requests as opposed to those that attempt to abuse the systemnot suggesting any pilot be singled out for past offenses but wonder if this has ever been done in the pastconsidered attempted or is currently done to improve efficiency by improving routing of petitions based on prioritizationthis way even a repeat offender will still get his hearing with a gm but it may not necessarily be as fast as someone that has always submitted legitimate petitions
but how do you determine if a request is legitimate or not since the logs never show anything for my case as an example how is ccp going to prove that i wasnt stuck
ya it would be nice to see them all changed in some aspect change how station games play out
oh no im not saying its not a fair request or anything just pointing out there are ways around it atm that dont require ccp to do anythingi hate the gallente outposts because of the stupid spine things when you undock forever getting stuck on themmake all outposts egg shaped same docking range and no stupid spine things i can get stuck on
then you get banned which improves the eve experience for the rest of us

i personally think that all scamming thats not at a corporate security level should be bannedno market scams no corp joining scams just noif someone wants to join a corp and take its wallet that is a different thing that has more to do with the corp internal security preying on individuals is a different matter its not new player friendly and certainly shouldnt be allowed in the recruitment forum1 ccp

i would like to say that i will continue playing eve in the middle to long term though certain cosmetic restrictions are anoyingi have played many mmos and half of them have gone free 2 play with microtransactions with the world economy as it is now is a good time to consider the following1 microtransactions have a wide scope of services1a eve could go free 2 play  example would mean smaller client download size install content as required if you have say only 1 character slot  and only the region of space for your race say can only fly around in amarr space since you chose that race buy from ingame store other space regions 1b buy other services like character slots and this could be expanded1c ingame store currency could be acquired through selling special loot items to npc vendor  real world currency  a 6 or 12 month subscriber would get x amount of ingame store currency per month2 the content which you might not want would be to walk around in space stations 3 player owned space stations could have custom design interiors and exteriors based on the content bough from the ingame store through microtransactions4 going to the planets surface could also be extra content from the storenow is the time to work and perfect a microtransaction system that works for eve before eve is just left with the addictselse you end up with the following scenario1 those who play eve are addicts1a the addicts will try and play for free buy exchanging isk for game time1b even if addicts have 2 out of 10 accounts funded by subscriptions and they do not buy etc since they have enough iskthen who buys the etc for the addicts to use to keep the other accounts running2 if the number of active accounts who are on a subscription fall below y  of x  then ccp will need to rethink their payment optionsi have one example now you might not be interested in this mmo  but they failled to create the free 2 play properly and just limited it to a zonea better solution like champions online  dc universe online  star trek online  age of conan online  lord of the rings online although lotro went f2p in late q3  start of q4 in 2010  you have to wonder what free 2 play with a correct that works for eve would do not only to the number of unique players not those with multiple characters and accounts but also the revenue for ccp final example is world of tanks mmo from wargamingnet and is doing very well for its self since it is completely free 2 play but has a prestiege elite mode which is only unlocked through gold currency which you can buy for real world money or by winning eventsthis is all pure speculation but as i said above now is the time to develop a business subscription hybrid model using microtransactions for eve and do i need to remind everyone about the italian and greek debt the countries have the global finacial pain will not go away for a few years maybe with us for the rest of this decade
everything about your proposal is an abomination no
op please get in the biomass queuejust follow the arrows it will all be over soon
firstly i find those replies to my op and proposal very narrow minded my opinion on those who reply without even picking apart the ops original post is even lower to just say its wrong  abomination and fail to have any proper criticism is really poorto me you are like a politician with high levels of national debt and you just want to put you head in the sand ignore any problems and hope it goes away the other view is that you are just rich and pay UFFFD13140 per account and you have 10 accounts  well in that case you are just trying to escape life spend your money as you see fit and ignore the world around youto download the client is 4gb  with limited free 2 play and microtransactions this could be a 1 to 15 gb download then content and systems could be installed in a few 500mb packseven with highspeed broadband 4gb for some can take a while and now both traffic management and shaping profiles via isps to prevent bit torrent hogs and the heavy filesharingthe modular client works well with microtransactions yes i know my proposal is a double edged sword and i doubt if everyone will like it i know former players of eve may return and anything which would increase the number players all connected at the same time can only be a good thing for ccpyou have to remember than ccp though privately owned still had to employ people and pay salaries even if ccp may or may not be for profit anything that increases market share of the mmo industry  increase revenue would never be ignored by ccpthe fact is no one not even i can say that my proposal will never happen but why wait and then not be happy with the result when we could try and be part of the development of the system to one that will work for the future benefit of eve and ccp

sorry i dont want to tell my friends to play eve then tell them they have to buy access to the system im in and buy access to the skills they need and oh wait theyre gonna have to buy more access to use contracts then right screw the whole thing lets just make this mabinogil
free to play is for bteam gameshaving to pay bunch of money for every single upgrade to get all the content is bullshit all in one and even playing field is better ccp better keep it cosmetic junk i dont want none of this other junkanyway if you want to play for free plexnot plexing you can play free with trial accounts anyway just keep remaking them they have lots of restrictions in amount of skills and what can be trained so if you poor and dont know how to make isk do that thats your heavily restricted gameplay with no cost for you on the houseanyway why have download slower for trial accounts they want to get people in to the game not out its not like dling the client will happen every day for each player it costs them to have servers doing that but its a investment that returns itself

since it seems so important to soem people you get actual criticismthis model is not meant for eve its meant for 2 kinds of peoplethe first kind is devoted enough to the game to spend 15 usd or equivalent a month to play the gamethe second is deovted enough to the game to devote weekends and weeknights in the game to accumulating money to pay for their next month with a plex put on the market by some kid from a country with a better economy and more moneyas long as both of these people are the oens that truly dominate eves active playerbase then the subscription style will be the preffered and more efficient median for game access allowing those that are truly devoted and into the game to play with little issue and those that arent too impressed or dont play seriously enough to decide whether this game is really for them the latter group will eventually either realize the game is not for them and move on or come to the forums and whine about how the game needs to change to be like every other mmo out there because apparenlty bandwagons are goodplease realize that the only way to get eve a larger subscription abse is to make it even more different from currently existing mmos and not to make it more similar making eve like other mmos puts it in a market that it cannot compete in as eve is a game centered around difficulty and gradual progression and between this and a casualgamers mmo if both play similar they will always choose the casual
just go die already ive no spare empathy for those who want such  ideas
supported and liked for the following reasonseventually eve will have to move towards f2p as this is the general trend of mmos if ccp wishes to grow the population of eve further as more and more mmos are released that are f2p fewer and fewer people are going to take a risk playing eve when they can go do something else for free the reason current mmos are going f2p is because they can make more money off of microtransactions with a higher number of free subscribers playing the game than they did with a lower number of paid subscribers at 15 a month it is as simple as that these mmos arent going f2p because they failed like some people seem to think that makes no sense at all our game is failing and we cant afford to keep the servers upso lets make it free sorryswing and a miss they are going f2p because there is more money to be made in microtransactions than in pure subscriptionsif ccp wants to take eve into a sort of f2p model like lotro where you still have to pay a sub to do certain things and swing more heavily on cosmetic microtransactions then ifor one fully support them in that decision

we already have achievements check out the elite hull tanking certificate if you dont believe menot having a formal achievements system means that you have to actually engage with other players in order to boast about the things you have done write a blog post showing your systems i have visited screen shot post a youtube video of your first titan fight etc heck fly your zephyr around to show that you were actively playing the game during the christmas break in 2009 or your apopheosis to show you were here for the 5th birthday celebrationsthe achievements systems in games like portal are simply time wasting diversions you dont actually achieve anything more than hey guys look how much time i wasted playing video games alone in my basement forever
hey guys can you all stop shooting this titan when it gets to 5 structure i need to get my killing blow on a titan achievement
its not so much lazy snipers as bringing back sniper 240km snipers used to be the staple pretty much and it was great to have that diversity perhaps scan time issue is long but it was only for combat probes its mostly just finding a ballance between still being usefull to kill lazy npcers and reall really lazy snipers and completely removing a fleet type from the gamethe speed bonus is not really as huge as it seems it used to be far larger when all hacs fit pollys there was an unballance there but there is definatly an unbalance now

yeah his idea for how the bounty collection works is essentially the same as mine in fact its the same mechanism ive been promoting for the last 3 years or so my proposal adds a mechanic for allowing those bounties to be collected in hisec  transferrable killrights  that i think is worth having as well as refinements like being able to limit who collects that bounty which i think are essential to prevent exploitation
fair enoughwill you offer an amount of isk for people to come up with ways to exploit this in order to amend your proposal accordingly 
why dont you just post the exploit along with the fix to make me look dumb surely the pleasurable memory of doing that will warm your heart long after some petty sum of evanescent isk would have been frittered away
fraid i dont know any but im sure others will come up with one especially comforted by the double warmth of being right and soft tender isk to grace their companyone thing to get this back on track though you seem to propose that bounties can only be gained by first accepting a contract would that contract be exclusive to a single taker or could the contract remain up for as many people as willing to accept under the conditions given until either the cash or the timeframe is used upif it is the former i imagine the bountied player might just block the contract by accepting it herself through some intermediateif it is the latter this could be made easier by only displaying and thus paying out the bounty to players that fall within the conditions determined by the bounty giveralso i wonder if there isnt a way for the bountied player to rid himself of the bounty at favourable conditions in a quick bout of insured pvp thus escaping prolonged consequence as a bounty target
shrug as long as value paid is less than value destroyed no matter what you try you can never be sure who is actually accepting contract imo i dont think there needs to be contract if someone has killrights and backs it with isk anyone can shoot the target and collecttho it might be interesting to limit who does collect it could add flavor or there could be both public market and private contract bounties
this idea has meritsee i dont hate you
the important part of the contract is to transfer the killright not the money
im ok with people hating me or at any rate im used to it by now but i prefer the criticism of my proposals to be based on facts coherently expressed and structured in a way that lets me actually understand what you are mad about when people just copypasta rants from another thread entirely and shoot them at me as well i dont feel as inclined to reply constructively
its your perogative to reply however you like i merely stated that you had no idea what you were talking about  which you yourself said was soall my comment required as reply was a or other short messageif you like we can continue here and  this thread up too 
its certainly not my job to be doing this but seriously this is getting extremely tedious youre at it in every second thread on two different subforumsthe two of you just pack your egos back into your trousers will you ive seen some very good ideas here and there but these threads wont be going anywhere if you keep this up
plugging the kill myself with an alt hole is fine and good but tying killrights to bounties is really what makes bounties work in the general sense  allows for placing bounties on players who keep thier sec status up allows killing the bountied player in highsec or on gatesstations no sec hit for attacking the bountied player prevents bounties from becoming a substitution for merc contracts
couldnt have put it better
dear communityi would like to bring up yet again subject of plex for remap i know that issue been discussed in great deal of detail before however i would like to introduce whole new set of arguments i would like to briefly touch upon cons and pros and then proceed to discuss the issue in more detail pros UFFFD i would not go into too much details here i think everyone understand the benefits of having plex for remap in game 2 greatest pros here are that1 it would allow great deal of flexibility for players2 it would allow ccp to generate additional revenue which in turn would allow to devote more resources to game developmentcons UFFFD the cons are also pretty straightforward plex for remap would UFFFDdiluteUFFFD competitive advantage of older players or in other words those players who have so much skill points so that they can afford to train single skill section for a year then remap for another skill section with different attributes iUFFFDm one of those players btw on a more broader picture it would dilute UFFFDthe spiritUFFFD of game whereby the choices you are making matter and you have to make those choices very carefullydiscussion UFFFD now let me try to put it all into perspective being one of those players who can UFFFDaffordUFFFD to train single skill section for a year i can clearly see why would similar players not want this kind novelty clearly people who object are mainly those who feel it give them disadvantage of all the players iUFFFDve spoken with who have moderate amount of skill points pretty much everyone welcomed the idea of plex for remap those players argued that it would give them great deal of flexibility and allow to achieve their goals faster i think what is important here is to consider is that overall this change would not only impact a small proportion of people but rather community as a whole and that includes ccp as well i would argue that common good resulting from this change would outweigh costs incurred by a small proportion of elite players in a form of personal dissatisfaction by a wide margin so effectively pros and cons outlined above are not quite correct one cannot give them equal weight on the pros side we have a very wide proportion of players with moderate amount of skill points and ccp who could generate additional revenue on the cons side we only have a relatively small proportion of elite players who are trying to lobby their interests trying to put forward a fair argument i have to mention here as well that players who defend UFFFDold schoolUFFFD eve model would also fall in this category irrespectively of their amount of skill points UFFFD but these would still be a minority finally i want to point out at experience of introducing other changes to game mechanics in the past the best examples here would be introduction of remaps and removal of learning skills some people protested fiercely against those changes i think some of them were protesting rationally protecting their UFFFDskill set advantageUFFFD other were protesting protecting UFFFDold schoolUFFFD eve and others were protesting UFFFDjust becauseUFFFD the result was same though we had potentially very beneficial game mechanics for the majority of people involved in the community which was objected by a minority conclusion benefits of having plex for remap in game are far greater than costs because of the amount of people who would benefit directly and indirectly from this feature is far greater than amount of people who would be put at disadvantage please vote positively on the issue so that we can bring it to ccp attention via csm
a wellwritten proposal yoursstill noremaps added flexibility by making a basic element of the game your character an arbitrary thing that could be molded and remolded to suit the players whimhowever i firmly believe that it serves eve as a game to have choices with meaningful consequences restricting players through such as for examply through character generation is good both for a competitive game and a virtual universe if you wish to change your playstyle and need play along with the best whip out a new character or stick with your old one but be prepared to be patientremapping once a year was bad enough allowing to do so at will makes choices mean even less some will remap for every skill they train in order to optimize their progress in that perspective plex for remap is also basically another pay4win mechanic i dont care so much for those

its not that bad but its not exactly unique either  wed just have another instance of pi basically that way mining would have some extra complexity but it would still be boring and repetitivewhile most players would agree that mining is awfully boring there will be some who insist they like it botters the lot of them i say   as an activity and will be vehemently opposed to any changes either you ignore them adapt or die or you simply retain the conventional mechanic for their sake at lower profitsa new mechanic should be straightforward to get into with some variety and a simple set of rules but really hard to master a mechanic where skill preferably not twitch reflexes but brain stuff determines profits and where taking risks is rewarded botters might remain but unable to really compete with the dedicated miner for example if you need to actively monitor various elements of mining processes to not just optimize your yield but avoid catastrophic consequences further increasing your risk due to shifting your focus away from the danger of other ships approaching you should see significantly increased profits if successful furthermore if you had to interpret some visual feedback from the mining process and smartly adjust mining targets energy rates investment of consumable tools in order to maximize profits skill actually would make you a better miner over timei currently have no clear idea what such a mechanic would have to look like but im sure that this would not just make things more complicated for complexitys sake
how is this overcomplicatedyour brain still runnning at a year 2 level you bring up a scan of an asteroid you plop your laser on the biggest bright red patch you minesounds really hard
hey ore for brains wake up and smell the quafeits a itty bitty rock you mine it completelyand move onnot parts of itnot placing an extractor and doing stuff with it to make it availableits just raw materials you gatherand bring it on boardwhy should we complicate it any further than thatyou want to stop botting make all belts scannable like grav sites in whs even with weather disruptions and hazardsstop messing with a system that is not brokenthis is just as bad as an afk promptonly worse stop the evemail spam
how is this an afk prompt ideain order to stop botting the system has to be made more complex than programmers can code to preemptthis means dynamic content has to be added where only a human can interpret much like many forums have where you have to type in words interpreted from a picture in order to continuei bet you get stuck at those forums without being able to registerhazards which will come up as what a popup in the middle of the screen which the bottes already program fordude you obviously know zero about what these guys are doing why you even comment on  u know nothing about already botters can move to bookmarks of scanned down beltsand most of these guys work as part of a team they have a lot of real money invested in the entire process they are what make up the rmters you think they cant have a couple guys scanning down belts and then just let fly with all the bots as per usual you arent a smart guy stick to playing the game not thinking
scanning up an asteroid and plopping your lasers on the biggest brightest red patch sounds like things bots will be very good at also it still seems rather boring to me  how long would you be doing that with your attention glued to it before going afk or to the forumswhats with the personal insults right and left though you sure youre furthering your cause or its discussion that way i dont know to make an activity that takes hours and is outsourced to bots actually interesting possibly even a valid alternative  profit and excitementwise  to harvesting rogue dronesspot on about the scanning part though oh  ore for brains i find almost acceptable a tongueincheek sort of taunt youre getting better 
why thank you but the point is still validthe activity is boring to some but not to the mining communitythe bots argument is something that will continue to plague usbut instead of making it more complicated and giving ccp a migraine for programming something that they could best use their talents somewhere elsemake the belts all grav sites that require probing pi belongs on planets not something 110000000th the size of a planetits just a rocknothing fancyor specialit already gets chewed up and reprocessed into mineralsthat mechanic is already therewhy do something that already is in gameits called refining  refining efficiency   processingmake the belts grav sites  problem solvedno not the directional scanner trickjust make it easy to hit a sig with a couple probes that require a little effortmineonce site is downnew one spawnsetcnot that different from whsanything else is just a little foolish and overkill stop the evemail spam
for the umpteenth time botters already work grav siteshow is this problem solved 
do the bots actually scan down and find the sites source
scanning individual asteroids for better mineral concentrations and thus better yieldcycle is theoretically bottable but not necessarily with ease if you hand out an option to micromanage the focus of your lasers by repeated scanning and retargeting at the most tasty bits of any given asteroid then thats something people would actually have to work at and at the same time bots attempting to maximize it would be engaging in especially predictable and thus detectable patterns at the same time youd want to move away from a beltcentric model to a signatureanomalycentric one with the better opportunities requiring more homework ideally youd have a system that looks something like thisfirstly a prober scans down an appropriate hidden belt site the people interested in the op come in first with combat ships to clear out the rats then the mining ships come in a rorqual sets up shop just off the belt activating its forcefield to give the miners someplace to retreat to when enemies enter the system this isnt hisec after all enemies could arrive at any moment and they need the protection offered by a forcefield to keep them safe additionally the rorqual can use its onboard scanning systems to locate the richest asteroids in the belt analyze them and then send hiresolution images of the ore concentrations present to the fleet at large allowing fleet members to focus their efforts on the best and rarest ores no need for haulers here the rorquals also responsible for snagging the cans and compressing the ore onsite each individual mining ship could be scanning the asteroids on their own to get this sort of information but the rorquals optimized systems make it better so long as theyre getting uptodate data broadcast on the fleet channelsdont have a rorqual well the orcas just about as good it can do everything the rorqual can with the exceptions of compressing ore and generating a forcefield and in a large enough op an extra guy running highresolution scans of the belt might come in handy on the other hand an orca can carry combat ships so even with a rorqual on hand the fleet probably wants an orca around too that way the miners could flee to the safety of the rorquals bubble swap into combat ships and engage their foes much like if they were defending a pos an op entirely without a rorqual is much less defensible but it is mobile since its not waiting on any kind of siege timer the whole fleet can simply abandon the site and warp to a safe at a moments notice long before hostile probers can locate them if theyre paying attentionthe mining ships themselves arent doing anything too complicated theyre just targeting the asteroids and blasting away with their lasers same as before of course if they want to be getting good yields of the nice ores theyre paying attention to the scans broadcast by their command ships using that info to target specific asteroids and specific locations on those asteroids for significantly better harvestsadditionally careful attention to the scans will doubtless reveal lots of small specialized deposits hidden among the larger veins thats no job for the hulks and their strip miners youll want smaller quicker systems for that a few people certainly have mining drones onhand though and theyre keeping busy by micromanaging the acquisition of whatever crystals the drones can nab notably the guys running the mining drones can double as the security detail they arent necessarily such after all you could be doing both mining with lasers and drones at once but then youre either paying a lot of attention and running several things at once or youre halfassing at least one of the jobs also hulks and such dont have the drone bonuses needed to really do a good job at drone mining anywaysfinally theres almost certainly a skiff floating around hes playing an entirely different game from everyone else since all the asteroids out there that can be mined normally also might have a totally different and more tasty sort of resource in their cores inaccessible to all but their specialized equipment if the fleet was wellprepared and has more then one skiff on hand then theyve got an entirely separate highres scanner package onhand to pinpoint and broadcast the locations of the otherwiseinnocuous chunks of veldspar with tasty mercoxit centers if not then the lone skiff is at it alone prospecting in much the same way anyone else might but for an entirely different layer of the asteroidof course just because the rats were shot down at the beginning doesnt mean they arent coming back better pay attention and have your security team  drone miners ready to switch up combat drones and handle it and of course i did mention that sites this tasty dont spawn at all in hisec so watch local just because youve got a shiny forcefield doesnt mean youre invincible after all sure youre basically a roaming minipos with a couple battleships on hand for security and a squad of battlecruisers stashed in corporate holds for safekeeping but that just means that youre a nice midsized gang and youd better be ready to defend yourselves or make a run for it if a bigger gang comes knockinglets see bots do that
there was a dev blog 3 years about system wide belts and scanning them down and it was awesome they should do that
this is so much betterone thing not sure about restricting this to low and nullsec why not put those belts and mechanics in highsec too at significantly lower chances for goodhigh quality ores or great quantitiesalso did i understand correctly that those skiffs would then be a preferable way to solo mine quick and agilelike
for reference im not implying that these mechanics wouldnt be inplace in hisec but that the sites worth doing the kind of ops i wrote the example to demonstrate wouldnt be and of course you cant use your shiny rorquals in hisec at all theres nothing stopping you from bringing an orca out and running a lesser op if you feel like mining in peace and safety but theres markedly less profit thereand yes for solo mining id like to encourage use of the skiff its playing the deep core mining game which under my proposal would be completely different from the game other miners are playing but which taps out fairly quickly in comparison in a group hulks play the long game grinding their way through the whole belt in a slow methodical fashion if they stay for the long haul they could mine the whole belt out and leave nothing at all behind though devoting strip miner cycles to small deposits of droneharvestable crystals or the still cores of otherwisedepleted asteroids is highly inefficient skiffs on the other hand can get at the tasty centres of asteroids far more quickly and effectively then hulks can and theyre fast and light and warpstabbed if you want to mine in lowsec and you dont have a group on hand you want to be in a skiff because assuming you can find asteroids with worthwhile cores thats where the good isk isi would envision prospectors sneaking around through lowsec in covops ships with both your basic survey scanners and core analysers aboard theyd probe down hidden belts and comb over the individual asteroids prescreening them to decide if theres anything worth bringing their skiff in for the survey scanner giving a general indication of which asteroids look most promising but with individual scans needed to be done to find out where and how much most asteroid cores will be  containing much the same stuff hulks can get more quickly with their strip miners some will be tasty having highend minerals worth a nice chunk of change a very few will be totally awesome containing vast mine this out and plex your account tonight types of fortunes though this wont be at all obvious until the individual asteroid is specifically deepscanned its this latter that people will spend all their time looking for but theyll wind up settling for the middle option often enough if youve only got an hour or two to play and dont have the people for an op the casual money will be in skiffs who will always outperform hulks in the short term especially if they dont have to haul the tradeoff is that theres not enough quality cores in any one place to keep a skiff happy for long to continue to make that optimal betterthenhulk iskhour the skiff will always be bouncing between hidden belts and combing their way through systems and either switching off constantly between prober skiff and hauler or multiboxing while the hulk just needs to sit in one place and graze
to be honest im more of a small corp miner if i can get away with itif i had my way id create a corp have maybe 1015 guys logging on whenever they wanted and mining in a decent system i like my daily pvp as well so i would probably solo roam or take whoever wanted to comegrav sites are too few and far between without taking sov and upgradingtaking sov means bowing down to higher powers which also means paying rent on an industry thats being completely choked out by the guys you are paying rent to more often than not  rmtersive done it before even in lowsec mining of hemorphite it can be really iffyill be happier with the drone regions change in the winter expansion i think hopefully that might even fix the issue of income but i still think the entire thing will only give botters more income as well and thus still devalue mining which in turn devalues isk and prices on things like plex will continue to rise after the initial changes have been made and the market restabilizesid love for eve to be a lot bigger so smaller mining ops could run in distant systems reasonably unmolested but traffic is rising in all of 00 and even lowsec and has been for yearsthis means only changes to mechanics can make the small to medium operation viable however creating mechanics for miners means changes for other parts of eve as well like larger pvp alliances and those changes generally arent wanted or neededits a sticky issue at bestpersonally id prefer to continue the war against botters alliances that house and allow them and rmters generally changing the mining profession to more human only systems seems the best way to do thatif scanning anomalies and turning all belts into anomalies is the way to go im all for it however even some of the less sophisticated publically available software can be used to mine from bookmarks who knows what is running in the back rooms in some of the more influential rmt facilities 
i dont think this is the way for mining to go at allkeep pi in pi1
this is a terrible idea whats needed are changes to ore values exhumers and to some mechanics the answer is not kill mining and the reason the drone regions supply 99 of high grade minerals is not because they pushed miners out based on pricing its because mining in nullsec is complete and utter  bullshit its not worth it mega and zyd could double in price and i still wouldnt mine it because i dont want to deal with multiple cloaky campers the lol  industrials faggots and the long dull hours and hours it takes to get anything done unless you can make mining with one hulk net me as much as incursioning does 100 mil per hour then  mining not worth the hassle get rid of cloaky camping allow hulks to survive more than 2 volleys from a stealth bomber or get me a goddamn capital miner with capital strips then youll see mining again otherwise be glad the drones are there keeping prices from going through the goddamn roof and shut the  up about mining when you obviously dont know  about it
sourceid love to have a discussion on mining with a different op  maybe endovior will turn his idea into a proposal of its own
well changing mechanics wont help honestly using the skiff wont change the state of mining whatsoeverkilling the botters is the issuethe real problem is that most people cant seem to grasp the economics well enough to understand thisseriously changing mineral values and mining bargeshow the  does this stop the degredation of the value of isk  most of which happens due to rmters most of which use mining as their source of income please do tellfacts high end minerals have not grown in the past 5 years there arent new belts being added to the gamehigh end mineral values have decreased around 30 in the past 5 years and yet the player base has grown exponentiallythe same amount of minerals for more demand but lower incomes for minersthe price of plex has increased by 25 in the past 6 monthsso the amount of ingame minerals has remained the samedemand must increase with player numbersbut with increased demand you should get increased income instead something is effecting it in the opposite direction in a huge waythe obvious reason for these changes is rmters not drone regions  which have been in the game for years
you need to edit your post once more dearkill all mining bots and remove mining as option for the colourblindyou will never be able to think up a way that hinders bots without also making it excruciating for humans instead you should think of of ways that make it less of an eye gouging exercise for people which is by far most frequently mentioned reason for resorting to mining botscombine it with mechanics that encourage mining with friendsgangs by adding extra profitability through minigame sort of deals and bots become a nonissue provided ccp keeps refining their detection tools
planning on it my original post was a spurofthemoment idea ill have something more fleshedout and detailed later

minning drones remember does never used the either but the concept of a drone minning ship still really haunts me id love to see a true drone minning shipsupport vessel something thatll mine less than the hulk but me more versatile and can protect other ships in a minning fleet two ideas come to mind 1 either make a new hull with stats etcs 2 a tech two version of the orca with focus on this drone bay from 75m3 to 250m3 bandwith to 125 fixed 200 bonus to drone rangereatin most of orca bonuses add 1 low slot 1 med slot 1 high slot industrial command ship bonus 10 to drone dmg and minning amount 5 to warfarelink industrial drone ship skill 2 additiona minning drones per lvl 575 to shield resitance per lvlitll tank like hulk and protect it s fleet in null sec still be capable of mining but itll definetly mine less than hulk being tech 2 cap itll be in less circulation by adding the specific rule of 2 minning drones per lvl avoid it form becoming a subcarrier or offensive ship but still
i had a longer post but was ganked so a briefer summarymining is boring mining drones are a comparatively useless and boring bit of that bit of boring and using mining drones is unwise unless youre mining in safe enough space that you dont need protection in which case youre doing something too boring to be worth bothering aboutright now mining drones are exclusively for that one incursion that calls for you to mine inbattle and needed nowhere else at all ever thats not actually a bad thing
botters would love this no longer having to recycle mining lazors grand ideano
fill a nyx with t2 mining dronestheres your drone miner
mining drones are garbage any miner who puts a mining drone in his ship deserves to die and have his clone reset to alpha and then get podded combat drones are the only drones that should ever be in a mining ship especially if youre in null or lowsec besides a t2 mining drones hold can only carry a single unit of anything larger than hemo so unless you gave drones a 100 m3 cargo hold  useless miners learn to fit a tank train warrior 2s and shut the  up
nothing but presumably if the chatlogs dont show you in recruitment and nobody in recruitment saying go talk to lord zim and nobody from recruitment pming you saying the name of the mark and andyeah that seems like a worthwhile use of labor a new player with plex might be though they are more likely to buy faction mods for their kestrel and then shoot at a billboard
i lost a redeemer to goonswarm a long time ago but this was one of my tens of billions of assetsa new player does not have a lot of assets and will quit if they lose something so expensive so that means less new accounts sticking to the game meaning less money for ccpalso i hate you guys dx

it seems were getting new models for some of our beloved ships which i find great winters expansion looks awesomebut as there was a topic asking about some ships to get new models and it is lost deep within topics list im making this topic for adding a ship to the list of ships that need to be remodelled the bellicose and its t2 variants the rapier and the huggin and the vigil frigateplease dont start yelling about who needs the bellicose since its as useful as other ships and i know you love rapiers and huggins the thing is that their model about the cruisers is odd their bridges and solar pannels keep killing me and im a minmatar who loves minmatar style my proposal is to change them slightly perhaps this way bridge instead of making it a rounded glass thing id say to make it a bit similar to stabbers or at least ruptures ones more pointy for variety it could be inverted from them i mean longest part up isntead of down inverted pyramid and theres something with huggins one those solar pannels are cool but they look like elephant ears perhaps making them more aerodynamic pointing them forward or backward note if their bridges get changed i think vigils one should be modified in the same way solar pannels they dont seem as nice as other ships so id say to put them instead of at the tip of the engines arm at its side forward and backward as now for keeping its looking the backward ones could be longer than forward ones there could be smaller ones at the top of the ship too vigil ones are coolthis would be small quick modifications that i think would make these ships better looking i think please let me know what you think of this thankie
armor plates are used on ships that have heavy cap use thus it shouldnt hurt the weapon system it is normally paired with thus my idea keeps the balance of armor plates making your ship thicker while keeping a steep penalty the goal is simple find a drawback that doesnt hurt using blasters or lasers that still keeps the feeling of 2nd guessing if you should fit one more platearmor plates not adding massarmor plates dont need to add mass yeah it doesnt make sense but who cares they should however reduce agility extremely if you can make it full speed in a straight line but go slower when turning how cares awesome this would have the side benefit of booster blasters as the slower you orbit the better your tracking remove the mass penalty  or reduce it by 90 and increase the agility draw back by a bit armor plates make you more obviouslets face it slapping armor plate on your hull is not very ninja like this makes it much easier to figure out where you are it also makes you easier to scan and to lock down now i feel having armor plates increase sig radius leads to the same issue as mass increase they can lock you faster than who cares if your faster so instead armor plates stop your senors from being as effective senor strength is decreased by 10 across the board no matter what size you equip this adds an element of fitting ecm to counter the new super fast buffer blaster ships and long range run away laser ships this doesnt stop blaster boats from being useful in normal situations it jut adds a counter other than haha i have autcannonsarmor plates forevera new option to expel armor plates would be awesome you get in lase and jammed so what do you do the hell with it you blasts those  plates off the port bow this allows you to change to a speed tank when close or to get back your lock this last part is more just for fun anyways hopefully this gets a lot of support and ccp will hear about itif not tell me why im a dumbass that shouldnt post ideas and i will take it into account so my future posts dont overlook any obvious balance issues
some of us do and i dont see the benefit of reducing plausibility that wayagreed on sig radius though and i really like the expel armor bit
thats the problem it should thats why its called a drawback
armor plates adding mass is logical sincetheyre heavyincreased sig radius doesnt make sense since youre simply reinforcing the internal structure of the ship not magically gluing more thingymabobs and doohickies to the external structure from a practical standpoint even if you were gluing on additional plates the sig radius change would be so minimal that it wouldnt be worth coding inand to turn off armor plates theres a simple function called offline module already implemented in the game though why youd ever consider doing that is beyond me
the market tools need to be improved i would love to see something like the eve metrics web site was there is a clear need for good market information beyond what is offered now i use the fact that there are or have been multiple web sites to cover the lower quality of information ingame sites like eve central eve market eve metrics and so on have existed for years this doesnt break immersion since it reflects real life in rl there are tools like morningstar ans publications like wall street journal market pvp is constant pvp also for future wis concideration i would like to visit the big stock markets in the trade hubs walk out onto the trading floors
sigh i really cant wait to see the fruits of the latest volunteer moderator recruitment drive  these kinds of backhanded personal attacks just because youre too lazy to come up with a proper argument just serves to cement the view devs have of this forum being the playground of clueless whiners how the hell should anyone take anything else you write here seriously

1 but have the remapping cost be based on the current amount of skill pointslike 1 plex per 10 mil sp makes ccp and the very few players who would still want to use it happy eve is about options everything should be possible but come at a possibly i
either way i dont care which they do so long as they balance out the cost vs the bonuses issue
why do you post
ccp dont set the price on t2 rigs increasing their bonus would only increase their price
this if t2 rigs were say twice as effective as t1 then everyone would want them as is theyre only about 13 more effective so hardly anyone wants themthat said salvage alchemy would definitely be the way to go here if you wanted more t2 rigs around just bear in mind that it will increase the price of t1 rigs
it looks like ccp will try to combat the high t2 rig prices by dropping more t2 loot see this dev blog
prices are relative  based on demand i too would like to see more t2 rigs used so either enable us to produce t2 salvage or have more t2 salvage droppe possibly also from more sources yet at very low chanceswhy are some kind of rigs sooo cheap they dont get used why the bonus you would get does not compensate for the slot you sacrifice as some other rig gives you are preferable fitting so please boost bonuses of all seldomused rigs and fix some fitting requirements  who would ever fit a sentry augmentor ii for 300 calibrationcheck the moderated 10000 papercuts evelopedia page

gm panzer its been since 1031 since my petition has been submitted and still no fix this is just plain stupid every petition i have ever submitted has not been returned in my favor and none have been about ship losses you can always make more isk to get another ship rule 1 of eve never fly anything you arent prepared to lose do me a favor and take a look at my petition and see what you can do to help me out just once i would like a favorable reply from a gm your help in this matter would be greatly appreciated
well i do know the feeling getting late responses and sometimes no fixes from bug reports i filed with ccp but petitions bluegeneral i am very curious what kind of petitions you opened anything that is not working as it is supposed to is basically a bug and should be reported as such so if it is not a bug what categories of petitions are you referring to why are you hesitant to discuss them herecheck the moderated 10000 papercuts evelopedia page

u sad bro
ive brought this up a long while ago in a blog relating account security and im bringing it up again hereim currently looking around for a new character and ive allready spend some time in the character bazaar however there is one thing that still holds me back from buying and that is the fact that i have to give up my login name to the seller to me my login is just as secret as my password and i think its not smart to hand out one piece of the puzzle to someone that i dont knowmy proposal that under account management an option is created for the buyer to generate a unique code or as an alternative an unique code that is not your login can be found there this code will then be passed on to the seller and instead of using the login he will use this unique code to send the character to the buyers accounti hope that ccp can implement this and that the csm can put this on their agendawith all the fixes ccp is pushing out this is one could use some attention as well
hellosince tyrannis ive began to monitor the ram usage of eve clients on my pc is it solely related to cache or is the 300mb to 690mb usage increase to this day a normal pileup of improvements not obvserved ingame
mine use up to 1 gb at times which is a tiny amount compared to real games like battlefield 3 ram is like 5 per gb those days get more

would it be an interesting game mechanic if the level of system control in incursions affected concord response times i though up two possible mechanics 0 control puts the system at a flat response time regardless of sec status say something like 20 seconds as system control goes back to 100 the system gradually goes back to the normal concord response time 0 control doubles the response time as system control goes back to 100 the system gradually goes back to the normal response time i like the first method better because it is easy to chose a value that makes every system more dangerous than 05 without making the response time too long for the latter idea it is hard to chose the right multiplier that will make a 10 incursion system more dangerous than a 05 system without making the response time in a 05 incursion system too long even the 2x multiplier makes the response time too long in my opinion 26 secondsfor the record i am neither an incursion runner nor a suicide ganker i just found this to be a rather interesting idea for a game mechanic having flown through many a highsec system with an incursion without giving two  i wondered if something else could be done to make the incursion itself hazardous to the constellation as a wholeedit actually i mean to put this in jita speakers park to get more feedback although the csm could take it if they wanted
this would do precisely nothing but make it easier to gank incursion runnersnot sure if bad thing
interesting idea would force incursion farmers to chose between farming the incursion and safety against gankersmore interestingly it may do more to pit people who prefer prolonging the incursions for isk against those who prefer the safety of concord
how about you also factor in the security status of a victim into concord response time maybe concord is less motivated to revenge the death of an almost criminal maybe also faction navies would come to a victims aid if his faction standing was high enoughgive your own standings more meaningcheck the moderated 10000 papercuts evelopedia page
i have been escrowingcontracting and trading items between 12 cynos character on 4 accounts for some years now the recent change that allows damaged items to be contracted was a help in that regard but it would be paradise on earth for multi account user to be able to share their hangar between all their characteraccounts without having to spend the time contracting the items or shipsof course keeping corphangar the way they are as they are strategic assets in many locations is importantbut im certain it is possible to prohibit corporations from using a shared hangar but allowing multiaccount user to spend less time on shuffling stuff around and more time on enjoying the game and spend more money on more accounts
i can forsee a lot of potential problems with this im pretty sure youd be quick to yell at ccp if your hangar somehow got shared with the wrong people
although it would be very helpful maybe it is not wanted maybe you are supposed to join the same corp to get that functionality but of course that is not desired hehecheck the moderated 10000 papercuts evelopedia page
you dont make sense and we caregive me your stuffbiomass queue is over i am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
lol how doesnt it make sensethe mass increase is makign them boost blastershowever blasters and armor tanking dont work togetehrso istead of mass it makes you easier to jam the more plates the easier it is for ecm to work on you i know its not perfect but i dont think my idea doesnt make sense or is without reason behind it
yes they do it just requires you to think a different way and fly for armor tanking blaster boats rather than for something else
that seems to be the opposite of the test forums opinion you cant close range in an armor tanked blaster boat you move far too slow in the time you get to them your blaster dps isnt enough to catch up with all the damage you took even flying in at an angle to keep your transversal up if you fly in a straight line to close range faster youll take every single hit either way the mass increase should at least be lowers by 30 my op might not be the solution it might even be a bad idea but dont try to sit there and say that blaster boats dont have issues also i should clearfly that blaster frigates are pretty much bomb cruisers are questionable but with changes in winter are useful but blaster fitted battleship dont need to lose 300ms while mwd because they have a tank fit i personaly am not for the huge dps increase most player seems to want i think thats pushing it too far for the ships that can fit blasters and active tank without cap issues
original poster is right maby something that can be set in the configuration menu esc then it displays the dtt in a color over the target icon  or ring the icon green or red if its inor out side optimal range
what would be useful is a site that conveniently lists the current jita buy and sell order for a item i tried some sites but they always give screwy data measured from all around the universe when i want the hub with no goofy over priced scam orders or 01 isk buy orders influencing the real price real current orders real pricefailing this i usually have a alt on the ready
what was nice about some of the tools people made was that you could look at current market activity in various regions i did a lot of business outside of jita i was able to look research market activity on items i was looking to manufacture just as real businesses do the lack of such a functional system is part of why other than pure convenience places like jita have so much traffic there are other good markets that are barely tapped simply because people cant find them eve metrics how i miss ya
sure like the crumbling rock sounds when you mine gas but yes i like the strip miner sound back now i feel like i am sitting in a huge t2 ibis
as a said before only predetermined textures by ccp so they are in the client and dont couse extra lag just some more disk space a vindicator get say 5 new textures that cant be used on a normal megathron or faction version fill in yourself for other shipsso with new textures the eve installment will be some megabytes bigger
you dont even need a chart feature just another slide down option like the others buy and sellto make it work and loot selling better in general you need a quicksell option where you automatically sell it to the highest bidder in range without checking the price and having you need to click another button and promptwith a firesale button just permit multiple items to be sold at once if by a glitch a order is gone then the item is not sold but the ones able too are kind of like repackage all
this discussion has been done to deathif you search the old forums the community voted overwhelmingly to take it out of the game
i think a better idea would be a plex for one additional annual remap no more than 1 per year if a year passes and you havent used it you loose the remap
well  there are various options how that could be done we could have it restricted to certain number of remaps cost proportionatelly increased etc certainly every feature has to be balanced if feature is not balanced then people would try to abuse it  thats normal the notion is here is to get consensus on acceptance of feature the problem with that is that people who mainly browse forums are veterans rather than younger players who indeed would be interested in that feature when you just start the game people have little incentive to go to forum given overwhelming amount of information as it is can i make a suggestion here  i know this is going to be difficult however i think we should try if you are making a post could you also post how many skill points you have on your main of course people would not say the true value but some will when we get sufficiently big sample we could infer on the pattern
this choices should have consequences
since the benefit of the remaps is honestly negligible in terms of actual time i will go ahead and say its ok by me seriouslyi have looked at all the possible reductions in time for everything i still need to train and in the span of a year it is a total of something along the lines of 5 days of time saved compared to what i have now which is pretty much even across the board in terms of stats 5 days really doesnt mean all that much to me even at 55 mil sp frankly the people this change would benefit the most would be the newbies and even then the benefit isnt so much that i think it would be any kind of problem at all if anything it would just help more people get more sp faster to get into pvp and nullsecwh combat faster that i am all for you want more people in nullsec for pvp stuff give newbies a faster way into nullsec
i would like to see an opportunity to reallocate your entire skills once at some point there are some many skills you train at the start because you dont know any different thats just wasted
but it wouldnt help the newbies at all really since they wouldnt have the isk for plexes anyways the people it would really benefit are the people training up alts mostly for botting or for sale
id have used this six months ago when i derped and wasted a remap with a misclicki dont see where this would grossly imbalance the game and it might save some noobs from ragequitlevel frustration when they figure out six months into the game what they should have done and will have to wait six more month to dodont mind if its done dont care if its not
this id spend a plex or three to buy back a few million sp that i wasted on industrial skills that i never usenot the entire skill point set but maybe 1 plex per million
well im talking about the build costs not the market prices the build costs are related to the way their salvage raw materials are obtainedwhich i think should change its so limited that its driving the prices upbut yes imho t2 rigs overall are broken they need to be looked at price vs performance vs overall benefits vs fitting etc faction items are used more than t2 rigs even through their are expensive why because the bonuses warrant the expense
price of t1 rigs is driven by the price of salvage and the people who actually compute base build costs these people have a minimum sell price if the abundance of t1 salvage does not change neither will the t1 rig prices
ah you look at doltan first  yes drone lands was always but there wasnt so much ppl how it is now and waththey do there afcorsratign and kiling drons mining al thos activitis ganerating great mineral amounts way you tink drf have bigest super cap fleet 
i am not sure that this would be of any real usethe miners that i know mine everything in a belt until theres nothing left they wouldnt even waste their time scanning as they will mine it all anyway
i am not sure abot the equally fair bit at all i once had an occasion where i asked very kindly for the gm to do something and they said no no matter how much i explained however another person asked and they had no problems doing it infact they did it immediately only because i believe that person was quite a well known character so i dont believe its all fair at all i believe gms also prob have black spots on people tooand yes i have to agree with op 99 of the time gms do not rule in favour of the personwe all know the logs didnt show anything scenario
im sure this will have come up before had a quick look but did not see it probably on the old forum i also know ccp have said they would not do this in the past but with the upcoming expansion and the introduction of tier iii battlecruisers i want to throw this out there again if enough people want it it may be consideredfleet command ships would stay as they areamarr damnation  prophecy hullminmater claymore  cyclone hullgallente eos  brutix hullcaldari vulture  ferox hullfield command ships would move to tier ii modelsamarr absolution  harbinger hullminmater sleipnir  hurricane hullgallente astarte  myrmidon hullcaldari nighthawk  drake hulli would love to see nighthawks as black with the red kaalakiota diagonals on it or a gold and red harbiof course the problem will be in the blueprints people are using to make them but i am sure some sort of fair way of sorting that could be found perhaps offering a one time only swap of the tier i blueprint to the equivalent tier ii
i can agree with this idea i would be more inclined to buying and flying a sleipnir as a hurricane hull while the claymore remained in the cyclone hulli fully endorse and agree with this suggestion
how do you propose the slot layouts be changed in order to accommodate the change in the hullas well how will the different characteristics of the hull ie the myrm is a drone boat versus the brutix which is a blaster boat and the bonuses from the different hulls change in lieu of the new hullhint think more hint
i dont recall saying anything about fittings slot layout or stats all the tier ii models have enough gun ports to support the existing ship compositionsthe ferox is a gunship the nighthawk is a missile boat so your myrmbrutix analogy is already irrelevant another example is the navy issue scorpion compared with the vanilla version same model different ship style where is it written the t2 ships have to follow the style of the t1 shipsim not sure what your point is this is purely an aesthetic change
when you clickon or target something and its off screen its very difficult to see where it is especially if you have some other windows up and overview and other stuff can we implement some like bright red arrow or something like they do in fighter games thats always pointing to the target so you know where to look just something that will highlight much much more better what we are targetting or looking atplease see the pics this is only having a couple of windows up as well overview just generally selecting or targetting this is more of a problem if you have multiple targets to track and perhaps more windowspic 1pic 2pic 3do you really think thats ok its a nightmare to be honestchanging to colour would be a start

really the little objects all around the edge of the screen and the boxes around them to indicate you are clicked on them arent enough i suppose maybe allowing us to change up the color of a targeted object to red or something would be fine but i dont see how it isnt already obvious as it is
please see the pics this is only having a couple of windows up as well overview just generally selecting or targetting this is more of a problem if you have multiple targets to track and perhaps more windowspic 1pic 2pic 3do you really think thats ok its a nightmare to be honest
no they arent good enough its not a gamebreaking issue to be sure but its an issue that could use improvement now do you have actual complaints about this request or did you just pop by to say we should settle for less for no particular reason
this 
what the hell are you talking about i said the suggestion you made is a good one and we shouldnt settle for a lesser system i dont see what your post has anything to do with what i said
dude i removed itwhen i realised
as i stated i see nothing wrong with just changing the color to make them more visible but judging by your pics i would say this is more of an issue with how you organize your screen how do you suggest ccp fix this issue specifically your third pic shows the window pulled away from the edge of the screentry that for all your windows or do what most people do in fleet fightszoom out so you see the whole battlefield and not just your ship
not exactly a problem imhoand yes ive had complciated situations as far as overview is concernedis there room for improvement as far as the metaphorical hud yeahpapercut projectyesissue to be taken cared of as top priority nonot enough for me to pushbut like i saidwould be nicebut its more of a luxery than anythingps ive learned to keep an eye out for certain things in these situations9 times out of 10 its your overview settings that are doing you innot so much visual clutter stop the evemail spam
this is what i was wondering yes the game could do a better job at presenting information so that you can make betterfaster judgements i dont think anyone will argue that its imperfect the question is how do we fix ita few ideasdirectional arrows on each target icon indicating which direction you need to turn the camera in order to see thema large version of these arrows somewhere on the screen indicating the direction of whatever object you have selected on the overlaythose two ideas might enable you to visually locate the target more easilyid also like to see more control over how information is displayed id love to be able to shove all my chat windows off to the right outside the gameplay windowkind of like what happens when you press f10 for the maps we have widescreen monitors let us use the real estate better if i could push two panes of chats off to the right complete with tabs so that they never had to overlap anything my screen would be a lot more legible
i would like to see insurance voided if you are killed by concord and a bit changedwhat insurance company in their right mind would pay for you to engage in criminal activity essentially this is what insurance for suicides is doing financing your criminal activities further buy refunding part or all of your ship costanother change i would like to see is the full or nearly full insurance for t2 mining barges haulers the only drawback to this would be halfpay if you are killed in null sec space
how is any of this talk about gtc and subscription prices relevant to high sec
temba ronin brought in the fact that there are people using plex to play and argued that it was losing ccp money vov
this is currently on sisi
im thinking something should be done to remedy the alarming rate at which the highsec economy is taking a dive mainly on the t2 end and not to mention the plex market has become ridiculous not that it effects me as i pay for my account on a yeartoyear basis but for some who are trying to pay for their gaming by plex its becoming difficult if not nighimpossiblei am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
i agree i brought this up a few months ago about some kind of regulation system to prevent market tank and huge market spikes usually these happen because of 1 or 2 people with a lot of isk who can do whatever they want with the market at the expense of everyone else the eve market is not a simulation of the real market its actually far from it the spikes and troughs of the eve market are not demand or supply driven but rather driven by ignorance and manipulation nuff about that thoughi have a few suggestions on how to fix this but for a different threadthe plex thing unfortunately affects a whole lot of peoples ability to play the game
thats it 690mb damnmakes me wonder why i splurged on the 32gigs on my new machine hmmmmaybe ill knock that down to 16gigs insteador not
in null security space concord dont know about the hostile acts you commit that in low and high sec space you would be punished forso if they dont know about the hostile acts you commit why do they know about the good ones you do by this i mean the security increase for killing npcsnull security space should have zero affect on your security status up or down and before any of you think i am going for a stealth suicide ganker nerf i am not i love the fact that no place in the game aside from being docked is safe what this will do is for players who cant go into high security space is leave them npcs in low security spaceif you want to do the crime time to do the time in low sec that is
im pretty sure the 4 major empires and concord know whats going in 00 just becasuse they dont have sov doesnt mean they dont have a clue as to whats going on maybe all ships are mandated by concord to be equipped with comm devices that register any and all rat kills
they dont knowdont care is irrelevant really rp reasons aside what are your thoughts on the change
anything that gives a bounty also gives a bit of concords approval since concords the one paying out the bounties itd be odd if concord paid bounties but not sec status for nullsec killsinteresting as it might be to keep criminals in lowsec for the duration of whatever time they spend in penance thered need to be a lot more compelling content there to justify forcing that on people
very very poor trolltry harder1010 stop the evemail spam
its hardly a troll you idiot
only an idiot would make an proposal obviously outlandish and foolish beyond all reason when it comes to how things workjust because concord isnt in 00 doesnt mean they arent watching and keeping track of thingsdo a little research and read up on things before you start spouting foolish things again stop the evemail spam
doesnt mesh with canon rp nor would it be a good idea to yank out the ability for concord to put bounties on nullsec rats if you cant get standings increases from rat kills there would be no logical reason for concord to also include bounties unless theyre able to register the kills to stay canon and to be logical youd also need to remove bounties from rats and simply put  that
i wouldnt be opposed to removing bounties and sec status increase by shooting rats as it makes absolutely no logical sense but as ive said with literally all other changes of this kind of nature it has to be tempered with an equal and opposite chance for the nullsec dweller to make moneyuntil that happens no
sounds like a stealth nerf to null and low secno bounties and theres virtually no reason to be in nulllow would be even worse if people cant fix their sec status then a lot of people that are casual pirates will no longer even consider fighting in low sec with such a massive penalty hanging over them low sec will be even more deserted than it already isno support from me on this one
depends on who you aska while back i suggested a modifier to the concord response time so that they took longer to respond in incursions as part of other changes to incursions i realize that would grossly imbalance things in favor of griefers and would need a solid countermechanic perhaps a unique ability in incursions where you can defend your fleetmates since fleeting is the whole point of incursions if they are attacked by gankersthen you could have some serious battles between incursion fleets and the gankers who try to take them down before concord arrives
this would mean that concord would be slower to respond to defend noobs than they would mission farmers also those of us who found their pve niche in wspace have lowerthannormal sec status instead of basing it on sec status base is on the total negative sec status hits concord remembers all your gcc events and holds them against you it would be a longterm penalty for excessive ganking that you could never completely repairedit can you get standings with concord right now if not lets add that and have it drop each time you gank someone and go up each time you kill someone flagged as a criminal npcs would not affect this standing at all this way only pvp activities would affect concord response times and players would be rewarded for being the good guy by getting better protection gankers could flaunt their 10 standing with concord while others work hard to kill them to run up their own standings
ideas for concord response time factors why not factor in the victims sec status  maybe also the aggressors sec status  why is system sec status even in highsec static first place shouldnt it depend on how secure how many combats  nonconsensual pvp there has been recently  maybe you could also pay concord a weekly fee for faster response time  maybe you could bribe concord to arrive a little laterganking by definition means you cannot defend yourself against it currently there is no counter to gankinghigh alpha except fitting a high buffer yourself even then i honestly feel ganking is too easily done  with too few isk invested even if insurance payout was removed look at how easily and often freighters are taken down and ganking some pve bs is just scary easy to do if a freighter having a breakeven of about 1 bil at around 170k ehp what are you allowed to fit on a pvefit bs having around 60140k ehp not to speak of a hulk at 3040k ehp and that is the buffer fit sure you could say dont fit those mods and prices are just market driven i favor those changes insteadcheck the moderated 10000 papercuts evelopedia page
here here i dont like the idea i do not think that characters should ever have anything to do with each other except through third party mediums like corporations
shared for multiple characters on the same account yes this is a fairly standard feature on ost mmos nowadaysshared for multiple accounts no too risky imo becasue of people selling characters and such
something else that hasnt been pointed out yet if youre a director you can do that already by using corp hangers just drop the item into the corp hanger and deliver it to your alt ive been using that trick for years
i agree with this but i would also like to see them make it where those multiple accounts become 1 account with learning slots bought for the same price as a new account so instead of the ops 4 accounts with 12 toons he could have 1 account with 12 toons and 4 learning at once for the same priceperhaps even a multiclient that enables you to run multiple characters on the same account limited to the learning slots purchased at once in one client that can share windows and make tabs for the different characters or different screens if you got dual screens thus enabling you to cut the alt tabbing and extra processes run and run it all in one more efficiently built client for multiple charactersbut thats just my 2 isk on the subject

also fix caldari sig radius
the ui is supposed to be scalable to some degree in the next expansion problem solved before you brought it up try going on sisi and messing with that it should solve your problem
this has been addressed in the latest sisi builds the geometry is different but the size is roughly the same
oh no you are wrong even a raging homosexual would want bouncing boobs since it would increase subscriptions the antiboobists are communists or fascists or something 
requiring the command boosting ship to be on greid is dumbing down the gameremoves the role of the scan down ship for the planet hugger ship or removes the advantage of getting to the fight early and putting up a posthe key is to adapt  possibly take out the command boosting ship before it makes it into systemtrick you enemey to fight on your terms have the terrain on your side1 i will not support dumbing down the game to a bunch of ships sitting on 1 grid and just calling primary a little hide and seek
waitwhat requiring a ship in pvp to actually be in pvp is dumbing down the game really nowto top it off your solution is to beat the other guys to the system and put up a pos firstholy humanity is doomed
the only reason this persists is ccp wants people to buy alts however for every alt they sell with their command links there are a bunch of people who think this sucks that we have to dual box alts in order to be competitive in this game now with t2 command links this will really suck for people who dont like to dual box alts and for those who say you need to scan down the boosters give me a break even if you were to redirect your attention from the pvp fight to try to start scanning the alt out the alt boosters are aligned ready to warp out as soon as you show up on grid increasing these bonuses without forcing the ships to at least be on grid is obviously a bad direction for the gamemake faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
the balance between the two is already there t3 have much less tank than command ships if the booster was required to be ongrid the command ships would be better for multiple links while t3s could use one or two links while still having tankgank capability

friendly bump
why not just issue eves version of social security numbers into the game i can change my name in rl if i want to but my ssn stays the same we can call them cin sin for concord identification number
yes good points i think the main thing is to make it so we can know our militiary complexes are being invaded if its by map that is ok with me  as long as the map is fixed so its not so buggy make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
i thought this thread could use a bump
i dont sorry dad
not supported
we dont have such a policy we check each case and evaluate each claim such a system probably also weeds out a lot of genuine claims and we dont want to do that if we are able to verify that a bugerror was a cause of a loss we want to reimburse almost all items lost in eve are lost in some sort of combat i can not go into details but we keep track of when we catch players obviously and intentionally trying to abuse our services repeat offenders get official warnings and account bans however it is safe to assume that most false reimbursement claims just get a polite noas irritating as it is when our logs dont show everything we want them tothey actually often do  and as a result we reimburse thousands upon thousands of ships and items every month ill see if i can dig up some data on that for you guys
as nice as that might sound what i concluded when i tried to get two of my chars hurricanes reimbursed two separate incidents and petitions back when we lost connection desynced etc etc etc because the server code was a ludicrous piece of  and hadnt been fixed by team bff was that i might as well just not bother sending in petitions because all i got was boilerplate responses insisting just got me more boilerplate its not that i needed them replaced but i figured id give it a try to see how it went and i got more or less the response i expectedif thats different now then ill be pleasantly surprised of course
the petition in question currently awaits your input
im voting solidly in the gms suck categorythis is based onpoor communication skillsfailure to answer simple questionsnot dealing with a clear repeatable bugdisplaying an utter lack of knowledge of game mechanicsnot bothering to think or investigateflat out lyingwhen finally cornered closing the petition instead of admitting itexamplespetition for reimbursement on a ship that got popped even though the cyno showed as done the station refused to let me dock when i asked the question when did the cyno end so i could compare with the death mail i got no response not even the default we dont bother to log thati had a bug where i couldnt create a contract with a container it kept claiming item x which changed couldnt be found different containers different stuff in them repeatable for over a week did the gms fix the problem move my stuff because i couldnt nope i kept the stuff there for a week so the bug could be investigated expecting a reasonable response ie its repeatable  grab it and kill the bug  didnt even get a thank you bug report came back unable to replicate on any test system really what a big surprise what a wastei had a senior gm tell me that warning windows only get displayed when an outofrange order is placed not on order modification do these guys play the game or are they just given so much stuff they dont have to worry about such details like buying and selling stuffi had a senior gm tell me that they didnt have access to regional average data this is despite the fact that it had previously been demonstrated that they had access to the transaction data so a bit of work with a calculator and  or a pencil would give them the average he had it if hed bothered but then if hed bothered to think hed have realized the average wasnt needed an upper limit would suffice and that can easily be tested with a simple database queryive had cases where its taken until the 3rd of 4th cycle of the conversation to find any evidence of action on the part of the gm iow nowhere in the first 3 or so messages from the gm did i find anything like i searched i queried i asked i investigated i checked so even if they did any of those things their communication was so poor they didnt express the actionill admit that ive submitted a couple stupid petitions usually when it was way too late and my brain was fried and then the response has been reasonable but past the stupidnoob issues the gms have been total failspend 8 minutes watching this ted video on apathy
sounds more like a bug than something for a petition but still you need to be able to reproduce an issue otherwise the developer cannot fix it  the bug is basically not there  not important currently any bug you file for eve will be filteredtrashed by the bug hunters  developers if not reproducible these are the current guidelines  at least that is what i am told after getting bugs of mine treated this way thats also one of the reasons i also posted in incarna 112 issues thread this and this on their philosophy how to treat bugs you remember overview jumping for weeks no responsefeedback to my suggestions of a quality first test system has it been even readi would also like to know if an issue is already tracked therefore ccp needs to provide a detailed known bugs list  known issues not enoughcheck the moderated 10000 papercuts evelopedia page
1 it was a reproducible bug i reproduced it for over a week on multiple containers2 youre right its not the gms job to fix the bug i opened a separate bug report but they should have fixed the effects the bug is impacting gameplay so the gm should have fixed gameplay options would include relocate the stuff that couldnt be couriered basically this is a stuck petition because the stuff cant move come up with some other solutionmeanwhile they should have been calling the bug hunters on the phone and saying we have a reproducible bug capture whatever data you need before we fix gameplay and it disappears and the bug hunters should have been on it like flies on poo  instead of responding a month later

agreed with this will make for more variety for sure and id love to see the t2 versions of the cane and harbinger 
funny thing with your specific comparison is that the myrmidon has 6 prominent turret slots and the prophecy is a laser boat while the damnation is a missile boatnot to mention that ccp is working on visible missile launcherssauls suggested mapping is what id go with why oh why wasnt the nighthawk based on a drake hull since it gets similar bonuses to the drake
to be fair on that specific point the command ships were introduced before the tier ii battlecruisers so there was only one set of models to choose from at the timei might photoshop up some screen shots of the tier iis into the relevant skins for my own curiosity if nothing else
this is a pretty thin reason for this drastic of a changeif you think it thru a bit better as to slot layout changes to support this and any needed cpupg changes you may get some movement but not just for seeing a black nighthawkside note i really like the idea of each races command ships coming from the two different hulls
yes for the love of godi might actually be tempted to fly a command ship if it didnt look like ass
good idea would love to see some new models in game
its like playing wheres wally one major problems are the windows you need to have up when you are pvping especially in gangs you usually have up the overview ofcthe actual fleet window local corp fleet and alliance chat windows which do take up a bit of space its quite obvious from the pics that targets are almost impossible to see where they are if they are hid under these windows people say rearrange your windows well that wont solve the issue as your targets can be on the screen anywhere at anytime you would be constantly moving your windows abouton alot of space games they have some sort of hud that can be turned on and off perhaps this is what we need i am actually surprised in a game thats very much about pvp nothing like this has been even considered crazy really for me i think it is a major problem am quite surprised by people saying its not  we have just learned to live with it because we had to anyone who really pvps alot would consider this more than just a paper cut i am also surprised why people are asking how it should be done havent you played any other flightspace game beforecheck out the following
whilst i am glad to see that in the next expansion ccp are adding what appears to be meaningful new content that doesnt involve buying my toon pretty shoes please ccp for the love of chribba could you fix some of the age old bugs firstprimarily among them imho is kill mails they are an age old feature that is still plagued by bugs given the age of this game the system for generating kill mails should be perfected by nowyet still kill mail after kill mail messes up i personally have lost t3s that had no subsytems fitted killed freighters topped up to the brim with bpos and been solod by battlecruisers because eve cant keep logs of something that happened two minutes ago if you jump through a gatethe socalled feature is a joke accepted only because its been flawed so long that people have stopped bothering to complain about it it is perhaps the biggest annoyance for me in pvp up there with people hot dropping supercaps on battlecruisers and neutral rr in high sec wars actually the reason i left high secso heres my list of things that need fixing with the km system if anyone can think of anything else thatd be grandsession changes mess up kill mails suicide prevents a km from being generated kms are malformed when cluster load is high item ids for bpcs and bpos are identical rr do not show on kms complicated one to fix on this list this is perhaps the most understandable issue 1 whilst this would probably be the most difficult to fix it has to for me be the highest priority issue the majority maybe of engagements occur on a gate and the most common method of disengaging is to jump back through2 using suicide to deprive the aggressors of a km fine thats cool but a publicly viewable km showing that the victim did something silly would be nice at the moment its a lame mechanic that allows people in high ehp shipsfleet battles to hide their mistakes i expect it to rise in popularity when the logoffski says goodbye fixing it before then would be nice3 high seems to be oddly defined ive seen it occur on multiple occasions with 2025k online and 10 in local im not sure what the criteria is but kms are an important aspect of the game for the pvp community they shouldnt get such low priority that they come out malformed or they should be stacked in a queue and generated as and when time allows messed up killmails due to server load to me smacks of very bad programming4 if you cant fix this you shouldnt be designing a computer game if you cant fix this in a period that spans years christ where does our subscription money go again5 pretty difficult to fix and perfectly understandable maybe adding a tag that shows they were present and repping one of the targets would be possible without increasing server load too much maybe even showing who they were repping but killmails should represent what actually occurred id rather people who use an army of neutral rr boats arent worshipped as pvp gods who fight against the odds
remove killmails there fixed
go complain about skunkworks some more 
1 meh2 either way someone lost a ship bring more dps if you want a juicy km3 a single server iirc can handle up to ten systems if theyre low volume systems now if you suddenly have a 10v10 fight in one system and a 50v50 in another on that server  things get dicey4 its db stuff  easier to use 1 id for 2 items rather than 2 ids for 2 nearly identical items  a difference of only 2 columns seriously it doesnt matter though i thought that was fixed with the new bpc colours5 meh
1 meh for you because youre a pve toon why are you posting in a thread concerning killmails a subject you likely dont care about its akin to me posting my opinions on mining2 not realistic two minute timer fights dont last two minutes again something youd know if you were a pvp toon3 theres no noticeable lag surrounding areas are empty we know they are were roaming with scouts out killmails still mess up priority needs raising or the kms need to be queued my point stands4 again it isnt fixed and its a simple issue that completely screws up killmails5 meh because youre a pve toon
kill mails are completely irrelevant to pvp and eve as a whole i say just remove them but we know that wont happen either way i am going to vote no on this since you came right out of the gate whining about ccp not fixing what you want them to which completely dismisses everything coming with the winter expansion despite you specifically mentioning what is coming in the winter expansion
meh im fine with the winter expansion especially the idea of new complexes and items kudos to ccp for changing direction a little with the content theyre addingbut there are a large number of issues with the game as it stands many of which are completely ignored by ccp killmails for me is one of the main ones and so its the one i posted on the problem as far as im concerned is that them messing up is a daily occurrence not rare one off incidents that happen every few months especially the part about sessions changes almost every engagement without a blob that becomes an issue we end up being forced to blob just to stop nano drakes getting back to gatethey are not irrelevant to pvp and theyre pretty important for alliances and corporations when recruiting as for pve if you had a jf pilot apply to your alliance who regularly loses ships it would be nice to know yes
1 yes killmail denial due to session changes needs to be fixed2 no selfdestruct is a legitimate tactic get over it3 some yes some no here limiting the number of people on a km ensures some decent competition for getting on them sometimes malformed killmails are simply the result of something not going right on the interpreter for 3rd party killmail parsers killboards however modules not showing correctly or pilots being dropped from kills they legitimately should be on should be looked into4 yes separating bpcs and bpos in killmails makes them more interesting5 im ambivalenthowever there are many more factors in the game that id rather have ccp focusing on than making killmails better at this current point
1 eve is pvp just because i choose different arenas than you doesnt mean i am not engaged in pvp while i admittedly refrain from combat can you say with certainty that i cannot hop into a ship and pew2 if the fight doesnt take 2 minutes to complete  then shouldnt the self destruct be irrelevant3 i suppose it all comes down to how ccp determines what systems are on a node  4 you really dont get how bad it is to do stuff like this in dbs  do you5 you were logistics  and didnt apply anything to the target why does this matter or are you talking about the other guys rr if any
i like this bullet point format makes arguing multiple points possible without creating a wall of text p anyways yeah2 i agree killer should be denied a km but imho the loss should be visible and the timer should be balanced around the length of an average fleet fight as i said i think this will become a bigger issue when titanssupercaps begin commiting suicide instead of using the 15 minute logoffski3 i dont think its a limit on the number of people last time it happened to me i was cut off the km and there were only 6 people on there same with the time my t3 exploded without subs or mods very few enemy ships on the km i even petitioned it alongside the guys that killed me admitting that i had some very expensive stuff on there t2 rigs etc ccp replied with copy pasta saying they cant generate kmsalso ive never seen an issue with interpretation by a 3rd party except rare cases that battleclinic have quickly rectified most of the time you can see from reading the kill mail that it is incorrect4 lol im just tired of seeing lolwtf isk kills on bc not to mention the completely inaccurate corppersonalalliance stats that come about as a result5 meh same im glad i moved to low sec however i still think if they dont fix neutral rr they should at least let it show up on kms high sec war is just a joke as it is1 i can say that you have no interest in it hence your meh concerning killmails they dont concern you asteroids dont concern me going into a thread you dont care about and saying meh is simply pointless and not constructivemeh i take that back after reading on youre being pretty constructive 2 fights dont take two minutes they take six or ten or more for example we want to kill an orca in a belt his friends warp in to help do we ignore his friends and focus dps on him to kill him in less than two minutes or do we call primaries sensibly and win without losses to win without losses might take ten minutes or more3 hmm good point i assumed nodes were done by region and expanded or contracted as needed but yeah that probably wouldnt distribute load very evenly still during off peak hours kms really shouldnt be messing up they are important to us pvp guys unfortunately they do and it grates4 yes creating a new item id for all the existing bpcsbpos would probably be messy but it could be done during a dt when a new patch comes out and they could try it out on the test server to make sure it doesnt mess anything up first thats why we have a test serverthe main thing is these items are obviously going to be of different value why were they ever given identical ids in the first place im guessing there is a single item type and a boolean value or something to decide if its a bpcbpo why not just have two items anyway if its just some value dictating what the item is hopefully a script could quite easily create a new item to replace all the bposthen again you are correct i dont really know exactly how difficult it would be but it would be nice if ccp would explain to us why they cant do these things and try and sound convincing p as it is its just a major flaw they seem to have ignored for a very long time 5 two guys fight say rupture vs tengu the rupture wins because he has four guardians helping the km shows that in a 1v1 a rupture killed a tengu rupture pilot looks like a god and because he does this consistently his kill board makes him look like a ridiculously good pilotscratch that about creating walls of text i always manage it always
hahahahahahahahahahaha gaspccp has already gone on record that killmails are working as intended so the carebear fantasy of killmails going away wont happen they consider them important and are adding implants to killmails so obviously the trend is toward improving them1 3 and 4 im not familiar with2 i had a thread in here a while back about self destructs creating killmails losing a ship to concord gives a killmail to the player that did the most damage assuming a player did any damage i dont see why suicides should be any different5 ive wondered if there would be a way to put remote support on a killmail of course that would open the door for some serious km whoring where everyone with an sort of remote support throws reps sebo whatever on a fight to get in on the mail definitely needs a lot of thought to make it work well maybe only rr coming from fleetmatesedit completely random thought it would be hilarious to take a fleet of logis to jita and rr both parties of any fight that starts so that they cant kill each otherive been pushing for a change to rr so that if you rep a target that has an aggression timer that would prevent them from jumping or docking you would inherit that timer and be unable to dock or jump as well if that were put into place it should be easy enough to have the logis get on the killmail thats assuming ccps system of generating killmails works the way i think it does
aye ive read that suggestion on here before and i think on the old forums it seems like the best solution to the issues with rri think the whole rr system needs a slight rework rr from fleetmates only would probably prevent km whoring and also maybe put a dampener on the guys that randomly rep people outside jita before promptly undocking a vindicator if they get attackedin all honesty though getting rr onto kms would be difficult at best rr should just never have become this much of a problem in the first place again its another issue that should have been addressed by now it would have been nice if ccp at least came forward and gave a good reason as to why adopting an aggression timer is infeasible
its certainly feasible the current system where logi inherit yellow timers is relatively new i think they need to take the final step and transfer all forms of aggressionone concern that has been raised is the ability to pass the aggression timer down a logi chain in such a way that two logis repping each other would permanently hold that timer and never be able to dock even though neither of them has committed a hostile act that could certainly be prevented from happening its just up to the devs to work out the best way to do so

well looks like this thread has gotten completely off topic and is probably unrecoverableso with that in mind vile rat has this given you any pearls to work with or what
one annoying thing as others have mentioned is that pos in high sec can take a lot of work just to get the standings to put it up then for whatever reason if you have to move your corp to another place you get to start all over againi dont know much about how pos work in terms of servicing one but do you think its possible that perhaps some skills or a career could be made out of pos work somehow almost like a pos mechanic or something a career that perhaps if you went along that path would make it also easier to install a pos for your corp etc maybe a career at going around setting up poses for people and maintaining them via contract of some sort
csm member vile rat you are offering to review ideas from players of eve that might lead to what you called your vision UFFFDmy vision i want to see a legitimate career path for those who want to live in empire and enjoy eveonline i want to see empire activities iterated upon properly and i want there to be a plentiful array of entertainment options available for those who want to make their empire in empire and not lowsecnullsecUFFFDi have given that some thought and would like to put forth the idea that players with significantly high standings with a particular empire be allowed to place a full blown pos that rivals the npc stations in any system in empire space that does not currently have a npc station a high sec corporate outpost in the hypercapitalistic market that is new eden it seems that players and the microtransactional economy they represent must now directly compete with the npc stations to take the next logical stepyes it should be expensive no it should not be so much so that it is unprofitable the corporation alliance setting up the high sec outpost should be allowed to implement the system upgrade mechanics of sov to make their system a more attractive place to tenants additionally the access to the outpost itself should be controlled by the corp alliance that placed it there but the access to the system would remain unrestricted concord would of course have a very limited specific role in a player controlled high sec system that would be limited to the jump gates to curtail contraband and enemies to their empire and to strictly enforce no gate camping the system internally would or could be extremely dangerous but transit thru it should remain safe the controlling corp alliance would be responsible to react to control and define criminal activity in their system these empire corp controlled systems would of course be a prime target for the sansha and they should make frequent attempts to capture the population pi and moon mining are very similar a high sec improvement would be to allow more then 1 entity to mine a moon as is currently possible in pi additionally moon mining needs to be implemented in sec systems greater then 03 to preserve and improve the reward for all those willing to risk low sec moon mining the occurrence of high value ore must be significantly increased and limited to low sec and null space in the dust514 implementation it would improve profitability if ground forces could capture pi and moon mining facilities intact and or have the ability to repair damaged facilities some of my thoughts on enabling the creation of corporate empires in high sec empire space
3040 billion ought to do it right and no to this being allowed anywhere near hisec lowsec might be workable but its touchy there too
rp  there are people in the star gates who control access to it they are also what is going on in the system and they can register rat kills and pass out bounties and sec status
no more bounties in null and you get tags instead turn in tags in lowhigh sec there now your rp is fixed now kindly  offif bounties on rats is the only reason you can see to be in null you need to get out more
this proposal is about as waaaaaaah as it gets the fairly obvious ulterior motive is to eliminate suicide ganking in highsec which ccp has stated multiple times to be working as intended your solution of rats in null drop tags is laughable at best because the main reason rats are killed is specifically for the bounties followed by the security status increasesalso removing bounties on rats would give players zero reason to be in null as there would be nothing of value to the individual player all of the larger benefits of null space moongoo require a reasonably large entity to maintain and a fair amount of isk to keep running the value of these to the individual unless youre skimming profits as the ceo of a corp or something are fairly limitedin short without replacing ratting with some other activity that pays the individual removing bounties and security status increases would turn null sec into a wasteland and ccp would lose a considerable segment of their playerbase maybe you should consider the consequences of your proposals better before mindlessly posting them and then calling players who are capable of looking at the consequences trollsas others have said id be fine with replacing ratting with something else but since you have failed to provide that something else your proposal is mostly dumbo7o7o7o7o7o7o7o7o7o7o7m8m8m8m8
so turn in tags and get reward and security boost
please show the judge where on the mackinaw the bad boys touched you miss
that makes more sense to me would put a purpose back into tags
but that wouldnt help the posters of fhc so i guess thats out then
just the reward not bothi do realize that the income of high sec needs a nerf why kill npcs in null sec for a slightly better profit when you can do it in high sec in complete aside from things like suicide ganks safety balancing the income levels is not what this proposal is aboutand for the record i am a supporter of suicide ganks hulkageddon and other activities like that i even donated over a billion in prizes for last years hulkageddon and will be doing the same this time the purpose of this proposal is for there to be a different area for players to get their security status back up to go into high sec more specific area low sec where there is real danger doing it not ten regions deep into your power blocks territory where you have a dozen intel channels warning you of a lone guy running around so you have time to go make a sandwich and contemplate which safety zone you want to hide in the pos tower cloak or dock most parts of null are just as safe as high secit is amusing to see some of you shout that this is a nerf to null sec or to pirating or suicide ganking you can still do all of that you just have to rat in low sec instead of null
with respect you think im gonna drag all those tags from say stain all the way to empire err no sorryi jump clone so i dont have to fly up and down
so in other words theres even less point in shooting red crosses then which means im definitely not going to do it oh well ill just keep doing what im doing now instead spend a few minutes a day on my jita alt fiddling with various buysell orders and get 1b dings in my wallethell even my jita alt has a negative security rating because shooting red crosses is so much fun that i definitely need less incentive to do sothats why you get someone do it for you
there is no risk in low or null for sec status i was in a cloaky pilgrim and only killed rats in empty low sec systems and safedcloaked if someone came in done the same in null with a proteus cloaky  nullifier while in npc corp with no blues all the change will do is make the grind longer for those who do it in null now
just so you gais know in drone 00 you get very little sec since drones dont give you much sec i dont see drf guys crying out loud here nor me or my buddies who hang around there somewhat much so in general theres no need to give sec boosts in 00 i dont really care to any extent but theres no real need for sec boosts in 00 best sec boosting is in hi sec certain pve sites and incursions give loads of sec boosts so it doesnt really matter to anyone if you dont get sec boost in 00 again i think it would be more important to remove sec boosts in hi sec instead but maybe thats only me who thinks its  you get sec boosts in hi secjust saying i dont suicide gank retardedly fit overpriced tengu every day so i dont know much
this remove sov null rat bounties
why
remove bounties on rats switch to tags no more concord tiein new avenue for income generation by middlemen security standings gains in low sec means that content will be there since players are the content in this pvp sandbox game of course once youre higher than 50 standings you can gain standings faster by running missions in hisec so its not like youre going to be forced to live in low sec forever
finally someone who gets it
cosmetic restrictions you find the prices of items in the nex too high which pvp persistent worlds have gone f2plotro is a great example of a pve persistent world which has succeeded by going f2p it doesnt matter that some guy can buy gear twice as good as yours because hes not trying to kill you with it progressive download is already on ccps great whiteboard in the sky but only to enhance the new player experience ie start the game the moment you launch the installer being required to purchase extra regions is a foolish idea how are people supposed to introduce rookies to the world of eve online when the rookie has to keep bringing out the credit card just to get to the other side of a stargateim amused that you then try to prop up your argument by pointing out one f2p game that failed dismally lego universe while holding a pve f2p as an example of what eve could become does not computeid also like to remind people that what ccp offers through the nex is a virtual goods store from which the obscenely rich can buy bling to show off to their friends the nex is not a micro transaction store the whole point of conspicuous spending on luxury goods in real life as well as in game is to show off to other people you have items which everyone knows are ludicrously expensive because you have more money than they do such items in real life would be gucchi handbags versace polo shirts 10k designer jeans etcalthough ill get tarred and feathered by many of the other posters here id like to see the nex providing nonvanity items such as special issue ships examples could be a nex equivalent of the cnr you pay aurum instead of lp  badges along with a raven with a sufficiently high aurum value nex ships would be ideal for the purpose of trolling imagine your killboard efficiency when you blow up a single 30b isk battleship hull never mind the goldplated modules that were fitted to it the nex could even release limited issue industrialutility ships of similar metalevel to the utu or freki through auction further increasing item value this would be the alliance tournament of the commercial side of evei believe there is a fair tradeoff at some point between realworld effort as represented in game by aurum and in game effort as represented by lp badges and isk so go ahead and spend your UFFFD500 on a ship with which to bait gankers eventually youll lose it all the while providing awesome content in the form of a loot piUFFFData and you guys were having a tanty about ccp zulus reference to 1000 designer jeans lol
not empty quotingjust because the majority of the market uses the f2p model does not mean that everyone in the market should if everyone jumped off a cliff would you blindly follow themto me and to everyone ive talked to in game proposals such as yours are abominable wrecking this game so you can have special toys or buy skills you havent the patience to train and experience to use does not make sense
sorry but you dont seem to be getting thisto a lot of players the fact that other people are able to change the conditions of the world and their gameplay by rl means seriously damages the game world for themfor me id turn to single player games where no one else gets to wreck my illusion
f2p games are all about putting the smallest possible effort into gameplay coating that gameplay in a thick layer of fecal matter then charging people money to wash the  off in a f2p game you dont make decisions based on is this balanced or is this fun but more on how can we make this as awful as possible so people will pay us not to do it sure you can play for free and delude yourself you can stick it to the man and dig the gameplay out yourself but at the end of the day your hands are still covered in poop
20 million players who didnt have much choice but to pay a subscription fee and do you really think ccp wants to keep their target audience down to 20 million players i doubt it most people dont have the money to spend on a monthly sub there are a lot more than 20 million people out there that would gladly give eve a try and potentially spend money in the mt store if given the opportunity to it is true that f2p is a method of a free trial that is designed to hook the player thats the point as it gets harder and harder to get people to pay subscription fees another method has to be found just because you think 20 million people were ok with paying subscription fees for a game doesnt mean they are now or ever even wanted tofrankly the current free trial that ccp has for eve is a joke for this game what the hell can you accomplish in 14 or 21 days 3 months maybe personally i think ccp should make eve f2p and restrict what skills can be trained and what modules and items can be used without paying the monthly sub or plex or whatever with enough restrictions the potential player could experience everything eve has to offer to a very limited degree for as long as he likes or needs by severe restrictions i mean nothing allowed to be trained above level 2 for mining weapons defense etceven games like lotro and eq2 just to name a couple off the top of my head do this play for free with restrictions pay your monthly sub and get the full blown game and everything it has to offer why would this be bad for eve more targets to shoot everywhere you goonly weaker targets more potential revenue for ccp this leads to more devs and more in expansions and faster and better development of current and new content
weaker targets are boring and no challenge plus wouldnt anyone in the f2p mode you suggest be more likely to leave rather than sign up after being bashed about a bit by the existing player
does every miner in eve quit after being bashed up by other players the kind of people that would quit after that are the kind of people that wouldnt like eve to begin with the kind of people that would survive are the ones that subscribe train and come back for revenge
you missed or worse misrepresented my point the only point i was making was that lotro is a bad example to use of games that have successfully morphed from subscription to f2p models since it is a pve game with optional pvp eve online is pvp all the time with all players sharing the one virtual world so imbalances introduced through gearforcash will have much greater impact on that virtual world your point is valid but that doesnt mean my point is invalid lotro is pve while eve online is pvp is entirely unrelated to i dont like people being able to alter the in game world using outofgame meansi will extend that point though and suggest that due to eve online having the harshest death penalty short of hardcore mode in diablo imbalances introduced through gearforcash schemes will not be so severe since that gear will eventually inevitably be destroyed the more that gear is worth the more likely it is that such lootkillmail piUFFFDatas will be deliberately hunted for no other reason than that they are valuable targetshere are the eulaabiding ways we currently alter the ingame world through outofgame means forumircteamspeak spies alts on same account eg market alts contract alts pirate vs iskfarming alts alts on multiple accounts cyno alts covert surveillance alts bribery ill organise a date with my sister if you forget to pay sov psychology politics plex for isk turn off titanflying players mains power during major fleet fight okay it was only discussed not actually done but still UFFFD if people are truly concerned about outofgame activities influencing ingame activities there is no persistent world mmo suitable for them and many of the sessionbased mmos are not suitable either there is of course skyrim
helps a tonne i never knew you could do that and was always trying to right cilck or somethign to move themmany thanx
nice looking ships are well nice1
go to lowsec if you want to gank peopleintroducing a new mechanic for the sole purpose of breaking an existing mechanic thats working as intended is pointless
similar to the way overviews work my proposal is to allow game option shortcut and window positions to be exported and imported on different accounts to allow separate them to be synchronized easier
please yes 1
this gets a  from me theres no reasno to break this legitmate mechanic it would make command ships in capital fights completly usless becuase you would be for all intense and purposes owned as soon as you came on grid to give your captial ships boosts
its a no thank you from meif someone has a pos up they took the time to do exactly that why shouldnt they then reap the benefits of this later in fightsalso they fixed tech 3 just because you cant be arsed to probe them down is your problem and not the problem of the tech 3 ships or gang links they fitted to be harder to probe you need to fit to find them sounds like balance to meits not as if this isnt open for all why do you lot always insist this game be dumbed down and made so much easierdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
this all comes down to one simple fact if any ship is giving bonuses to other ships in a fight then that ship should be required to be in the fight no ship participating in pvp combat should be completely immune from being killed this means no warping around the system or hiding in a pos you cant target another ship and fire from within a pos why should you be able to give bonuses from within one same goes for warping or even sitting still in another part of the system command links can effectively do more damage than the ship itself could by firing its own guns depends on how many other ships they are giving bonuses to so if you want to let command ships to continue to give bonuses without participating in the fight directly then i expect to be able to target and kill any ship within a pos and i expect to be able to do the same from within a pos
it seems we never agree you think it would dumb the game down to require booster ships on the battle grid i think that is a very hard case to makelets say you have an idiot cousin you decide to put him in a command ship or booster t3 which do you think would be easier for this dumb relative1 to have to fly the ship on the grid where the battle is taking placeor2 to have him sit at a pos or in a safe spot aligned out to warp if anyone shows up on a 200k dscanplease answer thatcurrenlty flying these booster ships where you dont even have to be on grid is so boring and easy no one would actually think of doing that with anything other than an alt you are multiboxing there is a difference between dumbing the game down and making it more tedious forcing people to multibox alts simply makes the game tedious and destroys any small semblance of immersion the game has sure some people are so concerned about looking like a hero on the killboards that they will suffer through this immersion breaking tedium but that is not good for the game these boosting ships dont show up on the killmail  which they should those who dont want eve to be a chore will quickly find that it is no longer for themmake faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
if pos were complicated demanding expensive and required player skill to set up then yes most definitely the owners deserve the 2 days worth of absolute immunity for their links  not the case though  and now pos are getting dumbed down to bootyou done a lot of combat probing after the change sure it is theoretically doable provided you have maxed skills andor implants  sisters gear  if the t3 has deepish safe spots you are screwed though as it will take ages to get anywhere near itif range was limited to 12au or so then they can be probed1111 would be a very valid argument but that is also not the casejust brain farted some alternate ways of handling it cheap readily available and easily fittedrun module that blocks all communications from offgrid hard counter to offgrid links link interference 1 disables the use of directional scanner while links are active cycle time increased to two minutes to prevent rapid cyclingscanning link interference 2 active links disrupt shield harmonics causing pos bubbles to harden making them impassable by everyone but the link ship any ship inside will be bounced as if the pw was changed should open door for some quality laughsgriefing
poses already influence fights through cyno jammers jump bridges weapon  ewar batteries if you want to benefit from a pos during a fight bring the fight to the posoffgrid boosters allow an afk player to influence combat in what bizarro world does this make sense in the meantime i am of course training my alt to fly a 6link tengu to boost incursion fleets am i a hypocrite certainly am i going to exploit any valid game mechanics to my advantage of courseat some later point in time that alt will be flying a tengu or loki ongrid providing boosts and combat capability of course id really love to be able to provide siegeskirmish warfare links ongrid with a shield tanking drone boat but we cant always get what we want ps if ccp is watching id love a rattlesnake or dominix which can mount warfare links or a sleipnir with 5 medium drones perhaps a siegeskirmisharmorinformation warfare processor retrofit rig which provides the warfare link bonus that battlecruisers enjoy allowing battleships to be retrofitted with a gang link
i have only three words for this proposition no  wayi can see where you are coming from and this is the same attitude almost everyone has towards supercaps and co which is understandable but it pisses me off most of the time if i cant do it then no one else should i for one run exploration sites and i use an offgrid boosting alt this proposition requires me to fly 2 accs at the same time just to get bonuses so whoever wants to gank me can get the advantage no  way
id like to see a sp remap for plex i can live with that but its obviously gonna drive plex prices into the roof
now with picture goodness to show exactly how to use this abuse to achieve complete invulnerability for your highsec towers
signed ccp absolutely has to  stop changing the rules because they cant be bothered to fix i have no problem with this they pay an 11 tax for that immunity wanting to have their cake and eat it to or i am a highsec bear i am entitled needs to end
u mad broworking as intended go to lowsec
start charging 10 to 50 mil a shot and youd make it a profitble business and not likely to whine about this crap  op  stop the evemail spam
dec shield has received enough generous donations to break even with operating costs for the foreseeable future already we were gifted with a bhaalgorn and around 100mil in smaller donations from assorted sources we were originally going to make dec shield a paid service but decided we wanted as many people to use it at possible and isk was never an issue and while i appreciate you bumping the thread goose99 you seem to be lacking the reading comprehension to understand what were doing here were not fighting these wars were making sure others cant
i support making highsec less safe and removing this loophole with an overhaul to the criminal flagging and war systems
 1 i totally agree with this when the servers go down and you just scanned everything if the site didnt despawn it should not change in any manner same would be said for if you go to the station and log off and come back on the site is still there it
i am curiousdoes sisi go through the same downtime and restart that tq does each day i ask because i want to log into sisi right before downtime to scan and rescan after to see what sisi does to my knowledge nobody has tried this the easy assumption being that it will do exactly what tq does but you never knowthey might have a fix in place they just havent mentioned
edit holy crap they did it
woo
because of falcon  because of eafim ok with that
i have always been in favor of games actually looking at the comments people leave about their tickets the devs have no way of knowing if their assets are being deployed correctly otherwise some sort of system to review tickets to see if the issue could have been solved after the fact to keep only the gms who can think outside of the box would be appropriate
i must agree  1 on this threadyou cannot take away the bottom line of this game this game isnt safe it makes you think on your toes every second of the day new players need to know that and sugar coating them in the recruitment channel is not going to protect them its going to hurt them becuase they will think that everyone is nice and will get hurt even worse later on when they actually have things to loose more then their pride eve is a univrse always on the go and always changing it has made a name for itself that other mmos have not what you do inpacts people in the real world that you cannot play this game if you cannot think on your toes please dont change this ccp
for rr how about everyone in fleet on grid is on the killmail put flags on the killmail for boostingreppingpointingewar and just doing nothing atleast if everyone is on the killmail people might drop the 4x sebos for tank
hmm well hopefully theyll get round to it at some point if they do i might grind my sec back up and try some high sec warfare again might be nice to have some fights that dont consist mainly of aligning out unless a cyno pops and a fleet of supercaps appears dif they dont it would be nice if they could explain their reasoning if theres a genuine technical limitation fair enough it would just be nice to know if its something that will ever be fixedhah true although i hope they have a flag for do not show my alt that is in the enemy alliance and was cloaked in fleet off the gate that could be embarrassing imho the easiest way would be to amend the involved parties part of a km so that it adds to the list any pilot who has remote repped one of the attacking pilots whilst they where aggressed perhaps even showing repair amount although that wouldnt strictly be necessary if it created too much server loadalthough as floppie pointed out that would probably result in some major kill mail whoring i might even train up logi myself either way itd be pretty messing adding rr to kms id prefer if they just changed it so rr wasnt the only valid strategy in high sec warsinb4 it isnt it is
this gets a  from me the system needs to be revamped when you have entire corps out there who are based around remote repping other corps who do wars and split the loot i belive its time for a change if at least that the player who is at war with your rr target can now target you without concord intervention it would be nice i like the fact that we are getting teh ability to see implants possibly clothing in the future but i have had several of these issues mentioned come up if someone jumps trough the gate it resets their damage counters bascially and so you have to follow them trough and hit them again to get on killmails so say a fleet is engaging a person in say a orca and he powers tyrough you to the otherside and barley jumps then you have a few guys on the otherside whalla it looks like a bc took out a orca by himself rr it has always been a problem to me that they can disengage and warp away no problem but think about it this way your a logi ship with no way of defending yourself to that i belive they do need to be marked on teh killmails otherwise it would look silly that a few af take out a large ship or can surive in lowsec at stations or gates i have yet to figure out what cuases the killmails to break becuase you have killmails with hundreds on them and they are correct and you have killmails with 4 people on it and their fittings are wrong
imho fleet boosters whether off or on grid should also show up on killmails anything that contributes to the kill should show upmake faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
security is like an onion no not because it smells or looks like an ogre but because it involves layers one simple layer of security is to ensure that peoples email addresses are not the same as their account nameone principle of security is least privilege that is dont give people privileges or information they dont need since you dont really need the account name to sell someone a character that information is excess to requirementsheres an example of how it could work i want to sell a character to i start a character sale ticket or charter for short you want to buy my character so you bid on the charter and nominate an account for the character to be transferred to this information is held in the charter system not revealed to the seller i accept your bid or your bid is the highest above reserve price at the conclusion of the auction period the system transfers the character based on you winning the charter auction thus the only information revealed by the system relates exclusively to the character for saleat present the risk is minimal assuming the people involved have decently strong passwords in the future the risk will be slightly lower due to the use of the token generators a charter system as described will help smooth out the process though
hisec industry needs a bit of a buff the margins are razor thin to encourage this unfortunately more things need to be blown up and minerals taken out of the systemccp could we please have  1 a concerted investigation into drone region botting which i believe accounted for 13 of minerals in the game at present2 hisec ship losses used to be much higher than now perhaps skewed by insurance fraud could we possibly look at2a a slight buff to the higher tier insurance payouts2b reduction in time for concord response making well planned ganking viable in higher security systems2c a slight buff to npc rats dps across the board to make missions and anomalies slightly harder and make more ships explode2d a look at the faction warfare mechanics so that faction warfar can be carried out into hisec as well and get more people involved with blowing things upthis will hopefully encourage more ships exploding and as such will boost mining and industry margins
how is this a buff to mining and industry again stop the evemailUFFFDspam
simple economics actually supply is inversely proportional to demand and viceversathe more ships that get destroyed the higher the demand for the replacement of said ships and thus the more that need to be manufactured thus the more minerals that would need to be gathered to manufacture said ships therefore creating a new supply to replace what was destroyedthis creates more work for the legitimate industrial pilots in the game if bots are removed there will be less competition for materials against them and real players and may actually lower the prices of certain items which have been targetted for rmt say plex which if you have been watching recent market trends have had their prices rising at alarming rates due to inflation created by isk faucets bot mining and incursions i am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
war is the engine that drives the universe just like any other consumptiondriven economy destruction is more valuable than construction
well puti am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
apologies for restating what youd already posted i should refresh before submitting my carefully crafted verbiage
while ccp guys are reading this thread and are taking down ideas im going to harvest this thread for good ideas to introduce to the conversation we have at the next summit some ideas might be utterly dumb but parts of them might be cool and work well when put with other stuff so its all useful even the bad ones im taking down notes and paraphrasing a lot of this and hope to make some good headway this next month keep posting ideas but yea gtc chat would be better placed in a different thread
as with most folk who have posted here there are some niggles like setting up multiple research and manufacturing jobsmaybe find some way of automating them
level 4 missions are boringmind numbling boringsome dynamic missions with a real challenge and a better ai would maybe make them somewhat intrestingalso long term goals and group missions are restricted to wh space or incursionshigher level missions that can be completed in a short time maybe even with a group would be fun not asking for more isk per hourjust something intresting
imo a silly solution get more accounts so you can use more ram
you are rightwhat was i thinking lol
i like the idea but there is a better hull than the procurer to use for this ship class the primaenoctis hull was made for this kind of mining at the very least ccps art department could add a few gas tanks to the model but i think it is there it is easy enough to set it up with the hard points as they are already in place on the noctis for the current gas miners so there wouldnt be as much work getting it set for this role as a guessi think it would work well with the folloing6 high slots  5 miners  slot for probe launcher or cloak 4  5 mid slots  for a tank3 low slots  for cargo expanders25m3 drone bay  for defence20 reduction of gas harvester duration per levelrole bonus 200 better yield for gas harvesters per levelseriously these attributes would be good as gas mining more than any other form of miing is like watching paint dry getting the mining cycle down to maybe 20seconds and 60m3 yields will cut the mining time but not too significantly will probably still take a good amount of time to clear a gas site the other option is up the amount of gas in gas sites  i think this would work well in this configuration
what floppie said
so all this is supposed to do is get people to play more in lowsec why not remove sec status grinding from hisec too then
no the op is just a glorified carebearits a stealth boost to high sec profits stop the evemail spam
who has a few thousand more kills that you and that is just with one of my charactersyou have stated your opinion on my idea a few times fine trying to label it as some boost to the amount of money someone makes in high sec is just stupid
supported once youre red you should be red for good this will be a boost to lownull population
1010 quantifire you provide something down there that someone can bribe their way back into highsec or something similar this game after all is about the market if you remove a legal means of getting back into highsec then one should be able to use lo
so marlona sky just wants to remove sec status grinding from nullsec not from hisec as well where the gain to lowsec is potentially biggerps goose99 youre missing the point read the post again
 grid only gang links i would not be opposed to not allowing gang links to be active inside a force field though
youre already flying two accounts to get the bonuses the only difference is they now both require attention
so you actually have no problem at all with a genuinely invulnerable gang boosting ship in a pos participating in a fight but youre complaining about a totally probeable ship doing the sameokyou know those horribly vulnerable untanked safespotted t3s are not cheap at all spend some isk of your own and probe them out you dont even have to risk your prober since the safespotted t3s are unarmed
if someones genuinely not paying attention to their 800m isk ship then youre looking at an easy killbring a dictor because you may have noticed those skirmish mindlinks going past the 100m mark lately
thats not a fact its an opinionwe may agree on something in the future who knows rather than asking questions 1  2 you need to ask the correct ones1 should someone be able to fit a tech 3 to work off grid2 should a corp gain the benefits from a pos they took the time to install3 do all these options have a counter and are they open to allyou lot are basically saying we dont want to be bothered with finding tech3 or fittingequipping ourselves for the task therefore we think ccp should nerf itoh and this idea will make it more tedious not less that was a weak argument to bring tbhif they are so easy you put one up and reap the benefits toothe interaction of fuelling the pos is being made easier but as you have to build the fuel blocks you can hardly claim it as being dumbed downthere is nothing theoretical about it you just need to equip accordingly rather like the tech 3 ship hasdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
im against itwhy because1 this request is a i want you to play eve the way i play it request2 it will affect missionrunners miners and incursion players as welldissonance is recruiting members
the arguing about this is just stupid now ccp has enough common sense mark my wordsthis will be corrected in the future predicting it now with my psychic mojo
you did not answer my questions so i will take it you admit it does not dumb down the game to require link ships to be on grid in fact its pretty brainless when they are not on grid at a safe however i will still answer yours because they are easy1 it can work but its work should not directly influence a battle that is happening on grid2 yes and i am not suggesting we remove every reason to build a pos 3 yes it has a counter the counter is the immersion breaking UFFFDeve is a choreUFFFD option of dragging an alt around yourself and multiboxing your combat so you can compete that option sucks the other UFFFDcountersUFFFD dont work well as explained above no i am saying everyone seems to agree that no one really uses these ships with their main people who use them are multiboxing i am saying that for me and many others that completely breaks the immersion of this game and makes it more of a chore than fun ccp is now boosting these alts with new tech 2 links wich will make a bad situation worse for everyone who just wants to have some fun with eve and not treat it as a job after the bonuses people who do not have these alts will simply not be competitive and so will not engage in pvp yes i realize that ccp likely thinks it would be great to force everyone who wants to be competitive to pay for an additional account and multibox pvp however i think this is very short sighted i for one refuse to do this in pvp now that these links are so damn powerful i may not be able to pvp any longer at least not solo like i normally do moreover i bet allot of people who keep dragging these alts around will get tired of eve as well sure not all of them there are a few in this game that are such drones they would do anything regardless of how tiresome and lame but there will be more than a few who get sick of it  yet they will still realize that if they donUFFFDt others will have a huge advantage in pvp and therefore they will burn out you think flying ships on grid during a pvp battle is tediousmake faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
so it is working as intended then
1 no tech 3 can bring links to same grid and be pretty useful theres no fair reason for them to be in perfect safety in safespot and even on same grid they can be flown in a way theyre near untouchable anyway 2 yes but not for links having a pos in system is a benefit alone reason for putting up a pos shouldnt be making perfect safe for titan or link boat also its not too much trouble to put up random pos especially when 00 alliances have pos in every system anyway3 doing weed is bad for your health stop it
if they intend to make eve a game that cant be played unless you are multiboxing alts then yes its working as intended is that good for the gamemake faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
i am just saying that ccp via player feedback has decided that group play is better than solo play they consistantly give carrots to activities and tactics that require 2 characters by granting bonuses or positive scaling mechanics ccp does not however have an ingame mechanism to filter out alt characters from real characters bad terminology but you get my drift nor do i think that ccp would want to have such a mechanism even if it was possible i know a lot of players who wouldnt that is for sureso long as efficiency is greater by bringing more characters whether more people are at screens or not alt use will increaseare multiple players engaged in activity cooperatively good for the game ccp and many players seem to think sois bypassing the need for friends via the alt mechanics good for the game any rule to the contrary would be unenforceable so the point is moot imo
what feedback are you refering to if the players already prefered group play why would ccp need to give huge isk incentives to join in groups eg incursions its not based on what players want its based on what ccp wants many players dont look to eve as their social medium and ccp is trying to change that ccp want more of players lives invested in the game its understandable from a business perspective but lets assuming they intend to drive out all the solo players making it so you are no longer solo because you have an alt in a booster ship is unlikely to be what they are intending although i do think they may intend to try to get everyone to feel they must have alt accounts to play so that they can make more money i addressed this earlier in the thread and still believe such a view is short sighted its the sort of approach a company that wants to sell a game would take not one that hopes to have a game long term well this particular situation is pretty clearly just for alts or do you know people who like to sit their main at a pos giving their fleet a boost and not doing anything else no one seems to be stepping up and saying that doing that is a very important part of their mains gameplay im sure such people exist but are there numbers great enough to justify losing the number of people who thinks it sucks that you have to mess around with multiple accounts in order to play this game competitivelymake faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
that is exactly what i meant by better the feedback i refer to comes in the way of people posting about how they would have left the game a long time ago if it had not been for the fact that they were part of a corp that they bonded with it also comes from seeing people resub just because thier rl friends or people that they play other games with keep talking about good fights funny ganks etci never made this claim i merely said that group play gets carrotslast i checked carrots are not sticksthis sounds like a complaint against needing a gangbooster even as a solo player to that degree it does not matter if that boosting is done by a pos alt or by an ongrid because ongrid does not mean actually vulnerable playeraltyou hit the nail on the head with the complaint about effort involved in dragging an alt around for boosting that effort will be even greater if it has to be ongrid which is why people dont like such a change especially when splitting up a gangfleet across many grids which means that much more frustration unfortunately as you yourself point out many people see gangboosters as necessary to be competative so people wont stop using them they will just be bitter about how much more effort it takes with them being on gridor they stop bothering to pvp in small gangs completely
an easy solution to war dec greifinga corp or alliance has to have an in space destroyable resource to declare war on another corp or alliance pos or tcu this asset becomes broadcast to the other party involved in a wardec and the asset can only be used in one wardec at a time if you wish to wardec more than one organization additional assets need to be allocated for declarationif the said target is destroyed then the war dec is over at that instant if in the case of an alliance if the corp that owns that resource leaves the alliance the war dec follows the tower or tcu this could be expanded further to high sec and null sec war decs but null sec would need a lot more resources and give and take to make it usefulthis will allow the receiving corpalliance an opportunity to turn the tables on a corp or alliance that declares war only to turtle up in a station let the organization declaring war put up something of value as a risk

againyou completely missed the point1 war decs are a legitimate means of being allowed to kill and pod repeatedly without concord intervention its cheap means of getting business done2 goonies are doing what they do because they can and they dont give a crap about costthey are likely not evenly sweating the cost as it is3 this has nothing to do with carebears fighting back or pvpers throwing a fitthe bottom line  this is about war dec mechanics your assumption is nothing more than a foolish attempt to troll me stop the evemail spam

im not a big fan of sebo effect either i find them very intrusive and annoying one or two ships with them is one thing but when theres 200 of those at once yuk
after a few long discussions with friends i have been swayed to the idea that ccp would do better to increase the benefit and number of places where eafs are the only available recontype ship rather than trying to force eafs into general purpose boatsthe former creates more player driven content the latter creates more balance headaches and whine threads

im sure its been said before but im going to bring it up again  regular carriers should be given the bandwidth to be able to field 5 figterbombers this could be done by a class buff getting a reduction to the bandwidth required or simply just increasing the bandwidth allowance to balance this a carrier should only be able to carry a max of 5 figterbombers in their drone bay so unlike a super carrier fielding 20 they cant pour wave after wave of good dps so a theoretical carrier hanger would look like so  5 fighter bombers  13 fighters the regular assortment of other dronessentrylogistics  ship scales on regular carriers need to be fixed if a supercarrier is theoretically too big according the ccp to dock in a station then why a carrier  which is the same size as a large battleship  can fit a battleship  an assortment of other ships in its hanger increase the model scale by 50 at leaston top of the above you have another 90000 m3 for drone space  problem physics its a capital ship  it shouldnUFFFDt be the same size and a machariel funny enough out of the above 2 points the one id be most happy to see would be the size increase of the ship scalepoint to note  a carrier having 5 fighter bombers will not make them over powered  frigscruisersbcs take them out easy enough as is limiting a carrier to being able to only carry 5 at any given time will balance out the swarm
why carriers already have fighters and fighter bombers were intentionally a scarrieronly thing
its situational  the ability to be able to field something more than 1000dps on larger targets while being limited to numberslose your fighterbombers lose your dpsagreed  fbs were intended for supercarriers  but super carriers were also not intended to be subinvincible

i read a forum post recently where a newer player oddly was in a mac mining ice complained that the goons had threatened herhimit to stop mining ice or be destroyed well no issues here but it got me thinking about the newold highnull arguments that abounds of latei am not proposing hearts and flowers i ask for no commitments or promises and expect to get flamed to death for saying the following if those of you in highsec want to be left alone why play a multiplayer game it seems a bit odd to be missing common sense when you can buy an old copy of homeworld and get practically the same graphics and never get ganked never have to interact never have to do anything but win it seems so strange to diverge your course from single player games and not your thinking when you join a game like eve that you must have presumed that its not about missions or mining or winning its about camaraderie and fellowship and war stories made real by the people who flew them even if its just internet spaceshipsat the same time the elite few those old schoolers who have unlimited resources and huge alliances backing them seem to forget they were once the ostracized carbears that other older players scoffed at you relish the power and influence but you forget that there are players who do want to join you in 00 but cant get in because of skill points or whatever alot of corps and alliance say well trainteach you and then the app gets declined for whatever reason said it before and ill say it again these decisions are based on experience and profitloss perspective of the interviewer as they should bethe goal needs to be that we remember that behind each toon is an eager player who wants to come be a part of something to his own ends and with his own means yes we love war and ganking and piracy but take a moment the next time you see a newb at a gate trapped in a bubble and after you pop his ship think to offer him a chance to earn it back by flying for you and newbs remember that you are never scorned or scoffed at for fighting but hiding out and not willing to be a part of the big picture will label you a carebear or worseim not a goon but i always liked the tag no not believing in yourself and to me thats what eve really has been a lesson in human strength of will sense of adventure and occasionally abject humilitynote i think what im trying to say is the old vets need to set a bar high enough but not so far out of reach for the new players to achieve and the new players need and learn to accept encouragement not through game mechanics but interactions to get out and really join the fungrain of salt thanks for readingjaime
i am not sure how noncensensual pvp could be forbidden  you would not be allowed to fire any weapon or smartbomb in those ultrahighsecspace anymore not to my liking but i would like to see ganking made harderotherwise yes the sandbox  also in higsec  should be able to be shaped by players pvp and pve need to blend i see lots of potential for fw to interact here give us influence on lots of factors eg concord response times and give your standings more meaningcheck the moderated 10000 papercuts evelopedia page
so in order to make solo ganking harder you want to make all ships have more hp thus having a potential huge effect on all pvp
yes exactly i would like to see all fighting  pvp changed in that direction  longer engagements maybe just increase hull hp  those hp would then usually not be available to repairs in combat but it would be fun to see some hull logistics out there  maybe make modules fail when you go into hull but the way it is currently being killed by a few shots possibly before you have even targeted back i find this just ridiculous and i think with tier 3 bc this will get even worse lets seecheck the moderated 10000 papercuts evelopedia page

lol tbh this will it ever happen i doubt ittoo much epeen and bragging rights
be happy to have killed someone why you need a kilmail remove killmails problem solved but this will never happenbut imho this problem has a very low priority
eve is a competitive game you compete for isk we compete for kills kill to death ratio isk efficiency etc are all used to judge a corporation or alliances skill in combat therefore the current kill mail system negatively effects recruitment for pvp alliances and corporations and for individuals we need good kill boards to get into corporationsall things youd probably know if you had ever actually killed anybody in this game either youre an alt hiding a terrible kill board likely or youre a very new player who obviously isnt interested in pvp in which case kms shouldnt really be your concern at allhmm maybe although sometimes id prefer to keep certain toons secret so as long as it was an optiin function as it is i believe there are mods for the edk killboard to give scouts and other participants an honourable mention on a kill mail thats been postedperhaps something similar in the fleet window would be nice although it would probably be open to abuse afk toons being added to kms etci just wouldnt want the km system to become a method for garnering intel that couldnt otherwise be garnered elsewhere especially when we have toons in alliances they shouldnt be in according to ccp the kms break due to high load on the cluster the fight occurred on although just how low a priority they must have set them to for this to occur astounds methe fact that were going to be able to see implants shows they are at least trying to improve the kill mail system ccp even say they love kill mails in their blog but do they what is the point in something this inaccurate id prefer they spent time money and resources on fixing the issues it currently has rather than adding features which may or may not cause moreeither way i cant see adding implant kms lowering server load so if they can manage that why cant they raise the priority

margins are razor thin because anyone can do it with plenty of slots in empire stations and safe access to market hubs furthermore lots of bots and multiboxers mining the low endsif a person has 10 accounts running with minimal activity on their part on working they will consider mining even if its just 1020 a hour in a hulk multiplied by 10 thats 100200 hour for minimal effort they will do it with not a care in the world of the prices needing to be higher to sustain desires of one person doing it part time of the dayalso lots of the minerals i mine are free kind of manufacturers people buy the item at the cost of of below minerals because people are too stupid to check before they manufacture something because it seems coolit needs no boast people just got to be less stupid and go for things that are not unprofitablethe lack of profit or any is all generated by players1 do tech 2 like lots of other people in empire and of the right items those have profit2 for planetary interaction you can extract no cost or take p2 and make it into p4 with a daily profit that can be measured in the tens of millions per day per char3 mine lots of minerals reprocess and sell them never manufacture anything unless any significant profit exists for minerals more the what they would sell for because extra effort could be used for more extracting minerals
drone region botting affects nullsec waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay more than high sec they get craptons of mega and zyd not trit and such for that look to highsec botters because theres tons of them mining and industry in highsec are doing fine and dandy if you dont like your margins find a new region to work in youd be amazed at the differences between the different trade hubs jita may have what you make dirt cheap while the same item in rens is at double the cost
recently my alliance ran into the following issue corp a sets up rd pos with alliance lab usage rights corp b has a member that wanted to copy bpos under current restrictions the member of corp b was unable to use corp as labs to copy bpos however research for materialtime efficiency could be conducted without a problemwhat i suggest is that if a corp within an alliance sets up a pos for alliance usage the members of the alliance should be able to use copy slots and in a pinch should be able to fuel said pos if the owneroperator is away due to rl constraintswould save a lot of issues headaches and ed off peoplei am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about

when your commanding a fleet your on grid plane and simple deal with it you dont see the great captain picard in his commandship giving orders from earth do ya
im not sure what you mean on grid does indeed mean actually vulnerablethere is a difference between the immersion breaking tedious effort of multi boxing alts with you werever you go and the effort you need to make when you are on the grid of a pvp battle the former is tedious effort the latter is fun i agree that command ships are powerful enough to still be used even if they needed to be on grid actually i think they would actually be balanced against the t3s if booster ships had to be on grid because now there is little point in even training them its just that instead of being a ship that people always fly with an alt they would be flown by peoples main characters make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
if the counter to this is  well get your own army of alts to multibox then that is crap notice no one is denying that you will need these booster alts to be competitive after the t2 links hit the marketnow the only question is how long will it take before people realize that eve is a game that in order to play it you must invest in alts that you multibox around the universe i can tell you if i knew eve was going to be a game that you had to multi box alt accounts to be competitive i never would have installed it does ccp really want the game to get this reputationlike i said the only reason they would want this is to get the short term burst of new accounts so that they can demonstrate numbers to sell the game but in the long run this sort of thing will ruin the game make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
this really isnt any different than pvp in any other mmo however these ships are basically buffing other ships similar to what a priest might do in wow although i think a healer would be more along the lines of a logistics ship the only difference is in most mmo games you cast your buff on a character and it remains until a timer expires or that person dies or it is based on proximity to your group same general idea applies to what we do in eve you have your tank dps healers crowd control and buffersbut everything is a little more mixed and generalizedit doesnt mean we have to have an alt to stay competitive but those that do have alts will definately have the upper hand
quoting myself from similar threads
the original post suggests common sense fixes supportedheres another possible fix every war is assigned an original target which may be an alliance corporation or even a single character if the original target is a corp then it follows that corp as it joins and leaves alliances if the original target is a character it follows when that character changes corp if the character joins an npc corp the war is still there but reverts to a cannot fight status until such time as the character rejoins a player corp
and it will never ever be misused by someone willing to permanently pay the wardec fee never it is simply impossible

i was thinkingits getting hard enough to run this game on my computer and i would think that most people dont play on like state of the art computers so why upgrade the graphics with new warp trails etc etc new skins for ships oooo aaaaahhh they look prettymost people can not afford to replace there comuters or upgrade in these daystimesmost people i know trun graphics to minimal anyway to run the game for best performance and turn off brackets d also with these new graphics out of the window will bring down the sizes of the updates and personally if i wanted to download a game then download 20gig of updates i would play wow no i would not its crap loli love this game din short please dunt upgrade the graphics anymore or make them optional downloads that would suite everyone i think d like a basic client like you had before and a enhansed graphics pach that could be downloaded if required d
as much sa i symphathize with youthis game cannot get anywhere without progressits over 6 years old if not oldertheres been many changes in industry honestly the only thing id ask is if they slow it down progression wisebut what is slowdepends on whose computer your sitting in front ofps if they spent an entire patch towards fixing thingsmight actually help stop the evemail spam
giving options to graphics etc would not be slowing down progress it would give the user more control of what they want and how they want to run the gamethis inturn could increase users machine performance etc etcon the other handsay they delaid graphics upgrades they would save a hell of alot of resources money time etc and they could focus on fixing bugs from the first patch and upward this would be progress in it self d for me and alot of others that graphics are not that important as a upgrade but game features and fixes i find that the resources would be better spent why reinvent the wheel and stick with what we have for now on the graphics side anyways d
keeping the graphics fresh means that you can retain the feeling of novelty while the players are still playing the same game for years at a timeim currently playing eve on a 17 2ghz imac core 2 duo which has a radeon x1600 graphics card this is borderline supported i still play the game just fine except for shadows the graphics card hates shadows they expand to fill the entire universe bogging the machine down as the processor tries to comprehend the enormity of nothingness and that model imac is now 5 years old its time for me to upgrade i havent tried singularity on my mac UFFFD by the time i download it theres a new patch outin the meantime my laptop is getting the same frame rates with medium detail as it was previously getting with low detail i dont know what magic ccp have pulled here but its pretty awesomei would recommend you try the singularity client see how it runs on your computer im sure youll be pleasantly surprised
gonna have to go with no on this one sorrybut why should i with my shiny computer and new hardware suffer because you dont have a good enough pc you will always have the ability to turn your graphics downthere is absolutely no logical reason to stop ccp from keeping eve relevant by upgrading the graphics unless they force you to play it on high graphics and remove the ability to adjust graphical settings
hi epsilonion i will try to give you some information that should put your mind at ease we take performance into account on any graphics development task we take on and in actual fact i think youll find the client will only perform better with the current upgradesi will give you a few examplesthe warp effect  this is a new effect which actually has less overhead than the old warp tunnel because the shader instructions were reduced its just been done in a more efficient manner however we added the distortion effect which of course has an overhead associated with it which makes the tunnel slightly heavier on resources we decided to only enable the distortion effect when players select the shader quality high settingthis means that if people have computers that canUFFFDt handle the distortion effect they can turn on the medium shader quality and still experience a really good looking warp effectv3ing of ships  we have created a new texture packing method that is more optimal giving us greater control and fidelity on the ship textures this method also reduces the size of the textures thus you will have less loaded textures in your gpu memory and the client size will reduce because the file sizes have gone downnow the client size is going to go up this release but the reason for this is that we have actually added all factional variants for each v3d ship hull however these are not hooked up ingame yetccp vertex  senior development manager   ccpvertex
excellent answer thank you ccp vertex and know that your efforts in making things better looking and more efficient are very much appreciated 3
most things can be turned offalso i can run eve on a really old lap top i picked up for 50
i have no problems personally with the aoe damage working in all space a problem i would have with it is people exploiting it for ganking and piracy in high sec on stations my original intent with this part of the idea was to allow explosions in high sec to cause damage to other ships however i wanted to have an idea where gates and stations had some sort of explosion dampening field that would prevent the aoe damage on ships within a range of 250km of a gate or station but only in highsec what i would hate to see is people blowing up their own ships in large numbers doing massive damage to other smaller ships in large numbers just for the hell of it i thought my solution would work rather well and even had a lore reason behind it but people shot it down to no end so i dropped italso to answer your question on the self destruct issue the idea was that a self destruct is a controlled destruction of the ship in which your ships power core is purged before the ship is destroyed when you blow up from taking too much damage you dont have the opportunity to do this so the power core explodes causing the damage to other ships
yes as long as it takes into acount signature sizedont want a fleet fight and every frigate is dead within the first couple tacklesfrigates should take very little damagei really would like to see thisas for poeple worries about gankinga ship explosion will not do more damage than 8 large smart bombsif i want to suicide aoe gank youi will and my ship explosion will not be what does it a ship explosion would not one shot any shipjust pointing out all the worries of abuse are sort of silly
48h sounds way too harsh but pods being completely left alone even after possibly repeated commited crimes sounds strange adding a timer to leave space might be reasonable  after that also that pod would be attacked by concord this would also benefit countering ganking from orca dropscheck the moderated 10000 papercuts evelopedia page

pvp and pve should blend yes i would like to see this in 56 systems how to deal with concord then they look away because it is sanctioned ok but then the navies should come to the pve players aid otherwise it is like missioning in lowsec the real problem is that 1 pve and pvp fits differ 2 pocket aggro stays on the pve playeri would extend this allowance to pvp even to nonfw players shooting the opposing faction meaning a pilot running a gallente mission to kill caldari would have an aggro timer against caldari fw pilotscheck the moderated 10000 papercuts evelopedia page

holy god where did this thread come from i thought for sure it was dead never to return wellits obvious this idea would never actually be implemented it is a bit harsh to be locking people out of playing the game as a consequence of playing the game it was in part a jab at piracy while at the same time i was trying to stir up some debate on piracy and its consequences either way i will be the first to admit that this is was a really poor idea
how about you bother reading before you post in a thread that obviously has been rejected or shot down before you look like a total noob poster its called common sense im sure your familiar with the concepttime stamps for the win stop the evemail spam
in all fairness though this technically isnt a necro post it was only dead for about 11 days i call necro posting anything longer than a month being as some people may actually go on vacation and not look a the forums for a while it was however a dead issue  poor idea on my part and should have remained buried
not a possible solution as you pay for your subscriptionccps job is to keep the maximum amount of players in the game at all timeskicking people out of the game is not ccps job unless you want to fly around the universe alone
hell yes suicidegank characters with automatic sec standing reset for the win 
yea was more of a past tense  the new changes to scs are great and yes  marks them as not being invincibledidnt take it as a troll i just think the ability is there to make the standard carriers slightly more versatile without overpowering them5 bss will still be able to kill a carrier like it is today  but a bit more dps out of a carrier will make them think twice about engagingsure a carrier being on its own is its own risk and 25 drones form 5 bss will still be dangerous vs fighterbombers
the carrier only has 2 purposes in lifetransport and triage logisticsit is not a dps boatthe fighters are pruely for defensealways been the caseyour asking to add a 3rd rolewhile greatthe ship just isnt meant for thatthe point of the changes is to make subcaps viable againif you want to focus on attack abilitya dreadnaught would be appropriateeven if its designed to shoot poss and other capsps fightersnot fighter bombersgiving fbs to a carrier would be a massive game changer stop the evemail spam
fair comment  and i can see your point so wont dwell on it however this takes me to my 2nd point which as initially mentioned is in my books was the more important of the 2ship model scale for carriersno harm in making their model scale larger a 50 increase in model scale would be sufficent in my books if you can fit unpackaged bss in its hanger its scale should reflect thisin direct comparison a machariel has a volume of just under 600000m3 but a carrier is 11250000m3 problem physics
that has been a frequent comment brought up not just for carrieres but for all shipsbut thats an argumentdsicussion for an another threaddayps admitidly id love to see a carrier fill other roles but the math just doesnt line up to use the experssion but im content to also grab dreadnaught on the way to carrier anywaythey are both compartively the same cost and fill their roles equally just as wellbut with tier 3 bcs on the horrizonim forced to hold my judgement for later stop the evemail spam
so youre saying that fighter bombers will increase carrier dps against battleshipsdont you think you should understand how something works before making a post in assembly hall about how it should be changed
why are we trying to revamp something that has already been revamped and just hasnt been released yet why dont we wait and see what happens with the current revamp
this is a a big problem to be honest having your targets around the edge of the screen double with windows over the top is a bit problematic would be nice to see as said a new hud thats central around your ship that is based on the overview i looked at the galaxy one and thats seems ideal obviously dont do a blantant rip off lol make it better i too am surprised this has never been looked at where pvp is the name of the game
too many times a war dec is created against a corp and the actual targets jump to a different corp that is not war decdi propose that once a war dec is active after the 24 hours either1 nobody can leave the corp till the war is overor2 you cannot leave the corp for a cooldown period of something like 714 dayspeople can join the corp as much as they want but you just cant take apart a corp this week and reassemble it next weekwithout a change like this someone can always hide from any war dec anytime if someone never wants to get war decd then they should join an npc corpm
quoting myself from similar threads
1 stupidvery stupid how the hell can you purge a spai inserted prior to wardec declaration many have proposed extending war dec period beyond that which would be the only way id allow this suggestion to fly otherwise count it burnedtrashedcrushed2 againwhile its good intendedceos should have the right to fire anyone who is a spai in their midst during a war decinfilitration is a valid and legiitmate business this would give them a great deal of power im sure youll get tons of support for it but common sense saysnaysceramsno stop the evemail spam
i never thought of it from a spy point of view you are correct the above idea would not work in that casem
howeverextend the duration of said members war dec period and its not such a bad ideabut its got a flaw in its root form and even tehnnot many people like the possible exception even thensorry if i sounded gruff i see these proposals all the time stop the evemail spam
how about if u leave a corp during a war u can only join npc corp for 12 weeks bears can bail but will have to put up with npc tax
if you honestly think npc tax is as evil as you imply it to beyou have alot to learn about carebearing stop the evemail spam
i think drake draconis is right there is no fix  i can think of right now  because the fix causes more problemsand if a fix causes a new problem its not a fix and why add more bugs or problems into the gamei agree with you drakecheersthanks for your input
war dec is like an elaborate chinese puzzelall camps have valid pointsbut every solution they come up withalways tilts the balance agianst the opositionit is a ncessary eviland this is why i dont really propose anything to attempt to conqurethe only concern i have is the ease of renewing wardecs or continually issuing them every time one endsbut thats not really a major issue as it doesnt happen as often as i thought it wouldhaveoh and your welcomeagainsorry for gruffness its a habbit of a troll x stop the evemail spam
even if you leave a wardeced corp you shoudl retain the war target status and be attackableless corp jumping but corp can purge spies
honestlyi dont have any misgivings over that particular pointwould solve some of the evasion problemseven with corps jumping from alliances to evade wardecsbut balance mechanics would have to be carefully wheighed as im sure someone will bring up a valid counterpoint short of whining about fairness stop the evemail spam
anything that locks individuals into a wardec will lead to them leaving game its also incredibly ripe for griefing which is exactly why they dont allow it now the most likely outcome of these changes is obvious people will just not join a corp there is no real advantage to corps as it is with the exception of pos anchoring get it through your heads the people who dont want to fight arent going to nothing you do or say is going to change that if theyre backed into a corner theyre going to quit the game any change is going to have deal with that fundamental reality
id suggest that in a revision to the system implement a cooldown time on how long it takes before someones allowed back into a given corp after leaving it a week ought to cure the abuses on that end i think since thats also the standard dec timer of course the postype stuff is corp assets not personal you can all bail on the corp to save yourselves but in doing so you abandon your corp resources to your enemies given that its those resources that theyre afterthe corpalliance thing is a separate issue entirely but one more easily fixed if a corp with an active wardec associated with it joins an alliance then sure the alliance is part of the dec but its still tied to the corp not the alliance if the corp drops alliance right after then the decs still tied to them instead of being left with the alliance between that and sorting out a few of the billing timing issues on mutualnonmutual wardecs thatll be the end of decshields and good riddance
that would be a valid coutnerpoint i was referring to stop the evemail spam

okaythey going to put an npc station in every one
1 we need incentives for antipirating activities one solution would be similar to suggestions made on changes to bounty hunting you can only pay out what gets destroyedcheck the moderated 10000 papercuts evelopedia page
1this would also stop acts of sabotage eg if two members have a falling out one could cancel the others jobs or stop spies from cancelling corporate jobs
indeed pve needs to get dynamic and pve needs also to come to the players not always vice versa why dont npc blockade a station or come in considerable numbers to a gate making you consider using it this would affect your game play big time and depending on your standings they would interact differently and this would allow pve and pvp to blend how does everyone behave when also players enemies warp into the fight give standings meaning check the moderated 10000 papercuts evelopedia page
making available bookmarks in the current system selectable via filter option overview settings seems like a good ideai would also like to see custom ordering of icon column and selectable ordering of a 2nd search columncheck the moderated 10000 papercuts evelopedia page
no keep them hidden but give us an option to get intel on them eg by paying with your own npc corp standing calling in a favor show results within some accuracy why standings should get more meaning and also decay over time back to average highlow values eg killing someone with extreme standings should affect your own standings killing someone having 9 with caldari should improve your own caldari standing 1 more way to blend pve and pvp less pve grinding but choose a pvp target wisely to work up your standings just 1 idea check the moderated 10000 papercuts evelopedia page

i am generally happy with the current gms though perhaps if enough people resub we can get some additional ones  qolde
its a plan certainly but i know many 30 year olds that are worse than 12 year olds when it comes to posting use the term loosely heremore like trolling
lo seriously add every effect u can just have levels and options to disable this way those people that spend what 50 for some ram and say 100 can still enjoy sexy eve and those who prefer or run pcs from the 90s are also happy
eve graphics already look like something from the 90s compared to real games like battlefield 3
kids these days its always about graphics even though graphics dont really matter
you are mixing up two different things one is the graphics processing load and the effort to optimize it the other is minimum graphics card feature set which you upped because a you didnt want to maintain multiple code paths and b you had to introduce incarna which still runs craptastically on the minimum required hardwareindeed for pure gameplay purposes graphics could be reduced to 4 poly wireframe models without losing anything in fact in large battles all you see already is only colored squares bubbles and maybe caps
excellent post quoted for excellence one thing i would like from a performance stand point is a greater granularity of performance options a greater degree of tweaking would be very nice in places the jotunn risi are now recruiting brutor ancestry required in order to best represent the brutor interest join channel joris to learn more
anecdotal reports from sisi imply that cruicble will run better than the current tranquility build though im not sure why it would at the moment probably a techy blog full of graphs will explain it
for consistency the field cs would then have to be invented using the tier 2 bc bpcs i somewhat approve of thisbut tbh the biggest problem with cs is that theyve become overshadowed by t3s displacing fleet cs and tier 2 bcs displacing field cs
supported without introducing any significant change to mechanics this proposal adds a little colour to the game
its all very well saying you want aoe in all space but what about aggro and concordhow long do you think before theres a threadnaught because someone ganked a noob and his aoe at a station undock knocked him to 10 one day into the game no more eve for him with that tooni am all for aoe but only on supers this will limit the mayhem that will ensue in hi secso it would only affect orcas freighters jump freighters rorquals carriers dread super carriers and titansyou will still see big bangs in hi sec just not from every ship that gets poppedgood thing for the orcas freighters and jump freighters as they have zero combat capability the aggro from aoe should be given to the killers instead of the pilot if they catch some innocent bystanders with aoe
aoe only on supers absolutely not that would make no sense at all we have already specified that we can limit aoe on stations and gates to address your concern specifically
yes you can limit it but you cannot totally remove itand where is my concern addressed in this thread your original idea didnt make any sense at all and i doubt anyone would support itif theres any chance of innocent gankees getting a sec hit for being popped then i wouldnt support aoe at all after all thats a double hit for themlosing a ship and a sec hitin case you missed what i originally wrote
i hate quoting myself
ill quote jack on this one
againwith the proper restrictions around gates and stations there is no reason why aoe damage from exploding ships cant work in highsec limiting ship explosion damage to not work within 250km of a gate or station resolves this issue if you want a reason to how that works with the lore you can say that gates and stations have technology that dampens explosions so they have no effect as for limiting to capitalsthis makes no sense you are claiming that only capitals have the mass to do any damage i dont agreeall ships have warp drives and power coresthese are what cause the explosion when they go critical
think well just have to agree to disagree on this one dude
nah rubbish idea
god damn whoever mentioned this in cq
tldrwe were all noobs once cut the little guy some slack when you gank him
toonmost old schoolers as you put it have no issue with the n00bs the problem lies in the n00bs attitudeas for my self i have no issues having a rifter hero in the ranks actually i will take a rifter hero who can barely fit a point with a decent attitude over some  with a character bazzar cap pilot waving around some sort of emo raging entitlement
eager rifter newbies are awesome especially when they gush about how they tackled that guy its so kawaii
assembly hall is for proposals this is not a proposal
people in highsec are as about rich as those in nullsec or richer if you ignore the many trial accounts and noobslevel 4s are not bad for income and add to that many run them in billion isk faction fitted ships for max speedadd incursions market and research factory pi highsec is the hub of money and goodseach has advantages and disadvantages but highsec is not a ghetto if you dont know how to make isk that makes you a noob but that doesnt mean a lack of opportunity exist for skilled players in highsecmoons do basically print a bunch of gold but they are alliance assets by default and all of the isk made is used by ship replacement programs and sov holding so it is more of a break even for alliances that does not make much of any alliance members richerthe lack of knowledge about the situation of the topic starter makes me question if these assumptions and ideas have the feintist merit
the problem is that behind some of them are spies from enemy alliances who want to get insider information andor directly attack our people and the only effective method to prevent it that has been found so far is to sacrifice the eager nobodies for the sake of integrity of our alliance
i never took it as gruffness a fair conversation is all i was looking for
1 move to null2 shoot ppl3 profit
this is where we should start looking before trying to force people into actions they just dont want to takei think the main problem for hi sec wars and the reason why so many will not fight is theres just no gain and no pointwhy fight when you stand to losing ships and gain nothing in returnpeople in hi sec arent there for the good fights except the griefers and they really should go to lownull if they want good fights
is this what lead to the thing with dhd and thunder will admit kinda why i read this thread read the other one about that and was curious about what happenedalso the way the new motd is worded it looks like itll just be another dec shield senario  too difficult to enforce so it got allowed
oh thats low brobut it made me giggle like a little girl so carry on
there must never be a place in eve where you cant be killed ever if that ever came to be you would have massively overcrowded space anyway in those systems
so basically if you want to remove all poss from wspace that would instantly destroy most of the large wh corps except rnk stop trying to force wspace to just be another part of kspaceand also have you any idea of the logistical nightmare corps like ccres aharm and all the others face believe wspace is hard enough
well if you think about it the command ships are the awax of eve being able to give bonuses across the fleet in system is reasonable so long as that ship is in space like any other command and control unit it should not need to be on a particular grid to be effectiveif your angry that its out there doing its thing scan it down and kill itotherwise dont get annoyed cause someone else has the good sense to keep these potent tools out of your gun sights that just means your tactics need to include scouts to hunt and and scan these ships downso they can be killed that means you have to actually develop a strategy and not just fly in guns blazingtactics out do fire power in the real world too figure it out dont ask god to change the rulesthat being said i do agree that a ship using these gang units should be much easier to lock down in a scan on account of its actively transmitting a fleet wide signal to make that bonus so that way using those module should make it difficult to hide the shiplikewise jamming these ships should interupt the bonus as well since it would sever the gang link communicationso it would give rise to the use of a cloaky ship with probes and ecm to shut this bonus downbut thats just my two cents
or have a 24hour cooldown before wars become mutual and another 24hour cooldown before they become nonmutualnot that i can see any reason anyone would make a war mutual when they can just let their aggressors waste isk
refer to red vs blue some people just like to pew pew and they should totally be allowed to without charging extra fees or whatnot
this needs to be back to page 1
ok so this proposal is based solely on the assumption that ccp did not create 4096 separate ship models to create the tech 3 cruisers but rather created the 80 component models which comprise the variable parts of the tech 3 cruisersso with that assumption clarified here is my proposal for the possibility of enacting a custom ship creation system into eve in a balanced and functional mannerusing the same technology already present in the game it should be possible for ccp to create a custom ship creation system which would be a revolution in the eve universethe simple end of it is that they create models in a similar way as they did for the tech 3 cruisers but instead for various size classes each model set scaled to the size ranges of ships of that class soUFFFDfrigates 2595 meter long axiscorvettesdestroyer 100190 meter long axis cruiser 200345 meter long axisbattle cruiser 350490 meter long axisbattleship 500800 meter long axisindustrials 1501000 meter long axisas i said with my above assumption in mind this should not be too taxing on resources to create letUFFFDs say 15 models for each of the 5 ship sections presented with the tech 3 cruisers as an example for each of the 5 ship size classes 375 component models which could create a possible 759375 different ship models per ship size class so 4796875 unique ship models for those keeping countso now for the stats and development pricingso letUFFFDs take the worst starting stats in each class for example below is an example baseline for designing a frigate class shipstructure hp 188cargo capacity 120drone capacity 0drone bandwidth 0mass 997volume 10000inertia modifier 446hull em resistance 0hull explosive resistance 0hull kinetic resistance 0hull thermal resistance 0armor hp 188armor em resist 50armor explosive resist 10armor kinetic resist 25armor thermal resist 35shield hp 118shield recharge time 625shield em resist 0shield explosive resist 50shield kinetic resist 40shield thermal resist 20capacitor capacity 125capacitor recharge time 28125maximum targeting range 175max locked targets 3scan resolution 400sensor type 0sensor strength 4signature radius 50max velocity 268ship warp speed 6cpu 100powergrid 15calibration 400low slots 1mid slots 1high slots 2turrent hardpoints 0launcher hardpoints 0upgrade hardpoints 3from these stat points you would use a point system to design the ships stats and then make the development and construction costs go up with the amount of points spent upgrading the stats and purchasing skill bonus elementsthe cost of developing the blueprint and the bill of materials to manufacture one increase the more points you put into designing this means that yes you absolutely could design a monstrous frigate but the bpo alone would cost you 1000000000 isk and each ship would take a large measure of minerals to produceok so here is the math as i figure itbase pricesfrigate 1000000 iskcorvettedestroyer 5000000 iskcruiser 10000000 iskbattle cruiser 20000000 iskbattleship 40000000 iskbase price  upgrade points  1or runstreat a full bpo as 99 for the number of runs and the max upgrade points as 900the bill of materials likewise increases as followsperfect material value  upgrade points10 for each individual componentso if you designed and built a frigate with max 900 upgrade points you would pay 1000000000 isk to create the blueprint and 90 times the materials and time per unit to constructlet me know what you think
interesting idea though the wall of maths doesnt add much to the proposalbut yeah i can totally support the idea of a tech 3 revolution where instead of having a limited array of specific ship hulls that you slot subsystems into you get a starship design system where you add components off a series of menus to create a ship concept that you can then independently research and producespecifically id suggest that the original design process require a lot of highend research skills and instead of producing a bpo it produces a prototype specifications document at some arbitrarily huge cost that document can then be researched to produce bpos which you can then sell or keep as you choose that would put the whole process of ship design  research  production  distribution in player hands though at the same time the whole process should be a huge isk sink from top to bottom the game can stand largish isk sinks at this point and making a high barrier to entry will encourage people to buy into already existing ship designs rather then everyone going ahead to make their own
yeah the math is important thoughi like that term prototype specification documentpsd can i use that would be really cooli am not a big fan of blanket menu selecting and arbitrary high expense a point system allows for truely unique innovation in ships yet also allows people to be cost minded that way you have to balance to cost to develop and produce against the benefit of stats for that shipso give people the rope to financially hang themselves withlike if you max out a frigate design and spend over a billion isk to develop it and it costs so much in materials that in order to break even you have to sell each frigate for over 200 million isk eachbut that is in line with the way of eve in general
the math is important eventually at the proposal stage its only important where it helps you illustrate your proposal and in this case it doesnt actually do that very well yes you can use prototype specification document if you likebut to address the main point capsuleers have a lot of money like seriously huge piles and bpos are expensive you can expect to pay over a billion isk for a researched battleship bpo and you will pay even more just getting an unresearched mining barge or capital blueprint off the npcs hell theres a vast host of capital part blueprints which are individually over a billion isk each unresearchedi envision that under the new system there will be piles of ship part blueprints scattered across space and the best will only be available in terribly inconvenient places like pirate faction lp stores not sure whether or not to make subcomponent bpos available at all if any sort of psd design requires a steady flow of lpfueled purchases then that will both sink isk and drive more people into missioning in weird placesaccordingly as the psd designer you have options you can pick exclusively lowend easily fabricated parts acquire the relevant component blueprints from the lp stores of assorted hisec corporations after doing a couple missions and go to town producing ships with little more then minerals to design your cheap ship youll pay little more then the base cost of 1 billion assuming a frigate psd and can then spit out bpos for distribution or resale as you like people will want what youre selling since even a fairly unimpressive psdpattern ship will be better then a t1 hullyou could instead pick midrange components which require more then just mere minerals to produce read expensive bits from exploration or wormholes or something and whose bpcs are more expensive on the stores depending on your access to nullsec you might consider using lowend pirate faction bpcs at around the same price less material cost but harder to get at the blueprintsfinally you could pick ntohing but the very best of the highend components and make your ships exclusively with the best pirate components from the four corners of space youll pay through the nose for both the blueprints and the partsdepending on the choices you made youll now be presented with the final list of ship specs and a cost ranging between 1b isk for a lowend frigate to something like 200b isk for a highend battleship this puts the higherend stuff beyond the range of most individual capsuleers pushing it further in the direction of psd research being a corporate effort in any event you could probably recoup your expenses fairly quickly selling bpos since anyone with a bpo can do everything the psd holder can except make more bpos then anyone who wants to make your ship but didnt have the initial investment to drop can get the same benefits by just grabbing one of the bpos produced once the psd is finished for that matter likeminded individuals not part of a corporation might put together some kind of investment program where they pool funds towards a psd and grab their bpos as they are produced in some way agreeable to the investors or they get scammed by the inventor either way alternatively you might stretch your profit out longer and make more money longterm by only selling bpcs since anyone who wants to fly this shiny new ship you invented needs your blueprints to make it happenin any event ive illustrated the chain of production well enough well trained capsuleer scientist invents a psd with a pile of cash and turns it into bpos bpos get properly researched then distributed according to however the funding organizations can agree and possibly bpcs get sold stacks of part bpcs are shipped in and in combination with the main bposbpcs are used to create the shipsultimately this either gets you ships that are slightly better then t1 hulls in some ways or ships that are specialized in an unusual way say a frigate with a bonus to both scan probes and salvaging or a cruiser with a bonus to smartbombs or an ungodly expensive t3 faction juggernaut that lays waste to everything before it
here is my idea on how to give the black ops more lovechange the way the black ops covert cyno bridge worksallow these ships to be able to bridge any ship in fleet with them through the covert cyno excluding capital shipsthis makes it so that they have a clearly defined role or bridging the rest of the fleet quietly into a system for rapid deployment of noncap ships into a systemthis opens the door for new strategic uses for the covert cyno and covert cyno bridge which would dramatically increase their value on the battlefield without much of a major overhaul in the ships themselvesbut thats just my two cents
declaring war is all but useless and or pointless depending on your perspective in high sec it is the tool for grief corpsinsert merc where needed to extort their own enjoyment by dominating noncombat characters while still keeping their own indy based characters safe in some other corp to supply them from the shadows so they evade combat cause to fight is pointlesspirate groups in low sec do not bother with declaring war because they are primarily indiscriminate killers looking to get whatever meat falls into their lap so a war dec doesnUFFFDt gain them anything and may put noncombat elements of their corp at undue riskfinally null sec alliances operate outside of the reach of concord in the first place so it is utterly pointless for them to pay concord to make a declaration and again this may risk noncombat elements operating in the blanket security of high sec spacethis all conspires to make declaring war an irrelevant actso here is my take on a revised war system to make war declarations more relevantdeclaring war is basically bribing concord to look the other way for a period of time so if legal war is based on bribery lets make the whole idea scalable and allow this trend of bribery to be done on the individual corporate and alliance levels independentlyindividual war this is simply the ability to buy UFFFDkill rightsUFFFD on a particular individual from concord just like normal kill rights concord will look the other way in high sec if you attack and kill that person only now they will look the other way for however many kills you have purchased but like normal kill rights these false kill rights have an expiration date so get the kill or not they will go away in time and they are only good for the individual who has purchased them and of course concord will give your target a 24 hour warning for each kill right purchased against themcorporate war like current war however this is purely a single corp declaring against a single corp regardless of alliance ties alliance leaders will be advised of any declaration against a corp in their alliance and have the option to expand the war for a fee to include their entire alliance in the war instead of a single corpalliance war again this is very much like standard alliance vs alliance war declarationcrosslevel declarations in addition to this any of the above groups can engage and declare against any other entity however in the case of targeting an individual the cost is multiplied across all registered members of a corp or allianceso for exampleyou could have a corp or an alliance purchase kill rights for all their members against a single pilotyou could have an alliance declare war against a single corp of another alliance though likely the opposing alliance might upgrade it to a full on alliance wara single pilot could declare war against an entire corp or even an alliancethough the price would still be the same as if it were a whole corp declaringor a single corp from an alliance could declare war against an entire alliance

i thought this would not only be really funny but would also make sense guristasanshaangelserpentis should also jail the pod of an offending attacker after they destroy the ship this pod would be in a stasis period of 48 hours where no game functions such as chat market and so on would work they float in station in a pod and cant do anything except pod themselves to get out this jail would also play the banana phone song over and over

i know there are a number of people complaining about the removal of the side effects for boosters for my position on this i believe there should still be side effects involved but not the kind that changes your statstell me when you hear about illicit drugs what kind of side effects do you normally think of visual or mental side effects correct not the kind that effects your guns rate of fire or signature radius or whatever system they seem to effectso i was thinking why not include visual or mental side effects with boostersfor examplelets say you take a booster that gives you an increased speed in the middle of the fire fight you noticed that your whole screen appear to be blurred a bit or the red aggression flash appears to move out of place every few seconds and then returns back to normal or what about the increased tank from a booster you might notice that you activated the wrong module or two when you didnt want to its like flying under the influence and you start seeing some strange things that are not there perhaps there never was an opponent in the first place and that you were shooting ghosts and your fc is screaming at you wanting to know what the hell you were doing xd
basically it acts like a smartbomb but destroys your ship in the process the damage and range that the smartbomb has depends on the size of the ship destroyed for example a frigate self destructing will do 1500 damage over 10km while a battleship will do 10k over 50km will be allowed in empire which should making ganking alot simpler but also add an interesting twist to pvp battles to balance it caldari ships which are shield tanked will not be allowed to activate it past 50 shield and the rest which are usually armour tanked will not be able to activate it past 50 armour so let me know what you think of it
why would you even suggest thisthis would be akin to why they took mines out of the gameimagine we put this idea in the gamei would give it less then 10 seconds from implimenting before jita and other hub stations would be subject to mass suicide self destructing smart bombsi think you should consider how your idea can be abused before submitting it in the future

this change would be good for solo play and bad for fleetcarebear play lets look at some extreme examplesexample 1 soloim in a hac my opponent is in a hac theyve got a ganglink t3 in a pos in system i dont they are going to win 9 times out of 10 my only real option is to try to escapethis is bad theres very little i can do skill wise to compete with the benefits of a ganglink theyre at no risk particularly when we look at the diminutive returns of modules lets take reppers on a reference fit sacrilegemedium armor repairer ii no ganglink 318corpum ctype medium armor repairer no ganglink 393medium armor repairer ii level 5 legion ganglink 425a t2 with a legion ganglink is better than a corpum ctype these reppers cost almost the same as the legion does each a sacrilege would need two to be almost levelin this situation it was actually fairer when it was possible to make them totally unprobable i could jump my own t3 in warp to a safe and not look at that screen for the next 5 or 10 minutes still unfair everyone needs multiple accounts to compete thoughlets look at a counter example thoughexample 2 fleet battle if ganglinks were grid onlya large subcap fleet jumps into a system to take down some capssupercaps the defending fleet has triage carriers set up they can keep their command ship alive the subcap fleet however do not have triage set up their command ship will likely get primaried and popped this puts the defending fleet at an unfair advantagesowhat if the range of gang links was directly affected by how many people are in the fleet i think its wrong for a single person to be able to have one toon sitting in a safepos and another performing pvp and what if the range calculation based on how many fleet members were in system at the time scaled to such a way that 23 in fleet  on grid 410 within a couple of au 10 slowly increasing to the entire range of the system this makes sense and would do the opposite of dumbing down play it would require boosters to position themselves properly to be able to assist everyone at critical points whilst this looks like a solo nerf and a group buff it really isnt lets be honest unless my target is a frigate if the opponent has 20 friends in system im going to lose anyway in example 1 i try to burn to the booster and if i can make it maybe i take out a nice t3 in example 2 the subcap fleet is big enough that their booster can be anywhere this seems pretty fair to me in addition it would also mean that stupidcareless pilots who stray outside of the range of their fleet booster ie they warp to a gate 200au away can still be picked off for their stupidity this solution works for solosmall gang unless youre soloish fighting a huge fleet not going to work unless youre garmon anyway p works for fleet vs fleet punishes stupidity
one other thing i think it should be possible to look at a ship and see if its receiving bonuses some kind of effect etcjust in the same way you can look at a target and work out what guns they have if you practice and whether theyre shield or armor tanked you should be able to see that they have a fleet booster and you should probably be able to differentiate the 8 types somehow 4 races x 2 ganglink  leadership skills only
i have to say i dissagreemy main reason for this is that even with smaller gangs of say 1015 people there are many times where you might want scouts or a few tackle to be positioned across multiple gates in a systemwith midsize and larger gangs this nerf would becomme more pronouncedloosing vital gangboosts for ships offgrid is an idea i dont like
1 to opmakes no sense that you can boost from 100 safety youre gang should be assembled in order to receive gang bonusesid be totally satisfied if it was completely axed but a variation and more dev work to this could be that offgrid boosting is
i think that would be an excellent compromise maybe make one of the skills increase the effectiveness of gang links accross distances to allow it to get above 20 but not too much higher i think the incentive should be to get the pilot to have a reason to be on grid and in the battle with bonuses instead of just being 100 immune and safe while contributing to the fight
personally i dont see the reason to have him be 100 safe and contributing to the fight at all i just dont think its a good idea to force people to multibox alts it makes the game less fun make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
great ideato people complaining about losing single unbuffered booster sp you dont have to fit full rack of linksfit a link  buffer you like another booster  fine bring second bc
absolutely agree warp graphics need to be more interesting whenever i introduce people to the game i often get comments about how boring travel seems even simply adding to the current speed up slow down warp tunnel would be welcome by most i think little effects such as a static storm that builds around the ship until it reaches full speed more chaoticcolorful warp tunnels or perhaps shortlived particle trails left behind when reaching a destination are possible improvements im sure someone can think of much better effects as well
if my calculations are correct and this baby hits 75 of its maximum speed  we will see some serious 
this was brought up in another thread and i thought i would post it here in the off chance it might get fixedseems like it would be pretty trivial to fix this issue and make amarr drones actually worthwhile
id support this but i quite enjoy killing things with my overpowered warrior iis and thus i must oppose it instead dodges nerfbat
there are drones other than warrior 2shmmm learn something everyday
yes thats messed up and my domi loves it

1 on the idea presented by the op and vile ratreworking the bounty system in this manner would encourage roams looking for wanted individualsi agree that complicating this idea with proposed changes to killrights might have a negative effect on the 
i have always thought with invention and everything else in manufacturing there should be some way to produce a prototype ship with better stats or whateverit would need to be stupidly expensive and have a low probability of success but if you have enough isk and patience then you should be able to research a monster shiphowever this is just a thought allow this and you will have every major null sec alliance producing these ships every other day and would eventually ruin eve for everyone elsedo you really want 1 player having a ship with stats that rivals concord never mind a whole fleet of them
personally yes i do expect alliances to want fleets of monster ships that said the devil is in the logistics as envisioned its npc null thatll be the source of the really awesome pirate parts to get them you need to run missions there that sharply limits the available supply that has a profound effect on the price i fully expect these changes to make npc null especially dangerous as everyone will want in on the action and everyone will want to murder everyone else who got in ahead of them the individual capsuleers who will inevitably wind up in the most awesome and dangerous ships will be the ones who run mission ops in gangs of course for protection against anyone else present in that part of space intending the same thingas presented the only alliances thatll be in a position to field fleets of awesome ships are those that base out of or otherwise have a degree of control over a given faction of npc null or those willing to expend ungodly sums of money importing the highend stuff from jita and even at the high end these are still ultimately ships that can be destroyed and even if they are better then most when the highend stuff dies that is a notable isk loss you dont usually see alliances fielding fleets of faction battleships because that involves a notable loss of isk what makes you think anyone will want to field fleets of t3 faction battleships given even greater pricing constraintsoh there will certainly be individual niche roles that demand the cost off the top of my head i can see alliances shelling out bigtime for command battleships to sit their fcs in battleships geared for logistics and ewar roles will also be valuable since a battleshipgrade tank will give survivability to the otherwise vulnerable vessels but the bulk of the fleets will wind up being either standard t1 battlecruisers  battleships or depending on how logistically feasible it winds up being cheapgrade t3 player redesigns optimized to support the fotm doctrine made up of bottomtier cheap parts imported from jita by the jump freighterload
this sounds suspiciously familiar
again  an identical thread was only started about three days agoccp is not going to restrict a players game time for anything that does not break the eula no matter how much it annoys another player or how real world other players think this game which involves ftl travel and body hopping from clone to clone should be to do so would be to drive subs away from the gamenow can we move on to more important things please

i would actually ask ccp to upgrade textures on capitals they are prettey bad bigger ships need bigger textures i can see faults even on bs textures capitals just look bad as for stopping upgrades you see they probably have an art department and its not like you can get a cgi specialist to do a network engineers job so even though i recognize that i am probably more fortunate than some they might as well do something useful as opposed to nothing
no they have not 00 fleet warfare still depends heavily on fleet commands for links since those ships can actually fit tanks unlike threelink t3s field commands have t2 resists and dual bonuses so they are not overshadowed by tier 2 bcs by a long shot its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
how about thiscommand ships remain as they areinstead we change tier2 battlecruisers so that they arent op anymore harbinger gets one turret one one hislot and one lowslot removed cpu and grid are reduced accordingly dronebay is now 25m3 drake loses one launcher one hislot and one medium slot cpu and grid are reduced accordingly shield resistance bonus is swapped for something more appropriate myrmydon loses one lowslot cpu and grid are reduced accordingly hurricane loses one high and one lowslot cpu and grid are reduced accordingly dronebay is now 15m3being supporters of free speech and free and open csm elections we removed fon revedhort from eligibility ccp april 2013
ermm good idea but can i haz the sleip the way it is
as a temporary boost to personal repair modules and solosmall gang warfare i suggest the following change when fitting any personal repair module it will also add 75 this number of course is subject to balancing factors of the ships base sensor strength to the ship this is of course refering to ladar gravametric sensor strength not to be confused with a sensor boosterso for example i am running around low sec in my deimos looking for some pew i fit a medium armor repair module now my sensor strength is 26 instead of 15 or say i want to be in my super leet triple armor repair myrmidon my new sensor strength is 59 have fun jamming that also when you overload the personal repair module the overload bonus to repair amount also affects the sensor strength bonusnow for those who decide they want to fit a small shield booster on their thanatos so they double their sensor strength is really no different than fitting a dedicated eccm module which would be better so their lossif for some reason a percentage amount would prove to be broken in some cases then a flat amount added to the sensor strength would work best either way the concept is the same and for those worried about role play reasons and lore and such honestly i dont care about that there are hundreds of things in this game that directly contradict each other so what is one more if for some reason ecm or all ew is redone and this addition to local repair modules no longer fits simply remove this change from them it is not difficult
at the first glance it looks weird but hey the idea itself is pretty good actually  im not sure whether 75 isnt a bit too much but still in generalsupportedbeing supporters of free speech and free and open csm elections we removed fon revedhort from eligibility ccp april 2013
viva la active tank
okim keeping my mind open on this onewhy exactly would this bonus be part of an active local rep why would this not be left to sensor boosters am i missing something
the personal repair module is the only unique module that you will not find in any other pvp scenerio outside of solo and small scale fleets so it only seemed natural to give these type of modules the secondary effect of a built in eccm
so add the repper to my hurricane and fit more tank because i can drop one or more sensorboosterawesome
so wait because fleets prefer to use remote rep to local rep for most purposes add a completely unrelated bonus to local repping whatyeah not supported eccm needs to be revamped in general yes this is not the way to do that id support a unification of sensor boosters and eccm before this if local rep proves to be underpowered for whatever reason then it can be buffed in some way that fits its flavor
i can pull information on buysell orders from 10jumps away place buysell orders set up contracts contact agents to complete missionsbut i cant transmit a simple 3d coordinate in space along with a system nameyeah thats realistic ccp
amusing ideas i approve minor visual sideeffects to booster use would not at all be out of place
i would rather worry about making boosters uselesslast time i was on sisi booster bonuses were cut to 50 or something like thatbasically that means you do not get bonuses you used to get and that means you do not get a bonus which would actually make any differencesimple examplecurrently with max heavy missile skills and tengu you can drive dramiel away eventually in few minutes unless its running local repper if you consume at least standard crash booster which gives you 20 bonus which makes you hit well enough assuming its not using halos xtinct and deadspace afterburner if its cut down to half 10 you probably cant since its not enough anymore i would rather take penalty for using booster instead of having bonus which doesnt help mejust my 2 cents
industry  science jobs on autorepeatproblemat the moment setting up manufacturing and science jobs takes many clicks arguably too many more importantly the process of setting up a job has to be repeated for every single job typically producing tech 2 modules from 10 manufacturing taking a 50 success rate on invention and a 12 hour manufacturing time will require setting up 20 jobs of manufacturing and 40 jobs of invention  every single day this is not an interesting or appealing feature of manufacturingsolutionthe jobs that are setup could automatically cycle until the required materials run out or if the players sets a number of runs or if the job is cancelledadditionally jobs could be saved and easily turned onoff with a simple clickconsequencesthis would remove the major hassle with manufacturingmanufacturing would become much easier to use 247this could clogup stations slots and force people to move to less populated regionthe number of goods on the market would likely go upthe price of manufacturing goods would likely droppersonal commentsthis will remove one of the challenge of manufacturing but i can say as a manufacturer that i would prefer if this challenge was gone as it adds nothing to my game experience for me the fun and true challenge of manufacturing is finding an item that can be produced with a profit setting up buy orders playing the market to get materials making sure the production facility is constantly supplied with materials and then finding a good market to sell the goods ive tried getting some feedback on this idea but i cant seem to find many other full time manufacturers out there  and i can understand why

just because you are accustomed to the current ui does not mean that it is gooda more distinctive reticule like the ones used in freelancer around targets and ships targeting you with icons showing active ewar and other module effects used against you instead of the current overview mini icons would be a step ahead also the enemy position indicators being positioned around your ship in a circle like in gof would be neati dont suffer from insanity i enjoy it 
i started a small discussion in the general discussion forum and after viewing peoples replies i think i would like to propose itwithout rewriting the wheel please go read the discussion forum there
i have read the prior replys and there seems to be an emerging arguement to instancingok whether it be a restricted site like the final pocket in angel extravaganza or an instance like a wh lets ignore the programming aspect of this idea thats up to ccp to decidea couple questions came up during the last 3 pages and i would like to give my reasons for themquestion 1 why not have a pvp mission agent for all levelswhy just level 4sanswer my reasoning for this is so you dont get someone like me going up to level 1 agents and getting a pvp mission and whopping the butt of a brand new eve player once you have attained level 4s with an agent you are no longer gullable in the game and your skills in the tiny ships do seem to hold up towards older playersquestion 2 why not join red vs blue or another corp and go huntinganswer i like my corp we are a corp of really good friends i do not want to give taxes to some other corp and i dont need any more drama from 12 year old telling me what i can and cant do in a corp our corp was formed to get away from stuff like that our corp keeps our assets safe so i simply will not join another corp for that reasonquestion 3 why not just pvp against someone in your corp of in your allianceanswer because when you do not know your targets toon age or the ship they are bringing  just the class of ship  and you do not know their skillset  if they are really good at jamming or rockets or neuting you  there defenitly is an exciting im gonna get my butt whooped or im gonna win factor that playsquestion 4 why not fix faction warefareanswer to be honest i dont know much about faction warefare it wasnt explained that great during the tutorial missions i did about 2 years ago and i really havent touched them since i dont know what these do to your faction standing but again this is a battle that takes place when 1 person usually is not ready for pvp and the other is im assuming someone gets jumped by the apposing teamquestion 5 you should move this discussion to a different forumanswer i want a general discussion about this idea about whats wrong with it whats right with it and if its feasable if you want to go make 12 other posts in a different forum go ahead i chose this one and i dont have the time to follow 20 forumsone other point i would like to make about introducing some kind of pvp to hs is that even though the ships are small stuff is getting blown up so some prices will rise because of it im sure plenty of people would suddenly make up pvp fits and try to sell them on the market as wellanyway thank you all so far for adding very interesting comments and at least keeping the discussion cival i have read them all  and even the links one thing that amazed me was how a very simillar idea was posted november 2nd how some of us are starting to think of the same thing eve might need need is a bad word for this sentance to make the game more enjoyable for othersdont forget i am not trying to ruin or break eve or make your gameplay worse i am trying to come up with introducing a new type of play into eve that 51 or more of the population would enjoycheers
you realized whats wrong with your suggestion yourself why post it bad trolling sir
no no no and nodid i mention no
this pic was from a week or so ago by way of follow up lina on sisi
the size doesnt seem to have changed too much those are still freaking huge
i dont understand why people are complaining about ts its not like its impossible to kill offgrid boosters unless they are in a pos in wch case its a matter of the residents of a system having a slight advantage wch is finelimiting boosting to ongrid will make managing fleet erachy a nightmare with the current game mechanics as you will lose bonusses potentially for the entire fleet whenever a commander of some sort dies or is forced to leave grid for some reason and itll also screw up if you have to split your fleet up to fight in several places at once the people who tnk fitting command t3s with buffer and weapons is a good idea are just plain wrong it will be useless and outperformed by a drake and also only have 1 link and be overpriced noone would ever use that subsystem on a t3 again commandsps however are meant to be on the field  i wouldnt mind if those were buffed in order to be doing the job better than offgrid t3s  maybe switch the bonusses so the commandsps give a bigger bonus that t3s or make some kind of mechanic that enhances command bonusses for a command sps if they are on grid so itll have the role intended
if the t3 sp is already aligned and using an afterburner the pilot would have to be afk to get caught meanwle the gang that is uselessly trying to chase the booster sp is short at least one pilot that should be on grid during the fightthe advantage will not be slight once t2 links are out people who do not use these alts will not be able to compete it wont be a nightmare it will of course hurt the fleet if a booster needs to leave grid or dies  but that is expected righteven now if they are fighting in different systems there is no bonus i dont tnk people are saying t3s should be used on grid as command sps i tnk command sps should be used on grid as command sps its not like t3s will become completely useless if they are no longer the sp everyone sits their booster alts in if ts in fact will be a significant t to those who do t3 industry that would just prove that ts is getting ridiculous i would be in favor of buffing command sps but im not sure increases the command bonuses is how to do it make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
yet more lazy excuses and cant be bothered argumentsif they dont bring a booster then isnt that simply bad planning bring a booster and compete simplealso everyone has the ability to gain the same advantage with t2 links it will be a nightmare and it is a completely unnecessary changeirrelevantts bad idea says otherwisedestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
how about ts nerf t3 links slightly mby just remove the command bonus so they are the same as battlecruiser links but leave them alone otherwise still able to be offgridthen buff commandsp links to current t3 stats but limit them to ongrid ts will allow small roaming gangs who doesnt have manpower to bring people in command sps to still bring their alts in cloaky t3s like they do now  slightly less effectively and it will ensure that an ongrid dedicated command sp will do the job better rewarding the people who actually bring their links to the fight tbh i would rather not see it changed at all but ts is a compromise i can live with
you and i just disagree on whether eve should require people to multibox alts if they want to pvp thats what all ts comes down to make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
ummmduh ts is kinda the whole freaking point
1 definitely support this

i like the fact that we are mostly on the same page in terms of where this can go although i was obviously way off on the pricing scale the one area where we differ in on the design mechanics you favoring a menu based selection process with the devUFFFDs adding lots of new lp items into the gamepersonally i was envisioning a points balancing system where adding points to various areas of the ships stats have some drawbacks for example spending points on most stats increases the ships mass and thus creates a negative impact on the ships speed and maneuvering using points to reduce the ships mass translates into a decrease in the shipUFFFDs hull structure and to a lesser extent a decrease in armor hit points now of course the bonus from the increase would be greater than the penalty incurred elsewherenow instead of creating new component elements to be added into the game as you reach certain thresholds in points in various stats some of the advanced components are required in the designso for example if i spend a lot of points in certain areas then my ships bill of materials may include things like graviton reactor units sleeper thermal regulators internal bulkheads or optimized nanoenginesobviously the higher the points the more of these items and higher quantities show up in the bill of materials itUFFFDs the balancing act needed with a point system which along with a limitation on total points used in a design will mean that no matter how much money you pour into a top shelf battleship design it will be impossible to make an absolutely perfect or unstoppable ship of any class we have to keep in mind that in order for a player ship designer system to be accepted it will have to be balanced if financial juggernaut alliances can simply dump a few hundred billion from their massively deep pockets into making pocket dreadnaughts that can trounce any and all tech 1 and tech 2 battleships it will not be acceptedbut youUFFFDre right if this comes about i foresee some truly interesting developments in the future one of the things i think we will see that you did not mention would be the appearance of alliance proprietarysignature designs the reason for this will be obvious if the ship is never released for public sale it is much more difficult for the opposition to analyze a ships strengths and weaknesses and thus figure out how to defeat it some designs may even become near legendary or mythic in their infamy dreaded monsters lurking in the depths of null sec space to devour the fleets of their enemies before vanishing back into the darkness
so yeah the reason why i suggested lp items and menus rather then pointbuy and a scaling bill of requirements is because one of those ways is really easy for a large alliance to integrate into existing production chains therefore producing toptier ships enmasse and killing off any and all lowtier competition while the other is obnoxiously difficult to massproduce and will require continual logistical effort to keep going it should be obvious which is whichthe one thing big alliances have lots of is resources in particular stuff like moon goo and t2 components are in relative abundance the one thing they need to expend special effort on is logistics anything that requires bits not findable in their home regions needs to be imported and on a regular basis if its at all important given that it seemed logical to me not to mention infinitely more doable on ccps end to use a menu system over a point system it can and should be a much bigger menu then the existing t3 options with more slots to choose from and more items to go in each slot but with a finite amount of possibilities nonetheless if each individual part requires an individual sinking of isk from an individual mission runner who had to spend time running said missions in dangerous bits of space thats far less exploitable then spend x more money to get x more power your suggestion as is would create a relatively linear scaling system in which theres very little difference between the bottom and top of the line vessels in terms of player effort needed to create them where mine would result in a system with more individual involvement in the production process and with far tighter logistical constraints on the edge cases

why is it even there you cant fit it after the siege mod and 3 launchers unlike a naglfar it also brings up production cost unnecessarilyi dont see the revelation or moros with a launcher slot so get rid of this stupid feature
or better yetgive the phoenix the option of using 3 turrets or 3 launchers so the phoenix can actually be useful

so  do itwtf do you need soundwave et al for
we have a concern people will metagame and compromse the competition eg fight before the tourney or bring in fleets to disrupt the event etc etc etc
if youre worried about a fleet showing up have your own sanctions in place in case it happenseg  your corporation is immediately disqualified if you bring in a fleet thats not the agreed upon composition frig cruiser ewar 2 others to enforce it have one of the bigger and hopefully more trusted corporations have their own wtfpwn fleet on the sidelines seriously you already have the tools to enforce the rules also ccp isnt going to moderate the tourney for you
mate we are talking about corps from alliances such asfconaifncdotagewnsrote kappelle but to name but a fewthese are all alliances that will use any chance to slay a neut or a redso having a do gooder fleet on hand is not really a feasible option as all alliance will have the same thingand it has the potential to be an event destroyerwe have considered this seriously enough to seek some ccp assistancethey want us to organise player events and get involved well here as an event they can get involved inso ccp back us up and make this happen
 yeah little harder to get anything working properly with the goons  so start an all out war with everyone else instead or run the tourney on sisi
this if you dont want people metagaming beyond a certain degree go outside the game where they dont care about their shinies being blown upedit also im reasonably certain that the evemail accounts of the ccp folks arent monitored at all to answer your first question
this is actually a clever idea
your encouraging active tanking but making active tanking modules a sensor boosterthe hell you ona sensor boosters make sense as a moduleb repair modules repairthats all they doeven in a rp sense it doesnt make sensepvpers dont active tank for a reasonim not saying this is a collasial bad idea like your othersbut something smellsand it sure as hell aint rotten fishill sit on the fence on this one stop the evemail spam
sensor strength is not scan resolution it would make you harder to jam and probe down not decrease your lock time
yeah i was about to troll the  out of those who are confusing the two but i can easily see how they can be confused i will update my proposal to clarify
doh the funny thing is i was actually thinking about eccm before i wrote that response oh well its still a quirky as  suggestion but the one thing im thinking of then is unprobable ships
being unprobbable is no longer possible now how do you feel about the idea
dunno as i said its still quirky as  and its not exactly a logical connection im still leaning towards no because of the illogical connection but at this point thats the most i can think of at the moment i dont do small gangs vov
not supporting this defeats the purpose of fitting an eccm based on the resposnes im seeingtroll awaylike it will helpps at that rate as people have saidecmeccm mechanics need to be looked at anywayif at all stop the evemail spam
aside from the fact that if i posted the exact medical formula for a cure to cancer and you would still declare it was a bad idea the fact remains that fitting an actual dedicated eccm module gives a much better bonusregardless you made up your mind on my idea before you even read it you already proved that with your first post
this is not a crue to cancerthis is a trolldrop the act and grow up for once its obvious that there are too many questions being begged from your proposal from what other people are saying as it isand until they are addressed throughly and emphatically im not changing my mindso keep trolling awayyour just proving my argument beyond reasonps who the hell compares an eve online idea to a crue for cancer that just makes it all the more obvious this is messed up stop the evemail spam
i have answered every question so far which was one or two and clarified the proposal a bit more so people are not confused in thinking about sensor boosters if you dont like it fine you claim i troll when it is you are the one desperately trying to derail another one of my ideas if you any more concerns or problems evemail them to me in the mean time just simply  off to someone elses thread
ahem i fly logistics im well aware of the difference between sensor strength and scan resolution and that the bonus youre referring to is the same bonus as an eccm mod grants and not at all the same as that which a sensor booster grants personally i find the distinction silly and dont really see why there needs to be so many different modules affecting how good your sensors are especially since the various eccm mods fill a particularly narrow and specialist niche but thats a separate point entirely and i dont think my original post could reasonably be interpreted as conflating the twothat said i maintain that there doesnt seem to be any reason for combining local reps with eccm the two have completely different roles and im puzzled as to why you find it necessary to combine them admittedly i dont solo pvp so ive not much experience with the arena where local reps are actually important in fleet combat of course remote reps win every time over local since its a specialized ship doing the repping while the local ship focuses on resists thats the way the math works out and really i dont think thats a bad thingbut since it is your thread care to explain why folding eccm into local reps would be a preferable solution to say combining them with sensor boosters
because having that means still devoting a middle slot to help with your sensor strength this would also mean that larger fleets that do use logistics and fit ehp tanks gain the benifit of the eccm built into their sensor boosters the idea is not to boost medium to large scale fleets against ecm but to buff solo and very small scale fleetsthis is not some overall nerf to ecmfalcons but it only feels like a slight nerf if said ecm is going against what is most likely a solovery small fleet a local repair module is the only exclusive module that is used on such solo and very small fleets that is why i picked it yes i know some of you cant grasp the idea because you want to know what in the world does repairing your ship have to do with the ships sensor strength again the local repair module is the only thing that fits into those parameters so the giving the eccm bonus to sensor boosters may seem to fit better because they are both deal with sensory stuff it would easily translate to a huge nerf to ecm in all forms of combat having the spare cpu and power grid to fit a sensor booster is nothing compared to fitting a local repair modulei hope this will help better explain why i picked a local repair module over a sensor booster module if someone feels they understand what i am saying and can formulate a response better dont hesitate to do so
dumb ideaas a falcon pilot i can only enter small gang warfare in big gangs i am wasted fast so doing that essentially removes my 15 years of ecm training from the gameif you have tears about a special skill like ecmthen i say that drones should not be aggressing me if you are jammed or even assigned to attack me if i have you jammed or and guns fired should make it easier for me to jam you as your ships power needs to fire the weopons therefore making you easier to jammso if you try nerfing my skill cause you got jammed a few times to bad get yaself a falcon pilot or train eccmthere are counters to ecm eccmmore shipsfof misslestry learn them rather than nerf a ship that keeps getting nerfed do not fark my game play up as you are to lazy to improve yoursif anything ecm ships need more chance of jamming and stronger jamms points and webs do not fail or missso why should ecmif your in a small gang and an ecm ship jamms you deal with iti dont like loosing much more expensive falcon to your cheap myrm cause you dont know how to counter ecmhave a cup of concrete and hard the fark up sunshineecm really needs a buff
good point personal repeccm module would render small gang ecm useless in favor of op active tanking
you could have stopped right therebeing supporters of free speech and free and open csm elections we removed fon revedhort from eligibility ccp april 2013
very good idea i like it i think active tank modules can be boosted by increasing overheat bonus armorrepair 30 duration 30 and also add resist bonus when module is overheated resist bonus  metalvl1penalty
oh yes a carrier orca deplying 20 automatic hulks erm too big troll 
factually wrong stopped reading there
your loss last time i checked you cannot use a smartbomb in highsec guess i will go try it when i get home to be sure
why wait simply look at evelopediahey have an area of effect in which every object hostile or otherwise will be hit because of that using them in high security systems is not advised as hitting almost anyone will result in concord interventionfrom
well either way a solution has already been posted several times in regards to gccs on exploding ships
haha it sounds like a good idea but its fail tbh blaster boats will be so  up if this happens
my personal preference which ive expressed internally on csm is to permit dragndrop of bookmarks in and out of chat channels evemail and the igb in other words they become a special url with built in validation to prevent spoofingeven nicer if you can rightclick on one of these urls in evemail or the igb and be able to warp to it
can you please please please add more than saved 50 fittings
theres a devblog somewhere stating it will be 100 personal and 250 corp with this expansion i am too lazy to go find ityay for lazy posting
yeah sure lock the manufacturing slots for yourself failed troll
your assumption is wrong i personally do all my manufacturing in a pos theres no contingencyas for station the solution is rather simple you make the queue as long as 1 cycle which means that every cycle someone else gets a chance to jump in for a cycle and it alternates with different people unless theres no one else queued upis this a solution that can be considered reasonable
indeed im still wondering why freight containers are in the deployable category they cant be deployedjettissonedanchored in any way we need big boxes 275k can is to smallor maybe the box is the freighter itself idk yet if a corp dont have the right freighter pilot theyre screwed they cant deliver the containers to a postoo many limitations on freight cans make them almost useless
if this is to happen game mechanics should be usedconcord or empire navies have warp scram and web ships for criminals after criminal acts to hold them in stasisthough concord should be revised to be not so invicable freeing a prisoner should be possible as with escaping
im in favor of any animation improvement to incarna ironically the devs realized that its the little subtle movements that bring a character to life and missed one two obvious ones im not talking dead or alive here but there is some subtle movements to breasts unless you have them bound really read painfully tightly
thank youthis is all i ask for
the way ts has been goingaoffgrid gangboosters are bad they cant be hurt put them on gridb yes they can just scan them down leave them alonea but the sig is too small you need mad1337 skillz to scan themb htfuwhy not just make ganglinks increase sigdecrease res make them easier to scan down but keep them off grid and then everyone only a little unhappy
fypmake faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
obviously hasnt read a single post in ts thread
bad idea it allowes a solo pilot or a smaller gang to engage a larger group and still be able to win the fight
wch is fine if they are on grid with youa falcon affords the same benefit  but it has to be on grid with you any recon for that matter but they all have to be on grid with you
are you required to have a falcon alt too in order to be competativeor may be another damage dealer you know dualboxing 2 battlesps isnt that hardor a cloaked trackingdisrupting pillgrim or logistic spsome should better deal with the fact that bringing in another sp is always beneficial its another story whether on or offgrid boosting is ok  just dont bring irrelevant facts to the discussionbeing supporters of free speech and free and open csm elections we removed fon revedhort from eligibility ccp april 2013
yeahts is a pretty stupid postespecially since the lazy people are those in an invicible gang link sp not participating in the fightyes lets go to all the trouble of scanning down a sp wch has either already left its position and is warping around system from one safe spot to another or is sitting in a pos where he cannot be touchedyou were born with a braintry using it
what do you mean solo no one takes these booster sps into combat solo they are almost exclusively used by an altoh do you mean solo because the killmails dont show the booster alt so your killboard looks like you fought solo but really you had what ever sp gets the killmail plus a t3 cruiser helping is that what you mean make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
not all falcons pilots are alts if people want to try to dual box several sps wle they are on grid they can go ahead some can do it but many will just hand out easy kills for people who are focused on one characterdual boxing 2 battlesps on a combat grid may not be that hard if you are are in a blob but if you are in a tough small gang fight its pretty hard but again go ahead and do that if you want i have no problem with people bringing many sps on grid tracking disrupter pilgrim to whore killmails go ahead it will be on grid and therefore you will have to manage it much closer than a t3 booster as far as logistics i will agree those mechanics need looking at as well but at least they show up on gridone important difference is at least you can learn the peoplecorps who are always going to bring the falcon or the logi in on grid so you can get burned once but then you know the next time you can know what they are going to do and prepare for it you likely wont even know about the t3 booster alt and even if you did figure it out there is notng you can do about it  other than start multiboxing alts yourself make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
instant acceleration and deceleration into and from warp definitely noon the other hand id like to see some sort of effect when someone falls out of warp nearby something akin to cherenkov radiation when the ship slows down

remember this is little things i am still working on my personal list here is what is on it so far1 shields on ships out of a smaentering a pulsarjoining a fleet2 better system than pos passwords for pos access same ui as chat channels would be awesome3 capital smas allowed in wspace4 cans in corp hangers should be able to name them open them put stuff in them5 rename all pos structures6 randomness in sleeper spawns7 dont change sig ids after dt  edit this was done with crucible8 capital ship sd timerscsm 7 secretary csm 6 alternate delegate twostepeve on twitter my blog
1 if every person had their own special tab within a corporate hanger  you would get around having everything all jumbled up and a billion containers everywherebasically all current corp hangers  1 personal hanger tabyou cannot access your personal tab if you dont have security to the hanger2 ship maint bay should work the same a corp tab of all ships  and a personal tab of just your own stuff if you do not have security for the ship maint bay then you cannot access your personal tab out of it eitherits very hard from keeping your personal items and ships from getting mish mashed between all corp members stuff goes missingreplaced all the timea personal tab added to the regular corp divisions tabs would solve the problem3 allow any structure to be renamed  its very hard to set security to a structure when you do not know the name of it cause they are all the same name4 signature changes after downtime  must rescan all the time to find out whats new 5 copying bookmarks is still very cumbersom as you need to pull the bookmark to your own cargohold and then to your bookmarks then copy back and put back there should be something simple to just right click on bookmarks  a tonne of bookmarks  and say copy to my bookmarks or something6 onlining and offlining a pos  there should be something like a 30 min or an hour cue so you can anchor a tonne of structures and then make a cue for onlining them so you can walk away for a bit those structures are all within the shields anyway so who cares if you are watching them online or not watching stuff online 23 minutes online makes you feel like taking a hammer to your head7 why cannot i jump through a wormhole when i just entered a fleet 8 security needs a bit of an overhaul  but the above are my 7 issues
ok  whats fw doing in little thingspoint for discussion  take fw out of little things and fix it properly see numerous threadnaughts on the subject in general discussion or the many blog postsi admit im a fw fan boi and therfore biased but as i recall a certain ceo stated factional warfare needs to be fixed in his open letter to the community last monthfw isnt going to get fixed within little thingsdrackarnfaction war fan boi 
fw both needs little things and a larger overhaul until ccp is willing to commit resources to that larger overhaul they would like to fix as many smaller fw issues as they can csm 7 secretary csm 6 alternate delegate twostepeve on twitter my blog
you forgot swapping tech3 subsystems on pos
yeah this would be really appreciated
4 from mnagy is probably the most important wh fix request and doesnt only apply to wh spaceit is also here
repackagingstacking stuff in cargo hangars would be nice
as stated beforeif i see this on the thousand papercuts list or at least see a dev post somewhere that it is something they are at least looking into then i will be happyohand bump
1 i supported the original back in 07 i support it stillfeel free to come on over to the recently reopened ship crew thread and give me some support too
please discuss issues related to this session in this thread we look forward to your comments and suggestions
i would like to get some discussion about this goingthere is way too many 1 player corporations in eve and reasons are clearthis issue as a whole would give enough content to one entire expansion and benefit entire community
yes corp roles and pos sorely need looked into and not just fixing the fuel which is btw a good first step
id actually like to see more comments and ideas regarding a suggestion im working on bringing up into the assembly hallpi 20
please make pve ratting and missioning mainly generally more than the tedious iskracking chore that it is today incursions were a nice start
yes production chains processes from gathering basic resources to creating all kinds of complex items players can specialize in one part of the process or run the whole chain the process integrates well with many other areas of the gameexample pi from planet gatherers to factory consortiums from pos fuel to tii components and outpost partsno clickget rewardexample nex store derp incursions kill a bunch of npcs get iskyes promote cooperation more content which gives an advantage to people teaming up in different roles dont be afraid to make being in a fleet a prerequisite for some content also make people compete for limited resourcesexample incursionsno purely singleplayer content with no way of cooperating andor competing or with cooperation not bringing in enough benefits to warrant splitting the rewards in half instanced content even in the eve meaning  everyone gets a mission site of their ownexample pic wat i did thar
please discuss issues related to this session in this thread we look forward to your comments and suggestionseditors note ccps title for this topic was convenience microtransactions but we have not heard of any specific plans for such microtransactions and the csm is generally opposed to the idea
convenience mts in eve onlinenever ever without switching to free to play
did they gave you examples or do we have to discuss what we can accept and not again also having this on the last day is a bad idea  it will for sure be a hard disucssion and youll need to talk again about it another day before leaving
no double nomt only for vanity items ever if that
with all due respect anyone who advocates anything beyond sparkleponies ie vanity items for mt should be forced to answer to a salvo of quad 3500 mm artillery if they survive the first salvo repeat
i want hats
anything that gets introduced that people had to previously invest time for will set of the  storm all over againdont even think about jump clones or standings for real world money ccp unless you enjoyed last summers threadnaughts ofcjust sayin
in shortmicrotransactions   no stop the evemail spam
23 of the crucible would be sold as mtjust no if anything else would be too great an incentive to leave or even intentionally create inconvenencies  which should be properly named just bad design and coding and ccp has way too much proven record of making inconvenient stuffinsert some waste of screen space here
microtransactions could actually be beneficial to the economy as we know it however i dont mean by the creation of an iwin button or several items that give a defined advantage over other players what i suggest is that mts continue but lower prices for aurum and make the nex the great isk sink that it could be utilized as it could help stabilize the failing economy as with current nex prices and the addition of aurum has driven the price of plex up to alarming levels currently affecting numerous people and their ability to continue playing evevanity items onlyi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
vanity items only this is how it should remain
no mt at all vanity is a core gameplay mechanic in this game as a quick look through these boards will show so no pay2win even for the vanity game
no cash store mt whatsoever for stuff in the eve online client as long as a subscription is chargedpreferably remove nex store and ceremonially throw the people who envisaged and championed it into the harbourall ship customization logos exotic clothing and such should be introduced into the game by traditional means allowing players to research develop earn loyalty points from factions etc and sell this stuff to other players on the market its an absolute nobrainer that npc corporate and faction ship skins should come from those factional loyalty stores furthermore id like you to strongly remind ccp that they already got a form of mt additional income from the introduction of plex which allows cash rich time poor players to spend rl currency on game advantage and trying to impact the sandbox further is just being greedyof course you could argue that even additional accounts which many many of us have are another form of mt that makes gameplay easier cyno alts anyoneconclusion being screw nex get that content flowing back into the sandbox by the traditional means and do not be tempted to nickel and dime subscription paying customers again in the future the solution for ccp to increase its cash flow is to 1 improve the game so more people subscribe and tell their friends to come subscribe too2 introduce expensive kit that people make ingame and sell for big isk that some will trade plexisk for3 stop flushing money down the drain on halfassed projects that nobody really cares aboutit really isnt rocket science
qfecouldnt have said it better myself the nex store and aur crudtheres no reason or purpose to itthe economy should be unified under isk anyway for dust 514why make it any harder than it iswe can buildproduce the stuff for the ground pounders anyway we need the focus shfited back to the gameand as evidenced by recent eventsits obvious that its the right thing to do stop the evemail spam
if anyone cares to read it i have an alternate proposal where both players and ccp all benefit from microtransactions without effecting game balance ie no pay to win
please discuss issues related to this session in this thread we look forward to your comments and suggestions
just going to keep banging the drum here about the complete industry revamp that was supposed to be quantum rise but got pushed into a backlog black holeany hopes of this being resurrected in the near future
dear friends i think it is time that we focused on the new features that are being released with this winters expansion to our favourite mmo we have been told that all the racial captains quarters are being released and that means that fullon incarna v20 is just around the corner i cant wait to walk in stations but before we get to that we need to take a look at how were each going to defend our rusty space hovels i believe that the best way possible is for each racial captains quarters to come equipped with a weapon rack which could be placed on a wall somewhere and would come standard with an array of racially themed killing implements that would be safe to use in the confines of a space station without worrying about blasting a hole in the hull to that end i am pretty sure things like space daggers and space katanas will be the order of the day and i am prepared with a list of reasons why this makes perfect sensefirst as previously mentioned it appeals to those among the science fiction fandom who realize the intrinsic issues with fire arms on a space ship or space station explosives and lasers and projectiles that blast or shoot holes in things are a very bad idea on an contained platform whose purpose of keeping an atmosphere inside of it is greatly hindered by being ruptured put bluntly a sharp bladed instrument is far less dangerous for the integrity of the space vessel than is a fire armsecond the inclusion of swords and swordfighting mechanics will appeal to a wide audience of people ranging from the dungeons  dragons fantasy mmo player who enjoys world of warcraft and rolling twelvesided dice to the budding star trek fan who was quite impressed by sulus ability to wield a telescopic katana in the most recent movie on that note we should totally allow switchblade and telescopic versions of pretty much any sword that is introduced so as to provide functional differences in their performance you could even modify the stats of certain other weapons to compensate imagine a whole new realm of customized itemsthird the addition of the sword specifically as a melee weapon associated with honour and chivalry allows for the timehonoured practice of the space bushido warrior code to be fully exemplified in a modern day samurai now one can literally have an honour duel with another player all thanks to the presence of a sword and if one is slighted in some way or feels that one has failed in his service to his feudal space lord then one can commit space seppukufourth swords and combat would allow ccp to further develop the carbon framework that can be used in later iterations of eve online and other products to include dust and wodi am sure there are more reasons to include how stylishly a katana goes with a neckbeard but i think i will stop there for now and open the floor for comment by my fellow space citizens of new eden reddit lyrisnairn skype lyrisnairn twitter lyrisnairn
incarna v2 just in time for the next expansion
i support these ideas fully
1i always dreamed of having a gunsword fight in the halls of a lowsec station
can we get slippers with shoebells on them too
gooo away
1 for awesome potential that and blades make more sense as weapons in space then laser guns do its harder to breach a bulkhead with a sword
so you want to be a jedi  310 for trolling
um no stop and use your two brain cells for a moment and think about it in a hostile environment such as space what weapon are stations and ship captains going to look the other way for and which one will they come down hard ona weapon like a blade that if you miss you missora weapon like a gun or some sort of laser rifle where if you miss you kill yourself your target and everyone else in the compartment due to a blow outhmm methinks theyre far more likely to allow the knives and swords
awesome chain of thought you got going on there m8 i still think its a troll weve kind of established that wis is dead and buried so lets keep it that way kk 
i wish i could like this post more
i like the idea but i doubt the gameplay could be easily done on eve it would need so much stuffshooter duel would be way easier to implement
i see your katana and raise you  ramming a nyx into the side of the station
wis is a long long way from being dead and buried i figure well see them get back to it if ccp plays their cards right on this and the next expansion ccp has invested far too much time and money to let them go plus i have to agree with hilmar that it will eventually be an important aspect to the overall future eve online experience
im gonna say that wis is a long way from dead too simply because i actually enjoy the ambiance of my cq when not blasting the cookies out of something if the rest of the station interiors is as good well see a lot less people spinning shipshowever this would actually require ccp to get its act together
please discuss issues related to this session in this thread we look forward to your comments and suggestions
give ccp punkturis a hug and tell her that we understand that it was impossible task to finish and polish everything what she started before the crucible launch we still appreciate the work she pushed forward to meet with the requests of the whining community and hope that she will be given enough time and resources during the next few months to properly polish all the features already in the game
they did a lot of good things reallyhowever i would like to see the list of systems on the way back on starmap on a form or anotherbeing able to see infos on one system is not the same as being able to see infos on all the systems at the same timeyou cant add midway waypoints or do some tweaking without all the informationsee this post for more details 
please do your best to make sure that this effort continues not neccessarily on as huge scale as now  ccp needs to work on other projects too  but little things shouldnt be abandoned after the release until we shoot up an npc structure again i especially love the speed of the feedback ive seen this happen several times alreadyccp we brought this new feature x to sisiplayer cool but itd be nice if it could do y tooccp ill look into ita day laterccp y is now in the development buildplayer happy fun joy joy

again this seems like an awful waste of time compared to a lot of issues that are fiercely fought about and have been around for years why did this make the listthe art is nice we like it bravo now make more of the same discussionseriously
they should make a survey to chose the next ship to be redone if they have artists available

appears to be working as intended eve is back on track ccp will make more money more money means more profit and investment into their other projects down the road
omgso anywaychanges need to be made to the csm to ensure more balance for who is represented in the overall community i dont see how it is even possiblecsm membersno offense trebor should not be allowed to run if they have already been voted in and served on the csm once or twice already
your a day late and a dollar shortthey lifted the restriction even under exterme protest and csm now have unlimtied termsyou have a snow balls chance in hell in reversing thathappened last yeardont recall when or how or what but it was a dark day for csmccp stop the evemail spam
recently started to work as intended  by the players as a leverage for players to get their views taken seriously by being legitimated public loud and focussed about itstill could improve on its legitimacy by improving the election process for example reduce number of nominations to a more manageable number through some sort of primaries on the forums while making sure minority interests remain represented rl politics have come up with quite a few ways to do this also make it easier and more attractive for players to vote 50 participation would greatly add legitimacy
free 5k aurum for votingonly thing i can really think of without giving free isk or plex and screwing the game over
free aurum just means that of those people who dont currently vote those who dont care enough about aurum will continue to not vote and those who want free aurum will pick a name at random from the list or just the first name at the top so they get their payout it might give the false impression of legitimacy but it wouldnt increase the number of informed or engaged voters
this is true but there really isnt any way to incentivise voting without giving some kind of reward compensation unfortunately it will always lead to that outcome i think ccp should work on the out of game and in game advertisements to help get the word out make it easier to see the information people are voting for and more information about the person and what they wish to accomplish as well
any sort of incentive for voting will only add random noise to the resultsthe only way to encourage responsible voting is to promote the csm and make people widely aware of what it is and what it does propaganda and campaigning by the candidates and the idea that we can change the course of this game is what brought many people in 00 alliances to vote for csm6 not getting free stuff

should plex bound to account on isk purchase from in game marketin other words you could sell plex through in game market only once and the receiving account would be forced to turn it to either aurum or game timethis would prevent any kind of market manipulation with the item and remove quite a load of worries about unused plexes from ccp
i like that
honestly while im in favor of thisit would prevent freedom of the player driven market stop the evemail spam
youd also reopen the doors to rmt people patience is a very rare commodity online
how would not being able to resell a plex after buying it on the ingame market make rmt people more active i dont suffer from insanity i enjoy it 
in that case you can remove plex from the game and use the timecode forum to buy gtc for iski would like more control on manipulation but youre going way too far
remember that for everybody buying plex to fund their account theres somebody selling plex to fund their pvp or whatever habbitif you can get more isk for your dollareuropound from rmt people because ccp removes supply demand mechanics from the in game market which is what not allowing resale does you make that option attractive to peopleif 30 gets you 700 million legally back when plex was 350ish and 1 billion illegal through rmt to some people not me btw the risk of a ban becomes worth itand now for a controversial statement i think the interest of the people spending real world money should weigh heavier then the interest of people wanting to play for free zips up her flameproof suit
every players opinion is valid if they didnt play then they arent bringing in money to ccp sure you may not be paying out of pocket to play if you purchase plex but somebody else is so you are still a valid customer
yes but you need your customers giving you money not a 3rd party rmter
i disagree with this in one a biti have 2 paid by cash not isk accounts with eve  i dont plex  but i will let you know my issue below1 toon is the moneymaker and the other toon ist he industrialistdo all the redundant stuffi sometimes get toonb to purchase things for toona or vice versa depending on where they are in the universeif the above suggested was to take place  it obsoletes my dummy toon for doing all the things in eve i hate flying somewhere to buy stuffso you still need to link multiple accounts together
wouldnt you just transfer the isk instead of the plex in this scenario
i do not remember broad opposition to plex in any recent discussions is it really an issue if not leave as is
duplicate post with eve error  read post below
it depends where the toon isi could have toona in jita and toonb in rensone of them will buy an item for the otherwhen they meet up by days end  items are flip floppedso the person who bought it  itsnt always the person who used itmany times toona is missioning while toonb is sent around the galaxy to pick up items for me and for any other members in corpthis scenario becomes more apparent when you spend your time and live in wormholes more oftenmany times 1 buyer since they are going out anyway is given a shopping list
1 excellent ideathank youhe has mounted his hindlegs and blown crass vapidities through the bowel of his neck  ambrose bierce on oscar wildes lecture in san francisco 1882

pi 20an updated assembly hall version is nearing completion and will be posted soon enough
we have absolutely no idea what are ccps plans for this are the only thing we know is that it will be tied to planets whether the current pi system or something else and that it might affect sovereigntyso far theres nothing to discuss
thiswe cant discuss something if its totally nda and have no infos about it

it would be nice if taking or losing sov involved more than 1 side bringing overwhelming numbers for 6 timers it would be nice if there was actually some incentive to attacking multiple systems with smaller say 100 strong fleets rather than 1000 with some sort of tug of war and possibility to actually have feint attacks
pretty muchbrute force with massive numbers should be an option but it shouldnt be the only option in every circumstance theres more than one way to storm a castle
we hate shooting structures thats the big pointalso we need more reasons to need sovmaybe a system like fw ano the one where you only need to stay near the beacon for the timer to move on sov it would mean that you dont need tons of ships and so could do more than one thing at the same timeof course it would need a good thinking given it will be harder for defense
better yet fix the explosion velocityradius of the torps and cruise missiles

eve economy should be more than the supply and demand of a couple thousand capsuleers and the completely independent static and completely implausible system of npc trade goods have worldchanging events like wars and incursions as well as the needs and wishes of billions of people on planets reflect on the market
laughable logic sorry probably caused by a wish to over dramatize unless you will find billions of real players wishing to play and personify those needs and wishes of billions of people on planets they will be exactly that  npc goods oh and we already have themaccording to you worldchanging events like wars and incursions  will be purely npc stuff as well  couple thousand players cant implement all that on their ownand btw if there are couple thousand capsuleers it is time to shut down servers and discuss one thing only  where to have a rip partyinsert some waste of screen space here
1 wrong thread2 the economy should be more than a rng and a bunch of algorithms people will figure out within a month after release the economy should be based on the supply and demand of real people and worldchanging events like wars and i dont mean amarrminmatar wars and invasions as well as the needs and wishes of hundreds of thousands of real peopleoh wait it actually is

the wardec system needs to be looked at yesterdayespecially what is and isnt allowed in hisec dec shields need addressing one way or the other the recent sudden change in policy set a lot of bad blood with mercs hisec dec corps and yes griefersccp needs to take a clear stance on where they want to go with pvp mechanics in hisec
i know they are already working on it but it was coming with wis which has been put on hold bounty system is all sorts of  up in its current state it isnt even worth having in the game
the wardec system needs a revampit needs to be simplified a flat fee cost for wardeccing there should be no need for decshields there should be no accommodation for avoiding decs by jumping a corp to another alliance a corp jumps to another alliance the wardec follows it and pulls in its new alliance freeofcharge players are still free to leave corpwardeccing alliances cannot have other corps enter their alliance for the duration of their wardecaccommodation for isk warfare if a corp can pay to start a war the opposing corp should be able to pay to avoid the war but that cost should be expensive it should be expensive to avoid shootem ups since this is primarily a shootemup game if it costs x amount to start a war it should cost triple the amount to end it once bribed the corp cannot be wardecced again by the same corp for two or more daysjust a simple set of rules are all that are required simple rules are harder to game and exploit
dont even know where to start this  this would easily fill the schedule of several summitspersonally i have favourites bounty system insurance factional warfare pi
nullsec industry namely the fact that mining and building stuff localy is orders of magnitude slower more expensive timeconsuming and less efficient than simply importing everything from jita the efficienty speed and scaleability of 00 industry needs to be multiplied many times to be able to compete with the thousands of industrialists in highsec until that happens there will be very little reasons to do any industry at all in 00 other than because i like itdisclaimer i live in pure blind if the situation is different on the furthest edges of the universe then i dont know much about itin my opinion this is right now amongst the biggest gaping chest wounds of eve

things should be about risk vs reward in this game2 main issues i always have a beef with1why would i want to go to ls or null to do a mission when my hs mission pays enough  gives me a tonne of looti will never go to ls or null with my mission running as i make enough isk vs no risk in hs2hs missions provide lp  bounty  loot  salvagethis should not be the case you are flooding the market with loot  or refined loot minerals thats a miners  industrialist toons joba mission should only ever provide at most lp  bounty  salvagelet the items be built by players for profit that is my biggest beef about game balance too much is given to missioners that takes away from industrialists
low sec need to be more rewarding given its riskbtw i dont see any mention of low sec on any of the subjects you wont talk about it at all  or it is limited to fw 
agreed on risk vs rewardas a rule avoid nerfing wherever possible you will always face a huge threadnaught doing so as you are taking stuff away from people if one element is to advantageous introduce a counter a new item or an improved version of an old one  without removing the old one mind just letting it become obsolete wherever possible instead thats how these things work in real life and i dont see why they shouldnt in new eden
thats dumbthe reason that things work differently in real life is that its you know real life during the cold war when it became clear that humanity just might annihilate itself there was no dev available to nerf the laws of nuclear physics and make superpowers develop more balanced and interesting defence spending priorities rather than everbigger and more gruesomely effective nukes in eve we can and should go back and revert things that dont work or which work too well despite the shrieking and rage from bandwagonersan endless cycle of broken ships followed by counters and countercounters and countercountercounters just makes for a tedious onedimensional grind of chasing the latest fotm

in general security needs to be overhauled totallyif you look at the way security is now it is made so someone has the option of theiving or stealing from you currently you technically need to give too many rights to someone so they can do their jobcurrent rights is also unfair to an individual as an individual must trust a corp with their own bpos for researchagain  very easy for these to be stolen my first solution to the above is a simple change any corp hanger  the div tabs  should be given 1 extra tab a personal tab only you can access it if its at an npc station if its at an actaul pos then the items can be accessed by admin as there would be no way to offline the hangerby doing the above an individual can go to the corp hanger at an npc pos and put hisher bpos in there safely cause nobody can touch them from here you can do research at the pos remotely your years of investing into your own bpos that you purchased with your own isk is safeyou ever wonder why you have so many 1 man corps or tiny corps around  its so none of their years worth of investments dont get stolen
im not sure about the exact proposed nerfs but i tend to agree that the drake and to a lesser extent the cane are overpoweredif you do this for balancing you also have to nerf command t3s
nighthawk should always be the ferox hull see enough drakes as it is
i think that these nerfs are a little bit too steep id much rather the tier 2 bc be treated as the benchmark that the entire class strive for this would mean an increase to tier 1 bc performance with a possible increase to production cost to keep things balanced i also believe that field commands should be reevaluated and slightly improved as the introduction of tier 2 bcs and tech 3 cruisers has more or less removed any advantage these ships once had at the very least field and fleet command ships should be given the hp buff that was applied to bc hulls back in 2006ish for some reason this hp buff was missed on the t2 shipsas for changing the field command ships models to tier 2 bcs why is it needed
whilst i am pleased the thread is getting some attention this is about simply changing the models of field command ships to tier ii bruiser models by all means start a thread about bruiser balancing if you think they need it
there is no need at allhowever i think they would look very good and it would create a very clear distinction between the field and fleet variants

booster mechanics proposalboosters should move further from a  chance of negative effects as the main negative effect towards a gradual and increasing dependancy on the use of the drugalthough they should keep a  chance of bad effects the current  chance should be reduced by 50 to 015 this would allow the skills pertaining to boosters to stay unchangedboosters by their nature boost certain performance aspects of your characters pvp skills creating a dependancy mechanic from this is as easy as incurring a small but cumulative persistent penalty on the same areas that the booster gives bonuses tothat way consistent long term use means that a character carries a persistent incurred penalty to the areas the booster would normally affect the character would eventually consume boosters to negate this incurred cumulative penalty thereby creating a dependancy that dependancy would drive use of stronger drugs for performance enhancement incentivising the higher tiers of booster useeven at the highest level of booster use when performance enhancing effects are totally negated drug use will continue purely to negate the persistent negative effectsthe addictive nature of boosters would allow for ultra rare items equivalent to detoxification medicines or npc services akin to a drug rehabilitation course the latter of these would only be available in high security space and would restrict players to staying docked for a set period of days to complete a rehabilitation course detoxification medicines would not nearly be as effective as a rehabilitation course but would be available through players seeding markets in low and null security spacedrug usageapproximating recreational use vs a strong addictive use of a drug is vital to getting balancing correct these are my approximations and are subject to change depending on feedbacktypically less than 3 per week would be considered recreational   156 pa  between 3 and 6 per week would be considered consistent  156   312 pa  more than 6 per week would be considered excessive  312  pa  the approximate values 150 300 and 500 will be used in calculations to approximate usage levels and simplify calculationsoverview

nature of boosters would allow for ultra rare items equivalent to detoxification medicines or npc services akin to a drug rehabilitation coursethis can either be bought off the market and created by players out of ultra rare materials or an aurum or isk based instation service where you enroll your character into drug rehabilitation for UFFFDxUFFFD period of days for a percentage reduction in accumulated booster effects this percentage should be limited to a maximum of 50 per session with sessions lasting up to 5 days during these days youUFFFDll be unable to undock but you can partake in

security space both by npc customs officers performing random cargo scan screenings but also stop and search drug intoxication screeningsthese intoxication screenings would occur at a much lower chance rate compared to cargo scans but would immobilise a characters ship for a small period of time on gate when jumping into a 07 or higher systemif found to be under the effects of boosters a player would be asked to relinquish their ship or if not in charge of a ship pay a fine either option would possibly incur a standings hit relinquishing your ship would allow social skills to positively affect the chance that youUFFFDd gain your ship back at a station in system without incurring a fine and reduce any standing hit the characters ship would not be available until the booster has worn offnpc customs drug inspection ships doing the tackling on gate would be relatively weak allowing a possibility for characters to remove the tackling ship and escape this course of action would cause global criminal status a significant standings hit and characters doing so would become a temporary enemy of the npc faction they aggressedso what do u think guys  feedback always appreciated
too complex for my taste i always think simple  better
oh christ even more tears on this why dont we remove everything except a ibis and a civi railgun from the game so you wingers have nothing to complain about
dont worry grazer hes a goon just tell im that if he wants something simple that u can always direct him to his mothers houseeve is eve not pong
i wanted to try to issue an unofficial thank you to ccp for the effort youve put into reconnecting with the player base its a step few other companies would have attempted the apologies and efforts have been unprecedented in this industry youve backed up the words with practical actions that took an evident investment of time and money lots of people swallowed thier pride and put the community before themselves the new winter expansion though unrelased is very player experience oriented and takes into consideration the day to day things that will really affect the enjoyment of the game it focuses on the existing players rather than new onesi would love to speak for the rest of the community but even just for myself i wanted to thank you for all the effortshopefully if anyone agrees they will sign this post
the idea have been around for a whileone of the idea to fix moon mining would be to allow people to mine a bit of moon goo somewhereheres my version of it  i would propose a new gravimetric site that would allow that but would also offer something that mining dont know  dangerthese new grav sites would appear everywhere but would of course have different minerals and different difficulties depending on the type of system they are inthe specificity of these sites outside being able to mine moon goo would be that the comet itself would be a danger   some fragment could break away from the comet and be thrown to a random guy being hereyou would have to move out of his way for it to be reduced in dust before reaching you a bit like a missile that you avoid by being outise his range or by asking your fleetmates to destroy it with their guns some high end comets would also have some dangerous gas that would damage your ships like it can happen on some situation currentlyanother specificity of this site would be that it would be moving and would not be static its a comet after allin fact the comet would be moving very slowly at first but when people begin mining it it speed would raise more and more the goal would be to force people to fit speed modules and instead of a level of depletion it would be the speed that would make the comet unminnable  when you cant orbit it anymore cause its too fast it would be the end that would also mean that if you ask your buddies to come mines at the same time as you you could extract way more minerals before the comet is too quickthis way you would have 2 reason for teamplay  too mine more before its too late to protect you from debris and gas
oknow that i understand the idea fully i am going to say no it is not a bad ideabut i dont think it is the right idea ecm does need some work and tweaking but i dont think doing so using modules that have absolutely nothing to do with the issue is the right way to go about it
its always lovely to see how any interesting idea brings the trolls outpersonally i think the idea as a certain amount of merit and represents a logical evolution in the same way that a current barge represents the logical evolution of the mining laser besides think of it as just one more new type of ship you can gank without any effort or skill to inflate your egosi think we can all agree that a greater variety of ships in game even if its as targets is a good thing
aw comon no quote just an either way x not even saying you were wrong you know youd be all over this if you went home tested it and it turned out you couldnt use smart bombs in high secplus the solution provided for smart bombs would be absolutely unworkable with your crap idea about exploding ships doing aoe damage picture this you are hauling your 10 years supply of plex in your interbus shuttle just waiting for the autopilot to get to jita you get to jita and decided to peruse all the great deals in local before docking up then suddenly you explode suicide ganked in a fit of rage and spaghetti you go to the station and undock in your battle orca with its hull tank and full set of 15 light battle drones you then explode again concorded turns out your ships death aoe damage hit several other pilots and your security status is below 5
i like this idea and as a bonus  another dumb ideaso that ccp doesnt have to remake entire game mechanics implement this as a module call it something like warp field destabilizer or whatever if this module is active and ship is destroyed by enemies or selfdestruct then explosion happens damage and radius based on the quality of the module and signaturemasscapacitor of the ship or all three if you have a bs full of cap and probably equiped with those lame cap extender battaries no one uses then your boom is bigger but your enemies can evade the boom by draining you and make it the same as interdictioncynobombswhatever those modules cannot be activated in high sec make this one the samethis would enable some version of fire ships in lownull sec space but anyway this is cool but at the same time horrible idea but we have plenty of horrible ideas implemented in eve already so why not
looks like corp bookmarks is how it will be done not something i had considered but also doesnt sound too bad i guess well see what happens
i think using drugs should just make characters less ambitious 25 to their training time when using boostersreally i wish ccp would leave boosters as they are except allow people to take another booster if they dont like the negative effects they received and therefore reroll the dice in exchange for iskmake faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
boosters need a proper rework ccp is rushing out a change to boosters as if they are one of the thousand little papercuts theyre not they are a major feature that has simply been overlooked for a very long timethe current sisi changes are a rushed shitshow of a jokethey need to hold off on these changes and rethink this crap
meh i studied animation once upon a time so i know that a plastic torso is a trip to the uncanny valley even though they added a breathing animation neither male nor female torsos move quite right
i like your solution t3 bonus goes down to bc level but cruiser still can give bonus offgrid ehp buffed command sps have to stay on grid thumbs up
this seems such an easy fix any chance that it will ccp
the mechanics of wh space work very well  the things that dont work well in wh space are the same things that dont work well in k spacepos mechanics bms t3 subsystem changes those types of thingsas far as im concerned fix those and corp bms are a big fix and whs are fine
yes fw does need small fixes but it also needs damn big ones and in my mind needs to be given a topic of its own lest it get drowned in pos management or whateverseriously how much time are you guys anticipating dedicating to fw in december 1 hour if so please use that hour effectively and get some actual mechanics  game play changes agreed with a timelineccp knows what the issues are as theyve been well well documented before and no removing the navy from hisec is not one of themedit
all this
static sig ids is an interesting one not sure of the techncial details of why the sig ids change after dt but keeping them static until the sig actually expires would be frankly game changing and brilliant to both wh life and exploration in generaland bump for everything above especially t3 refitting at poss and shield ships not coming out of an sma at a massive disadvantage to an armor ship
fw complex respawn timers please dont have them resetat the same time each day
updated signature idUFFFDs should not change after dt the deadspace signature around whUFFFDs should be removed shields should be at 100 when boarding a new ship in the sma we should be able to restrict access to the sma by member allow us to swap subsystems in wh space sleepers should roam wh space camp whUFFFDs warp randomly into gravladar sites and maybe attack posUFFFDs there should be a rare chance of ice grav site spawns in wh space remove the penalty to refining arrays in wh space add a ship that has the ability to hold a wh open past itUFFFDs time limit full idea upcoming
bumping because this idea is great quite easy to implement and it would greatly enhance the game in lowsec but not only in lowsec though 
i like the general premise of truly unique ship hull designshowever i believe that the steep entry cost 1bill just for an average frig psd up to 200bill for a bs psd is alittle pro sov aliance and not indicitive of the sand box nature of eve as a gameto pass a golden egg to one portion of eve would be counter productive to eve as a whole maby you would consider a lower entry bar for this kind of game changing proposalsay start in the 100s of millions up to billions what im trying to say it that in eve people dont share outside of there little click of associates all that would happen is you would see uber fleets of ships belonging to only a small hand full of moon raping sov factions they would be rarer than alliance torni ships
what reallythere are players in hisec who fly single ships that cost more then a billion as corporations they can deploy towers and invest in things like tech 2 bpos which cost much more then that hell tech 1 blueprints cost much more then that i dont think its at all unreasonable to have those figures where they are
this is pretty much my view as welllarge sov holding alliances would benefit the most from things like this dont think they need anymore help in wiping out smaller entitiesas as example look at who holds most of npc null space right now how would you expect anyone else to get anything from these mission areas when they cant even get past the front door metaphorically speaking
1 i just want more ships and more varieties of ships really dont care how
bump
its always puzzled me why ccp chose to sell vanity items directly in the nex store it would have been much more fitting to the eve universe to sell aur only materials and blueprints that could then be traded for isk which could be used by researchers and manufacturersso instead of buying a dress you can buy a blueprint for the dress research it and offer to produce for people or buy the materials yourself and sell the dresses on the marketinstead of buying a custom ship logo you buy a blueprint and some paint and produce a ship logo kit that other people can applyprice it so that a 1 run bpc and the materials is the same price as the current vanity item and optionally sell a bpo for way morethis way you can maintain the same microtransaction structure without completely removing the economic and industrial mechanics that eve does so well
cancel them complitly no microtransation in eve dont tuch our plexes they allready very expensive
mt only for vanity items  ship skins concord billboards snowball launchers etc be creative ccp
not on the topic but just to explain somethingaur exists for a simple reason it allows ccp to monitor how much plex gets converted and by extension how many gtcs are purchased for the purpose of vanity itemsif it didnt exist theyd have no way to monitor the vanity  subscription revenue streams separately so theres a valid real world reason for the secondary currency regardless of what my or our opinions on micro transactions are aur has a valid reason for existing as long as nex store exists
mts for vanity items onlyif someone has too much cash and wants to buy monocles then that is between them and their bank manager
so let them buy plex and sell for isk and use that isk to buy expensive things in game that other players discover harvest manufacture and market dont shortcircuit the player economy in this game by allowing cash store nex microtransactions to strip away content opportunity from eve
thismt has been debated to death close the book on it once and for all
omg i just agreed with someone from goonswarm so where are those riders in the skythat said if ccp went about it the right way mt could heavy emphasis be a good thing but they are not the thing they really need to do is get the players involved in the creation of vanity items
institute scaling costs for manufactuing and research slots in stations like office rentalfix the booster bpcgas supply issues before futzing with what they dounderstand really understand what regions high low null drone wspace are net importers and exporters of various commodity types t1 shipst2 moduleslowendhighend minerals etc so a clearer understanding of whats actually happening can be used to predict more accurately the impact of changes you want to makebtw its ok that highsec can produce everything as long as its also less profitable in line with risk
eve needs consumables  some relatively inelastic demand items that impact pve to pvp that scale up with ship size and player age examples are  fuel for mwd and abs charges for armour reppers and shied boosters no not cap charges  think more along the lines of ammo for active modules use minerals in ship repair and not just isk but keep current isk costseve needs new raw materials minerals et al to be used up in t1 to tn construction materials that cant be found in the same places as current materials  more time needs to be consumed in resource gathering versus isk gathering  dont make it more boring or a time sink so much as simply add additional requirements for existing things create more demands upon time by adding new raw materials to the landscape and place them in locations other than existing materialsadd hungry mouths to some of the planets barren and terrain planets can have people that want to be feed the other planets can have robots that need repair people eat food robots eat mineralsstart giving us some info on the dusteve economic dependencies got lots of brains in your player base that are willing to help with the ideas granted lots of ignorant trolls and clowns too but the good ideas speak for them selvesthere was a dev sponsoredauthored thread a few years ago about player suggestionsimprovements to the market interface  whatever happened to thatstocks bonds etc etcnecessity is the plea for every infringement of human freedom it is the argument of tyrants it is the creed of slaves  william pitt

how about we keep everything the same but raise prices on items like oh sayplex
we need more scarcity for example further restrictions to availability of ores to increase the contrast between minmatar vs amarr space 09 vs 05 another would be restricting npc lp stores to the regions claimed by the particular npc corps empire thus you wouldnt buy republic fleet shield extenders from an rss station deep in amarr territorydont just include material scarcity encourage scarcity of services and supplies too restrict the flow of traffic through stargates allow stargates to be upgraded through the use of either anchorables like sbus two varieties  one which enhances weightperjump andor weightperhour the other diminishes weightperjump andor weightperhour to allow eg faction militias to engage in economic warfare by eg disabling all the gate enhancers between jita and the surrounding systemsbut those are just my two soap boxes i like to push at any opportunity not really related to any existing problems in the economy apart from the severe deflation due to ease of supply

 eve evolved the new player experience eve evolved the new player experience part 2
the art session is not about the final product its about the process csm needs a better understanding of the process and the constraints the art department operates under because it is often a bottleneck that affects everything elsefor example everyone wants the dead horse pos but art may be a bottleneck that prevents or delays that by having a better understanding of the constraints csm feedback about other aspects of the game can be improved and we can also give art some input about prioritizationfor example if wed been asked about the new turrets wed probably have said gee thats nice but other things have a higher priority since the turrets are eyecandy
change field command ships to tier ii bruiser models no mechanics reason it will just look goodsee this thread for details
animated realtime camera view for locked targets instead of static image assuming this doesnt ruin usability also stop making all ui elements rectangles and more like movie oseve should look more like minority report and less like windows 31also inb4 rage about removing locked pinned windows

this is the prettymuch final agenda some items requested by ccp some by csm but most are stuff that everyone wanted to talk about
make voting mandatory like creating a portrait cant log into game until you vote
same problem as giving away aurum above
oh god whats this i cant play my game until i pres butan just show me a butan and i will pres i need my ice mining fixyep this suggestion wont help no matter how many times guys like you put this forward
what youre afraid of is just the opposite  that the ice miners would actually read the short description and run down goon candidate
how would a bot know who to vote for
you do realize that bots have evolved quite a bit from the old days the trick is to leave them in irc channels for a while so they start to learn english and then have them listen in say minmater channel here in game and pretty soon youll have them wandering around mining ice and spouting lol l2p noob can i haz yur stuff and posting their considered opinions on how awesome goonswarm is in the forums
you missed all the whine regarding 500mil plex a few days agothats why you have 3 toons per account to have them somewhere to inject plex to the account
no i have 2 toons on 2 accountsas i said i dont plex and dont intend to but if i click on one toon and buy a plex and cant use it on my other toon on the other account id be peedi should not be forced to travel 30 jumps with the purchasing toon just because
weak excuse make a 3rd toon in empire biomass it afterwards
this would have the side effect of greatly reducing liquidity in the plex market
as said above this would be a significant disadvantage for people who dont have access to market hubs atm i can keep 1 alt on one account in the forge and buy plex for all my accounts
yes keep one alt out of 3 per account in forge for all your plex needs on that account face it the significant disadvantage is for market players
you can add your plex to game time remotely from assets window no matter where it isin other words it is enough if one of the characters in an account goes to corner of any region where plex is available in market this has to be done only once in a month given that you buy only one plex at the timesellers are still free to value their plex as they want and modifycancel the sell ordersbuyers are still free to set up buy orders or choose the place they buy their plex fromonly real difference would be that when you do buy a plex you commit to add it to your game time right away or later in the future you will be unable to resell or redistribute that game time to anyone else or play market games with it
why is this desirable
i think we should artificially raise inflation on plex pricingoh wait
because it is game time not scourge missile
this wild fluctuations in plex prices  unstable player base  bad for ccps bottom line
is it my understanding from the above posts that if i wanted to make money on veldspari would buy a billion dollars worth of veldsparwait a few daysand then sell onto the market for a tad higherhoweverit will not be permitted to buy 10 plexes  hold them till the prices goes up and then sell themsandbox is a sandbox  if you want to buy plex  you should have to pay market priceseven if there is some yahoo stocking up on all of themif i want to hold onto my melted nanoribbons for a month to make a profit  thats my choice and the same choice  my choice  should be there to gobble up plexs and sell them whenever i want to sell themto complain that an item is too expensive in eve  even if it is plex or any other type of item  defeats the purpose of the sandbox ideai do not agree with the above suggestions  if i am reading them correctly   as you are removing the free market from the game the very thing that makes the gamewhat next  robotics  coolant  arkonor 
the whole point of plex is that it is a tradable item which the market will set a price for the bound to account on isk purchase item is the gtc once plex were introduced the prices of plex and gtc increased whether this was due to a general increase in the consumption of plex due to the ease of purchase or due entirely to market manipulation is irrelevantit might be worth a statement from dr eyjog about whether the introduction of plex increased the number of people buying game time with isk perhaps a reissue of the plex devblog showing purchaseuse of plex and gtc from about three months before plex were introduced even at the time of that devblog plex usage was increasing linearly over timethe long term trending of plex is due to demand not manipulationprobe launchers are not scourge missiles either they have noncombat utility shuttles have noncombat utility many skill books have no utility in combat plex are the same they have noncombat utility the closest eve has to a purely speculative trade item
paranoidit doesnt remove free market it removes ability to hold years of unused game time in single account just to make less game time available for others it also removes huge problem from ccp when they can actually have solid statistics about accounts and amount of available game time binded to them makes future financial planning much easier besides you can not craftcollect game time in the sandbox so the item as a whole doesnt belong into sandbox playing market games with such item can not be justified by any reasons related to free sandbox environmentbind it to account when it is bought from in game market or traded between 2 accounts by any other means and the plex can properly serve its purpose  and only the purpose  which it was originally made to fill
plex is gametime valdspar is valdspar wild fluctuations in valdspar price  unstable player base which wrecks havoc on mmo learn the difference
holding plex in a hangar does not diminish the supply of plex check the plex devblogthe purpose that plex was originally made to fill was to be a markettradable item to allow the market to decide the value of game time the format that you are suggesting is exactly the original gtc model trade once on the forums game time is automatically applied to the account that paid isk for the codeany complaint about plex being too expensive for some individual to buy in order to play for free is irrelevant the value of plex is determined by the people who have the spare isk lying around to be able to afford to throw it away on 30 days of game time this is a subscription based game getting to play for free by spending ingame currency is a perk enjoyed by the ingame richthose of you trying to fund game time by buying plex with isk are directly competing with people who play the game to make the isk to buy the plex to play the game the play to pay crowd if you are having trouble raising the isk to buy a plex each month check out the making isk guide for some ideas in the meantime acknowledge that if you arent committing your gaming time to making isk you are falling further behind the plex affordability curveplex do not exist to allow you to buy game time with an amount of isk that you can afford
i can tell you from first and secondhand experience that fluctuations in plex prices are met by players finding more isk to buy those plexes with in some rare cases people will let alts go dark for a month while they grind up the isk to buy that next plex in the meantime plex sales and consumption continue to rise steadily as more people realise what a challenging game the playtopay lifecycle isa rise in the price of plex from 300m isk to 500m isk simply means a couple of extra hours of incursion time are spent paying for game time so the acquisition of shiny ships has to slow down a little after buying the nightmare this week i might have to wait an extra week before i can buy a nightmare for the alt too  she wont be able to fly it for a month anyway so no great loss thereif the value of a plex is a significant proportion of your regular in game income you are playing to pay with some other activities on the side you are directly competing for plex with people whose main goal in eve is playing to payto put it into perspective the missionganker who manages to loot half a dozen officer modules per month is not playing to pay UFFFD they are rolling in isk and trading isk for game time is a perk the low sec pirate who resorts to mining or incursion running in order to raise the isk to pay for plex is playing to pay
we dont really have info on this either this session is supposed to change thatcsm 7 secretary csm 6 alternate delegate twostepeve on twitter my blog
true theres no information on their plans yet however if their plans are not at least as good as thisi suggest that you tell them to scrap their plans entirely and do that instead
put moongoo in pi and ppl will fight over them otherwise theres no point

the link needs to be pretty strong for it to be anything other than a shortlived gimmick just saying you can disrupt hostile pi isnt going to cut it especially with the current form of pi which is an exercise in masochism and where hostile entities disrupting my ability to perform it would be an act of mercysure i want to be able to nuke dust players from orbit and be doomsdayed by their planetary defence lasers in return but lets go beyond that i want the dust economy and the eve economy to be essentially the same thing with the same currency market windows and logistics considerations where the local sell order im looking at could have been set up by a dust player on their ps3 or an eve player on their pc i want to be able to manipulate the market price of neuralbonded assault rifles and hybrid demolition charges and attack skimmers in jita like i can with spaceships and modules today i want new resources in space that are harvested by eve players and used to make dust items and new resources on planets that are harvested by dust teams to make new space items i want to be able to reinforce a pos or offline a cyno jammer or delay my enemys manufacturing jobs by infiltrating their space in a blackops battleship and deploying dust teams to carry out sabotage missionsccp are committed to delivering dust now so run with it and deliver properly

structure grinding needs to be removed or reengineered from the ground up as its a pointless time sink that does a great deal to put players off nullis there a point to sov anymore i understand those with the power skills and money to do moon mining and build super caps gain advantages from it but since the anomaly nerf does anyone else there needs to be a point to sov for those of us at ground level small scale objectives that encourage small gang effort as well as larger scale participation not only on the combat but the industry frontif players can build and deploy a station they should also be able to watch them burn
some kind of mechanic to make sov in surrounding systems affect how easy it is to drop the sov in a system so it makes sense to attack multiple systems at once rather than just the one high sov indexes in adjacent systems makes it harder low indexes makes it easier or possibly have it tied to the change in adjacent sov indexes so if you have 5 systems around you dropping you drop faster
what do we post about what what we think of them
i agree that the wardec system should be looked at with a critical eye i agree that paying your way out of a wardec should be the hardermore expensive option than fighting however this does not address the reason the dec shield originally came to be junk wardecs predec shield eve uni received numerous wardecs where the aggressing party the one that initiated the wardec refused to come out and fight instead staying docked up this issue should be addressed explicitly perhaps an isk penalty to the aggressors if they refuse to engage in combat with this other wardec evasion tactics should be illegal being able to operate with basically minimal risk in hisec your ship is not costeffective to suicide gank yet still get good no great as in topend or nearly so rewards from l4s and incursions is not what this game is about as a possible system id suggest making the declaring party put up a sum of isk with a set minimum value that either will be refunded to them at the end of the campaign if combat takes place is paid by the targeted party to end the wardec danegeld basically or is charged to the declaring party as a penalty if no combat kills andor losses results
speaking as someone who lives out on the furthest edge of the universe even though we do manufacture a lot of stuff locally our goto solution for getting most of the things we have isnt to improve the manufacturing chain and focus on making more things better its to focus on our logistical chain and figure out ways to get to and from jita more easilythats kind of sad really and speaks volumes as to the issues at hand here
im not advocating any specific changes im just tired of gathering intel eventually deccing a corp and then having them drop the dec via a decshield immediatelyi am also not saying people should be forced to fight you want to dock up dock up eunis problem stems from their own rule of not allowing their pilots to undock during war except in an organized fleet if the aggressors never undock into your frigate blob i understand thats annoying but eve uni told eve unis pilots they cant do anything but sit in that blob on that station during war you really cant blame fail deccers for your own policies i cant buy anything because i forbade myself to spend resources i blame it on the shopkeepers anyway their issue isnt caused by game mechanics its caused by themalso isk is a bad motivator to encouragediscourage anything in eve if i put up a post on brrc forums saying we need x amount of isk to wardec y wed prolly have it donated within 48 hours even if were talking billionsbasically stuff needs to resolved in such a way that wardecs either stick except when you disband the corpalliance or there is a clear set of rules and conditions under which a wardec becomes invalidated i dont really see a surrender system working either while it would work for mercs and maybe hisec extortionist type wardeccers it will do nothing to discourage griefers not that i actually think griefing should be discouraged at all mind you

the security session is more about external security  protecting your account fighting botters and rmt etc
but wie need ingame securety to that waits already very very long
great area for improvement and the technology is now ripe to implement something low cost and easy for everyone that could also provide a much higher degree of securitythe best idea ive seen lately is the new mobile phone account validation function that has recently appeared for competing mmos  yeah it may be patented or whatever already but maybe a different design or licensing agreement could be arranged you install a validator app on your smartphone iphone windows phone android you set your account to require phone validation  let the account owner choose whether to require validation code upon any number of scenarios when prompted at login for the phone validation code you have to go run the phone app and it generates a temporary validation key based on phone hardware time function and some parameter stored on the server side unique to your login account a parameter passed to the phone app from the server at initial phone app setup etc that will only work with your account input the phone validation code in addition to your normal userid and passwordthe scheme could include options for higher or lower security based on the desires of the userthe app does not require an active phone connection each time it is run but only upon initial setupthis is similar to the old login dongle idea used by many high dollar or high security firewall validation systems where in addition to a userid and password the server would present a temporary timebound encryption code to the user logging in and the user would have to input the code into a small smart dongle device and the device spits out a reply code that the user then inputs in reply to the server prompt  but thanks to the prevalence of smartphones dongles are no longer required
uh how does that help with anything all it proves is that you have a smartphone and not everyone doesmore useful would be code to check to see if any of the known botting programs are currently running on your computer if so then your client will automatically flag your account as a suspected bot allowing easier investigations into botting or of course you could just automatically ban everyone who triggers that bot flag but since it seems unlikely that youd manage the feat without some false positives its better on the whole for there to be a bit of oversight

theres a csm thread here
see the status of your drones in drone hangar would be nice to see how healty my little fellows are so that i can decide to launch not the damaged onewould love to see some ice belts in wh space not unlimited for sure but as an sig with ammount of x
one idea could be to introduce a personal hangar array this array is different to the cha simply in that it provides an infinite number of hangar divisions unique to the capsuleer viewing the content with only one access rule directors and pos operators would be able to access all items in a pha and get an inventory of who is storing stuff in the pha the pha would be able to store assembled ships alongside other items and provide a fitting servicethe pha would have one fixed volume everyone using the pha would see the same volume used indicator so everyone knows just how much they can shove into the pha
trebor two step please go though hans jagerblitzens thread on fw improvements carefully so that there is no wasted effort on fw
can we get ice mining sites in wormholes i think it was an oversight
i think the pos overhaul i think im refering to the modular pos idea would pretty much be buffing wh stufft3 fitting at possindividualized hangarsbetter management of access to hangarstowers themselves etcfw stuffremove the after dt shuffle replace with more regular spawning mechanics of plexesincentives for occupancy
will dowrt ice in whs this is by design to prevent whs from being selfsufficientsuper chair i agree in general with these ideas
fixed that part for youits not like there isnt alot of other large volume crap we are forced to haul in using itty 5s through unfriendly systems  c5  c6 whs occasionally get highsec access to push a freigher load worth of crap through but the rest of us gets to slowboat iterons around for hours on endnot fun and it would hardly be gamebreaking for wspace to get their own ice i mean even the plebes in highsec have it for christ sake
that doesnt make sence anymore lets say an entire corp lives in a c5 these guys are not going into know space everyday interacting with the rest of the eve community in actual fact they hardly ever go to k space once in a while they will need to take their loot to sell in hs and when they do they will bring the ice fuel in with them this doesnt require the participation of each member  just a small teamplease see my suggestion on page one
i would like to add one more thing to the list here that has to do not only with whs but also with hs and ls and null secso anywhere in the eve universeif a pos is anchored but offlined any player should have the ability to unanchor itthat and any structure that goes with itlets start cleaning up all those pos position holders out there that are not running and allow someone to make profit for the cleanupas well if you pos bash a pos anywhere  why do you need to destroy everything to get at the items why cannot you use the codebreaker mod or something to crack the safe and get at the goodies and the structuretoo many whs have dead pos  or backup poss either a pos is online and is running or is in stront modeor its a dead pos and can be takento add to that the same should apply to secure containers any container anywhere in eve universe should be codebreaked to get at whats insideits annoying to fly into an astroid belt in hs to see a billino secure containers m
it doesnt make sense to me why is it wrong to have wormhole selfsufficient on an equal level to nullsec i hear nullsec has access to icedoes this make them too selfsufficient then why not remove ice from nullsec thenmy bottom line i want to be selfsufficient being forced to haul ice from known space is not fun
agreed it should required the t2 code breaker and should take between 15 and 30 minutes to unanchor a offline pos
id suggest having an offline timer so it has to be offline for a couple of days before you can steal it stops a little qq couldnt log in to refuel due to legit reason without getting rid of the main reason
there is no legit reason to not have a months worth of fuel in your pos other than death or tsunami
with poss i agree they should be unanchorable sure use codebreakers or whatever doesnt matter but this also kickstarts salvaging into a profession even those who dont want the moon or the pos can hack scoop and sell the towerfaction war needs more enemy elements ive suggested before adding pirate factions and allowing corps to join those malitias it also goes along with my proposal to have variable sec status on the empire borders inherent to the conflict between pirate and empire factions
good list right there id increase 6 to not just some randomization in sleeper spawns but also in what a site actually yields in terms of radarmagneto cans spacerocks or gas makes it maybe a bit bigger than a little thingshared corp bookmarks would have been on the list too if they had not been introduced for crucible hooray for thisthere was some talk about removing highend ores from lower class wormhole gravimetric sites this will probably resurface as well during this session
iirc a concern at the time is that if whs were selfsufficient they would quickly be colonized by nullsec alliances and used as secure production facilities
ice in wspace doesnt count as a little thing and it is not a bug it is totally by design without the need to haul stuff there would be a lot less traffic in wspace and ganking a hauler is often the start of a fun fightcsm 7 secretary csm 6 alternate delegate twostepeve on twitter my blog
which would be awesome if doable but every time  let me repeat that every time they have tried to fix a little thing in fw they have broken a whopping big thing hell even when they fix things theoretically unrelated to fw something breaks fw is a great big mashup of code from all over the place  there is no small fixes available the best you can do on that scale is tweaking but tweaks are neither wanted not needed  the base mechanics are what people have been complaining about the past three yearsthe perfect solution for me is for ccp to pour everything they have into a rewrite of null sovereignty system and then applying a simplified and slightly modified version of said system to fw should make for a much sturdier construct and goes a lot further towards making fw a taste of null warfare without forcing people out to null type deal which was one of the original intentions if i recallin short i second or however high number havent read all posts the motion to remove the little things sticker from fw
trebor make it clear to them that they will be risking the future of their company if they go beyond vanity items and it would be by far the best of they left that topic alone till eve has started growing again
wait where the  did this word convenience come from and whenweve gone from vanity related microtransactions to convenience microtransactionsbefore this topic gets too far ccp had damn well better step up and tell the players outright what they consider conveniencefaction ammo is convenient because it hits harderfaction modules are convenient because they increase damagedefense etcmicrotransactions are pretty damned basic for eve avatar accessories only
i dont mind the microtransactions as long as it remains vanity itemsi would like to see ship custom paints  these would be very popularit would be good to see some of the old trinkets that appeared on the old character customization screen there were hair trinkets wires etc it added a lot of character to the avatar
i too would like to see ship paint jobs and custom skins but i want them from exploration from player led industry from the faction loyalty point stores from mission runners and sold on the market for isk so that players can involve themselves in another service industry in the eve online sandbox i do not see any valid reason for leeching gameplay content out to mtnex cash shop if you can see one then by all means make the argument but remember ccp already have a form of mt income stream through plex for isk conversion and they already allow players to pay extra money for convenience by opening new accounts for multi boxing of everything from trade to logistics to cyno alts these terms vanityconvenience are a smokescreen for removing content from the sandbox and taking things away from player industry in eve online i want customization of spaceships avatars anything else you can think of i dont want to spoil the playerled purety of the economic sandbox to get it and neither should you
jadei understand your argument and i agree with it but the argument on ccps side is that they need to monetize the game more im not sure why or how valid this is but thats what motivated the nex storeif the nex store didnt exist the clothes would have been added to the normal customization screen and players could have used them without charges custom ship paints are in between im not sure where that would fit in the gamethe in game industry has always been about manufacturing ships and modules of all sort cosmetic items could be a part of industry but its never something i expectedas long as ccp doesnt make utility for the nex store or focus entirely on the nex store and forgo the game industry then im fine with it
which was a terrible mistake that led to the fiascos of this summer and contributed to the unsub crisis the message the player base gave to ccp was that nex monetization was a step we didnt want and it doesnt answer the question i asked  why is it needed when plex for isk conversion already fulfills the need for extra income from players seeking convenience for rl cash with respect it is something you should have expected because eve online is a premium cost subscription game the hybrid model of subs  microtransactions for vanityconvenience is a bogus nickel and diming insult to the intelligence of eve gamers as long as nex exists it represents a place where non integrated content can be injected into the game at cost to the integrity of the playerled economic sandbox it needs to go
the original plan involved manufacturing clothes through some wis process and have only blueprints available for aur i agree that the current iteration is quite lacking in contenti still stand by my opinion that the nex store is not a mt shop its merely transfering one ingame item plex into an ingame currency aur into more ingame items accessories the only mt in eve is being able to buy a plex  which is freely available on the market therefore all the ingame content is available to you without having to pay anything more than the subscription fee as long as it stays this way i am fine with it
i think the problem is that even though there are ways it could be done ccp doesnt seem to know how to display restaint in its exicution to be fair this isnt just ccp other games have shown poor judgement when it comes to not selling power and ccp should not be thought of as different the fact that this is still up for discussion in eve is a sign that they still dont understand player feedback or just how bad an idea this was i dont see how it could be any clearer for that reason ccp should just avoid another disaster and skip it they have bigger problems with gamekilling supercaps and crappy alliancesov mechanics those 2 things will kill this game if not addressed in a rdical fashion
remove the nex entirely drop microstransactions entirely according to the will of the community and make all these items part of the playerproduced market like any other itemmake all clothing and hairstyles available to all races
yeah trebor please dont forget to put that crowdsourcing thread result in front of the relevant people
even if then only vanity items that people can sell on market but the plexaur exchange i wonder how much it affects pllex prices
vanity items only preferably by integrating vanity item production into existing market structures plexaurvanity bpomarket cash comes into ccp products enter market for capsuleers market competition ensues that model provides a single entry point for vanity enabling items but allows the entire player base to benefit
i liked the idea of a plex for a remapa lot of people freaked out about it but all the people that did the math and worked it out showed it didnt really make a huge difference besides you still had to sit through the skill training either way you just dont screw yourself for a year if you make a mistake even if it was limited to one per month or something like thati think its important that nothing that you can get in mt for convenience takes the place of something a player could do for you so no shipping things anywhere you want by interbus for an mt price or something like thathowever mt for a racegenderfacial structure change should be ok as well  as long as the namecorp history doesnt change
whose decision was it to rename this thread incidentallyjust because you havent heard anything about it doesnt mean you should try to preemptively run a damage control action theyve kept you in the dark before on certain issues and might be doing the same again tinfoilso changing the name of a topic that ccp doubtless chose for good reason could come across as a little disingenuousid personally like you to obtain proper clarification from ccp insofar as youre able as to whether their chosen title was actually appropriate
since the topic of microtransactions is again on the agenda it is apparently again necessary to trumpet some opinions to ccpi would think most if not all csm members would oppose microtransactions for nonvanity items in fact most eve players probably oppose microtransactions for nonvanity items a significant chunk even oppose microtransactions in any way shape or formi for one do not mind the concept of mt for vanity but this should be limited to vanity ship logos would fit that category as well and will be possible soon due to technical changes already being rolled outmt for the proverbial gold ammo or mt for convenience i can not supportif this session is about discussing possible products that could be sold within the concept of vanityonly by all means go nuts but keep in mind the current price levels in the nex store are rather ridiculous especially considering the lack of diversity it offers thusfar
ccp provided the initial name and then realized that it might be misconstrued and asked me to change the postdont worry if they suggest something we think is dumb well tell them thats dumb and heres why
im all for microtransactions in the form of vanity items but never for anything that provides convenience or a legup in any form over any other player
ideally each strand of pve should specialise in granting one type of resource to the player who puts time into it so if you want minerals mining should be your first port of call half the problem with the current economy is that missioning acts as a onestop shop which grants everything a player could ever need raw isk loyalty points modules minerals through loot melting standings  ive possibly missed one or two things off that list as wellchanging the way that loot drops work would be one step towards fixing this  if for example wrecks never contained fully intact items to be plucked and reused just wrecked salvage components that couldnt be melted down and required some manufacturing time and mineral consumption to make into operable modules that would turn the current system on its head
yeah missioning gives too many different things each task career whatever you want to call it should have its own rewards the divisions of labor need to be more distinct missioning and rattingexploration are the biggest offenders in this regardnecessity is the plea for every infringement of human freedom it is the argument of tyrants it is the creed of slaves  william pitt
i think the big issue here is how to find the right balance between the isk faucets and the isk sinks judging from the last qen of last year the biggest isk faucet happens to be bounty prizes no doubt from running missions from the looks of things the isk flowing into the economy will continue to devalue the isk over time unless a balance between the faucet and the sink is foundthankfully since the insurance payout to suicide gankers will be nerfed 100 this winter expansion the isk flowing into the economy will obviously drop however i believe that is just a minor drop in the bucket compared to the 800 lb gorilla in the room mission bounties perhaps if we can discuss this more we may find a solution together
all major isk faucets should be in null low sec and wh space high sec should be the place to use resources from whs low sec and null in refining manufacturing and marketsthat is at its core what is wrong with eves economy riskreward balance your isk sink would be built in the risk from other players when farming the faucets into the game
batch of faction cruise cost 42k lp and 42 mil isk trade in a high end lvl4 mission gives around 84k lp 3 mil isk rewards and 10 mil isk bounty if pirate rats zero for dronefaction rats if clearing all rats its a small 4 mil net isk faucet if not clear all rats or blitz its net isk sinkthis is why sanctums were nerfed but not missions doing so reduce isk sink as well as isk faucet you even run the risk of potentially making things worse by reducing sink more than faucet if the nerf end up chase mission blitzers off
wrong isk faucets in null anomalies should be greatly nerfed because of its type  pure liquid isk faucet not counterbalanced by lp shop isk sink the only kind of isk faucet that is acceptable should be highsec missionincursion isk faucet  which is properly countered by lp shop isk sink while isk faucet from insurance is minimaleve economy doesnt care about risk if anything popping ships damage eve economy by adding insurance isk faucet
theres no insurance on mods rigs and implants the insurance on t2 ships is marginal and on top of all that i wouldnt mind seeing insurance removed altogether anyway but i think your over stating its impact lp stores demand is largely fueled by things blowing up the problem is those milking that faucet missions and high sec incursions are at virtually no risk to losing stuff themselves
fixtwhy do people continue to promote the fantasy that greater risk should guarantee greater reward as if being podkilled or losing ones ship actually has any real meaning or consequence in this gamewhat is the point of having different zones if we are going to try so hard to balance payouts with socalled riskthis is a game with automagically renewing resources there are zero risks suicide gankers for instance are merely speculative investorslowsec and nullsec are supposed to be more difficult than highsec why are people trying to make them so much easier quit with the welfare requests to make up for the fact that you chose to live where you live and quit trying to pick the pockets of people who chose to not live where you live
you didnt fix anything threddrisk vs reward is the basics of gameplay if the greatest reward is to be found where there is the least risk why would players ever rationally choose anything other than the least risk other than out of sheer boredom of courseif you live in high sec doing pve you still effect the whole game the more isk you generate into the game the less everyones isk is worth including those in null low sec and wh if you want gameplay that immunizes you from other players and parts of the game the game should be immunized of all your activities perhaps thats an alternative option high sec missions and incursions only reward players with modsships that can be used in pve and no iskeve is supposed to be a sandbox ccp should stop accommodating themepark players yes thats the divide in all these debates i see on the forums it isnt between pvpers and carebears whatever that means its between sandbox players and themepark players in regards to the economy and everything else in the next meeting i want the csm to ram home to ccp with the iron fist of mittani that they need to always choose sandbox over themepark i have no desire to play space wow
short answer exactly wheres the profit to be made when anyone can buy anything within a few jumps wheres the role of the hauler when people in lonetrek can get republic fleet merchandise from an lp store within a few jumpsincreasing the logistical size of the universe will help bring back the feeling of eve being a huge place
i agree and disagree to some extent but that discussion belongs in the game balance thread kinda at least it certainly doesnt belong in the plex thread
popping ships does nothing to reduce isk in circulation it reduces the materials in circulation which in turn would lead to higher material prices except for the faucets of materials
isk faucets available in highsec come hand in hand with isk sink a nerf can potentially add net isk faucet by removing more isk sink than faucet if more mission blitzers or those who dont clear site fully are driven off than site clearers sanctums on the other hand is pure isk faucet and can be nerfed or even removed safelylosing boats add isk faucet via insuranceyoure entitled to your opinions on how risk in eve should be but dont pretend it will help the economy instead of harming itsee below
exactly and as i said there is no real risk in eve so again why keep trying to boost rewards for people who choose to spend more money and reduce rewards for people who dont based on a lifestyle choicei am certainly not asking for immunization just asking why some folks want to rob the carebears to feed the nullbears when the nullbears have exactly the same options for lifestyle choices as the carebears low and nullsec are supposed to be less profitable and riskier than highsec make the payments equal to the socalled risk in a game where death and ship destruction have zero consequences in the first place and you obviate the need for low and nullsec at all and you may as well make it all highsec and install an arenaladder system instead you chose to live there and now you want welfareccp is a business and eve costs money ccp gets to say how it goes if ccp chooses to continue to do things to alienate much of their potential player base and leave millions of isk on the table that is their choice quit parroting the same tired codswallop about wow in space eve will never be that
dont know if this count but bring qen back or something
you and goose are correct my earlier statement only applies as an isk sink for players not the economy as a whole perhaps then insurance is what needs to be adjusted adding and isk cost in manufacturing equivalent to the cost to insure the ship or removing insurance altogether a scam proof system of player funded insurance would be interesting although im not sure if many players would get any insurance under real market situationsbounties are a huge isk faucet however and i have some ideas to fix thatno more direct isk payments into a players account rather when an npc ship with a bounty is killed it drops tags which then have to be taken to an appropriate faction agent and traded for isk this combined with reinstating proper riskreward dynamics to eve would cut isk inflation significantly make blowing up ships potentially a game wide isk sink and add a real means of potentially profiting from piracypvp which is sorely lacking in eve  all dependent on whether the ship is carrying tags physical isk and whether on ship destruction they drop or get destroyedessentially make isk a physical object like gold in fantasy sandbox mmos
forcing bounty by looting will just herd players into either highsec or safe sov null tucked deep inside the blue ass of large alliances where its safe enough to do so isk cost of manufacturing equal to cost of insurance just brings massive inflation to ship prices netting to the same result as just removing insurance but forcing players to pay more out of pocketthere are safer ways to introduce isk sinks in ways that are not hugely disruptive remove lp shop tag tradein while increase isk tradein to a point far higher than base tag prices drastically increase sov bills and npc office bills entities that get them can afford it drastically increase wardec costs etctrying to add risk in order to force people to play their game a certain way introduce problems and has nothing to do with increase isk sinkdecrease isk faucet dont tie the two together
no in a game like eve everything is connected you cant look at one aspect in isolation of everything else risk and reward are very much out of balance in eve and that dynamic is very much tied in with the economic aspects of eve your fears of people fleeing to highsec or joining mega alliances with a fetish for blue already happened long ago precisely because thats the path of both greatest reward and least risk fix that and players may make different choicesyour suggestion on wardecs is backwards wardecs should be made cheap and limitless the isk sink ought to be for those wishing to avoid the risks of war not for those that embrace it at least double the tax rates of npc corps but something in the region of 4050 would be better allow player corps to pay for the same protection from wardecs by paying concord a 50 tax on all members activities that would be an effective solution that is also balanced with riskreward
the biggest hurdle to new players is that realistic pvp only starts when players have enough skills to fit and properly use t2 mods and can afford to replace their losses this is why so many get stuck in hisec they never get to experience pvp at the beginning of their eve career i dont know what the solution could be hisec pvp arenas for players under a certain skill limit possibly but something needs to be done
the new player experience is alright but it needs to be polished a bit ive created an alt and run through the tutorials for each race postincrana and there are little bugs that can really throw someone like when a skillbook is supposed to be given to them but doesnt show upthe text on some of the tutorials is a bit truncated in content as it will say you need module to do action and not elude to the fact that when you click next the tutorial will give you one this can leave the user looking in their hangar for an item they havent been given yet wondering if the tutorial is broken etca newbie gauntlet needs to be set up to satisfy a couple issuesnewbies need to know what its like to get their little newbie ship obliterated by a t2 gankfit get them used to what eve is really likein the gauntlet system remove concord keep sec status dings but make it a blood bathset the newbies clone at a station at the end of the gauntlet so if they get podded they are still done with the tutorialnewbies have to get through the gauntlet to get to the career agentsnewbie star system 10gauntlet system 00 hot drops etccareer agent sytem 0910probably to much of that scary work word for ccp to actually implement but if they are going to run a pvp centric game then they should make sure that newbies get a taste of what life is like in eve before they even get settled on anything else
that sounds maybe a little too harshwhen i think back to my first day i remember just how confused i waseve is a very different game than any other mmo out there so when someone is fresh and without past experience or tips they are absolutely lost this means that theres a ton of things to learn but it shouldnt be dumped all at once on the new player if all the information comes at once most of it will be forgottenit needs to be a gradual and fun experience i would need to ask a friend that never played eve to try the new tutorials i started playing with the one in 2010 and i dont know how improved it isone thing i really dont like is how small the text is its hard to read
npe needs to be split into several stagesaura 5mission set is excellent little improvement needed there if anyits the career agents that havent been reviewed properly a newbie player should be strongly encouraged to run the career agents after aura currently there are 5 career agents 10missions eachmilitaryindustrybusinessadvanced militaryexplorationthey are meant to be run independently except for the adv military one but in reality many of the missions in industry require you to fight npc rats same happens in the in business missions if someone chose industry before military i personally tested it finds himself struggling with combat because of lack of equipment and skillsmy suggestion is to split all areas into basic and advanced making basic a prerequisite of the advanced onesbasic military training 5run setbasic industry training 5run setbasic business training 5run setbasic exploration training 5run setbasic missions provide the most important skills and show basic concepts in each topic then after you unlocked all the basics you can selectively run the advanced coursesadvanced missions are a 15run set and are centered around providing equipment and income to the newbie this means you give more time to the player to train skills get used to modules and acquire wealthfinally geograpy is another thing that should be improved currently there are 3 starting locations for the each npc empire each school however there are also 3 sets of career agents spread out i know this was implemented that way for the dragon patch when eve china was launched but creates the possibility for a player to run 3 times each set of career agentsmy suggetion is to create a single set of career agents 4basic 4 adv place them in a specific newbie constellation for each empire and design all the missions with the idea of traveling within that constellation as part of their design players often do not grasp the concept of travel in eve in the first few days it will also help the gms to police and help newbies in those 4 specific locations across the servercurrently we also have the newbie epicarc bloodstained stars and excellent set of missions to earn isk and which sort of explain the current sleeper threat along the geopolitical composition of the galaxy as fiction and basis of the rpg aspects of the game however this arc should be suggested to the player once he has completed all the basic courses and not before currently the epic arc is mentioned to the player after completing the aura missions and more often than not the new players struggle againsts some of the npc rats in the missions or lack the proper ships to complete them at least i did if bypassed all the career agentsdata centers and circle agents not sure if these still exist should be mentioned to the newbie player as a mean to create contacts with the goverment institutions on each empirethat way the grinding of standings at the beginning is not so boring data centers themselves should have some of the tag requirements adjusted a bit tooif all these aspects of the game which already exist are properly tackled into the npe framework as a single path for the new player provide fun isk and tools to break throught the difficulties of starting i am sure you will find a much better retention rate for trials
tutorials are boring and unfit for purposelook at normal games on the market you have a tutorial or single player campaign that teaches you how to play and prepares you for multiplayer eve tutorials may show you the different things you can do but it does not teach you how to do them and pve does not prepare you for pvp
nexstore clothing is mostly ghastly and miles away from the oldstyle that most players grew up with which brings me to thisthe recent competitions which eventually resulted in the new tier 3 bcs highlighted just how good some of the players out there are with 3d packages and given that as far as i understand from dev interviews current design is outsourced why doesnt ccp release a design document for players ie file format polycounts etc and see what the playerbase can come up with
this is the best idea all day i mean seriously if art is part of the problem then by god ill step up and create it myself if i have to some may laugh but i do have a degree in computer modeling and animation from aip
i would like crisp new effects for explosions and guns detonationi saw this video a few weeks ago
the csm or at least part of it has done a good job at reporting to the players this term two step trebor and seleene in particular come to mind
i think the csm did a good job it didnt feel like there was any bias towards a certain part of the game in the arguments i just hope the next csm will take into consideration all parts of the game in the future as well i would hate to see null sec get all the income and wormholes and low sec missout despite being equally as dangerous
keep the csm but give users an easily visible bright red vote on eve related issues button right next to where their character selection is let the players decide at the screen if they want to be involved where the game goes instead of having to hear about second or third hand or worse yet stumbling onto the forums to find out about itpeople dont need the stuff forced on them but they need the option to do so clearly in front of them specifically so they know that they have that option in the first placemore player interaction directly with ccp at a level that provides ccp with raw data to work with instead of having to pay someone to read through the endless repeating threads on the forumsless csm manipulation
seems to be working better than it ever has since ive been following eve granted its dominated by people from null sec alliances but id rather have them representing me than someone voted in by players that are forced to vote if players cant take the time to inform themselves and vote well id rather they had no say at all tbh
i trust you will strongly resist any proposals for reserved seats for specific socalled consituencies special treatment is not a way to improve the credibility of a democratic process
yes if there is one thing that will increase the effectiveness of the csm its ensuring that only those people who have to spend half their term getting used to the way ccp works can be elected we should definitely toss that experience into the dumper and ensure that only inexperienced csms represent us this is not at all a backdoor proposal to get rid of csms you dont like even though they got lots of votes because youre afraid that the csms you do like wont get as many
of that the bots would vote for whoever the bot script writer wants them to
i for one will resist them because its impossible to properly implement it and in any case very few players stay in one particular niche for their entire eve careerswrt to focusing on one area to the exclusion of others right now the focus is on fixing basic stuff that broadly affects a lot of people getting ccp to implement dead horse poss for example is something that helps everyone improving industry and mining makes hisec more interesting and nullsec more valuable  and worth fighting over and so on and so onpeople in the csm might disagree over whether iterating nullsec sov or fw or lowsec is the highest priority but these are disagreements at the margins and if a sharpeyed dev at ccp comes up with or notices on the forums a lowcost way to iterate an existing game feature like fw or bounties we are certainly going to get behind that even if it doesnt directly affect an area of the game we hold near and dear  because the bang for the buck will be too good to ignore
csm shouldnt have monopoly mostly for csm
as far as changes for the csm is concerned i found myself agreeing with what the mittani posted in his chairmans thread
agreed except that the trade is done directly through ingame market and you can easily decide when you want to apply the game time you have bought seller can still set the price move the plex around in new eden or take it out from market he can even contract it or make an auction in local only difference is that once it changes account it stays on account where it went this doesnt limit free trade it just changes the item from piece of paper to non refundable game time or service if that makes it easier to understandagain you can not create this game time inside new eden any unnecessary trading with such item can not be good for the sand box economyunrelevant argument youre confusing affordability subscription funding methods and pilots personal wealth to discussion about binding game time to account on purchase that is also called derailing the actual issue
youre confusing plex with game time thats the actual issueplex are a tradable commodity just like scourge missiles game time is not tradable once its applied to your account you cant sell it to someone else for isk plex can be used to impact the game just like scourge missiles can be used to impact the game
why is market manipulation a concern
that is exactly my point how can service in this case game time be an item what you can use to impact sand box game the goal of plex is to give someone possibility to pay someone elses game time and gain in game currency in the trade there is really no need to add any more variables to the equationif you want play more complex market games there is plenty of real in game items availableonly direct supply and demand should apply to plex price and that happens if there is no investors in the equation
no the goal of plex is to allow the playerdriven market to determine an isk price for the realworld value embodied in this virtual commodity that realworld value is approx UFFFD17 not 30 days of game timewhy should plex only be tradable from initial purchaser to immediate user
 because people make profit by trading with service an imaginary item which can not be generated in game but what some individuals still need to stay online because plex can not be generated in game normal ingame supply and demand rules do not ap
if i mission for 3 years straight and save up all my iskisnt it my right to do with it what i pleaseif i want to buy 100 plex and hold onto them  thats my choice  not yoursi earned that isk like you did and how i spend my time with my isk is nobody elses choice but mineif you are complaining that its not as cheap to play for free becaues your plex is now more expensive is your problem and your tears
plex is an item just like any other item in eve ccp has made it very clear back when they made them transportable and destructible the only difference from veldspar or scourge missiles is the way in which it enters the game after a plex is redeemed it is mechanically indistinguishable from any other item in that regard it is no different from say a primaei liked the part where you provided proof or at least reasons for believing so
in the end i feel like it all balances out plex is not the only way of playing eve and this means people who cant afford the isk can always pay with real money if theyre unable to do either they should consider their position carefullyive been pondering the issue of the plex for a while now especially in relation to bot users i was wondering if ccp had an financial interest in keeping bots instead of banning them outright  its an argument that appears often in bot discussions it sounds a lot like a conspiration theory and it probably is but anyhow it has some valid argument bots are accounts if ccp bans those thousands of accounts then they must necessary lose money not necessarily bots are meant to create in game resources without effort they easily create enough resources to pay for plex and then much more i have the feeling that most bots use plexnow the catch is losing a plex account does not mean that ccp loses money ccp makes the money when the plex is bought from a player with real money it does not matter what happens with that plex afterwards it could be gifted to someone else or stacked neatly for no purpose ccp already made the money so ccp wouldnt directly lose money from banning botshowever they would likely feel a smaller impact indirectly having less plex user on the market means the price of the plex goes down which means that people who would have otherwise paid money for their account switch to plex it also might get people to buy a second account with plexthis was all about bots but the logic applies to anyone that runs the game for freethe plex market mostly affects free accounts those accounts dont bring any money to ccp but they might be friends corp mates or botsmy solution ban bots to free up plex
econ blog nex blog and dev forum comment regarding concerns of unused plex buildup no i cannot be bothered to find links for your convenience google it yourself
you may still buy 100 plex and hold onto them in the form of added gametime on your account you simple lose the ability to throw out those 100 plex at a later time which would be a problem for ccp wild fluctuations  players quit game when its high then potentially crash later its in ccps interest to keep plex stable the thing rose by 100 mil the past week then dropped 50 mil in the past 3 days
nothing to do with several good reasons that caused a spike in demand i am sure
whyi would suggest that it is in ccps interest to keep plex sales high higher prices will lead to more sales remember gtc and plex are about legitimate rmt that they provide game time as a side effect is almost irrelevant to this discussion a lot of people have been using plex to pay for their accounts and seem to have developed a sense of entitlement they expect plex to remain at a price that is suitable for them rather than the sellerits interesting to note that most of the people i know who sell plex insist on selling to buy orders most of the people i know who buy plex insist on buying from sell orders these people are so impatient that theyve gone and turned the market upsidedownif you want decently priced plex to keep your account active post buy orders below the current orders theyll be filled dont buy from sell orders UFFFD doing so will only inflate the price of plex further
ding ding we have a winner bobthe mystery isnt why plex prices have risen to 500m the mystery is why they didnt do so long agoa trillion isk can buy something over 2000 plexthe amount of isk in eve increases by multiple trillions every month
it is quite hilarious how the discussion always goes towards cant afford the isk  prices rise  should consider subbing even the actual reasoning has nothing to do with the current plex price level it has somewhat to do with questioning is the current plex price level reflecting the true value of it or has it been manipulated by investors personally i would not have any problem buying my game time with 1 billion iskmonth however ive made personal calculations and come to conclusion that paying over 400m from plex is turning myself to tool so i rather pay with credit card and have no problem with that eitherhowever i still feel that plex is not actual in game item what should be used for market games it is nothing like scourge missile or primae as someone referred earlier because you can not control the supply in gameplex should bound to account when it changes ownership from account x to account y it is a service  game time  thing what appears from thin air you should not be able to make trade profit by investing to thin air when you buy game time you should commit to use it in some point it is that simple
hohif price is acceptable for both the seller and buyer than the sale is made you cant force the seller to sell plex for cheaper  if he thinks the prices is too low he just wont sell itbtw high prices doesnt mean more plexes are sold  if somebody wants to by a supercapital from plexes he needs to sell less plexes if the plex price increase relative to supercapoh and plex traders  plex doesnt worth to be trade on daily  just in longer term imho  the buysell difference is too low for thatand i would still like to be able to buy plexes with my trade toon in jita so he can contract it up to my other accounts when i need them so no dumb  if you buy plex it goes to your account page bullshit why should i made 1 char for every account to buy plex for that account  especially as some account doesnt have free char slots as those are used for scout and cyno or elsebtw if you think plex price is too high go buy gtc and convert it to plex nobody forces you to buy plexwhen you buy game time you should commit to use it in some point it is that simple yeah but not on the same accountstill i cant see whats the problem with market manipulators  just look at the magnitude plexes worth in daily change it is hugeif you join too you get yourself a cut too  lower income for manipulators  if enough ppl join  it can backfire for the manipulators as the demand is artifical and later demand wont be able to buy the stockpiled up gtcs at higher pricesjust look at some cheap ships or items somebody thought it is wise to buy them off the market and realized they wont be able to sell them at all maybe hounds on this week if i recall corretly so they eighter have to lower prices back to where they bought or they will have a useless stockplie for a long time
when you buy a plex youre are buying an ingame item you should make no further commitment than paying the price the seller demands its that simpley once its yours it yours and you should be free to do as you wish with itflat assertions of my opinion as if it was fact are awesome tyvm for introducing me to this fantastic concept
if this were true ccp would peg the plex price at 1 isk and make 225 billion every time someone wants to use gtc to buy a supercarrier eve would have millions maybe billions of subscribed accounts all subbed up to the end of the century and beyondmy god  youre some kind of economic genius someone get hilmar to read this thread naomi has just saved ccp with her insight
all the people in favour of linking plex to an account keep comfortably forgetting that somebody is spending real money to buy a gtc to convert to plex and they invested real time in that working for the man tooand it is in those peoples best interest that plex is in fact expensive since it creates a better real money  isk conversion rate for them like somebody mentioned earlier being able to play for free via plex is a perk of eve not a right eve is ultimately a p2p pay 2 play game
yeah sure case anybody would buy plex worth 1 isk for real money ofcourse there are limitations on how low the price would result the most sold plexesif that is lower than the current prices i cant tell  but ccp should be able to to some extend as they have or should have the data to backup their decisionsdont act as a stupid moron pls
well if youre going to imply that the supply of plex is inelastic with price you should maybe reconsider whether youre the one who gets to ask other people not to be idiotsso the real question is what is the equilibrium price at which the most plex are created ill assume that this is the right price as it allows the most number of people to play for free and makes ccp the most money and its ipso facto the best price for the people who pay the money to create them as well in terms of how much money theyre willing to payif the isk price is low then people have to buy more plex to buy a specific item but theyre less likely to do soif the isk price is high then people have to buy fewer plex to afford their aeon or whatever but theyre more likely to do soi know that i personally was watching the plex price rise with interest and i in fact made a decision that if they hit 600m i would work a day of overtime and make some plex to sell for enough isk that i wouldnt have to pve for a year or so i had no specific purchase in mindunless ccp tell us how many plex are being created then any attempt to say that the plex price is too high or too low is at the end of the day just based on personal perspective and undiluted guessing this might be an interesting question for the csm to put to ccp
so youre mad other people are making moneythis is just flat out wrong the supply is people wanting to turn real money into isk and the demand is people wanting to play for free the final isk price is a function of the two oh so now it does follow supply and demand i know its cool to hate on investment bankers right now but its not like you have any barrier for entry for plex investment just buy somedespite high plex prices people are still buying them so either they were underpriced before or we have an inflation problem neither of which have anything to do with a plex trading market either way if 100m is the difference between you being able to afford your gametime this month or not then you should consider just getting a real life job instead at 500m a plex is at least 5 hours of incursions with a good group not to mention the 5001000 initial investment how many hours of minimum wage work would it take to just pay with money im guessing less than 5
so you write the same thing as i wrote thats somethingit is all up to ccp  so i dont even understand why there is such a topic as this  as it has no real reason other than some ppl wants lower plex prices somehow
everyone of you seem to be unable to distinguish the difference between high and unstable high is when plex price climb sturdily as it did for years unstable is when plex rose by 100 mil in a week then fell by 50 mil in 3 days which is what happened recently the spikes prompt people to leave the dips put a dampener on plex purchases wild fluctuations is never a good thing for the economy what makes it unacceptable for plex is that wild fluctuations in subscription prices translates directly to fluctuations in subscription base
perhaps you should learn to understand what youre reading before trying to throw any answers
umadbro
those who believe that binding is bad idea only because it would prevent using 1 jitaalt to obtain game time for several accounts could be rounded by setting for example 24h timer to plex before it binds to account after it has changed owner 1st time during this period you could still contract or trade that plex forward but you could not put it back to market that way you could still buy and contract your plex forward but playing market games would be done deali dont understand what is the reason to be so negative about this you guys commit to game time when you buy for example 3 month subscription why should it be different in the game only the currency is different brand
no its pretty clear you think plex are too expensive and the evil soulless market players are to blame
is ithow interesting care to share the facts behind this assumption
see belowthe fact that it dropped by 50 mil in 3 days actually does more damage than it rising 100 mil a week prior it has everything to do with fluctuations and nothing to do with actual price subscription price must remain stable too high or low is a matter of opinion
this is a game and that means all of it is 100 thin air all of iteve existed before plex plex is a eula friendly form of rmt no one is being forced to buy or sell themccp gets their pound of flesh from their players as every month is still paid for with real money they just get a lot more prepaid time is allin game supply is easily controlled dont buy them in game or outpeople could be paying a lot less for concerts and sporting events if they would just be patient and stop buying those things for a while and let the price come downfact is despite all the crying to rob the carebears to feed the nullbears there is a ton of isk floating around just look at plex prices
dust has a lot of potential it could be used to infiltrate and sabotage space structuresi hear the complain now and then that shooting space structures for hours is boring it could be an interesting alternative to have dust players be able to reinforce a pos through their shootie gunny thing granted it shouldnt be easy this could probably apply to pocosmaybe in the future they can commandeer things that would be nicealso another fun ability of dust player would be to steal cargo say a player if creating high tier goods on a planet you send a team they manage to reach the cargo and bring it back to their base the cargo now belongs to them players should be able to defend from that
hey i had an idea where players are able to skill into flying fighters  bombersof cause the skills required will be tricky but will give people who develop their drone skills only to be used with a carrier for something other than logging on in lowsec  nulsec only when they are neededthe idea i had was for fighters  bombers to be flown from the cockpit like a fpsfirst person shooter with profit modules and attributes exact to that of a the original drones but of cause their will be limitation like the following1 they have no jump drive which means they cannot be jumped through highsec systems2 warp drive will run from the capacitor limiting how often it can warp3 must be able to dock  undock from a station4 if you do enter a modified fighter  bomber you will not enter a pod if you are blown up making it high risk5 you cannot at any point repackage a modified fighter  bomber which will mean that drone is limited to the system you chose to assemble unless you have a large enough cargo to transport it and that we can not assembled ships on our own it will force the use and risk of contracts6 manual fighter  bomber special ability would be to drop at of warp at any timei am sure there are more things to limit but i cant think of any right nowthe only other thing would be to some day if this was included into eve is to go further and allow special orders from a carrier as well as the ability to come and go from its drone hold
i concur i feel like it would benefit the game to have medium fleets in the hundred be the optimal way of fightingi think that problem can be controlled naturally with gameplay feature like the bomber bombers are able to dispatch large fleets which makes large fleet dangerousit benefits ccp to promote smaller fleet since they wont cause as much lag either if larger fleet are always better than people will tend toward larger alliances and larger fleet battle that will continuously put more strain on the serverim not familiar with the null sec and sov mecanics but theres definitely a lot of potential capture the flag could be interesting  it would remove the shooting structure from capturing sov in a system but it would still need to be long process a day or two to prevent sovereignty from bouncing every few hoursperhaps if sovereignty could be captured by maintaining an active  not afk in a pos cloaked or whatnot enemy presence in the system enemy structures could increase the difficulty of capturing the system by raising the time required to capture or by increasing the required number of foe in the system to capture it this would make destroying structure valuable but not necessarythe sov holders would need to defend by removing the enemy presence from the system promoting fights and then they could raise their sovereignty capture bar by leaving players there this would force the sov holder to split their force if they are attacked on multiple fronts it would make holding large area of null sec difficultthis means a null sec that has more smaller holders  thus more small fights anyway just a plan
structures for sov needs to be overhauledsov needs to be more focused and power projection minimized also theres a current issue where every other system has sov with pockets unclaimed projection pushes those as claimed even on the ingame mapthis allows an allaince to essentially influence twice the territory than they are paying for sov should require benchmarks to mantain and hold it and to have x systems y conditions must be met regarding other currently held systems
id go further and say that it should be possible to set ones castle up in way that makes storming it headon equals mass suicide or in other words an entity that specializes in smaller scale conflict should be able to smash a stampeding herd of cattle when on their own turf yes i want to reenact the movie 300 in eve   traeb and co you might want to dig up the threads on the subject that were redhot with activity just prior to the forum switch if i remember correctly sov was one of the questions ccp asked feedback on
hi i would like the developer team to address the issue of low insurance payouts for pilots flying hulks the price of hulks are steep as compared to the payouts should simething be done to address this i would not want to spend almost 200 million isks on a hulk have it blown up again by some good in empire space and then get a paltry return on insurance something has to be done on this or else mining in hulks will be extinct soon for your information should something be done with this hulkageddon or somethingsigh
something should indeed be done with hulkageddonit is this during hulkageddon dont fly a hulkif there is a widespread public holiday and celebration dedicated to murdering the ships you happen to fly itd be wise to not fly that ship during said holiday or not mine at all really but if you must mine do so in a cruiser or battleship instead of a vulnerable mining barge or expensive exhumerif despite all else you insist on flying your vulnerable hulk during hulkageddon despite obviously being aware of it in advance then you are clearly asking for trouble and richly deserve any you findthat said the other good thing to be doing with hulkageddon is stockpiling gank ships as theyll sell well during the event for that matter depending on how rich you are you might even stockpile hulks theyll be even more expensive during and shortly after hulkageddon once all the people who got ganked rush to buy a replacement possibly with plex the fools
tell them theyre on the right road but that they have to tread very very carefully to avoid more drama in future
crucible is a step in the right direction the next two or three expansions will be critical there are various issues harming the eve environment that have been allowed to take root over years and have never been tackled because ccp has been distracted by other projects we could all reel off the list we all know what they are and weve all waited in vain for years hoping something might finally be done about them ccps priorities for the forseeable future need to be using the next few expansion cycles to examine every aspect of eve to see where improvements can be made and tackling them head on every time bringing in more of the thousand little things and a couple of really big things as well
trebor could you throw us a bone here you might as well say chicken curry discusswhat is this session trebor is it a meeting with the man is it a discussion about the csms relationship with the guy what maybe once we know youll get a discussion
this is i think the usual sitdown csm has with hilmar csm has at the end of summits that is at least what i remember from previous csm minutes
yepif you feel there is a message you would like us to convey to hilmar do let us know im sure wed be happy to oblige
corp a is a 100strong pvp corp with median of 50m sp they can fly most t2t3 cruisers very well they have an established industry alt corp providing them with near limitless isk they play for about 5 hours day and most of that is flying ships in pvp combatcorp b is a 20strong industrial corp with median of 10m sp they mine in ospreys and retrievers one of the corp is training to fly an orca they play for about 2 hours a day a few more on the weekend most of their time is spent mining UFFFD shooting the breeze they occasionally get their rvb alts out where they will fly a few rifters into combat during their weekly 3 hour pvp ophow is it in any way fun for corp b to be perpetually wardecced by corp a do you believe that a simple fixedcost unavoidable wardec system will not immediately to a plethora of corps griefing other players out of the game do you even understand the circumstances that lead to concord being introduced and wardecs having escalating costs based on number of decs active

at last fanfest ccp talked about having dynamic agents basically the more an agent is used the less reward it gives this would be idea for distributing the population more evenly in highsec and give people an incentive to vary their playstyle they might discover something that they didnt know beforeanother interesting dynamic system that was discussed last week in feature and idea was dynamic security system it would be interesting to see high sec vary from 05 to 10 lowsec vary from 05 to 01 and nullsec go up and down depending on the system activitysame as the mission it would get people moving around a system that is good one month might not be as interesting once it devaluestheres a juggernaut in the room that should be toned down though incursions they were difficult at first but now theyre a run in the park its nice to have high end pve content for those that like to do that but it should not be the ultimate way of earning isk  and it should not be risk free the economy of eve is a delicate thing it depends on ship being destroyed to drain the resources incursions at the moment destabilize the economy
youre missing the point it doesnt matter if it destroys eve completely they are only interested in griefingif eve gets shut down they will move to the next game and continue its not the game that matters its the tears
wardecs revert back to preprivateer wardec nerf if some corp like orphanage for instance wants to be at war with every player corp they should be able to do so and isk shouldnt be a barrier in terms of declaring if you want to avoid such interaction with other players you should stay in an npc corp perhaps an option could be put in for a player corp to to gain immunity from wardecs by signing up with concord but at a price of 2025  tax on all membersgates i agree with the poster above would be nice if they were gone but it isnt realistic however it should be made harder to camp the jump in side of the gate the blind side looking into possibly increasing the the range from the gate when a ship jumps into a system like 10 times or more what it is now local local chatintel still hasnt been addressed ccp needs to come up with a replacement that isnt 100 foolproof intel and apply it to nullsec and perhaps lowsec as wellincursions the implantation of this makes me want to vomit its broken the risk reward balance of eve and its an affront to players that care about the lore or rp pirates especially the sansha  people blowing up sansha shouldnt be rewarded with sansha ships nerfed concord ships would seem more appropriate players should be able to side with the sansha and fight against players doing incursions without the interference of concord now if the wardecs were fixed players could sort this out themselves in true sandbox fashion what we have is groups like skunkworks trying every loop hole to fight these people and rather than ccp doing something to allow that like fixing wardecs theyre fixing the loop holes making it even worse a situation with incursions off grid near unprobable gang link alts reminds me of buff bots in daoc i hope it doesnt take ccp as long to fix it possible solutions must be on grid or eccm cant be fitted on these ships and doesnt work in a pos shieldcyno hot drops should be a mod that blocks a ship from lighting a cyno maybe something common in use but short range like a scramdisruptoranyway theres lots of broken assbackwards stuff in eve but thats enough to chew on for now
were still saying that
fair enough necessity is the plea for every infringement of human freedom it is the argument of tyrants it is the creed of slaves  william pitt
npc corps need looking at i think there should be additional consequences not necessarily negative consequences please note for being a member of a npc corp eg only members of a npc corp get access to particular missions for their corp members of an npc corp gain standings faster with their corp vs other players and vice versa competing npc corps challenge each other through player actions  missions maybe even occasional wars where players for competing corps can start attacking each other for a limited time period to help their chosen corporation achieve an objective for examplejust a few ideas but essentially npc corps need to become more dynamic as well as introducing more player consequences for being a member

nullparrot muchbraaawk lets steal money from the people who chose to live a quieter less dissipative lifestyle and give it to the people who spend ships like addicts smoke crackwelfare for nullbearsthere is zero risk in eve death and ship loss are extremely temporary setbacks at worstlow and nullsec are lifestyle choices and supposed to be hardscrabble riskier and less profitable than highsec make the payments equal to the socalled risk in a game where death and ship destruction have zero consequences and you obviate the need for low and nullsec in the first place and you may as well make it all highsec and install an arenaladder system insteadburn through fewer ships and you wont need so much money resources automagically renew in this game remember you are basically asking for government bailout money to support your poorshady business practices get your tree fiddy from your friends and quit begging ccp to take it from people with better smarter business practices than youheres a cookie
im not a nullsec toon and im certainly not a carebear look at my sec status although i must admit i do run complexes regularly this game is still not supposed to be risk free if you want to earn large amounts of money the more dangerous areas should be the best places for it without risk pve is just a boring grind and lownull are completely pointless areasyou are the one asking for welfare you wish for the highest iskhour but do not want to work for it nor risk your ships for you there is no concern about what pops up on directional no scouting no checking local and for all intents and purposes no skill
it should never be possible to build something refine it down and wind up with the same minerals used to build it there should be at least a 25 loss
ill tryi think personally they need to remove loot from missions or make it nonreprocessable anyways miners dont have a job anywhere anymore not in high not in low not in 00another think is what to do with the drone lands they give minerals hurting minersi think there needs to be a change to drone bpo in to a data library or name them other ways like how sleeper loot is sold to npcs of course there is a problem as to how a corp can receive taxes from those libraries probably by addressing if some corp member sells his library to an npc his corp will get a sales tax on the itemactually the same problem is with miners that corps dont get any tax from them at all the only ones who support corps are mission runners and ratters and its not even close fear

sighsame lack of understanding of human nature same mindless parroting same selfentitled whining the same tired we have to work harder for our money therefore we should make more money than carebears carebears are just lazyoh please this is a game no one does any actual risky work here there is zero risk in eve all eve is is a series of speculative investments suicide ganking included death and ship loss are basically meaningless you arent special because you choose to live a lownullsec lifestyle and therefore are not entitled to better payouts its that simple low and nullsec should be harder than highsec highsec should be easier than lownullsec otherwise why have them nullbears and nullparrots are quick to point out that this is a sandbox game and should be more reflective of dark gritty reality at least when it suits themheres some dark gritty realitygames like eve cant accommodate the reality of a lone gunner with little skill being able to ambush and neutralize people and other assets with a crew served weapon for instancein reality the military and police are much more effective than they are in eve excepting concord of coursein reality many of the things that eve players do would get them and their dna imprisoned or hunted down and permanently terminated neither of which can be accommodated by this sort of game scaling fines would make fine isk sinks though and i am not sure why they have not been implemented perhaps it is because the player segment that would have the most fines would have the least money to pay them overall because of their crackship habit in reality many more people enjoy reading about lowsec and nullsec than actually want to live there true storyin reality most humans seek the greatest reward for the least risk because that is part of our survival mechanism not the other way around greater risk with greater payout is no longer greater risk now is it not in a game where resources automagically renew and death and ship loss are merely setbacks of time the game curve already guarantees a payout much better than the casino of your choicein reality there are far more carebears than nullbears because humans as a group like to feel more safe rather than lessthere is much to be gained by awareness and tactical and strategic acumen but skill points can wash all of that away other things being relatively equal like other games there are some rockpaperscissors aspects to eve but its still pretty simplified and i hardly think basic tactical awareness scouting and checking local constitutes skill rather than good play and simple sense in any event taking money out of carebear pockets to put in nullbear pockets wont make them work any betteri have never asked for anything to be taken from nullsec to give to highsec and i have never asked for anything to be outright given to highsec all i have said is to stop trying to use illogical emotionally based reasons like the ones you gave above to make game changes especially ones that involve taking from one group and giving to another based almost entirely on the emotional premise that they dont deserve it and we do because we think they are lazywe feel special and therefore entitled if any conversation screams to most make eve like wow in space its the idea that because life gets harder the further you move from empire space that the further you move away from empire the more money you are entitled to and the closer in you are the less money you are entitled to in complete defiance of realitymake the nullbears happy at the expense of the carebears because in reality the nullbears arent that hardcore and really want a lifestyle more like the carebears they talk trash aboutwelfare for nullbears theres your wow in space
i think youre either trolling or playing the wrong game m8this game according to ccp has been about risk v rewardmore risk more rewardless risk less rewardits why abc ore isnt in hisecits why ice isnt in 10its why rat bounties in null are 900k compares to 15k in a 07its why level 5 missions are not in hisecits why incursions pay 100 in lownull as opposed to 80 in hisecno genius it isnt about taking away what you have in your precious little bubble of safety its that you pay the price for being a coward and that is in less of a rewardto be honest if the hisec fountian keeps increasing while null is ignored eventually highsec players will find their lives much more difficult
what you say is absolutely true theres no question about thattheres also no question that eve opened almost a year and a half before wow and recently celebrated 350k subsi think the numbers speak for themselves do they not its not like people talk that much about eves allegedly steep learning curve eve is complex yes but it is not complicatedmy position is still to cut the attitude about carebears vs nullbears and look more towards gaining and retaining more players in every tier as that by itself will create a richer environment for interaction for everyone and of course a more target rich environment instead of kowtowing to the droogs which is much of what ccp seems to have done over the yearseve is still unique in many ways if ccps aim was to sacrifice new customer business and current customer retention in order to create a game that was more about allowing people to entertain themselves at other peoples expense rather than create an experience that was collaboratively enjoyable for as many players as possible then i think they succeeded admirably and i think the subscription numbers reflect thatps i am happy for you that you managed the word genius tomorrow you can move on to four syllables heres a cookiepps did you really call me a coward in a video game what are you twelveppps in a game that has zero consequences other than time spent to recover pppps lets all sing i wanna be a nullbear ranger livin a life of virtual danger sound off
semantics risking your ship for more isk is risk it makes the game considerably more fun and is the basis of eve easier and less profitable by your logic maybe they should make the more profitable missions easierpeople seek it but once its found it is not as fun giving people everything they desire straight away is not the best way to go about creating a fun gameits like playing gta with all the cheats enabled sure you kill a lot of stuff and you have all the best weapons straight away but it gets really boring really really fast
ccps stance on botting goes back to hilmars infamous statement earlier this year players are watching what ccp does not what they say judging by threads on this forum ccp is saying a lot and doing nothing about bots thus it is a waste of csm time to even bring it up half of you stand accused of being mass botters yourselves if various comments are to be believed
publishing the number of accounts banned temporarily and permanently for botting every say quarter would surely improve trust in ccps measures theres no need to publish any details about the accounts or the detection methods just a pair of numbers
the smartphone authenticator is to improve security against account theft nothing to do with the botting topic obviously
keychain authenticators would be a good step in the right direction tho a bit outdated and with the drawback of having to add yet another dangly bit to your keychain maybe still good if there are still a lot of ppl lacking smartphones  a smartphone authenticator app wouldnt take long to write  heck they could even charge money for it  and even enhance the thing over time with some nice functions like displaying evemail  alert notifications or even some evemon type functionality
for me its simple ban bots and and dudes that sell isk for  amnesty for those that buy isk but if they will be doing it ban
an update on the keychain authenticator devices would be very good but im pretty sure this topic will come upwhile i realise there are a great deal of limitations on what can be discussed in terms of detection methods measures taken etc in regards to botting and rmt some more snippets of information would really help as it stands now from the moment you press a report bot button on raven navy issue user thuwgzkznw who is in thuwgzkznw corp as its only member it is unclear what happens next any feedback on this however small is goodyou may also log on to eve during this session land a brutix on a mackinaw
hmm well if that was to happen you would have to be making the fleet command ships adopt the tier ii hulls as opposed to the field command ships thus you would haveamarr damnation  harbinger hull a black habiminmater claymore  hurricane hull pale camo with blue lightinggallente eos  myrmidon hull dark green and grey myrmcaldari vulture  drake hull tehno camoamarr absolution  prophecy hull as normalminmater sleipnir  cyclone hull as normalgallente astarte  brutix hull as normalcaldari nighthawk  ferox hull as normali would not be opposed to this either im just biased as i tend to fly field command shipshmm now to decide it i should photoshop those up as well
would be neat but should be done as part of a broader rebalancing of cs as a whole
to all interested pilotsany questions and suggestions welcomed
i would love to see contract not contact information in evegate new contracts available to me or contracts issued by me being acceptedcompleted the info is already in the api why not provide an userfriendly interface toofix whatever is messing up uris with the percent signs in them on the forumsyea i know people are gonna btch about this one skill queueing via evegate
i have a hard time finding my own threads  thats my only complaint with the forums otherwise it all works decently
i know its been requested before but can we get a csm tag on the forum listings like the dev and gm ones
so many long posts that i forget to copy before posting only to have the page refresh instead of post with all content goneno error nothing they should have just licensed an established forum software and worked from there
industrial oblitoratorthanks for making an effort to engage au tz players in an event where we can participate without having to set an alarm clocki do have a few questions thoughdo you have a more detailed planhave you responded to ccp with what you exactly want from themhave you got some people to help you organise this event
mate i am working as fast as i can to get this event off the groundi am working with rd from netgame radioatm it is just the two of usi am sure as we move forward we may need more hands on deckbut if ya help cant enter the comp as it may be a conflict of interestbut any assistance would be greati will have a meeting this weekend to nut out some more detailswith that i will respond to ccpi really hope the autz eve community gets onboardi hope that answers all your questionsit may end up being post the anzac day roam next year at the pace we are going but it will happenso stay tuned and spread the wordindy0
pew pew pews wiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
mutual wardecs have their reasons im glad they fixed it so mutual wardecs no longer contributed to a rise in price of incoming wardec prices but theres still a lot left to be fixed
should just make wardecs a set price irrespective of how many wars either corpalliance has removing the limitations on number of active wars then it doesnt matter if people jumpswitch corps theres no such thing as a decshield and players still have the option individually of avoiding a war by joining an npc corp for which they are rightly charged a tax as a consequence
i for one really love this idea  would raise the immersion factor immensely and give the defenders something to fight for rather than just removing all bpos and supplies from their pos and docking up for the duration of the wardec
1 give greater rewards for pvp combat ie more lp when you kill someone in the opposing faction2 give lp rewards for taking over opposing factions complexes 30k lp divided between fleet members3 stop opposing faction members from docking in your stations
all i have to say is that im extremely disappointed that for all the feedback players have been working on for years now providing volumes of discussion about improvement that once again we are a brief oneword mention in a thread involving wormholesweve worked tremendously hard and written volumes about what wed like to see condensed those volumes into lists linked to them referenced again explained in even more volume more lists more links and still today both ccp and now the csm are asking us to explain ourselves one more timeasking us to list all these things over again in the body of a thread like this is insulting since apparently this is an agenda proposed by ccp for discussion can the csm at least acknowledge that theyve read the list of small fixes commonly agreed upon by the players and make a point of sharing this with ccp i know that no current csm member is a participant in faction warfare but that doesnt mean that it isnt part of ccps vision hilmar said he wanted to see this fixed himself or part of the player bases vision faction warfare has nothing to do with wormholes why the two are included in the same topic list is beyond me this is probably the most disheartening turn of events in the history of this movement to see iterations on fw were finally getting momentum from ccp on development yet here we are a single word in the title of a thread followed by a list of fixes to wormholes leaving the players to once again beg and plead for even a simple acknowledgment that the list weve compiled will be reviewed and offered to ccp by the csm during discussionsedit  the csm has indeed responded and been receptive to the list of fixes ive sent them and have committed to making sure they are posted on the internal csm  ccp forums for debate and possible resolution
hansthe reason why faction warfare and wormholes are tackled together is because theyre both activities with a minority of players in them what percentage of eve participates in wormholes and faction warfare 5 maybe
this is a direct result of years of neglect like this we were not always a minority activity its become that way because the fans have mostly given up because theyve shared their feedback time and time again only to be ignoredcurrently statistics on fw participation have very very little to do with how many players wish faction warfare were given attention if the csm were to take the time to read the feedback they would see that fixing faction warfare has farreaching benefits to the eve playerbase at large  increased fw activity provides a healthy role play environment an abundance of smallgang warfare that players across the board have begged for economic incentive to live in lowsec and a food source for piracy a classic pillar of eve gameplay its not just about fw its about all the other areas of gameplay fw stands to improve should its basic mechanics be fixed my ongoing fight has been and continues to be not just for the diehard vets that still participate but for all the frustrated pilots that have walked away moved elsewhere or even left the game because of treatment just like this its also for every pilot that has ever said i wish there was more small gang pvp or 1 vs 1 fights are dead or lowsec is worthless and boringccp said theyd include fw in a list of fixes  than failed to elaborate this hurt the community deeply and prompted a great deal of feedback that came from many people fw participants and nonparticipants alike
i know since i didnt say something like my personal list it is easy to see how you could have misunderstood that list as the definitive csm list look im terribly sorry that you feel that everyone is ignoring fw but i hate to break it to you most of eve is ignoring fw like i said to you in eve mail we dont have anyone on the current csm that participates in fw if you want us to bring up your little issues you need to tell us what they are and having them all in one thread makes that easieri also think you arent understanding what trebor and i said to you we didnt promise you that everything wrong with fw would be fixed we asked you for a list of smaller issues because we wanted to have a list to present to ccp this doesnt mean ccp is going to fix everything wrong with fw in the next patch or even ever this summit topic was a ccp requested topic not a csm requested topicas far as i can tell there are far fewer fw folks than people that are living in wspace of course fw needs a lot more work to be fixed where wspace is mostly in good shapecsm 7 secretary csm 6 alternate delegate twostepeve on twitter my blog
i agree that faction warfare could be so much better but as it is despite being a gamer that played in lorerp groups in games like shadowbane and darkfall i have never had interest in participating in faction war in eve as implemented nothing that happens in fw has much of an impact on the game world outside of those that signed up for it and even then its minimal its just another themepark ride devoid of story sandbox and meaningful consequences to the world at largeperhaps with some fixes it will appeal to hans and others more but personally i think it needs a complete overhaul hans is right though its hardly surprising that something long neglected by ccp garners little participation from the playerbase
thank you for your response and rest assured i dont have any grandiose expectations about having everything fixed im certainly not naive enough to think that we can just ask and it will be given also im not naive enough to think that we represent the majority of eve players ive said that before my case has always been that improving fw has implications beyond just fw and i was hoping that the csm could think beyond the one niche community and imagine the possibility that a thriving fw system could provide the type of smallscale combat that players across the game have been asking for and revitalize lowsec which has as many issues as nullsec does in terms of broken mechanics and stale activityi also was never under the impression that you promised it to be fixed either what i am reacting to is that you asked for the list of small fixes to be condensed into one thread which has been done i guess the misunderstanding here is that by asking in this thread once again to see a list of little fixes that i interpreted this to mean you hadnt seen the list that has already been compiled and youre right you said personal list of fixes im sorry for questioning something that should have been more obvious i was a little flustered only because theres only so many times you can asked to provide a list of fixes than provide them than asked to provide them again i will go back and edit my previous post for fairness to your personal list i apologize for jumping the gun
also since you have clarified that this list was proposed by ccp and not the csm i just wanted to add that i am not personally holding the csm responsible for somehow failing us once againi know that you are not all fw participants im asking you to think beyond a group of niche players and see that lowsec gameplay is stale for the same reasons nullsec is stale  lack of rewards broken sovereignty mechanics the things that bother you bother us in fw as well think of past csm  their repeated proposals fell on deaf ears because of incarna and wod focus  faction warfare used to be a much larger talking point please dont punish us for having suffered dwindling numbers due to time and attrition  take advantage of this opportunity now that csm 6 has the privilege to be working with the new ccp and help us get the attention that is long overdue our only chance here is for members of the csm to look beyond pure representational demographics and think about fw fixes on the basis of merit not simply on popular support
to clarify again it wasnt the list that was proposed by ccp it was the session topicwith regards to convincing ccp to work on fw that is going to have to mostly fall on the players not on the csm one of the things the csm doesnt really do is decide directions for ccp to work on though we are helpful once said direction has been decided on if you want ccp to work on fw stuff more you are going to have to convince them that it is worth working oncsm 7 secretary csm 6 alternate delegate twostepeve on twitter my blog
i agree with hans when he says that faction warfare could much more than it is its not just for roleplayers its for anyone that wants a purpose in their fight not everyone has a chance or wants to join large null sec alliance but the large scale epic space opera is appealingfaction warfare is the step between highsec npc and null sovereignty wars i personally think its good for the game to have people immersed in the story and support their faction as i said before it gives them a purpose and pride while they fight the enemyone thing i would like to see in highsec is more faction division most capsuleer seem to avoid standinglowering missions they arent choosing side they are just friendly with all faction i find that lame i want division and more fighting people should feel compelled to pick side siding with a faction against their enemies should have more advantages not necessarily in a faction warfare way but just have better reward for those faction missionsalso two steps youre from aperture harmonics so i assume you have an opinion on most things related to wormholes whats your thought on intensive refining array do you know the reason why refining in a wormhole comes at such a lostis that also to promote more movement between known space and wormholeshow much independence do you think wormholes should have
i guess i still have a lot to learn than about what exactly the csm does than im being serious here not snarky it was my understanding that many of you ran on campaigns that stood for things like iterations before new features and have specifically promoted that ccp redirects its focus from wis to fis so what i thought i was seeing was a csm that was very much in a position to influence the projects that ccp works on seeing is how you were such outspoken supporters for the shift away from incarna and world of darkness and back onto eve proper fixes you engaged in a media blitz exposing ccp for ignoring the fanbase than ccp swings around and starts working on features that have been championed by csm members present and past on behalf of the player basethus it takes me by surprise to hear you say and i still dont fully understand that the csm doesnt really decide the direction for ccp to work on i mean obviously you cant mandate anything no argument there but surely you can and do say we believe x deserves some attention sooner than yare you implying that current crucible list is comprised of things ccp decided to work on out of a vacuum with or without the csms advocacy again not at all being sarcastic im genuinely trying to learn about the whole process here i appreciate your time and patienceedit greater understanding about the csm  ccp relationship aside and i understand that is a discussion topic of its own my primary concern at this point is making sure youve found and reviewed the top little fixes we compiled for you in the thread your email to me asked for a list to be compiled and reposted so you could review it with ccp during the summit as long as there was time allocated for it which theyve offered you i think the community will rest much easier knowing youve found the list and will be sharing it with ccp during the summit thanks again for your time we appreciate it
why dont class 4 systems have the random outgoing wormholes like the other class types have  also why do c4s not have the possibility of getting a k162 from kspace  in case this is confusing people occasionally a system can have a wormhole that is not typical to the system ie not one of its static wormholes as far as i know this never occurs in c4sid like that added
hans two step is right he is here to represent players as they exist in eve now not what eve could befact is ccp has abandoned the only mechanic for frequent quality small gang and solo pvp for so long  very few of us have stuck with eve most people who play eve are fine with the blobs and certainly the current csm is fine with it some of the alternates i think may have an interest in small scale pvp or at least they did in the past but its unclear what they can donot one full delegate on the csm does small scale pvp its amazing that ccp still has people clamoring for small scale pvp after they have consistently refused to work on mechanics to bring it about for so long really when are we going to give it eve is blob warfare by design 1000 ship fights make the news in the gamer websites players who dont like that leave and have left therefore the csm is going to be players who dont mind the blob and have no real interest in mechanics for small scale and solo pvpfw isnt going to be something that csm can champion its entirely too foreign to them it will have to be ccp that decides they will finally implement a mechanic that promotes frequent quality small scale pvpi think the csm can recognize this the only people who can give much input would be elise randolf and prometheus even there im not sure prom even knows the mechanics and you may have pissed elise off with all your whining about pls super caps make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
i disagree that fw is the only small gang pvp available i think that a lot of the folks that went to fw looking for small gang pvp have found it in wspace i nearly always pvp in fleets of 20 members or lower often less than 10 if that isnt small gang pvp i dont know what is csm 7 secretary csm 6 alternate delegate twostepeve on twitter my blog
sitting in a wh waiting to gank an industrial is not anything close to what i am after hans is right fw and wh are completely different playstyles at least they would be if ccp fixed fwmake faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
i dont currently live in a wh but when i did one of the most frustrating things was being unable to repackage modules over time you end up with insane amounts of unpackage items in your hangars drones especially fixing that would be a godsend
100 this both from an economic perspective and that of zzzzzz boredombut judging by the apparent damage being inflicted to the eve economy by the comparatively riskfree hisec incursion system this should also be seriously looked at for the dynamicspawn scenario
come on i dont quite understand whats wrong with you guys awesome idea supported by 2 csms we need a dev answer and here we go content for the next expansion
indeed we want to know which session exactly csm members are planning to bring this up in broken systems
alright i appreciate getting that feedback on whose decision it waswell i hope theyre open with you ive had a lot of my faith in them restored recently but havent forgotten that some of the worst moves theyve made this year were the ones they didnt tell you aboutpersonally i take jade constantines view on mt i know its not ideal for ccps wallet but there it is
honestly this post needs to be on every pageinvest in what youre good at spaceships and let the money flow from there ccp has made its success by being unique in the industry not by copying other companies
those suggestions they either vastly increase isk faucet via insurance or chase highseccers 92 of total player base to another mmo likely both your other suggestions like adding insurance value to manufacturing cost is downright game breakingyou are just interested in risk vs reward and trying to disguise it as isk faucetsink issue when all your suggestions make the isk situation worse if you ever manage to come up with a good idea that creates isk sinkremove isk faucet while also just happens to balance risk vs reward without breaking the game im all ears until then stop trying to push that thinly disguised agenda where it doesnt belongim not against your ideas because they increases risks im against them because they ruin the economy
no goose99 everything you say in your last post has been answered in one of previous posts except about players leaving i think what it boils down to is you just want eve to be more of a themepark style mmo if players came to eve a supposedly sandbox mmo revolving around pvp and expected to be able to play a themepark mmo where theyre can at no cost never be subject to non consensual pvp then they should leave further more eves long term health as a game would be better off if they did leave as opposed to keep pushing the game further and further away from the sandbox modeloh and are you saying that 92 of players in eve only play in highsec where is the number from
stats provided by ccp a bit out of date but i doubt it changed muchall your ideas ruins the economy in order to achieve your vision of what eve should be changed into its an economy thread go push your unrelated agenda somewhere else btw i now pronounce you the boss of what eve should be
my ideas are linked with issues of the economy in general hence not inappropriately posted here perhaps you can ask trebor to make a new thread that would by default exclude ideas like mine such as csm december summit the economy specifically how to reward risk aversion and punish risk takers or csm december summit space wow the future of eveso only 8 of players have any characters that spend any time in nullsec lowsec or wormholes hmm okthanks please inform ccp
i finally got my dad to try eve after a few years of talking the game up he quit after 2 hours of game play and cited these reasons1 the font was too small and there was waaayyyyy too much reading2 the ui was difficult to understand and control he didnUFFFDt know where to click and even when he found it the sections had too much text and were not intuitive3 there were no introductory videos ie talking aurora head  tutorial  anythingi hope these observations help
if i remember right and the tutorials remain similar when you first log in there is nothing to tell you even where you are in the universe  youre either in a station or in space  would be nice to have a little orientation video showing at least a map of the system you start in how it has stations gates asteroid belts etc so the new players know at least what to look for ieok im floating in space i can warp to a gate to get to the next system etc maybe add to the video an overview of the tutorials and what will happen afterwards so they know they are working towards a goal ie the tutorials will show you the basics of eve  then you can pursue employment with x y z corps or epic arcs etc etcalso eves training system by nature causes noobs to feel boredlike they dont have any reason to keep playing while they are waiting for skills to train  other mmos force you to keep playing to build skills  now i love eves offline training system but would be nice if we could to find a way to make noobs feel like they have a reason to keep playing to build their skills  maybe giving out many more skill books during the tutorials like one every mission  or hopefully others can come up with something even better maybe let them earn skillpoints for running missions during the tutorials there could be all kinds of different ways of limiting this to keep it from being abused but still provide that addictive incentive for new players to keep playing currently the sentiment usually turns to oh ill just log out for a few days while a train my basic skills 
although i completely disagree with your gauntlet idea for new players  as its far too extreme  what youve written above could hardly be more trueive gone through the new player experience already for all of the races just to see what its like playing it as if i were completely new and although its much much better than when i first started playing theres still plenty of room for confusionfor instance in addition to what youve already mentioned theres the problem of shared artwork  i might be learning about fitting minmatar guns but the picture in front of me that im hoping will help is showing amarri also found that the tutorial text windows were quite difficult to read my resolution is very high and i think a lot of new gamers would get frustrated at this because learning to play something fun shouldnt reek of effort of course ui scaling is going to be a massive help there but how on earth is a noob going to find the option  unless we do npe v2
yes let players make the content then characters can become eve famous designers or at least see their work ingame all submissions must agree to relinquish all copyright claims on the design or whatever your legal team decideslet us the players help fix these half finished features
not sure if this should come under art or little thingsput in some dual monitor support for walking in stations whilst there is an alter camera position function it only changes which shoulder you are looking over your character is still always slap bang in the center ie right on the overlap between your two monitors we have this function in space so you move the focus onto the center of one monitor or the other and use the second monitor for other stuff chat channels comms etc please duplicate this function in stations i cant see it being a big fix to do
why are both those systems mentioned when your list of fixes is only restricted to wormhole issuesif you are not bringing forth and championing faction warfare issues who will be i am greatly concerned that even after being asked via private email discussions with several csm members to provide csm with a condensed list of top small fixes not a single small fix was included in your list of discussion pointswhat assurance do we have that a fw and wormholes discussion does not simply mean wormholes discussionthis kind of casual namedropping is exactly what the community is outraged at ccp for doing with the winter expansion i had gained a lot of respect for the csm because of their responsiveness to us but now that the agenda is posted it feels like the csm is paying lip service much like ccp has been we deserve more than to be a name in a thread title with no concrete fixes being proposed by any csm members even despite being handed a list by the communityi sincerely hope that i am misunderstanding the csm here and am open to hearing how you all feel about this subject i think i can speak for the faction warfare community though in that by saying post your list of little things for discussion here feels much like charlie brown being asked to come kick the field goal for the umpteenth time while lucy holds the football
minei try to read everything people send me on relevant topics and i try and point interested csms and devs to relevant materials as appropriateccp appears to be staying largely in fixing little things mode for the next expansion so we want to have hitlists of possible smaller tweaks that can improve the current features of the game including fwgetting feedback from interested players in the public discussion thread and via links to other threads is particularly important in the case of fw tweaks since afaik the current csm has little direct experience with fw
when the plex market truly crash the damage wouldve been done and it wouldve been too late to salvagethe fact that it dropped by 50 mil in 3 days actually does more damage than it rising 100 mil a week prior it has everything to do with fluctuations and nothing to do with actual price subscription price must remain stable too high or low is a matter of opinionquote
whyif youre going to soulbind plex you might as well remove them before we had plex people still traded in gtc for isk its just there was little to no oversight no logs to check for scams no easy way to check which codes are lost forever and which are being held the situation was objectively worse its naive to think that if you remove the ability to trade plex openly people wont just go back to the grey market
more damage to whom or to what
the price of a subscription hasnt changed in almost 9 years
the damage hasnt been done and wont be done real life subscription and plex prices are stable with subscription prices remaining pretty much unchanged for years again no one is required to participate in the plex program its an ingame commodity in an economy forever bloated by automagically renewing resources and barely balanced by ship use there is plenty of money to go around despite the cries of ccps seeming favorite player segment whining against all common sense and reality that that income aka bloat should be rebalanced to benefit the people who go out of their way to spend money rather than invest it and make a profit despite ccp setting up the game to not only allow for it but to promote itplex causes a lot more money to be dumped into an already bloated economy if it wasnt bloated prices would be going down not up as plex are not exactly rare the fact is lots of people have discretionary income to dump into plex and they are doing so plex prices will reflect perceived market value but they wont hurt subscriptions because of pricing subscription prices arent changing the ingame cost of free game time is if real life plex purchases dont outstrip the income the price wont come down much i dont see what all the fuss is about
really imagine thisright now moon mining is a tightly controlled superpower only operation the chances for any player to enter this market are nill thanks to alliances dictating control  conditionsa post like this happens about every week on si
does the realease of dust514 is still planned for this summer was thinking that we would have some feature related to dust in this winter expansion which is apparently not the case
1 um you realise jumpdrives are for capital class vessels that are banned from entering hisec right2 you do realise this is how a normal warpdrive works3 wtf4 and if youre not in your pod how are you expected to interface with the ship5 wtf i dont even6 what purpose does that give youother than the complete fail of understanding how certain things work in the game specifically the controls youve essentially described stealth bombers and assault frigates
this is probably the simplest and most elegant solution to countering the bring 1000 friends for 10 minutes solution that is sov warfare the higher the sov level the longer the timerthis also gives the defender a chance to actually fight and requires the attacker to maintain a physical attackable presence 237 or some other new timer in the systemelse the timer reverses and counts up a defense fleet has a chance to form up properly just like the attacking fleet had and move to counter more small  med sized fights here as getting 1000 pilots to stay logged on all day would be near impossiblei would caveat that instead of benchmarks have alliance member count paid nontrial accounts only determine the number of systems an alliance can control then increase the sov cost exponentially14 systems  200 mil  month each 10 members59 systems  300 mil  month each 25 members 1020 systems  500 mil  month each 75 membersthe numbers are irrelevant and used as an example they are for the csm and ccp to agree uponthe point here is to make sov blobs more difficult and allow startup alliances to steak claim in null
having been in fw as an rper read active plexer since it started i would very much advise against that the timer system is badly thought out and poorly implemented the amount of wasted time is staggering and has turned the plexing scene into one of disposable alt spammingthe only thing that fw might contribute directly is the hull size restriction on plexes whomever cooked that one up deserves a medal sovereignty plexes should lean towards incursion system with objectives to be handled within each be it a series of hacks salvage ehp grinds or something entirely different  anything but a thumbtwiddle timerand what is to prevent the current blocs from still controlling everything what you are proposing is pretty much what we have now the amount of dead space will just increase as will the amount of slavespets to fill some of themfor any type of isk based maintenance system to work you must first address the passive faucets which currently allow for a critical mass read blob big enough to effectively prevent any fights entity to hold infinite space reintroduce the capital system put limits on what infrastructure can be maintained and defended outside of home constellationregion if current tz timers are kept then it could be a linear decrease in reinforcement timers based on range for instance so that a tower on the other side of the cluster has 0hrs regardless of stront counter that with significant boons to be had at home ex production defense harvesting etc allows for manufacturing centres which may or may not develop into trade hubs improves local productionviability helps cut jita umbilical and thus the small operation read alliances new to null increase maintenance costs by system count and distance give skirmishroam fleets ability to impact space more than popping haulers and docking ratters up holding space should mean that it requires patrols a police force if you will the idea that you can sit by the hearth and only go to war on the weekends to defend your land is stupid to put it mildlyin short early dominion vision was throttled at birth and what was launched was a shadow of what was announced in the planning blogs combat has not been spread out small gangs have no place independents dont exist and everything is importedeven shorter almost the entire thing needs to be redone
as the previous poster said just dont fly a hulk either fly a mining fit rokh or grab a covie and insure it a covie will have about 8090 of the yield of a hulk and cost 5m after insurance
ask them how it felt to be slapped by their customer base with such force that they did an about faceand please make them understand that the requirement of better communication extends beyond their comfort zone they have improved but they tend to turtle when something they say is hammered  as in a blurp or two in a thread resulting in an outcry and then absolute silence on the topic as a whole it is the raison detre of community management hires
i dont think the csm should be rubbing ccps nose in the fact they did an about face to refocus on spaceships they should be praised for that ccp made the right choiceand better late than never but the refocus on core gameplay with crucible needs to ccps new long term focus not something done once to take the heat off themthey need to keep improving their communication with players an example of good communications would be matt higby over at sony for the upcoming planetside2 on the whole they need to be very open and transparent on their plans for eve in terms of direction and intent theres a lot of long outstanding issues with eve that they need to address rather than continued to be brushed under the rug issues that in many cases ccp will have to choose between diametrically opposed player group interests clarity and foreknowledge of where eve is heading is better for all concerned than continued ambiguity key to this ccp needs to decide what kind game eve is because sometimes i dont think they know or have decided yet
people arnt happy with how the voting system works for the csm at the moment the number of antimittani and antinullsec only csm as examples maybe a review is needed to see if the current methods work or possibly to explore other avenues i have no firm suggestions as to what other methods but some have been mentioned on the forums and theres real life examples that can be used and possibly incentives to vote in the next csm elections
8x neutron blaster cannon ii void li think thatll convey the message nicely 
i have been getting a bit concerned about the new battlecruisers going to be introduced in cruciblemainly my concern is these ships pack quite a punch and i am afraid they are going to be used to gank miners all over evei have tested this on sisi and one tier 3 battle cruiser can destroy a hulk in a few seconds and i did not even use faction ammo or t2 gunsso i think the miners are going to be the big loosers in this new expansioncould ccp maby think of introducing a new mining barge with stronger armor andor shieldsor even let the rorqual into high sec space to provide some protection for the now verry vulnrable mining barges
working as intended make friends go to lowsec your friends can shoot the bad guys before they open fire ie theres no concord to punish youperhaps this will be the first of the hammer blows to the great wall of carebear
this honestlyi remember back when i was an officer in a mining corp semidisbanded as we all started our own corpswe actually forbid corp members from mining in highsec as it gives crap isk per hour and we were adjacent to lowsec anywayshonestly lowsec is pretty damn safe all you need is a nice mining system and 45 australians from a friendly merc corp as in they were people we built ships for so they had an investment to protect and our guys would mine decentvalue ores all day with rarely a neut in system for more then 5 secondsbasically even if these new bcs are hulkkillers last checked they can go down fairly quick get a wellbalanced defense fleet of 45 ships and you shouldnt have any problems
yeah one of my corpmates pulled up sisi maybe yesterday  talos has something like1500 shield1900 armour2100 hull itll be scrapmetal in 34 solid hits from large weapons
confirming resists dont exist and tier 3 bc doesnt have the sig of a cruiserid be more concerned about mineral  ship prices if i were youand btw with the buffed dessie catalyst pumps out 900 dps overheated no you wont need those guns later i know what i will be using for the next hulkagaddon and its not the tornado
yeah nice in theory just round up a team of 10 people anytime you want to mine  not realistic for most people really  maybe this will decrease solo mining and raise mineral prices  which a lot of people in eve want  but for noobs  those who want to simply log in each night for a few hours of unscheduled eveing around maybe theyll either need to learn to be satisfied with pve mission running etc or maybe they will just feel like the game got a bit more hassle than its worth and just quit  will be interesting to watch for surequeue the you dont know how to play eve bc you dont play like us rants now 
this is the talos stats from chrukerdkemexkinthermshield  0504020 1750 base hparmour  50103535 1890 base hphull  0000 2160 base hpsig radius is 200m sig resolution on meta 4 neutron blasters is 400mideally youre hitting 50 of the timebase damage of antimatter is 28 kin20 therm weapon modifier 441x brings you up to 12348 kin882 therm8 weapons  98784kin7056 therm per volley before even factoring in skills and ship bonuses 16935 overall or criticalglancing blows which will admittedly change the numbers a bitshields take 5927 kin5645 therm damage per volley 11572 overall assuming 100 shields 1 volley leaves you at 34armour takes 6421 kin4586 therm damage per volley 11007 overall assuming 0 shields 100 armour 1 volley leaves you at 41hull takes everything 16935 assuming 0 shields 0 armour 1 volley leaves you at 21since were not accounting for the skill modification of these numbers or modules drones ship bonuses etc looks like itll take 56 solid hits with the base stats of the guns and resistslooking at the offensive side the talos gets 5 bonus to damage per bc level so youre looking at an additional 15 damage at base skills to be in the ship plus an additional 5 for large hybrid turret  so with just the base skills to be in one of these new bcsshields take 13973 overall assuming 100 shields 1 volley leaves you at 20armour takes 13291 overall assuming 0 shields 100 armour 1 volley leaves you at 30hull takes everything 20449 assuming 0 shields 0 armour 1 volley leaves you at 5since were not accounting for additional modifications to the numbers modules skills drones etc looks like 4 solid hits would be enough to convert the talos into scrapmy op stands
just to be clear  great wall of carebear  mmmm  why would we want to discourage carebears exactlyi mean most people start out as solo players in hisec  and even those who never choose to become pvprs still pay their subs  so whats with the declare war on carebears tact exactly why would we want to drive them away from the game some will adapt but as always there will be unsub casualties
there is only one tier3 bc coming this winter  winmatar arty boat as requested by grieferganker leet pvpers on csm and for ccp to get the whole art competition fiasco out of the waythe three other ships will probably not see much use comparatively and are included because adding just the winmatar hull would make the whole thing too obvious
is it actually possible to fit a rack of 1400 iis on one without some serious gymnastics with fitting mods vwait i forgot youre a troll
im an industrialist i mine when i want to relax and not deal with anything else however i have also engaged in pvp when its been necessary mostly wardecs against corps ive been in the great wall of carebear is the idea that every gate in every lowsec system is camped 24x7 with people who are shoot first then laugh at the victim or some idea that is very similar since all of the carebears believe in this permacamping of the border systems theyre viewed as being completely not worth it in essence it creates a wall between hisec and lowsectbh i absolutely hate the people who whine and cry that they should be allowed to mine or whatever without anyone ever being allowed to shoot them or wardec them or anything what im hoping with the new battlecruisers and the new direction that ccp is taking in general is that hisec starts to become less safe overall not just in the hey people can lolgank you faster sense but also in altering some of the other mechanics to promote people from different walks of life to work togetherreduce concord response times maybe remove them from 05 swap with faction navies maybe add the navies to 04 as well to help reduce the feeling of an immediate break from safety to not safe essentially make it so that having defences in 05 are warranted and so that they actually can do something without getting concordokken as it is now get people to be familiar with pvp get people more incentives to work together  rather than bringing an orca and 5 hulks in a 05 mining op maybe youll be bringing the orca 2 hulks ecmpoint and 2 bs
ahhh ok  you mean the wall of losec gatecamps surrounding hisec  verry interesting yeswell i still dont see how making ganking easier and dumber really improves things for anyone other than the gankers  well we cant really think of any new content for the game  but to keep ppl from getting bored lets create some new gank boats  that will entertain the bitter vets and lazy griefers for awhile  hehehefun for the gankers  but really how many ppl want to be gankers its gotta be the least mentally challenging activity in eve  yay i can log in and gank someone with only 2 months of skills im such an elite eve player woohoo  riiiightdoes ganking carebears really ever convert them into pvprs btw
it is not the point to convert them into pvpers you are misunderstanding a lot of things herecarebear makes shittons of isk pirate makes his money by taking a bit of that its pretty  simplefor examplefarmer grows some wheat evil bandit comes and steals his crops and wifei think it should be pretty straightforward to understandthe one could argue about meaningfulness of game mechanics which makes this possible but currently there is no better wayalso a lot of you do not understand that it takes time and effort to find good gank in pretty similar way than exploring works you keep scanning until you hit something which might get you something valuable even then theres risk of failure unless you try to play safe which means profit is reduced to pretty minimum for most of people its just easier to carry on and do incursions
 pretty much this with the addition that the farmer gets some of his town guard buddies to help him go the the unknown forest hideout lowsec of the thief to rescue the damsel  and hopefully whilst theyre there they catch on that there are some ways to get wealth in the forest lowsec and start getting those goods too  the farmer knows what people will pay for and the town guard makes sure the farmer can get the stuff
wow now youre actually right  the professional ganker i could actually have some respect for  skillwise i mean  still  is this really what the game is all about either nullsec blob warfare or ruining other ppls days  from destroyable customs houses better cheaper weapons for gankers and too many nerf hisec and anyone who isnt a ganker or a nullbear rumors to count  is it just me or does this game really just hate anyone who doesnt want to either a play the bad guy b be nullsec meatshield 75468 or at least c become willing pvp cannonfodder these are all fine and great goals for some people not enough though it would seem based on subscriber numbers is it really anathema to be someone who just wants to mind their own business and build cool stuff run missions etcmaybe its all that eve is intended to be and nothing more  then again  maybe its why we dont have more players 
eve is a pvp game remember that
if shooting carebears is pvp then throwing dynamite into a pond must count as fishingdoesnt matter if it can fit a full rack of 1400 iis  you can get away with using tech1 for a majority of targets and for the harder targets you downgrade one or two suicide ganking is not rocket science  this idiot concept just lowers the bar and cost associated with it
you should log into sisi and see how well it stands
quick point incursion lp store is a sink not faucetthe high sec isk payout should be nerfed especially vanguards gasp but seriously making billions is easy and safe isk in highsec iUFFFDve made a liquid bil in a day before and iUFFFDve only been at risk three times2 disconnected logi and 1 fail fcsecond mining is brokenUFFFDespecially ice miningplease see this post as a conversation starter
and the consequence of that is that people who only want to do mining or industry and not get involved in combat whatever their reasons are do not have a place in 00 an entire area of the game is obsoleted because even a corporation of industrialists cant utilize the resources well enough to compete with one person with a jump freighter this is bad design contrary to popular belief 00 should not just be a supercap pvp arena nullsec should be a place to build empires
i agree the is currently providing us with all the information we need to do our spacepewpew but it is doing so in an inefficient way i currently play eve on a 22 screen to receive all the information about what exactly is going on around me my overview need to cover 25 of the screen all i can think is that it must be a better and more intuitive way to display this information it would be highly appreciated by me at least if ccp did a completely new ui not a just redesign but a completely new design there has to be a better way to put all the needed info on the screen as well as a better way to combine mouse and keystrokes to navigate eve is a beautiful game it is just a shame that it is hidden behind all these windows
dear ccpfyi i have heard that on 25nov2011 nexon has disclosed thatthey have asked their local south korea if i understand correctly for help because1 data base for their mmo game maple story has got hacked on 18nov2 information of as many as 132 million players has been stolenccp could you please give us jpplayers two options for account billing like below optiona  i need local language support and agree with playing eve online by paying nexon oroptionb  i do not need local language support and keep current billing system no relation to nexoni wish you would consider this seriouslyjami
no no no the others are fine but the eos is a drone boat the astarte is a blaster platform it makes more sense that the myrm hull becomes a more specialized done ship than a pure gunboat
mate this has already come up in the thread and been covered nowhere is it written that t2fraction ships have to follow the format of there t1 hull counterpartferox  gunshipnighthawk  missileboatprophecy  gunshipdamnation  missleboatscorpion  ew platformnavy issue scorpion  missileboatrattlesnake  missiledrone boatjust because a myrm is a drone boat it does not mean that any ship that used the same model has to follow suit
please refrain from making this thread in every sub forum topic may be discussed in events and gatherings
no more thoughts on this
i forgot to mention something that needs to be added to the forums clicking a dev marker should jump directly to the dev comment
i will give you a simple reason why i keep all my factions at high standingi plan to play this game a year from now and perhaps even 2 years from nowi do not want to be stuck just to minmatar space or caldari space just cause i wanted to run a couple fw things for a couple monthsthe whole faction standing needs a bit of work as it takes waaaaayyyy tooo long to grind out missions to get the standing backso you may find it lamei find it lamer that it prevents me from playing other aspects of the game i might want to do later in life why would i pay for an account if i am only going to screw up my character and i suddenly can only play in 1 factions spacewormholes jump out to every system possible  even there  i would be limiting myself to gameplay
there is no good mechanic in eve for frequent quality small scale pvp when i join fw i want to constantly have plexes to go and fight over ccp should strive to have 25 decent pvp fights per hour happening in fw if people want to continue with the current game where you might wait around for hours for a single gank they wouldnt want to join fw however i think allot of people would love it if the pvp action came allot faster than it currently does make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
i completely understand cearain but you and i are players too and theres nothing wrong with asking the csm to share information with ccp thats really all im trying to do here is take what ive heard from the people i interact with consolidate it and send the message up the chain that this is what we see is broken this is what would benefit the game if it were fixed also that we see faction warfare as an area where minimal fixes can reap great reward in terms of enhanced gameplay and activityyou and i have a different background than two step thats totally cool i truly appreciate the diversity of activities there are in the game and really want there to continue to be a variety of vibrant and unique forms of gameplay each with its own set of challenges and rewards wormholing is indeed a place where small gang pvp can occur and it is also one of the areas that is essentially supercap and titan free but just because two step and i have spent time in different areas of the game doesnt mean im somehow ineligible to say anything to him and have him pass it along during a summit talk all i can do is ask and if i didnt at least ask i would be doing my own community a disservice regardless of whether two step shares our lists of fixes with ccpand two step  i understood you when i meant the list i mean the topics list  im saying its not your fault that the topic is called little things fw and wormholes no one should be seeing the csm as somehow trying to belittle us by using that phrasing cause it was ccps words not yours the other list you posted is your own which rightfully so is focused on wormhole fixes because thats your background you have your wish list ive compiled a wish list on behalf of the faction warfare community im just confirming that youre talking about both during the summit whether cearain feels you represent me or not you had offered to share our list so im simply following up is all
fw the most important changes what need no docking permissions for the enemy fw participants in occupied enemy controlled systemslet a sense be given the fight for starsystems
speaking up for fw here and repeating again for crystal claritythe op has been edited to list the top trending fw issues with a description of each and the threadnought that follows goes into extreme depth should any more clarification be needed
i really wish i could set up a station in a wormholecloning bay market orders all in wspace although the market would probably have to be limited to only displaying the solar systemmaybe this ruins the manliness of living out of a pos with no reliable access to regular space to rely on and it might make it way too easy to turtle up and make these impenetrable wspace fortresses but sometimes i just want to dock upi honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
qft the current game design has a greaterthanunity power scaling function for fleets  its almost always if not always increasing the size of your fleet which leads to a mutual runaway to the blob i raised this issue in my original csm5 campaign coining fleets expand to fit the lag availabletidi will address some of the technical issues with lag but it also opens headroom to permit even larger blobs so its only really buying time eventually the fleets will get big enough to make the tidi factor so large that itll be unplayable ccp really needs to change the mechanics to get away from the dirtbag is primary everyone shoot dirtbag douchenozzle is secondary blob fights we have nowwrt fw if changes are made that make it more popular without addressing the underlying combat mechanics issues the game faces itll just blob up
could you elaborate a little more on what you meant by this i was wondering which changes you are referring to in terms of popularity and which underlying mechanics issues you speak of
i think thats probably a good idea heres the summarized version of hans compiled list of requested fixes from the fw community quick fixes1 have plexes spawn throughout the day instead of primarily after downtime2 pirate frigates shouldnt be allowed in minor plexes 3 repping a militia member with low security status should not kill faction standing 4 repping a friendly low sec status militia member who is a victim of aggression should not result in gcc5 give some kind of highly visible alert or intel system for when territory is threatened big fixes1 make plexing more rewarding2 balance faction npcs3 change fw missions so they cant be soloed in a stealth bomber4 make fw sov do something rather than being meaningless as it is at presentthe full expanded list can be found here
something else ill chime in on hereits not up to us to throw around estimated statistics of fw or wh popularity or to compare them or to then decide which issues have meritthere is a strong voice in the eve community asking for recognition and development time the voice is strong enough that it has been heard by ccp employees discussed by ccp employees sent up the chain by ccp employees to the point where the ceo the man in charge of the entire company has heard it considered it and deemed it weighty enough to directly reference its need for work in a very important letter to the entire communitythat should be enough for everyone if we just stick to the simplest communication here it will be best for everyonewhat are the issuesare the issues clear to the csmcan the csm communicate them clearly to ccpsourem itharen  congratulations lady kadesh you have been selected by trial of fire and blood under the watchful eyes of god to represent lord khanid as his champion in the imperial succession trials yc117

nerf incursion rewards seriously halve them across the board theyll still be very good
12 would mean incursions pay the same or a little less than missioning with all of the hassle of finding and organizing a fleet and the time of jumping out to the incursion might as well say remove incursions
nerf missions too
well if your message is nerf everything that does not fit my favorite play style i assure you that is a common enough position lame but common
well some more general ideas in short form many have allredy been suggested in the forums maybe you like 1 or 2real estatethe basic idea is that people can buysell production slots and maybe office slots at npc stationsin these slots you can install spezialized production machines in lowsec and 00 you can also install illegal machinesthey only give boni to production times of specific item groups ammo frigates  also faction machines could be possible that give better or more specific boni for example a sansha production machine that produces sansha ships in half the time or so but nothing elsethey only change production time cause if they would change material needs they would become mandatoryi would suggest to only sell 12 or 34 of all npc slots at one station and only in system that had an incursion this shall prevent that one party dominates all slots in empire and that all slots are gone after the first day it would also make sense rp wise cause corps that maintained these slots flee from sanshas at the first time they are sold with an auction from the npc corp that owns the stationthey also should have a monthly maintenance cost land tax if it can not be paid they are auctioned againthey could also become a material sink if they need something like a fuelat player owned outposts the machines can be installed by the owning corp maybe selling these slots there could be nice but you will lose everything when the outpost gets conquered and the slots can be sold again by the new owning corp cause they are allowed to confiscate the slotssome more buttons in production menu would also be nice thenchoose next free slot  usefull atm toochoose cheapest slotchoose fastes slotmission distributionit would be nice to be able to ask an agent for a fast to complete mission or maybe a longer mission so if you just have 30 min or so to play you can just log in and do something without risking to get a scarlet the piratdingbums mission or something longmicrooutpostsbasically spezialized structures that can be placed somewhere in space and that have only one function of an outpostthose services can be taxed like in an outpost they dont have to be conquered they belong to the corp having sov in the system and they can be disabled like outpost services todayexamplesrepair outpost  basic repair servicestorage outpost  limited corporate hangar array in space usefull for mining mayberefinery outpostautomated shipyards  just an idea but thing about an array in space where you can place an bpo and minerals and it automaticly builds ships ammo and whatever without using a prodslot of a podpilot if they are conquered the enemy gets everything in the array like a complex reactor array with silos at a posthey can be limited to one per region or constellation or systempleae no new pos modules for this cause pos can only be used by one corp and have many risks associated run out of fuel getting sabotaged by corpmembers geting killedthey also dont offer some services that an outpost have like a usefull refinery repair services maybe the market and a place to work with contracts very important for corp internal logistiks and othe thingscorpnpcstandingsomething that bugs me every time i think about it why is the corporate standing towards npc corps based on the average standing of every member with standing towards this corp so if you bring a new pilot to a npc corp to do missions for them your corpstanding towards them drops until he reaches the former average standing i would love to see that it works like the system from players where you get a bit of standing for every mission so normal corps can use pos in empire without using a altcorp for it and jumpclone services and so on wardeccing another corp cause of an moon would also be more predicable cause you never know whos altcorp owns the moon you wanttower defense in eve  player created complexwell this is just a small idea i had but what if players could design complexes with a limited amount of parts for npc factions that get placed in space you could influence spawntimes spawnplaces position of gates and sentryguns and other things with limits you get paid based on the time players need to complete it and maybe boni for destroyed ships but this could be exploitet so just small boni worth less than the ships maybe you could place them for pirat factions in highsec the longer they survive the more money you get from the pirat faction they could also become lowsec pockets in empire and you could defend them activelyminionswe already have npctechnicans as npc loot why not use them during production jobs to accelerate them they can be specialized like the scince skills so you have teams for battleship construction or maybe faction teams and so onthey can be sold directly by npc corps or you buy a basic student that can be trained in a special posmodul or maybe later at planetary coloniesmaybe they have a monthly cost loan asociated or paid per job i would prefer the first
great running out of space heres the resta more advanced market systemin todays system you only create buy and sellorders which get processed automaticly so you can not choose to buy from someone or not to buy from someonei would like to see a system like in other games where you can choose to buy from one person and not only just the cheapest oneit would also be nice if you could choose which persons are allowed to buy your goods for what price tooso if you press the advanced button in the sellorder screen you can have the following options set price for alliance dont sell to set price for corp dont sell to set price for blue dont sell to set price for neutral dont sell to set price for red dont sell towhen you open the screen the prices get automaticly set to the price set in the standard sellscreen so you dont have to cp everything and can only change the thing you like maybe only better price for corpmembersthe same could be done with advanced buyorderswith this system you could create internal markets for corpsalliances or even tradecoalitions without the fear that someone just comes by buys everything and relists it or you could start more or less effective tradeblockades against other corps neutral tradealts are still available but less pleasantfor example i dont want to trade with people in privateers cause i think they are a lame bunch of loosers without balls but i want to buy veldspar from chribba just for the lulz if it only costs 001 isk more or if i buy my monthly plex i would prefer to buy it from someone in my alliance and not someone in pl or the drfthis maybe could also prevent 001 isk games where people without a life can dominate a market this would still be a valid tactic as people can still choose just to buy from the cheapest one but there will also be a way around it if you have good connections to some other people and get better prices than the restto prevent confusion the market screen should have 2 additional informations for every order your price where the price is shown you would have to payget owner of the order with a tag like in local or in the show info screen the price of today will then be the price for neutral standingsand maybe some filtering optionsthanks for reading

remove drone poo ore to minersa little increase in prices is good for marketeconomic with big amounts of money and for eve itself too easy to get big shipsand more ppl will start to mine again  less ppl grinding isk in the economythats a balance between that 2 things
pvp is the biggest material sink in this game and dumping more materials in the game encourages people to pew in more materially expensive ships due to availability so pvp is a material sink that grows to compensate any material inflation isk sinks are pretty much fixed in place and do not balance the amounts of isk flooding into eveif inflation is inevitable this is why material inflation is more desirable to isk inflation i think the reward systems in eve missions anoms incursions should move away from isk rewards and towards material rewardsthis is also why i like the lp store lp cant be traded between players and can only be turned in for certain items at certain stations lp is basically materials waiting to happenon a slightly related note the one thing that would really make mining more profitable is to crack down on botting the reason you dont make isk mining for 2 hours on the weekend is because some botter is running 15 hulks somewhere in highsec 237 flooding the market with minerals not because of drone salvage ok well drone botting is hurting the system but thats the bots fault not the rogue dronesi honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
my general comment is that as some people have already pointed out botting seriously messes up the economya friend of mine played this game back before the first titan was built and he laughed at the idea that anyone would be able to any reasonable number of them ever he was also afraid of lvl4s because it supposedly took 56 coordinated people much like incursions or c5c6 hw sitesif ships especially caps and supercaps were much much much more minerally intensive nerfing them might not have been so important because there would not be nearly so many people like cheap ships but it was not that long ago that ship prices were set by insurance rather than minerals because minerals were so cheapi think the economy would be healthier if a serious effort to stop bot mining were made not to mention help the poor miners that are actually people and for those people who say we wouldnt have any ships without botters you have it wrong if there were no bots and nobody wanted to mine prices would eventually rise to the point that mining would be more profitable than incursionslvl4s and then more people would mine and then prices would fall and thenit would work like a functional economyfinally on the whole isk sourcesink thing problematically ccp is determined to get rid of npcs selling stuff and not having massive inflation while letting people get more and more isk good luck stuff can be created and destroyed isk can be created but it is much more difficult to find reasonable ways to destroy it i think the best solution not that this would happen in a million years its just a theoretical suggestion is to get rid of all sources and sinks of isk all of themreplace all rewardscosts that used to be isk with some physical itemmineraltags that can be used and destroyed and require transportation make skillbooks bought with some of this stuffwhy you ask because isk will still be used as a medium of exchange people who want fluid assets will trade their stuffitems for isk as its much more convenient than stuff people will still buy stuff they want with isk but will no longer just be able to go and get isk form the isk tree but instead will have to go and get stuff that other people find valuable enough to buy from themisk becomes a medium of exchange instead of a sourcesink problem if you still want some inflation for economic purposes then give some to newbie players or something further it encourages activities that actually contribute to the economybasically imagine sleeper lootsalvage only all of those ancient coordinate databases would be purchased by players because they are redeemable for skillbooks instead of selling the databases to npcs for isk
for the nullsec noobs you could make t2 frigates a little easier to get into sp wisealso theyll need a way to make isk to buy these ships you could add a few more low risk belt rat spawns into the mix a small handful of cruisers  frigates  battle cruisers the normal belt ratters will skip over the belt rat spawns that dont have any battleships in them and the noob ratters can skip over the tougher belts till they find something their speed with more spawns it means that belt miners will get jumped more often but a flight of medium drones from a hulk should have no problem chasing off a low risk belt rat spawni honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
and this ui is comfortable to use loljust ask noobs that are starting to play evethere is no more uncomfortable ui then eve ui
well if they have nothing to do in art department then they could change the player created outposts so that they maybe show what upgrades they have maybe a modular system like the t3 shipssame could be done for regular npc outposts and it could show what services they offerseeing that an outpost has an medical without show info would be a nice feature
i would like to see the signatures requirementalso id like to see an instant runoff voting system used where you can vote for just one person or preference vote for everyonekeep the 12 month terms but have half the seats up for election every 6 months

there is nothing wrong with the current system of plex there is no need to do a bind to account thing that would screw up the gamestyle of thousands of people and inconvenience everyone the primary concern with plex currently is the rapid increase in price due to manipulation and hoarding by select few players eve is a sandbox first and foremost the rules were set in place to allow exactly this sort of thing and thus we must allow it or give ample prewarning on any changesthe high plex prices will begin driving players away from the game as they can no longer subscribe the best way to drive the prices lower is to increase the overall quality of the game and restore the feeling that eve has a long term potential for another decade people need to feel eve is worth investing in to be worth spending rl money on plex crucible is a good start were seeing a lot of good changes that are sending eve back in a good direction the bulk plex sell offers from ccp are another good way to push prices downfor now everything is on the right track to correcting itself we just need to be patient
i remember watching that little dust 514 trailer a while ago it had all the isk costs for the stuff they were using and all i could ask myself was how much would i pay to screw up someones piand the answer was definitely not 120 mil for that floating command centereither the prices need to go down or pi needs to get way more valuableactually id like to see dust interfere with sov warfare  structure bashing maybe you could launch angry dudes with rifles at any renforceable thing in the game and they could make the reinforce timer longer or shorter depending on who won the dust 514 matchid pay a lot of money to be able to slide someones reinforce timer up or down to get the fight into my timezonei honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
a big part of this is because most structures have stupid amounts of hot points and you need a load of people if you want to take the thing down in a reasonable amount of time the new dread mechanics that encourage you to take them out more often might help out with thisyeah i can see a decent hp buffer for the initial attack to give the defenders some time to get a home defense fleet up but when you have a reinforce timer ticking down you already know when the fight is going to happeni hear the new pi offices have fewer hit points and i am interested by the idea of choosing a window of time during the day for it to come out of reinforceif the new pi offices turn out to be really popular we might try doing something similar to the current reinforcement mechanicsi honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
heres the thing with changing the slots and refining percentages  its already hard enough for industrial types in nullsec since for the most part anyway theres a serious need to have combatoriented guys protecting your borders and such this ends up leaving the industrial guys usually being looked down on yes i will agree that not everyone does this  but lets be honest  as a recruiter you can have one of the following pilots pilot a  20m sp in combat skills only has the basics ie what new players start with in industrypilot b  20m sp in industry can fly cruisers or maybe bcs with t1 gunswho would you rather have in your crewnow i havent been in nullsec in a long time so things may have changed  but i remember i got drafted in because i pulled off some near impossible deliveries to a corp 5 dudes in retrievers i had a hulkmack  the order was for lots of oxytopes and a few mil units of various minerals after getting in i was pretty bad at refining in their station was a 30 or 35 base station  so i worked to squeeze every last bit of usable material out of those rocks that i couldyeah i wasnt useful for anything beyond cannon fodder  but i made myself stand out in my corporation because i was able to refine at essentially 100 out there i wasnt just some miner who was able to supply some materials  i was one of the guys to talk to when stuff needed refinedsure it makes things easier all around for indy types if everyone can refine at 100 with less effort  but there should really be something left in the game to make training skills that high worth it and no the elite certificates arent really what im talking about

tigerit takes a long time to stage pos yeah getting fixed and conquer a system etc i agree that moongoo should probably deplete at some rate but monthly turnover is far too fast
this will have exactly the opposite impact that you want in order to maintain a few useful systems an alliance will now have to conquer much more space just to stick a few towers in and leave it alone and by leave it alone i mean drop their entire armada on anyone who wants to settle ini understand the argument that holding huge areas of space should be more difficult than it is now but simply making it cost more isk is not a solution as the only way to get enough isk on an alliance level is to conquer more space eventually you reach a balance when the space the alliance holds de iure is enough to pay for the space the alliance uses de facto ideally this balance should be achieved without having to hold any space simply to make isk all allianceowned space should be profitable to operate in
this is only just the basis idea which unable to keep for an alliance the valuable places continuously without fightthe monthly turnover time should be 2 or 3 months or there may be something else
no argument here and i think you are wrongjust go and check 00 areas now the big alliances controlled huge terroritories but when you go there you just see so many empty systems without any pilotsif you cant pay for 3060 system upkeep cost because that is too much isk you need more renters or smaller corps and alliences therethats better against blob and much better for smaller corps and alliances because it is possible to populate the empty systems so better while this is cut smaller parts the big continuous possessed areas
actually i responded and the ticket was mistakenly flagged wrong and closed so i had to open a new petition more wasted time on a petition that has already been open a month but read my petition all the responses are a copypaste of the previous response do you guys even listen to us the customer ccp does a lot of good things in this game other than the gms i really have no other complaints just once i would like a petition in my favor gm panzer does it really take a month to solve 1 petition
the phrase bitter old vets comes to mind and sadly i dont fall in the 30 category  im only 27
yeah  i was going off what my corpies were saying  bandwidth limits and all wanna make sure ive got enough to not get the isp pissy at me for crucible edit  so was able to get the installer at a mates house yesterday  seems that the ships have one of two modes1 gank2 wtf am i wasting lowslots with tanking modulesnow what we didnt get a chance to try out was buffer tanks with a logi cruiser helping to soak incoming dps so that might be a viable setup for the plan these ships seem to have ie the fast roaming gangs youre right that the resists and other things will probably move the numbers i gave one way or the other as for their survivability but not by very much from what we were fitting last night dcu ii and mag field stabsheatsinksgyrostabs in the lows full rack of meta 4 guns with a few rounds of faction ammo  the new bc will absolutely trash mining vesselswe tried it against the normal hulk youll find in hisec completely untanked and theyll diaf in pretty much one volley assuming you hit ran the numbers against haladas nullsec fit and it looks like 56 volleys possibly less if the guns are overheatednow this fit will absolutely diaf to bcs probably even cruisers fit for gank roughly the same fit on a brutix 7x med guns dcu ii mag field stabs will turn the new bcs into scrapmetal in 812 volleys depending on whether or not you overheat
the general rule is if you cant afford to lose it dont undock it if you are stupid enough to undock from jita 44 in a kestral full of plex or something equally as stupid then you deserve what you get
hooray we can finally start taking out those botters up in empire spaceseriously all the minerals in this game are produced nearly risk free in highsec by one of two kinds of players 1 robots2 unemployed neckbeards who spend 15 hours a day multiboxing 10 accounts in hulks eating belts in empire spacei honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
and you are a real moron asuming just the second optionwhat about disabled people that cant do much more then play games  or people that just suck at pvp and still like eve and for number one i agree bots are wrongback to topic nowi will guess what will hapen when us carebears go mining in low sec yeah right the worst scum in eve live in low secthe post was not intended as a whine but more to get ccp to see they created an inbalance in the gameits just to easy to gank someone in highsec it will most probablu ruin the game for new players that mined like mad and finaly got that hulkcovetoryippieee i got my hulk and can only just fly it then some dork decides its funny to gank that noob noob goes rage and quits to play swtor
exactly the question is  is it only a pvp game  should non pvprs really be reviled and shunned by even the designersfor now i guess the answer is known ganking is the new solution  its probably a pendulum effect ieplease the gankers this time around  look at the followon effects  react and retweakwill the t3 bcs be expensive will they require any t3 or t2 components and will their bpos be commonly available or will they require lps etcim guessing from the noise so far they will be normal t1 mfg items but havent seen the bpo details to tell 
so if eve is a pvp game why are there a  load of missions to do solo or with friends eve is both pvp and pve and player and friends versus enviorment
no eve is not only pvp there is ship spinning  however the vast majority of gameplay is actually pvp to some degree  and anything you or i or that guy over there does can and will affect someone else at some point the noncombat people who think the devs are shunning them ie the carebears have the necessary tools to know someones coming and be able to gtfo they even have the tools to not be quite as easy to gank note its still really easy as i mentioned above  but making myself harder to gank means that im not mining as much the new battlecruisers are tier three tech one not tech three just like all the other t1 shipe they need various quantities of isogen megacyte mexallon nocxiun pyerite tritanium and zydrine  the precise well close enough  theyll likely get ninja tweaked just before the patch mineral quantities are available on sisi and some sites do pull the sisi build info already pricewise theyre going to be expensive for the first few months since demand  supply
its depressing for us more solo players but yeah from the looks of it it seems they are swinging away from solo content atm and trying to encourage ppl to join into larger groupscorpsalliances even for pve  ala incursions or at least force them into solo pvp ganking i guess is very much a good thing in their eyes  ie  maybe they think the game is too boring and there are problems with mudflation though theyve supposedly just added to it with incursions so they are trying to instigate more conflict and destruction and make it harder to produce base commodities mining ice harvesting etc  maybe they also figure bots dont run in fleets so the way to combat botting is to combat solo play personally i dont like it  but it kinda seems that this is the new age dawning  there are lots of ppl who think these things will be an improvement  some even say the best way to retain new players is to force them to join larger corps etc where they can be better supported and wont be as apt to leave the gamethe goonswarm wing of the csm also seems to have a complete and utter disdain for any solo play other than ganking and that pretty much the only ppl who run missions or mine are botters or at least thats their political cover story who knows they may have their own bot fleets running 24x7 in their home systems  that would be totally classic goon shenanigans wouldnt it anyway tough to be them once youve beaten every other aspect of the game though whats left other than to beat ccp itself 
you can solo pvp outside of ganking  its just hard mostly because the other guy probably has friendsdont get me wrong  there are some days where i actually enjoy it being quiet in corpchat but overall solo play is probably the one truly wrong way to go about playing eve im looking at the new changes and rather than thinking oh great now i cant mine because of tornado  im working with my corpies to come up with ways to deal with it ive engaged some of the local corps to see if were aligned in our views  not to bring them into our fold or anything  but to simply not be surrounded by neutrals yeah ill own that im generally disdainful of the small corporations that are always on at the same time  but its because these small corps are so apt to get in the mindset that they arent affecting anyone and generally want to see the game go to hell ie i want a pve only flag or similar if being in your 510 man corp works for you  then it works for you but dont expect any special treatment because you want to be a little guy
hey guys isnt it already easy to gank a hulk in hisec in a hurricane  if so no reason to use these the t3 bcs for that actually assuming they will be more expensive  but maybe thats not a good assumption
good god who ganks in a cane brutix is cheaper and better yay gallante pvp and tomorrow catalyst will have 900 dps overheated no you wont need those guns later i know what im using for the next hulkagaddon
it doeswhat part of player versus player do you not understand
there is pve to fuel the pvp note how a lot of pve can actually be interpreted as pvp ninja salvaging exploration racing incursion fleets etcits just a different form of player versus playersorry but eve is and always has been a pvp centered game its why there is no instancing
i believe that malcanis had a really elegant bounty system fix if you can find it it was well thought outi believe that the mac build though cider is a broken system a lot of the time i feel like saying fix it or dont offer it is a really stupid attitude but at some point if you could actually fix it stopping the crashtodesktop for no repeatable reason that would be great and if you cant fix it its probable that the money spent on transgaming could probably be better spend on something realthe iskmineral sourcesink problem is borked mostly by botting also by bounties the wh system is betteras in items instead of iskcaps and supercaps should be much more mineralintensive they are not supposed to be used how they are used right now although well just have to see how hard the nerfhammer comes downthere is much angst about station games undocks docking radius etcon that note aggression mechanics could bebetter like rr
what no i wha whatthat aside there are some balance changes id like to see tweaks to the drake  its great rangedpsspeedehp numbers far exceed the other tier 2 bcs it doesnt need to be meganerfed just toned down but the ship is imbalanced as it sits now just look at the last qen and how many of them are flown the numbers speak for themselves low sec improvements  there is little incentive to live in low sec atm most low sec pockets are devoid of any meaningful traffic there are many well thought out threads about low sec improvements as things stand in eve now low sec is never even mentioned in csmdev discussions most of whats said is 00 this high sec that low sec isnt even a part of the conversation and its saddening ewar rebalancing  ewar is unbalanced most of this imbalance revolves around ecm its strength compared to other racial ewars is clearly out of line target painters and sensor damps are especially in a bad spot one of the best ways to nerf but not really ecm is to give a secondary bonus to eccm modules all other ewar counters sensor booster cap boosters prop mods ect can be used even when not targeted by the ewar that they counter sebos make you lock fasterlonger cap boosters give you cap ect eccm however is only useful when ecm is being used against you if eccm was made to passively lower sig radius just throwing out an example people would be more inclined to fit them since eccm wouldnt be a hitormiss use of a slot thus making ecm less of a problem this is only one suggested solution ofc but there is a big disparity in racial ewars regardless of whether or not buffing eccm is the solution ccp could just as easily hit ecm with the nerfbat so its as unappealing as other ewar
give industrialists a way to build t1 meta level 14 items
ban supercapitals from low sec
yep risk vs reward is the one big problem eve has nowthe highsec incursions that give out silly isk per hour rewards for next to no risk are killing lowsec  nullsec where you can get shot at by any random roam that flies by and you have to defend your space every once in a while if you live in a sov holding allianceby the way i have only ever lived in hot regions of nullsec i imagine living in renter space surrounded by blues for 20 jumps in any direction its probably safer than highsecactually oddly enough lowsec is probably the most dangerous place to hang out in id move all the incursions from highsec out into lowsecand if you are worried about isk inflation id cut the isk rewards from incursions and just hand out a bit more lp youd still give people something for running them but instead of isk flowing into eve from incursions it would flow out from the concord lp storei honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
whats with anti bot fightthat was only pr thingand when will they change that 3strike anti bot mechanic that dont work to 1strike and out
let a player flag some number of items as critical  if there is any attempt to transfer that item to another character it triggers a security question account hackers would not be able to loot a character as easily
totaly agree with that
if i were to make a new interface id have different viewstypes of interfaces that are switchable based on whatever im currently doing but only very broadly such as flying in space scenic a combat focus mode mining industry etc all of them with they own view angles and tailored views of your ship based on your activity broadly all of this is to highlight the way the game looks but still have only what is necessary on the screen
i support this  idea product mmmm boobiesi also support the no pants proposal i love cavorting around my quarters in just my panties this is my signature there are many others like it but this one is mine without me my signature is useless without my signature i am useless
i think for the teen rating that ccp wants to keep they wont be allowed to show panties i am not sure on that though i guess that wouldnt make sense since they show all that in character creation i am ambivalent to that since i am not really interested in walking around half naked i would not be opposed to it either though
it sounds like ccp agrees and is planning on fixing thismake faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
fixing fw is more than just fixing a single style of game mechanic for a single eve community faction warfare pilots fixing fw will revitalize lowsec fixing fw obviously has benefits for participants of faction warfare pirates who live in lowsec have more targets available to them it is a casual pvp environment for highsec carebears it is a casual pvp environment for nullsec bittervetsfw is a small percentage of the player base due to chronic neglect but a much larger percentage of the player base are pilots not in fw who want fw to be fixed so they can a join fw or b benefit from a more populated and active lowsec
this and more im a new player and really want to get into fw when i graduate from euni i want meaningful i was there fw moments that have consequences to the evolving story of new eden i urge all the csm members and ccp to reread hanss excellent fw thread here
good stuff here in this thread especially for my morning coffee some things that i wanted to comment on this is a type of small gang pvp that is vastly different precisely because it is in wh space you need scanners the ship classes are much different t3s recons and sbs are very popular compared to lowsecfw although it is a type of small scale pvp it is vastly different with its own costs many enjoy lowsec style pvp and fw is one of the few mechanics that encourages small gang fights there it is in that sense it is unique and why a lot of ppl in fw use the phrase fw promotes small gangsolo pvpthis perception is precisely why we need fw representation in the csm although the mechanics in this game do encourage blobbing many find it extremely boring fw has done an amazing thing with it though most players limit to small fights and constantly attempt to avoid blobbing the earlier comment about the existance of rivalries in fw is true to the core and because we fight each other all the time there is a ton of if you blob we arent even going to bring ships to fight most of the corps that do blob end up going to null getting bored and coming back to fw with not enough players to blob with  small gang fights againwhat we are asking for is to change the mechanics so that we are not getting punished by the game for our communitys style of playthe above is really just me soapboxing what really matters here
i am not referring to any specific changes my point is that if you wave a magic wand and make fw perfect in every respect so that lots of people want to do it itll just blob up and that this can only be fixed by game mechanics changes that make blobs over a certain size nonoptimal
given two topics this is quite a confusing thread to read i understand that it is a single session but perhaps two threads would have made identifying points for discussion easiersome of these things have been said already in various threads but these things would get my support oh and i am a militia pilot and support hans thread rebalance or remove npc ewar from plexes faction warfare missions to count towards occupancy faction warfare missions to not be farmable in a stealth bomber and interceptor move pirate faction ships into the higher tier plexes if it were up to me i would spilt out the special ability they get and give them it back via a assault ship or hac skill bonus makes them a little more skill intensive for their power level as well faction npcUFFFDs should switch aggrodistribute when other pilots or neutrals enter missions and plexes not to their own militia pilots obviously neutral pilots should be engaged by the faction npcUFFFDs in missionsplex as if they are the enemy regardless of standings they can get a warning message when warping to the plex if you like move plex spawning away from downtime greater lpisk rewards for plexing and pvp kills leave high sec navies in place in order to even out engagements within plexes a further spawn of your own allied factions ships when a war target enters the plex or is already present not to engage the other player but for both sides npcUFFFDs to lock each other up and ignore the players for a time allowing pvp to take place faction war intel mini map  2d region based intel map highlight activity shows number of plexes taken lostmissions completed and militia ships destroyed in the last hour and importantly shows current plexes in progress perhaps with some delayed intel say 5 minutes so it does not take the place of proper scouting and maybe only for the region you are in faction warfare live events  details up to ccp thank you for your support
i would have to be against this there are many reasons why this is a bad idea1 it would remove any need to have logistics at all and people would be able to literally live in wh space without ever having to leave2 the nullbears would go into instand cry mode and it would never end they already want ice out of hs and lswhat makes you think they want to allow it in wh3 wh is already extremely profitableit does not need to be buffed for even more profit in this way4 etcthere are a lot of good ideas in this thread though some of them a lot bigger than a papercut however
actually fw plexing is a mechanic that does work well to prevent blobs the way it works is it should require pilots to be at many places at the same time in many different types of ships that is the blob should be split up the problem is plexing is broken so fw players often ignore it and just fleet up and roam like everyone else in evelet me explain a bit morethere are about 4 regions in the min amarr fw front and the same in the gallente caldari front each of these regions has about 50 systems in play each that is a total of 400 systems that plex can spawn in now plex can be closed in anywhere from 10 minutes to 25 minutes and they only let in size restricted ships minor plexes dessie and down  medium cruiser and down and closed major bc and down and then open major lets all ships in so now lets say fw plexing is fixed you are fighting for amar and like everyone else in eve you form a blob however there are 30 different systems throughout your region with plexes being opened and captured letUFFFDs say half are by your militia half are by minmatar so that is 15 different plexes throughout 200 different systems that you need to get to in the next 1025 minutes it wont work i didnt even mention the fact that of those 15 plexes probably 30 will only let dessie and down in and another 30 will only let cruiser and down in the blob will need to split up if they want to plex efficiently and the beauty is there does not need to be any artificial limits on the size of the fleetshowever ccp will have to balance and iterate on this if there are too many plexes spawning then both sides will run them and never have to fight over them if there are too few plexes spawning then people can form blobs and win them this is what ccp has to iterate on to carfully balance thingsccp has many untapped resources in helping them balance this for example lets say caldari far outnumber gallente gallente can all get in small ships and run minor plexes throughout the regions if caldari canUFFFDt organize as fast they will lose plexes but also they can do things like if caldari gains occupancy of 70 of gallente systems they can let gallente cruisers in minors and bcs in mediums etc if caldare gets 90 of systems then maybe gallente could put bses in all the plexes they can also add pirate factions as needed maybe the guristas will come into play and do the old enemy of my enemy alliance with gallente that is they would both be able to cap caldari plexes so there are allot of balancing options ccp would have but it would take iterations make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
why is plexing broken for me it is because the rats are doing damage to my ships so if an enemy comes in i typically have to warp off or vice versa the other problem is we donUFFFDt even know when people are plexing supposedly the other miltia is attacking our military compounds but no one in our militia knows where or what sort of force they are bringing that is there is no notification system when plexes are attackedthese 2 things lead people to fit pve ships and engage in hide and seek plexing that is how its done most efficiently and that is why people want nothing to do with it that is also why lots of people iUFFFDm not saying everyone have asked that ccp 1remove the rats and 2let the militias know when plexes are being takenother reasons are there is not much of an immediate benefit yes there are tags but because ccp keeps boosting the pirate faction loot drops in null sec the tags have a value cap the 4 major faction lp stores have very limited items that can compete with the deadspace and pirate faction versions of the same items well whether you agree with that or not the fact is plexing does not pay as well as most other forms of isk generation the other issue is no long term benefit or effect i donUFFFDt think ccp should go overboard on this because everyone will then join the winning side but some indication of who has sov would be nice there are a few ideas that have been kicked aroundmake faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
this proposal is on csms list for years already well not this particular variant but ideas to make the bounty system viable it even has already been voted on some years ago all in all it seems to be regarded as not that important not that beneficial not that high a priority as to put some real effort in it or to invest development time and ressources this will only change if we can mobilize significantly more people advocating for it
a single solution to high sec incursions would be to have the security of the system degrade over time until the sansha incursion is finished if players dont clear it quickly concord gets overwhelmed and the system becomes lowsec left long enough the sansha defeat concord and take over and thus the system becomes npc nullsec until clearedi still think players killing sanaha and being rewarded for it by concord with sansha ships is completely assbackwards bang your head on the wall stupid but with the above change players themselves will sort everything else that is wrong with incursions in highsec
when i originally read the preview of incursions before they came out i seriously thought they would degrade a systems sec status this is a good idea and should really be in the game id like to see incursions drop the sec status right off the bat but that might be asking a bit muchbut the one serious fix to incursions would be to make the highsec ones fewer and far between as well as pay out a bit less lowsec should get a boost to the frequency of incursions as well as the payout to encourage people to go out there a bit morenullsec is dying because you can make more isk per hour safely running incursions in highsec than you can running sanctums in nullsec why would anyone take on the immense risk of nullsec when they can get more isk ratting safe and sound in empire spacei honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
waaaaa mummy people in hsec are making isk and i dont like it waaaaa waaaaa waaaaaaaaaa impersonation of the op by me 281111
yeah absolutely ccp should be embarrassed by incursions as it is implemented now it runs counter sandbox style mmos riskreward balance roleplaying and lore its everything eve ought not to be when i first saw what they were doing i was very much taken aback and felt very bad for those roleplaying sansha loyalists because no one got more shat on by this than themwhile i would be in favor on an immediate security drop to low sec status or lower i think a reasonable compromise would be to offer a small window in which those that mobilize quickly and dont delay completion to farm can feasibly do so before the security drops low enough to remove concord protection as you suggest in terms of effort on ccps part drastically reducing the frequency or removing incursions entirely from highsec would be easiest
i am up for mt for vanity items items that make me look the way i want to tobut convenience items or services must be able to be reproduce able by players but also cost the person experiencing the convenience more than if they did a player contract for itie convenience mainly used for those people who have the  to take a short cut but pay more than 50 to triple that what a player could pay to reproducet1 meta 0 loot  to be purchased in null sec or anywhere because it was not stocked by a player in the system assuming a set ratio of arrum to isk the price of the good should be more than what players would be selling them for counted by mineral content the lower sec the greater the price hikethe nex store also purchase one off the market nearest market ensuring a large margin t1 ships could be treated the same way similar to npc seeding a stationpossible pay to win but going in game with real people produces a better effecthire npc alts to guard you in high sec during wardecs even though a merc corp will do the job far much better at less of a priceif bob the isolationist from high sec want eve the single play he should but it should cost him assume arum to isk is a set conversion rateif bob want to buy a raven from nex store he should the nex store will buy one off the local market for him at a 50 mark up and put it in his hangerif bob wants to get all his stuff move from point a to point b  the nex store will move that stuff for him at 50 more than the cost provided by the local market the nex store will place a contract with appropriate collateral and reward similar to marketbob loves nex be cause it saves him the effort but he pays for it though the nose the nex store becomes a conduit that spoon feeds bob and then hires eve players wisely to do the task so the economy is strengthened by nex store not harmed by it though working for essentially hal may creap people outmt for silly stuff likesilly stuffrepairing missiles  much like how snowballs work having to work though resistances to actually rep something on a similar ship fit the repairing missile boat vs a boat fit with reps the missile boat reps at 50so for vanity any thing goesfor convenience the nex store must purchase an object or service similarly but wisely from the eve community so the nex store become the npc buying and moving product for the lazy playerthis should allow ccp to make money from lazy but that money essentially turns into isk to be earned by the logistics players of eveso sliding the slope of p2win UFFFD as long as the nex store prechases the items off the market to sell to the pswin guy or the cost of a service is done by nex the nex must recreate that service as an npc contract for players to full fillso the nex become like this room mate that you pay to play the boring parts of the game for you this room mate is essentially a regular player in eve but a 50 markup is paid so you dont have to interact with anyonewhen a player sees a nex store courier contract up he know some one just paid2win and the player accepting the contract is the one getting paidin the end the nex store becomes a tax for the lazyconvenience option pay to fuel a tower for younpc contract for local area go up courier if goon swarm keeps preventing the use or completion of these contracts then the price for fueling a tower in that region keeps going up till it become just to impractical to even think of paying nex to do the shipping for youalso goods in the closest market are removed from the marketso fueling a tower in low sec or high sec may be easy through the nex but null sec may be an issuegold ammo UFFFD only if a player makes it and puts it on the market to be purchased if the nex cant buy it  it cant sell itthe destruction of courier contracts will increase the price of items in the nex store and will increase the reward on the nex purchase contracts
this is happens when you drink the microtransaction coolaid
jades right dont drink the coolaid
i want to give ccp what they want but i dont want to loose what i wantit is not a case of if i win some one else has to looselike in faction warfare in high sec the local friendly npc faction will help protect youpersonally i would love the opportunity to pay lp points to have the faction npc so set up camp around me during a personal wardec and guard me probably this option would have to be in place before the nex store could sell this optionand the nex store would be purchasing lp points to resell to lazy players
get out
see im not convinced that the ccp we know and love actually wanted microtransaction moneygrubbingsandbox destroying nexcarna rubbish to spoil their dreami think the whole monetizationmtvanityconvenience trash came from a few industry experts who got hired who had very little understanding of what makes eve a uniquely successful indiestyle product and simply wanted to get paid to advise hilmar to follow the crowd and make like a wow sparkle pony i hope those people all got fired is that you ccp zinfandelget outin game
get outthe sound of a closed mind slaming shuttake the time to brain storm a solution that will make ccp additional revenue with out causing those who dont want to pay more the game not to have to pay morewhat vanity or convenience items would not ruin your game if they got introducedis there a spin or way you could make some p2win items palatable like the nex store buying its stuff its sells off the local markets if the nex store did this would it also remove the rmt of those selling ships for real money like a dominix can be sold from rmt side for 495 i would love to see the nex store put these guys out of business especially after plex it is only worth 160nex buys a dominix off jita for 48 mill and then sell it for 85 mill worth of arrumisk on the nex 295this will put the rmt companies out of business and the nex store earn 135 for ccp and a player made his 48 mill isk for building and selling a dominix on the local market though another player may earn some isk doing a nex courier contract from point a to b to represent the moving of the ship from jita to the point of purchase of the objectis there other pay to win option that if done a certain way to involve the eve player base make pay to win paltablelike if i have a wardec can i go to a nex store and say i need protection and the nex store puts out a standard contract for mercs of a certain ranking to accept to complete a task for a newbcan players build wing man drones npc ships that have a sleeper ai and accept limited commands i can purchase off the market to do my bidding introducing essentially crews once they become available to the general player back the nex store can start purchasing these goods and start selling them on the nex store player built henchmentthe nex store turns into this not so compeditive market bot in eve that does rmt though plexes 
ive got it how about we invent this thing called plex what it will do is allow poor players to trade isk for game time isk which they have loads of because they mine while unemployed or studying for exams and rl rich players will have the option of buying isk by trading the game time to the rl poor players ccp will get more subscribers total and some of those will pay extra money for ingame advantage by trading in plex for iskits genius rightthink we should go with that strategyremoved all your stuff because we already have plex that achieves this goal without wrecking the game you have stern competition from nex quislings but i think thats probably the worst idea ive ever heard regarding eve mt
no reallyget out
brilliant idea would totally fix the economy and halt inflation in its tracks never gonna happen thoughalso youd have to account for the one unavoidable isk sink people unsubscribing i know we dont like to talk about this but after the incarna debacle a lot of ultra wealthy people in eve just stopped playing you can see the effects of this in the t2 marketwhen someone quits playing all the isk in their account just sits there never re entering the system also all their market sell orders stay up so the dead account accumulates more isk without spending iti honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
starting amount of sp needs to be increased i recently created a new toon just to take a look at what its like now for new players and its far harsher than it was for me 4 years ago when i created this toon i started with around 800k sp including frig 3 or 4 enough gunnery that all that stood between me and t2 small acs was the small ac spec book and enough support stuff so i could fit all t1 tanking mods frig class as well as speed mods and other such thingsnow you cant fit anything without spending hours on training sure the skills are all 10 minutes each no implants and you are effectively starting with all lvl5 learning skills but there are dozens of those skills you need it adds up fast and you cant do anything but the most basic of tutorial missions without them the result is after creating a new toon you have to wait nearly a day before you can undock even a noob ship with a t1 meta 0 shield booster on it that just isnt a good setup for drawing new players inso i think it would be a good idea to give all new characters those basic skills nothing fancy just the absolute minimum so they can immediately get into the game thus they should have all necessary skills to use any and all race appropriate t1 mods excluding mwds these skills should be the absolute minimum however caldari as a primarily missile race should start with missile skills instead of turret as well i think this works out to about 50k sp starting instead of 5k sp obviously handing out skillbooks as tutorial mission rewards would need to be adjusted as this setup would eliminate their need as a final thought one exception should be made for the sole purpose of demonstrating what skillbooks are the propulsion jamming skill would be perfect for that i think that one was left out when i was a noob too
i think the art department could really help with the new player experience especially with the ui it does look a little windows 31if the ui was a little more intuitive and approachable it might stop people from giving up when they start the gamealso you could make more variety in the things people will see most in the game namely the level 4 mission haven and sanctum set piecesfor example right now there are only two types of havens in the game the rock haven and the gas cloud haven for varietys sake id make as many types of havens and sanctums as i couldi have never really done that much mission running but i assume they could use some variety as welli honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
csm needs more marketing avenues with the actual game of evelikesplash screen on load upthe in cq captian quartersthe in space tv in space near jump gatesif it is in game  the csm will have to work in role playing  some of the topics to avoid emerssion breakinga link to the in game browsers wiki of the csm would be handior a web page pointing to a particular pollone of the larges concerns i have is the developing of official polls the need to be neutral several polls written by the csm during the summer of incarnage were written with incredibly bias if a poll is written it should be done by that csm mediator guy so that the polls will depict an unbias question and provide a valid answerthe private polls that when out during the last summer the market research the csm should view the results of these so they can temper of what they see from the forums that can easily suffer from group think vs what people are thinking on an individual by individual basis they then can leverage their vocal minority input to position that also addresses the information collected from the surveys
disband d
the main thing wrong with plex is that a lot of people have come to believe that theyre entitled to play for free and at an isk cost of their choosing and this at a time of increasing rl economic difficulties reducing the number of people willing to spend rl money and increasing those who want to cut their rl coststhe time price of playing for free is still extremely low if youre unemployedstudent  5 hours a month thats just 75 minutes a week will do it ive been unemployed 75 minutes is nothing when you have 16 or 18 hours a day to kill and some free entertainment to secureover the next 23 years that time price is only likely to increase
when plex go up people are more likely to buy them from ccp and put them on the market its good for ccp to have those spikes in price whats more anyone who would quit over plex prices probably isnt a serious player who will be around for long anyway if you cant deal with a 100 million isk per month difference in your wallet you shouldnt be plexing yet
it is fact that pi prices will change dramatically with crucible and since the importance of pi is increasing so does dustsi just hope that ccp start giving more information about dust development so that when it reaches eve it would mix with it instead of colliding new pos system new sov system
i am getting a ps3 it should be funnow when i propose a twitch based play in eve people can now tell me to go play dusti hope there is special resource collection in dust to bring back into eve for vanity goodsi hope there will be a new class of ship similar to a blockade jumper that can allow me to plan mercs on a planet to fight for me deep in enemy territory
this oh sweet mother of chribba this is a fantastic idea lets not see dust limited to planetside engagements  merc detachments to fight over and seize space structures would be awesome current structure shoots certainly take long enough that a deathmatch could occur inside in real time and scale just fine with eve space battlesthis could potentially be used in everything from pos towers to pi gantries to sov blockade units to even structures in faction warfare plexes about the only limitation might be shiptoship seizures but even than  what if there were a marine ship capable of attaching like a barnacle to a supercap and injecting mercs inside to storm the bridge the whole time the nyx pilot might be engaged in a race against time before the dust players inside his ship reach the pod chamber and kill the clone he would of course have his own paid bodyguards on board to defend
if you want that it means somethinggive dust to have influence in moon goo that would become real fight if you cant get moon goo you can send dusters to cut supplies from you opponents too vote issler dainze for csm7
i think at last dust514 should influence the sovereignty of a system as much as eve does now if you plan to take down a system you have to place sbu take down the infrastructure hub and only then take down the sovereignty blockade unit for now the only thing that keeps this from happening are the ships defending the systems and the poss that spawn them but with dust514 there is the possibility of planetspace weapons and as long as you have the sovereignty of the planet you will also be able to use the planetary defense system to shot invaders that are in a certainly distance from the planets probably each race will have a set of planetary weapons with different ranges strengths and rate of fire and maybe with modular configuration to make them more versatile i think it will seams like picking up targets from a directional scan around the planet and commanding it to shot them like when you do a pos defense from insideso if you plan to take a system you will have to deploy soldiers at the planets to take down this structures or the planets defenses like destroying the force field generator so then you will be able to shot them from orbit with special weapons each faction would have a battleship and a capital size orbital weaponry with orbital range to shot the plannet surface that are useless at space and have certainly characteristics that allow shot trough the atmosphere  like a rail gun with charges that contain a shield generator inside a special artillery with reinforced ceramic shells a beam lazer with low radio lens elf lens or spaceplannet missiles  also planetary attack fleets would have to be well organized because they would need to defend themselves both from planetary counterattack and conventional ship attacks like a pos bashing op so bring some logistics new pos system new sov system
hey guys if we make this really expensive thing easy for everyone to get itll stay expensive right
i say we start with ccp gives us information to discussthread
no youd just drop sov but keep your moons and still hotdrop the crap out of anyone who tries to get in this is already happening to some degree for example check out the kalevala expanse or adjacent regions it used to be much more widespread about a year ago imho this is even worse than claiming sov but not really using the systems
i cant comment on some of the larger alliance affecting issues like moon goo and sov systems however from my perspective as a player that was quite active in 00 pvp 3 years ago only return this month much of the complaints that i hear on these forums about the lack of good smallscale pvp and the poor health of 00 as a whole can be directly attributed to the redistribution of ingame resources that has occurred during the past few yearsthese changes have included the introduction of level 4 missions to empire incursions the increase in gun mining and more all of these changes have a created more opportunities for people to accumulate wealth without leaving empire b lowered mineral prices to the point where mining anything but ice in 00 is not only unnecessary but outright foolishnow i dont think that giving those who dont want to leave empire a better gameplay experience is a bad thing and i certainly dont think that removing any of the current options available to empire dwellers is the way to go however to ensure the health of 00 people have to be be given a real incentive to take on the risks associated with null space currently those incentives simply are not in place  most players can earn just as much isk in empire than anywhere elsehow does this relate to the decrease in smallgang warfare simply that without an incentive to mine mission haul and rat in 00 proportionate to the risk players wont participate in these activities  and those players were typically the targets for the small gangs of old whats the point of taking a small gang to enemy space if there arent missioners to probe down or mining operations to disrupt whats the point of forming a defense gang to defend your space if you dont have anything to defend that a small gang can take down to add a personal anecdote newbies in goonfleet in years past could make a decent amount of money mining crokite in our old home in syndicate the number of miners in the system meant that the space was a frequent target of small gangs trying to disrupt the miners and ratters this in turn lead to defense gangs being formed to protect the miners and ratters the result lots of smallgang combat and emergent gameplaycontrast this situation to today most systems can only support one ratter at a time who will instantly safe and cloak when anyone else comes in the system mining is simply not profitable in 00 meaning there arent the frequent mining ops and solo miners like there used to be due to level 4 missions being available in empire there arent a high concentration of players traveling near the old 00 mission hubs there simply arent the targets that there used to be for small gangsso how to fix these issues and 1 make 00 more attractive to players and corporations and 2 create more emergent smallgang conflict here are some ideas1 create different mineral classes for 00 space with significantly improved yield the goal here is not to replace gunmining but to make standard 00 mining equally if not more profitable also increase pi yields from 00 previously unexploited planets should have more resources2 significantly increase the value difficulty level and respawn rate of of 00 rats currently most systems can only support one or two ratters at a time  not exactly a target rich environment ideally systems could support 4 or more ratters at a time at an income rate on par with other earning options3 create reasons for miners and ratters to defend the space instead of cloaking or docking up while simultaneously providing more targets for smallgang pvp  this could be done by creating a new class of anchorable objects these objects could only be anchored within 100k of a belt and would come in two types i pirate beacon  increases the number and value of rats and faction spawns in the system only one could be anchored per belt with diminishing returns for beacons in additional belts in the system ii rat inhibitor  once anchored causes any current rats in the belt to despawn and prevents additional rats from spawning in that belt both of these anchorable objects would have hp comparable to 2x that of a large anchorable bubble would have defenses equal to lowsec gate guns and could be set up with basic anchoring skills this personal infrastructure investment would give miners and ratters a reason to defend their space make ratting in 00 more profitable make solomining viable without relying on a partner to clear out the rats and give small gangs a target when roaming through 00 space though the implementation of these changes 00 would once again be the land of opportunity for players looking to strike it rich helping balance the risk vs reward equation more players would be populate 00 and would invest isk in 00 infrastructure that is vulnerable to small gangs creating the kind of emergent gameplay that is healthy for eve creating opportunity for players stake for players and targets for players in 00 would go a long way into making 00 space healthier and more dynamic
from a miners point of view i need to be able to mine large quantaties of veldspar and other low quality ores with the same way as we are mining high end  with in the safety of hidden belts as it stands we mine for arknor to sell to jita to buy veldspar minerals removing us from the null sec being self reliant themeplease allow us to upgrade our systems to to focus on empire ores for example if that spoduman rock in the low end belt was veldspar it would be a large step in the right direction would it possible to make tech ii prospecting arrays that would allow us to find hidden belts full of empire ore and less abcsanother idea would be the capital mining drone ships that would used fighter sized drones to mine empire type ores in null secie minimtar dozer would be able to mine only veldspar as if it was a procurer or mine other ores at like a normal mining droneie caldari dozer would be scorditegellentie be pyroxammar be plagin null it is highly dangerous to pull end low end ores as belts are on the over view and super easy to direction scan a ship and warp to it please make mining in null sec focus on production and away from mining for iskplease keep in mind us miners will have awsome scanning skills if it means we are harder to find so if it is harder for us to find a belt then it will be harder for pvpers to find uswould change the game if it was easier to find the higher quality belts than the lower quality ones higher the reward higher the riskice belts are unique and should stay the same as they are in null sec especially how valuable they are now
so we make sovereignty of a certain level a requirement for anchoring moon harvesters lowsec moons can be moved or some draconian imperial decree can be added to help limit it like major increase in stront consumption making defense of far away ls moons difficult governments do like like safety redundancy in the workplace after allpersonally want the moon system to be abolished completely and products added to pi as reactions but doubt that will happen any time soon
i think a sorta theme of resources vs efficiency has to be played in null sec working its way to high sec null sec theme greater the risk greater the reward vs lesser the risk less the lossnull sec should plenty of ore to be mined and can be easily mined in large quantities high sec should where efficiency is easy to come bythe index of the system should effect the refining manufacturing and research efficiency of stations as they used the local resources around them to keep them going no fuel costs and the lower the index the harder it is to find the right people to maintain and employ to do the refining building research to cater to the whims of the pod pilotplacing upgrades that make the place safer should possibly effect the security level of that area and lessen the resources coming from it but on the other hand increasing efficiency of all the aspects of the stationin fact lots of upgrades will not only will increase the security of not only the host solar system but the entire constellation soon to the point of becoming high sec with out concord safer index upgrades would be strategic upgrades like jump bridgesgreater the risk greater the reward vs lesser the risk less the lossplacing upgrades that make the place more dangerous should drop the indexdangerous index upgrades be military and industrial upgrades especially quantum flux generatorsthis should see more smaller fluid skirmishes over closer to null sec systems as there is fewer to make safe moneyso instead of the one way though process of putting a station in every system players will start conserving what areas they are going to develop as this drops their resource collection and is making per hour role play seedi know bob a caldari engineer has spent the last 6 years in null sec for work experience he is now tired of the risk low pay and poor statues living in a null sec stations working for pod pilot dic he is taking the next shuttle out to apply for a job in caldari prime as he can now get a position of value because of his real life work experience on another note UFFFD allow players to upgrade an out post to a conquerable station and allow out posts to be deconstructed UFFFD the owners belongings taken by inter bus to the nearest low sec systemnot sure what programming would be required but this require alliances to choose safety over profitin eve the only thing that should always mean more or bigger is better is the skill points of your character out side of that eve should be a give an take of you exchange an easy control empire or a profitable empire
moon mining should stay the same maybe make more high end moons possibly as the market increases so should the supplyout side of making some more moons they should stay the same as these are like the small nuggets that people fit over the item that people will politically let a moon fall of an ally so they can come to the rescue and take over the moon for their own purposesthough i think some random moon have a temp store of high tech would be interesting something that would change every month make it worth while to once in a while to scan down a moon as it may have 1 months supply of value that you can collect before anyone realizes it a reason to prob moons versus looking up on the 3 rd party sites

easy fixingno sov no jbno stationno sov less isk from npc bountyno sovreduced moon miningsome big alliances hold 100 systems but at least 50 percent of those solar systems is uninhabited thats unacceptableit what makes it unviable the small corps and alliances there because they cant controlling systems there but big alliances can do this easily because their upkeep costs is too lowneed to cut these 6k alliance member numbers to smaller parts and populate the inhabitant spaces what controlled by big alliances but nobody live there
those systems are empty because theyre garbage theyre claimed because game mechanics like the market make sharing a region with nonblues at best obnoxious and at worst harmful
no need to insure your hulk seriously noone will dare attack you in highsec concord has got your back 
insurance is based off the mineral value going into a ship t2 ships are mainly just a t1 hull plus some extra components which are not minerals thus the payout is fineif you cant afford two you cant afford one
i know im entirely too predictable here buttrebor can you convey the message to hilmar that many players still enjoy faction warfare and many more would resubscribe and participate again if it were given some development attention some maintenance on the core mechanical bugs and problems would if nothing else keep a good number of current subscribers around for years to comethank you for your time we appreciate it
please convey to hilmar that ccp are doing the right thing now and if they keep doing it they will be rewarded with increasing sub monies and the love of the players once again crucible looks like its going to produce a fantastic increase in the every day quality of life for the ordinary eve playerbut also that the wounds are very freshly healed and still tender and if crucible is just a bone thrown to keep the dogs quiet with ccp intending to resume its old course again that there will be no coming back from that if they do that the 8 will only be the first drop of rain not the stormweve gotten an awesome fix patch follow it up with a revelationsapocrypha style gameplay expansion patch in summer and an iterations patch next winter both pursued with the energy and passion were seeing now and ccp will have rebuilt that trust
and the new bcs will oneshot a hulk
now you made me feel sad for making fun of someone with no arms and no legs who has to play eve with his tonguejust based on probability the person who goes out mining two to three times a week for 2 hours a day will probably not attract a lot of attention from gankers the 15 multiboxed hulks eating all the belts in one system 237 is what attracts gankersseriously every time i have shot at miners in highsec its always bots that i run intothey never safe up after peoples warnings and our witty comments in localthey never freak out when half a dozen destroyers warp in on them in a beltthere are always 10 of them methodically chewing through the same belts in the same system all day every day in a predictable patterni honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
true bot are a serious problem and eve is pvp centered but there are enough players that like eve and do not want to go to warfor every fart that came out sidewaysi still think when tier 3 bc prices level of at about 40 to 50 miljon isk they are pretty darn cheap hulk gankersand that 900 dps for the gallente catalyst is for the same reason a gank shipi think ccp is trying to get rid of bot miners at the expense of real players thus creating an inbalance in the game
i think if ccp wants to get rid of bot miners there are easier ways to do it ccp can simply flag an account that they have verified as a bot account so that concord does not come to their rescue if ganked make this flag visible to all players ccp wins as they do not lose the money from that account until the owner unsubs on their own the gankers win because now they get free juicy targetsthe player wins because bots are now cut down by the players for the playersthe botters lose thus everybody else winsyes there would be room for error on ccps part in flagging accounts this is what petitioning is for ccp knows who the botters are anyway it would be very hard to make a mistake in this regard
and a pretty damn cool way to fish too makes me wish u could use bombs in highsec
if we were botting why would we be running bots in our own systems when its safer and more profitable to put them into npc corps and run highsec l4s
while sometimes i think the devs think it would be sexier if it were not the case i think on the whole i disagree solo play is a fairly big part of eve and is one of the reasons it has done so well it had a place for players who just want to pop on for a few hours here and there who do not have the consistant time or raw hours to be reliable enough for group playsure it is not the most profitable play style in the game but subpar and wrong are pretty different things esp since sub par is more profitable then just does not play
your cries of pain fall upon deaf earsbring the ganks death to all miners
i would like the statement of broken and fix fixedit is a term that is just too broad and vague especially when i read and i see people describe a feature as broken but they are talking about 2 different thingsi would love to see a procedure format or something the describes a problem sets some assumption or standards and gives solutions other wise fix hibred by making it the same as projectiles will be the common themei would like to see a broken and fix form like they do for bug reports on another notei personally would love to see or have the csm see the unfinished road map of features that were planned but never finish ask which one are easy or difficult to expand on and make some recommendations of what to add onto or requestsuggest a slight detour the directions of some projectskeeping in mind that ccp not only has to keep players but also have to attract new ones
my top priority subject atm is the bounty system make it work and introduce a whole new profession en passant there is a proposal how to do that with limited effort and investment discussed at this board right now
my oftrepeated wish list netural logistics need to be prevented from docking if they rep someone who is actively engaged in hostilities war decs should not transfer but stick to their target and be extended to allies this means a wardec against a corp stays on that corp even if they join and then leave an alliance it would also allow wardeccing a corp inside an alliance encouraging the alliance to remove that corp if that is part of the objective this solves dec scraping and makes it possible to choose specific objectives make the initial wardec more expensive but keep the weekly upkeep the sameedit i too would love to see the bounty system overhauled
with the winter expansion coming along we all know that the supercarriers will be getting a nerf the nyx and aeon will receive a 20 hit to shields armor and structure hps and the hel and wyvern will receive 10 hits to shield armor and structure hpsone thing that i saw in the patch notes was that on titans and dreads the requirement for capital drone bay is being removed seeing as those ships no longer have drone bays on them that makes complete sense they are removing that part of the ship so they are removing the components from the build requirementshowever the part i am not quite understanding is why the supers have not had a reduction in build requirements they will have 10 and 20 less hp which would mean logically that they would have 10 and 20 less shield emitters armor plates and whatever the equivalent for structure hp is if you are going to nerf the supers then go for it but reduce the build requirements as well the build requirements were massively increased when they received the buff that made them what they are now so it only makes sense that when they are being nerfed so are the build costs
yes need changes but not reduced requirements but increased building time against supercapital blobsneed to slowing capital online games
the sticky at the top of the page is apparently outdated based on its referencing of csm 4 were now on 6 and the old voting system for proposals which no longer exists also the csm have stated that they dont actually have anything to do with what ccp decides to work on and only apparently assist in feedback during the development process the wording of this old sticky greeting is misleading to many players who might want to get involved in the political process and causes confusion about the current role and responsiblity of the csm
a couple of small tweaks id like to seerebalance cloaks that arent on covops recons and black ops battleships the ability for ratters mission runners and the like to simply cloak up when a hostile comes into the system makes for poor gameplay revisit the command ship class while some are great others have been overshadowed by tier 2 battlecruisers and need a small bump in cpu grid and slots to justify their price it would also be nice to see fleet command ships being used for more than sitting at a pos during fleet engagements
removing local chat is the solution for that not messing with cloaks non specialist ships that equip a cloak take significant penalties for doing so ideally local would be replaced with a new upgraded scanner system where people like you can hunt ratters etc down but they can also avoid your detection entirely based on player effort skill and no doubt a bit of luck of both sides things like cloaksspeedeccm are what allow the weak or outnumbered to outmaneuver and evade the strong and the numerous thats good gameplay eve doesnt need anymore reinforcement of zergblobing
tnx you are true caldari 
take a look at that punkbuster program that is used to catch cheaters in fps games we could use something similar to catch bottersyeah its kind of an invasion of privacy what would you guys think if ccp came out with some sort of program that specifically looked for eve botting programs and didnt do any origin style dataminingi honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
i would be in favour of eve code that looked for the major botting programs and flagged the relevant account if they detected them it wouldnt hurt anyone but bots after all and botters can die in a firealso not a fan of the rmt thing why would you give any amnesty to the buyers of isk without them thered be no sellers so both need to die
repackaging ships in the sma would be great too itd be nice to be able to haul ships out the same way they were hauled in battleships in an orcas cargo hold for instance
i simply wish to be counted among those who support hans jagerblitzens excellent work championing fw especially his efforts on threads such as the list compiled at faction warfare moving fowardi wholeheartedly endorse everything that he is trying to do for fw and hope that the csm would too
this one was apparently stealth patched with crucible yaycsm 7 secretary csm 6 alternate delegate twostepeve on twitter my blog
agreed this is a bit of a nasty papercut for pos residents
dear eveplayeri propose a balance to the self destructing due to people not able to log off anymore the remaining way to grief is to self destructat this moment you can self destruct and you dont generate a killmail no loot drops insurance is paid out while it makes sense that no loot drops you do self destruct after all its dumb that there is no killmail provided the insurance is something that is also questionablewhat i propose generate a killmail for the last person who shot at the ship damage included or not depends on technical problems i presume no loot drops pay out no insurance this way sd is used for the primary reason it should be used denying people your stuff it doesnt however cover the fact that your ship was destroyedalso the timer should be dependant on the ships size the timer should be that it forces people to use enough dps to be able to kill it a reasonable timer would probably be around 56 minutes for a super a pod could be lowered to 2030 secondsconclusionthe csm has recommended this once already but nothing happened with it then ccp is doing a good job fixing a lot of issues with the game lets make this the next onethis issue was alrdy raised once by alekseyev karrde 20 december 2009the minutes it was discussed in csm meeting 4002  meeting minutes 20091220 1818 results wereself destruct should revoke insurancepassed 72 mrs trzzbk korvinselfdestruct should generate killmailpassed 72 teadaze song liselfdestruct should overheat all modulesfailed 72 alekseyev karrde sokrateszselfdestruct timer depends on ship sizepassed 81 korvin

this sounds reasonable to be honesti like that a player can still prevent you from getting their fit by self destructing but it doesnt make sense that they get insurance for blowing up their own shipthe timer issue is also a good one  from a rp perspective even it would take a lot longer for all the crew to escape from a supercarrier than from a cruisergood idea

jogyn is so hot
i do not believe that we should nerf the russian cowards any more following the super nerf all they have left is there self destruct timers
supporting this
1the fact that you get insurance from selfdestructing your ship is silly its been an incredibly  concept ever since eve was released and with all the other changes that are happening at the moment its time to fix it
ive been saying this for a whiletheyve yanked insurance for concord do the same for sd its logical and consistent and killmails are a vital part of the way some people operate especially mercenaries denying them killmails by blowing up your own ship is silly its enough to deny them loot
one problem which could arise with the proposed system is the possibility to use this modified bounty system for griefing purposes you want to create tears just slap a bounty on that unsuspecting miner any idea how to avoid that
addressed earlier in the thread that unsuspecting miner would have to be at 10 security for this to happen
i tried to keep the idea as simple as possible so not many resources would be needed hell all it really is is math and not a lot of it one set of references to a master table thats updated infrequently and probably offline
my mistake pay to win is the purchase of items off nex that provide a game advantage to more than anything that can be found in the game by standard means of play i would also think it would include the items purchase from the nex store but never removed from the market which will cause a deflation on the goods that the player put on saleconvenience item i believe is the purchase of a service or item that another person can produce such as if an item is purchased off of nex then that same item is purchased off the market by nex currently a service provided by evegiga and virtual items eu through rmt  which is against the eula putting rmt companies out of business would be a selling point for me which results in in decrease cpu and more money put into the game with out these rmt companies leaching off the gamethough for me to say yay to mt convenience items the item sold on nex has to be removed from market the nex must attempt to simulate the movement of goods though npc courier contracts or the like so the logistic players dont loose their lively hood nex needs to have a large markup when selling the goods so players with out much effort can easily undercut the nex storethe security level of the system the item is purchased at should be a variable as lower the security rating the harder it is to get goods to the person the price of items purchased from the nex will go up if the npc contracts are not filled as time progresses and quantities are purchased this point in necessary unlike many games eve does not have an UFFFDinventory system connect by worm holesUFFFD so i dont want the nex store to be an easy work around blockadesthe high price nex users are paying for will be instant delivery something other rmt sites cant doyes jade constantine UFFFD we have had plex for some time which is fantastic which allow poor player to grind resources for rich players in exchange for game time it has worked well in keeping many people playing and expanding the universebut how does that retain the older player who has less and less free time because he has money but not the time to even fit his shipif he could he would like to pay a few bucks on line buy a prefit ship at his local station and do a couple of level 3 missions before he goes to bedflying 15 jumps to jita and then back to your mission location takes up to 2 nights worth of you time especially when you are working 14 hours a day for some really good money and would just like to blow something up and then go to bed i am not really to concern with loosing my ship eitheror how about the new player UFFFD does not no all the tricks of the trades so has to learn to salvage pieces of ship items because nothing is close buy for me to build a decent ship with and what is this thing called jita or a trade hub i have no idea what that is since my newbie station is not near therei would be willing to pay a few isk to buy a prefit kestral just to get started if some wanker pops me no loss for 50 cents worth of aurrum i can buy another shipthese two play styles would viably exist providing more fund for ccp to move the game forward in new directions with out leaving other sections neglected the world is changing and the old subscription model is being less and less amiable received nowadaysdiablo 3 in fact diablo iii is going to come out with a integrated rmt model which blizzard is able to receive a  from each transaction a play makes to another player what would you say if eve turned free to play and the game was funded purely by rmt though the nex where if you wanted to make real money off the loot you get from your complex can be sold on nex and you get UFFFDpaidUFFFDto play eve vs paying a subscription will put the pirate rmt guys out of businesseven though i feel eve is the centre of my universe i realize it is not the centre of everyone and my beloved game needs to adapt if its greatness shall continuei welcome comments like jades it is helping me to develop my position of convenience mt as apparent from my changing opinions though out this thread
ive said it before valve has already demonstrated how to do microtransactions right with team fortress 2 even before it went f2p they were making good money selling vanity items and all ingame weaponsccp already has a method by which you can purchase weapons buy a plex sell it for isk buy your stuff i see no reason to place gameplay items in the nex clearly plex are in demand enough to motivate people to put them on the marketwhat ccp needs to do is put more vanity items in the nex paint jobs logos on space ships and tshirts tattoos ad space on billboards and cq screenshell id even support something similar to tf2s crates where you find containers which can only be unlocked at the nex and are guaranteed to contain rare vanity items that cant simply be bought
this is the best thing i have read here
dear ccpi refuse to get excited about captains quarters the nex store or anything else incarna related until i can buy a laser pistol bust into their captains quarters and shoot someone straight in the facei honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
using this logic our airmarshals should be armed with ninja blades and throwing stars which would be kind of cool come to think of it instead they use something called frangible ammo it breaks apart rather than going through the outer hull of the craft in theory anyway less likely to cause depressurizationi think id rather see gunfights than widespread sword fighting but knife fights is interesting it messes with my sense of eve if everyone is running around with cutlasses and rapierspersonally i could see integrating something like deus ex which i just ran through recently timelines are way off but tone and content wise that kind of thing could fit great into evethe more obvious blasters in the bar scenario would be easier to imagine happening bar
after i started the game and played through the tutorials i still understood almost nothing about the gamei didnt know how player corporations workedi didnt know anything about aggression mechanicsi didnt know how wardecs workedtheres a lot more that i didnt knowtheres plenty that i still dont i mention those things in particular because they definitely impact the early play of most new playersid been conditioned that eve gamplay primarily consisted of finding an agent and getting a mission if you dont have prior mmo experience i didnt and you dont have an experienced friend to help you i didnt youre largely on your own to figure out how the game workstheres not an easy solution to this but i can say this much right now the tutorials deal primarily with the interface and introducing you to various pve content and ship modules it needs more
add the new nebula onto the map to further build a sense of presence freelancer anyone
heres an idea for getting people to vote create a new faction frigate and only give it to people who vote it doesnt have to be dramiel 20 just something worth havingor maybe a vanity item or a choice that faction frig a good vanity item or insert third good idea here
if only it were actually a democratic process its anything but theres nothing to stop csm members from voting for or against anything they want whether or not the constituency that elected them wants it thats a particular problem for groups outside the big alliances as long as metagaming is allowed in the csm it not only isnt democratic it never will be if the goal is to have players directly interface with ccp to assist in the overall development of the game the csm is actually the worst possible way to go about it the crowd sourcing method and other common rl tools for gathering opinions and information from particular constituencies should be more than enough to fulfill the underlying purpose of the csm direct democracy in eve is entirely possible why should ccp limit itself to the opinions and machinations of a handful of people why take the risks associated with ndas and such while i have no direct evidence of anyone acting on information gleaned from their roles as csm members it seems odd to me that ice interdiction coincided so perfectly with a complete change to the pos fuel system enough with fake politics and a csm that doesnt truly represent all of the games constituencies
exactly what i was talking about what is 10050 and no its far worse than just 100 or just 50
i just want infoget me all the infothanks
remember that eve is a massive manyfaceted universe and all those facets need attention consideration and new content also it would be great to see the game mechanics be made more consistent and exploits be patched rather than bandaid rules used for years
giant secure containers are secure in space no one can see in them without the password so why are they not the same in cargowith a ship scanner people can see the contentsive learnt this the hard way and its not logicalfix it 
secure containers arent secure unless anchored in spacethat would be the only explination i can think of at the moment stop the evemailUFFFDspam
which is why i used quotation marks around wrong in my comment i do like the break from group things to just chill and check markets or mine or pretty much anything  its not terrible to run solo  but the people who get up in arms that there needs to be more solo content at the expense of everything else are what really drag things down for the pro solo play crowdif you wanna see what happens just look at the threadnarok from earlier this year because of incarnai will disagree that solo play is what has made eve do so well  you dont hear about the dude who plays for 2 hours in a mission drake in the gaming news  you hear about the 1k man fleet fights or the huge scams that seemed legit for years that netted one or two people hundreds of billions of iskas for the guys who have only a few hours a week to play  there are tonnes of corporations in hisec that are centred around that playstyle
if an afk miner or one that is lazy and not playing safe loses a ship to the new bcs i say its their probleman active properly playing miner will almost never lose a ship to a gankermine lazilly you make the job of the ganker easymine properly dscan not required and the gankers move onif you want to know how to mine with low risk of being ganked other than if you  someone off please feel free to message me in game mail preferred
last i checked the resources in 00 automagically renew just like they do everywhere else in fact 00 is the place to go for moongoo etc so hey heres a thought dont burn through so many ships and you will have more money unfrozen caveman nullbear your money saving ways are strange to mecarebear i know but hey if it works for warren buffet and donald trump it can work for youunfrozen caveman nullbear hey man you got tree fiddy i came up a little short ganking a minercarebear hey i gotta gounfrozen caveman nullbear being a nullbear ranger costs money lazy ass carebear wont give me what i am entitled to i guess i will go fill my diaper and cry to ccp they always seem ready to help nullbearsunless i am mistaken 00 has multiple empires currently in place that are quite stable check a map and you will seeheres a fact about empires they can be really boring to operate treaties tributes trading taxing and tolls are some of the joys of bureaucracy how about military garrisons training and patrolling and trying to avoid burning military resources in pointless and silly ways because we need them for offensedefenseoh and as a rule they want the greatest reward with the least risk possible true story empires are not built by constant combat and piracy not if they want to last rather they are most successful when they are built by taking and holding space taxing tolling collecting tribute producing trading patrolling sometimes defending sometimes attackingmore needs to be done about making this game more entertaining for more people rather than catering to wannabe ethugs virtual badasses and commandosintheirownminds who want to feel specialthen again that may be exactly what ccp wants their behavior over the years certainly appears to support that ideaits not piracy if they took millions of isk out of their own pockets now is it
its standard night for your alliance the enemy coalition has been encroaching on your territory putting up towers so your forming up to fight back youre in a moros a dreadnaught the 3rd most powerful ship class in all of new eden as you sit in the friendly pos a mixture of capitals and support start landing around you its almost time to go the support gets on the titan for bridging a scout reports a spike in local 3 jumps away from the target system it seems the enemy are not going to sit by and let you destroy their pos your spy on the enemy comms reports they plan to warp straight to the tower and start repairs a friendly cyno hic is already in the target system he gets into position 30km off pos in line with the enemy in gate 2 jumps 1 jump they jump in and your hic bubble goes up they warp straight into his bubble and he pops his cyno your fleet jumps as the system initializes you start following the fcs primaries easily tracking enemy ships once they are webbed down on the other side of the pos you can see the remnants of the previous nights engagement capital and battleship hulls too large disintegrate even as they explode under heavy fire as the fight draws to a close it is obvious you have won a decisive victory many new space hulks are now scattered around this moon it will be a warning for future invaders to stay away so the basic idea here is to have the ship wreck graphic not be destroyed when someone destroys or salvages the wreck i think this would create a more interesting universe where we could go on a pos bash or to a fleet fight and see the remnants of the previous weeks slaughter a mark of shame for enemy pilots passing through the system seeing their alliances fleet from the other night decimated making the fights we have create a visual mark in the system not just on the sov map levels of immersionproposalthis is for 00 and low sec only  concord runs a ship cleaning service where all wrecks are automatically destroyed to keep space clear only battleship hulls and above would leave behind the wreck models after wreck icon is targeted and destroyedsalvaged other smaller craft are too flimsy and fall apart due to the rigors of space without their shieldsarmor happens anywhere in the system apart from gates  gates are unstable areas due to the energy they use and this speeds the process of disintegration can include gates if it wouldnt get too clutteredbattleshipcapital wreck models last 24 weeks super capitals last infinitely a constant mark on the universe this depends on how much it would affect game play currently even when you remove wrecks from overview you can still see them in space so i wouldnt think it would be too different wouldnt affect cloaks as the wrecks are insubstantial just debris
in order for wrecks to exist visually they must be an item therefore they will effect cloakseven missiles will decloak someone if they pass close enough really hard to do thoughalso the lag would be horrendouscertain stations and null sec areas would be unusable because of the insane number of wrecks created in a week
definetly a yummy idea though mayeb supercapitals just stay around for a month or 2 maybe make the whole of all the wrecks from frigs up saty for a monthy or 2 would eb interesting palces to explore and make it after the month ro 2 is up they dissappar since everything in sapce not around an orbital body will drift away adn anything in an orbital body wil slowly crash into the atmospherebut this is definetly an idea only suitable for once the war on lag has been won
well seeing that ccp is runing into financial problems and that technically there should be no harm in doing this i support this
caldari are missile based not hybrid based if i wanted a hybrid boat id go for the talos which by the way is almost exactly the same why release a laser ship a projectile boat and then 2 hybrid boats how is that even balanced that basically gives all missile users the finger a caldari player have to skill up in hybrid turrets just to use it to clarify i already have all the skills for large hybrid but alot of my corpies dont they teched up to ravens and scorps so they cant use a ship of their own race because they dont have the weapons for itsimply put we dont need a hybrid ship there were no missile ships released in this patch and there should have been its not fair for caldari players that you release two gallente ships in one patch hellz
tier 3 caldari ships are turret based all is working as intended less tears more pew pew
but you are wrong caldari do use hybrids look at the ferox rokh cormorant and assorted frigatesif they cant use a ship of their own race because dont have the skill for it it means that they are poorly skilled and should realise that theres more to caldari than just missiles
but all of those give you the option of doing a hybrid missile boat they give you the option of adding in missiles should you so desire the naga doesnt give you the same freedom therefore not working as intended
yeah im a big fan of my blastertorp rokh
well the threads not about your sarcastic replies about whether or not you think a torpblaster rokh is effective the threads about the fact that we got 4 new ships released and 2 of them were almost identical using the same weapon class and missiles didnt get any sorta love this patch
you mean the jewcrew did not get any love from the new shipsam i right
troll central up in here p i suppose you are right p but i would like at least an explanation on why this happened i understand that caldari has a minor hybrid side to them but to release two ships that are almost identical is kinda wrong i can fly any of the new ones but i started as a caldari player id rather have a true caldari ship as my new play toy p
im glad to see another caldari hybrid boat especially in the form of a battlecruiser id also like to see the tengus hybrid sub get some improvements saying caldari are missileonly is like saying amarr are laser only you have to ignore several good ships to make that claim
true but when you think of amarr you think of lasers minimatar is projectile weapons gallente is hybrids and caldari are missiles every other race got a ship in line with their primary weapons system which ensures that a majority of the people that fly that race are able to effectively use the ship
if a player focuses on only one weapon system that supposedly belongs to that race of boatslike missiles then that player has effectively wiped out a huge portion of the boats that fall into their racial line in which they can not fly effectivelyamaar needs lasers missiles and drones
every race has a primary and secondary weapon systemgallente hybrids and dronescaldari hybrids and missilesamarr lasers and missilesdronesminmitar projectiles and missilesthe only reason people think gallentes primary weapons are drones and caldaris primary weapons are missiles is because of the poor state that hybrid weapons have been in for so long with the recent buff this is less the case
my guys will check that tomorrow after dt read and support dont mess with our whs what is your stance on wh stuff
the fw bandaid has in fact been applied and it is a very welcome one however it a temporary fix as im sure it is intended to bejust from today there has been a surge of activity which is a testament to what a massive source of gameplay fw will be when a little quality time is spent on itthings are definitely on the right course people have suggested starting with this quick tweak to get the ball rolling and then to allocate development to an overhaul before the tweak turns stale i foresee a new set of problems evolving as players settle into the resulting gameplay because todays fix does not have longevity that the mechanics need to boost and maintain the activityso step 1 has been completed lets not stop theresourem itharen  congratulations lady kadesh you have been selected by trial of fire and blood under the watchful eyes of god to represent lord khanid as his champion in the imperial succession trials yc117
any news about it
jesus misread that
1 allow repping with no penalties if you rep an fw member when your pirate2 allow other factions to enter enemy space if a person enters into war and join militia then why should they be allowed to just carebear in highsec and be protected thats wrong they know what the risk is when joining fw

i think its silly first off a simple ship scanner will tell you someones fit its not like its an easilykept secretsecond once your ship is destroyed the wreckage could be sifted through and your entire build known just because modules cant be reused doesnt mean they are completely and utterly destroyed

i will add my voice to this i havent read all responses so im not sure if it was proposed butplayers get 25 of destroyed ship value  destroyed loot just as proposed in op up to the level of bountybut at the same time victim gets its insurance reduced by the same exact valueto prevent situation where a t2 ship destroyed gives victim 0 insurance insurance being much smaller than ship real value the minimal insurance as if there was no insurance at all is always paid out this minimum could possibly be higher lets say to the point of cheapest insurance versionthis should prevent any form of gamin system apart from some really extreme mineralinsurance value fraud what do you guys think of thisread and support dont mess with our whs what is your stance on wh stuff
eve onlines handling of bookmarks now personal locations has improved significantly with the crucible expansion there is a problem thoughcrucible added a limit where if you already have 13000 locations then you are prohibited from creating more until you delete enough of your existing locations to drop you below 13000 again you can still import them from other characters but you cant create them there are 1907 solar systems in empire space 3294 solar systems in outlaw space and 2498 solar systems in wspace for a total of 7699 solar systems that players can travel to source for numbers most players wont reach 13000 but against that many solar systems 13000 personal locations seems limitingpresumably the limit exists to protect the database which is understandable in and of itself however i would like to ask ccp to elaborate in a devblog how bookmarks work from a technical viewpoint thank you in advancenow to go shove my bookmarks into station canssurvivor of teskanen fan of john rourke i have video tutorials for eve online on my youtube channel
i do rather like the implication of the name personal locations as it would suggest that we will see nonpersonal corpalliance locations in the futurebut i agree it would be easy to acquire thousands of bookmarks if you made just one or two per gate for scouting purposes
never mind the quantities of bookmarks one can accumulate over an extended stay in wormhole space i accumulate them at a rate of 300350 a month
thishalving incursion payouts is too extreme many people fly incursions in extremely expensive well coordinated groups their payouts need to be higher than that of mission runners however i agree that payouts are currently too high across the boardso increase competition it should be possible to find a balance where the best incursion fleets earn extremely large amounts of isk as they do currently whilst your average groups earn only mediocre amounts whilst aspiring to join the ranks of the better players this would probably also encourage organisation of corporation run fleets over public channel fleetsrandomizing some events within the incursions themselves may also address the risk v reward balance and at the very least make incursions a little less mindnumbingly dull currently incursions require slightly more patience than missions in the form of finding a fleet but once inside are incredibly monotonous and simple random jamming ship spawns or unpredictable dps spawns would mean that the fc at least has to think when calling targetsas for a system security drop im guessing there would be feasibility issues with doing that outside of a downtime i also strongly suspect that the moment the system security dropped the incursion would be abandoned effectively making this solution identical to a decrease in high sec incursion spawnsthe one foreseeable downside to this and probably ccps reason for leaving incursions as they are is the public outcry any decrease in profit from incursions would cause once you have given a player base something it is difficult to take it away even if it would in the long term be better for the game increasing competition in incursions rather than decreasing payout outright might negate this somewhat but imho there is no real solution to the problem
nope you know i find it funny how you keep missing what nullsec people want we want more people not more isk actually thats not true everybody wants more isk but the main problem we have in nullsec now is that there arent enough pilots there hence the ongoing shift in enticements to entice people to get into lownullsecill let you in on a secret we already have i make more money off of jita market fuckery than i ever would doing incursions and i spend significantly less time doing so
agreed isk is not really a valuable resourse pilots and time are the core commodities in eve that said i really dont think making high a worse place is a good way to make folks want to move i think my real disappointment in incursions is what they have become as opposed to what they could have been the idea of ecposing high seccers to coordinated tactics and enticing them with higher profit has potential potential that seems wasted
yep  buff miningseriously though it wasnt nerf everything i dont do but nerf the safe things a bit more
how about he puts up a post on the sell orders forum and says want to buy 10 prefit apocalypses with this fitting includes fitting this ammo includes ammo and amounts and these rigs lists rigs  items must be preconfigured and i need a can of quafe and dancing girl in the cargo hold all ships must be named after noUFFFDl coward plays all ships to be supplied complete to hek system minmatar space i will by 25x the total jita purchase price of all items for this service and guess what other players will take him up on that and deliver the ships being paid a premium themselves for helping out a rl cash richtime poor player who pays for the service by tradiing those plex he bought by doing an extra hours overtime at workthis is what can happen now you dont need a nex abortion messing up player interaction in the eve sandboxwhat you see as a problem eve players see as gameplay i would prefer a freetoplay eve with microtransactions to a hybrid subscription  microtransaction model any day of the week but both of these options are a million miles behind the continuance of the subscription model as primary income and guarentor of all the games content for everyone yes gaming is changing in some ways  but its a false argument to hold up the actions of an industry giant and claim everyone needs to emulate that by the same logic we should be removing death penalty introducing giant intelligent pandas and dumbing down eve to be furry friendly space friends online just because the market leader is forging this agendaof course the irony of your remark about diablo3s integrated rmt deal is that ccp have something similar already in plex they legitimized the use of rl currency for ingame advantage and ensured they made extra income from the plex sales done deal and its the only form of microtransaction eve online needs or really accepts so consider this point that eve itself the inspace game doesnt need microtransactions beyond what it already has with plex which enable rich players to buy convenience and advantage through plexisk conversation without destroying opportunity for player interaction in the sandbox if you want to find a place for microtransactions through nex then i say go out of game items  sell shirts coffee mugs magazines posters evethemed bits and pieces out of game but keep the gamespace pure of this stuff and preserve the essence of the game that kept it alive for 8 years and make no mistake most games if theyd been as comprehensively abandoned as eve was for the last 2 years would probably have already died by now eve survived because people know there isnt anything like it elsewhere in the gaming universe and they wanted it to live despite hating what nexcarna had done to itif ccp want more profits they need to grow the game and get it back to a positive upwards trend in subscriptions i dont believe the rot about the subscription model being dead because now in this current world environment of financial woe and uncertainty gamers want suspension of disbelief and insulation from the austerity and greed politics in their day to day life its easy to justify 15 dollars a month or free if fund your sub through gameplay as the cost of your leisure hobby  but change the game to a mt model and everything becomes an unwelcome reminder of how nickel and diming is prevelent in the modern world people play games to forget the bullshit of the real world not to be reminded of it by ccp monocle and ccp thousand dollar jeans people have always joked that eve spreadsheets online seems like a second job but turn it through mt monetization into eve online  second bankrupcy and youll truly see player base erode
plex is all they need and now they are not paying for two separate game development cycles on the income raised by eve subscriptions the only must have nexmt argument is pretty void just no all this stuff is core content just the same as engine trails nebulas turret effects are content you cant decide that a ship logo is vanity and an enhanced turret model that does absolutely nothing gamewise the old one doesnt is not vanity its a crazy comparison this is a subscription mmo subscription should get you all the graphic content that is worked on through our subscripton moneynow i know youre trolling
i am concern that mt items will circumvent the player who grind for ccp to make quick buckthis is why i am suggesting that nex begins to act at a rmt service this will not only to help disable the current rmt badies but also make ccp money to put back into the game so i recommend allowing nex to make a percentage profit on the resale of player made items means there will never be a p2w option it ccp wants to bring in those items that would be desirable like remaps ship colours logo unique items etc they will have to let the player base grind them though lp or some form of industry to be placed on the market for the nex store to resellthis would encourage ccp to follow the directive of everything is player made such as pi some thing the current nex path is moving away fromwith the broker of goods brought to players conveniently approach the nex store can have a UFFFDmassive variety of things to sellUFFFD my experience with ddo and they have convenience items that i could take the time to sell essence on the market to get the plat to buy the 3 chain a 2 day affair or i could spend the 25 or so store points to buy the 3 chain and it goes into my inventory so i can get to doing adventure right awayddo just makes it and simple make it a no drop item which eve does not haveddo also had things like seasonal candy canes that could make anyone a healer which made the item a p2win item as you could not find such an item via playing the game normally will plex simple be a solution as it has allow the effect of mt to happen over the last 5 years i worked over the previous 3 years but the last 2 years more efficient spoon fed mt has over run the industry if eve wants to remain competitive in this market it needs to make things easy spoon fed much like ddo or other games in summary make the current fashion items player made or lp itemsmake future items like ship colouring into player made or lp items have players place this on the markethave nex buy these items from the market as it as it sells them as mthave nex charge a large markup to compensate for the convenience this is where ccp makes their ccp gets its mt and players are will never have to worry about p2win ever becoming an issuei have never read the reports nor know the past work of these experts on mt so i cant say if ccp is on solid ground or if the vocal minority are unreasonably panickyall i know i never want my hours of mining grinding ore to have to compete with some one who is just paying for a good some item made out with out grinding but if some one want to pay too much than any sane person wants to for my item i put on the market even though i dont get the extra profit beyond what i ask for i say go a head it is not my money being wasted itccp is already providing real world items for sell but those dont bring in the potential revenue as selling instant gratification items in game small gratification that is conveniently put at ones feet so you can casually just pay pickup and play ccp needs to find additional revenue or raise the monthly fee of the game ccp monthly fee has not keep up with inflationpersonally i want the lazy self indulging rich guy often with not much time on his hands to pay for the costs of running the game that is not covered due to inflationthe broker to make the purchase of items off the market convenient approach wont receive a negative selling items flat out at this is a slippery slope first vanity items like boots or a paint job then convenience items like npc couriers then instant recustomization like plex for remap then p2win like gold jovian ammo

eves long term health has to do with income to keep ccp in business and therefore eve up and running all else is secondary including everyones fantasies of a 100 sandbox game ccp gets to say how it goes and has the right to alienate thousands of potential customers and leave millions of isk on the table if they want to you dont get toccp was at least smart enough to see that eve as 100 nullsec would hamstring its growth otherwise dont you think they would have at least shrunk empire space by now if not made it smaller to begin witheve has certainly held on and certainly has a devoted following but hasnt exactly been a smash hit it is still a mostly unique game and although it opened almost a year and a half before wow it just celebrated 350k subscriptions eve has staying power yes but isnt setting the world on firewhat is the point of lowsec and nullsec if the payments are balanced against the risk its not like theres any real risk when death means nothing and a new ship is just seconds away provided one follows the rule to not fly anything one cannot afford to replacehumans as a group prefer living in highsec type places rather than low or nullsec and the sooner people decide to accept that as reality the sooner they will be able to work out how to make this game more interesting for all players or they can keep going and keep the same subscription numbersthis game needs treaties and trade and tribute more than it needs robbing from people who choose to play a style of game that ccp allows even though they might prefer more people spend more time screwing each other over just to give the money to ccps pet player segment
the problem with that is the moment someone puts on kevlar those things are useless a knife however will still kill you through a bulletproof vest and it can be excused as a tool where as a gun is very obviously there for one reason

an opportunity for small corps and alliances to move to null without having to bow down to super alliances nor get destroyed within a matter of hours after going out to nullcurrently that opportunity doesnt exist except in wormholessummary of eves last four expansions
its time to nerf moongold its become saturated every valuable moon location is now known and instantly taken by the power blocs wiht a billion caps etc and there i snothing the average person can do about it its simply not fair that all an alliance needs to do si put up a pos and thats it to make billionsproposal randomise moongold every 3 months make people work for it and let everyone have a chance to hit the jackpot
1 stop allowing alliances to hold so much space2 alliances can only settle in one region and own only 51 of the stations in that region this gives more chance to others and makes more skirmishes of course they can just make an alt alliance an take the rest so that needs to be looked at3 limit the number of people in an alliance to 20004 add more stations in npc 00 regions like venal gw that hardly has none to allow more ppl to go in and more pvp to happen5 move 00 npc regions away from 00 sov regions not right that the sov holders can also control the 00 npc region perhaps move them in between highsec and lowsec
op got ganked and is mad hulk mining wont be extinct soon nothing to see here people
with the most recent expansion of crucible all dreads have had their capital drone bay removed from production requirements this now officially makes the phoenix the most expensive dread to produce while doing the lowest dps if it is not firing its native damage type of kineticthis needs to be addressed now with either the removal of the turret hardpoint or increase citadel torpedo rate of fire

it also has guaranteed hits with missiles instead of having to deal with things such as tracking falloff and optimal range and can change damage types to do better damage based upon the structureshiptype present rather than having to pack multitudes of spacehogging flavors of ammo010

thank you ccp vertex sounding good there the point i was trying to get accross never seemed to come accross but sounds like you know what i was trying to say dus older guys are more interested in game play rather then graphics d hehehhehe but since there more optimised and can be lowered and turned off is ok d ty for a good explanation etc etc d regardsepsi
lmao you high mate
i think what would be nice long term would be if they introduced an alternate mode that people can play in that have very low graphical requirements which could have a seperate roadmap from the pretty graphicswhen i say alternate mode i mean something like a beefed up version of the current solar system viewer or the current screen zoomed out to symbols only another possiblity would be the old style textureless wireframes from mechwarrior 12 which were aesteticly interesting but not too processor intensive
ahh another game where you get blown to bits and respawnyay for reality
i want to do it now goddamit
of course you do
bump
yes pleasesov warfare might be more fun as we could finally burn everything to the ground
i actually think for everything that is player built it should be able to be destroyed make it sothis should not apply to npc stations only player built onessupported on that basis

unfortunately the message many of us would like to convey has no place in civil conversation it mostly involves four letter words vulgar insinuations of mothers and a display of a finger of choicesummary of eves last four expansions
you mean words like epic and telling him his mom did a good job at raising him and showing him a thumbs upi honestly do like the patch that just came out hugefont gripes aside if they really have turned over a new leaf of listening to their players and they can stick with it then im happy i echo malcanis post if they keep going this direction i expect good things in eves future
what questions would you like us to ask hilmar i like asking questions
how soon will we see a revamp  iteration  upgrade on the faction warfare system what direction is ccp going with fw development
we might even allow a wis expansion in summer 2013 without shooting the jita monument see 18 months can benefit fis too 
voting the way it is is totally wrong and pretty much vote rigging being an alliance leader of 20007000 members pretty much gaurantees you in thats not right csm to be interviewed by senior ccp staff and chosen that way
they dont really go with their name then or fix the description or something
giant secure only if anchored containers is a bit long for the market window though
i suppose it wouldnt hurt to explicitly state in the description that they only secure their contents while anchored and passworded in spacesurvivor of teskanen fan of john rourke i have video tutorials for eve online on my youtube channel
