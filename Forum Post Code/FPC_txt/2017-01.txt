right click  show info  send iskplace bounty
often people who lead alliances and corporations are very busy people and this could save them valuable time and allow them pay salary  place bounty based on kill mail kill mail can have dozens of attackers and try to place bounty for 20 people it can be quite work big kill mails can have more than 100 attackers
it was also a gigantic security risk its not coming back best to accept it and move on
mikal is a great guy  i cannot think of a better representative for the pvp crowd  good luck sir

as a minerhauler myself i dont see what the whining is about to be fair it has been well beyond a year since i played eh real life you know but the principles are likely the same now as they have always been hauling goods from one place to another is supposed to have some amount of risk to it if there was no risk the sense of immersion and realism would be gone i could just spend all of my isk on a massive ship and expensive cargo and trade it all for more wealth in an endless and pointless cycle of monetary gain boringeve has crafted an experience carefully i might add theyve balanced and rebalanced pvp so much throughout the years that forces someone like me to consider that risk i have to factor in the cost of losing my cargo and ship into what i intend to do for the day or week i have to have to be able to take the loss and still move forward if i cant take the loss thats on me not the ganker it would be my fault that i spent all of my resources on one haul

positive community mention in the following also good opportunity to hear an awesome podcast from mindclasheven if you dont vote for me check these guys out great stuff

if you checked the summit notes youll note this is something we brought up with ccp during our time with the art team
i see that you also posted this thread over in features and ideas so i will lock this one
mikals a pretty cool guy a great fc he definitely has my vote
hello friendsi hereby announce my candidacy for csm xiiiUFFFDm very proud of everything that we accomplished as csm 11 not only did we have a big impact on the development of key features the new alpha clones but we also managed to rebuild a healthy relationship between csm and ccp the csm 11 team was amazing and everybody was very openminded to work together and operate as effective and efficient as possible i want to thank all members of the csm 11 for the amazing experience i had working with you and i hope that we manage to continue our UFFFDUFFFDgods workUFFFDUFFFD as members of csm 12 last year i wrote an explanation of whom i am and what i stand for so iUFFFDve decided to use that again in order for people to easily know who i am you will be able to find information in the second post in this forum thread here here are some interviewsvideospodcastspresentations i did while being a csm 11 member1 evesterdam presentation about the csm 11
who am imy ingame name is bobmon i am a member of csm 11 and you might know me as the ex ceo of evenews24comi started playing eve online in 2010 following an introduction by a couple of my friends who had their own dutch corporation this corporation was part of an alliance that had an active war going on at the time i joined i was a brand new player and back then you couldnt really get involved with pvp so i decided to make a new alt fly over to the location of our enemy and see what they were up to after a bit of chatting i got to know them and they asked me to join i then began relaying intel to my friends and so im very proud to say that my first task in eve online was to be a spyfrom those humble beginnings i have progressed in my eve career and experienced many aspects of gameplay including 00 nullsec warfare i have been a part of multiple 00 alliances with whom i fought many battles fc started in 2011 and from that point on led everything from small subcap fleets to capital fleets alliance leadership position second in command  head diplomat of unclaimed  mentor for new players iUFFFDm currently a mentor for members in pandemic horde evenews24 ex chief editor and ceo part of the evesterdam organisation team player presenter was one of the presenters for eve tv at fanfest 2015 fanfest presenter gave a presentation about eve media member of the rekkingcrew member of csm 11 all of these aspects have taught me a lot about the game and the players who play it and i think that they will help me a lot as a potential csm member focusi think the most important job of a csm member is to be a bridge between ccp and players players are the ones playing and can help ccp discover problems with eve online that need to be solved eve online is in a state where a lot of new features are being released and so its exciting to see what the future holds for us the players  communication between player and dev nullsec  lowsec alliance warfare and how changes affect this dont forget about the independent players when it comes to changes space usages  coverage ships and their use make sure changes are necessary and not the lets add a shiny ship tactic make sure the devs understand playersUFFFD problems how changes affect small alliances fleet fights think about 50 high sp chars vs 250 newbies increased support for events i would love to see an increase in support for our players who are blind deaf etcthese are not points i will purely focus on i will deal with whatever is necessary however i do think that the above points are very important for the future of eve onlinedo you have any points that you find important please contact me details will be at the bottomwhy do i want to join the csmover my years of being active in the eve online community ive come to the conclusion many times that im deeply in love with our community this is a key reason to why ive always kept playing eve online and it has often put me in a position where i had to explain to my rl friends why im so passionate about the gamewhile being active ive also been in a ton of game related discussions and through my work at en24 ive been in contact with a lot of different types of players from the best fcs to the pilot who can barely fly his retriever in highsec iUFFFDve spoken with those players a lot and iUFFFDve learned about their ideas or concernsthis is my ultimate drive to be a csm member i feel that sometimes changes are made to affect bigger groups of players to the detriment of the lone members i would like to represent those individual players and make the game more beautiful for them and everybodyways to get to know me better1 feel free to ask me questions in this forum thread2 check out my twitter3 contact me on the tweetfleet slack4 contact me on my email bobmonevegmailcom

first  go bob 
glad you run again i wholeheartedly want to see you in csm xii againhassan
amamake police supports bobmonalso hes a good dude and puts his heart into the game need more like this not just ppl whining about why the game sucks and not doing anything about it
bobmon is attentive and sensitive to all your needs a v nice man to have on csmall tar pilots should vote this man
i support bobmonsc
hes a good man hell listen to your problems and make you feel important even if its the smallest issue he is always a csm member that i feel has all of our best interests at heart from me
like last year and from this year bobmon is your only choice 3 0 3








topic moved
bobmon is sure as hell going to put the effort in to make eve better for everyone and ccp communication definitely needs improvement right now which is what he specialises ini want to see him in the next csm again













one look at the title and i can already tell my vote is not going to you lol
one of the most dedicated people to this game ive ever seen get me rag skins pl0xhope you get in this year again
you say you have all of this experienceUFFFDstarted in 2009 was in nc did a lot in ns lived in wormholes etc however do you have any evidence of this experience your corp history doesnt show it and your killboard certainly does not show you have much experience with the game either you must be posting on an alt then but for all we know unless you share that info you could be someone completely different at the very least we dont have any evidence you are qualified in the gameplay mechanics you say you arehere is one advantage of public killboards they allow people to see what sort of experiences you have which is especially useful for things like running for csm ironically your stance against public killboards conflicts with your goal of running for the csm as well as your goals for the csm killboards for one let us see the pilots experience one of your goals is UFFFDbetter expose the influences of older playersUFFFD except you dont do that by making certain intel less public and making it harder to validate the claims players make about themselves or who they are and making it easier to hide ingame activities thats like saying you want to hold the government more accountable and then proposing to remove all oversight and eithcs committees
through the various articles on our alliance web page it is fairly easy to identify my alts for those looking for them there is no reason for me to make it easier to find though until this applies for all playersmy alts can be judged by elitists players the way they want to i do not care elitists player have amount of intel and resources that i do not have ie we play differentlythis is this difference of playstyle that i represent
as a side note i like this new requirement for csm xii candidatesif you control a character that is well known in the eve community ccp may require you to run under that identity and not one of an alt or a lesser known characterthis alt is my wellknown alt like i mentioned before starting campaigning for the playstyle i like best none of my other alts were known in fact i did play for years without any real awareness of the larger community i am not a social until the siphons and the ess got released and their features made useless by the nerf of waste and api ratting for the siphons and for the ess their design intent negated by placing them in anomalies with no risks to the defendersthese are the reasons i decided to get more involved to defend the game features that could have helped develop my prefered playstyle further i also assumed that i could not be the only lurker out there with this kind of playstyle
now heres a candidate i can get behind





i promise i just stole the phase not supporting the candidate  i have maybe 5 the ego trump doesedit after watching the inauguration 5 dropped to 1
im arenthor doran and this is my favourite campaign on the citadelwho am iiUFFFDm arenthor and iUFFFDve been playing eve for just over 3 years continuously i had previous forays into eve but fell victim to the poor npe at the time over this time iUFFFDve explored most parts of eve from exploration mining and ratting to small gang solo and blob level pvp whilst iUFFFDve tried most things iUFFFDve recently settled on fcing and exploration mostly with a bit industry added on the sidemy historycurrent goonswarm federation UFFFD after the start of the tribute war between testco and panfam i moved down the goons in which iUFFFDve resumed my industry and exploration as well as fcing smallmid gang subcap fleetsco2 UFFFD joined with corp more than joining out of choice after drama between infensus and sort dragon our corp looked for a safe haven they found that in co2 in which we had been a member of years previous a good alliance however the culture of the alliance did not suit me and thus prompted my move to goonsinfensus UFFFD after the fall of vale during world war bee my corp at the time blks formed with quovis to forge our own alliance we started of by living out lowsec blopsing and generally harassing test who just moved in we then moved up to branch as part of the gotg coalition a few months peacefully here then resulted in our sudden evacuation after drama with sort dragon bastionfconco2blacksteel mining and manufacturing UFFFD standard newbro mistake i fell into a rut just after i started with a hs mining corp thankfully i moved as i started to burn out and thus saved my entire eve career in a way i have to thank these guys for making me the player i am todayso why should you vote for meUFFFD not one of the eve famous club who seem to dominate the csm electionsUFFFD independent UFFFD my views are my own and are developed from talks with people i play with throughout various parts of the game from null to wh to lowsec UFFFD easy to contact UFFFD as a member of the csm i would make it a priority to ensure i keep in contact with the rest of the player base i regularly attend meetups in the uk such as event and iUFFFDm looking to expand this to evesterdam this year talking to players at meet ups via in game chat and mail via reddit or the eve forums i can see what issues are effecting you as well as communicate our work to youmy positionshigh level over view of my campaign is to promote further development of the npe the new tutorials are a great step in the right direction from ccp and the work of group such as hordekarmaeuni cant be ignored either however after the tutorial and unless you find one of theese groups and join many of them are still getting sucked into the age old highsec mining corp where they burn out after a month continuation of feature in citadels one point was to push for insrance in citadels however this has now been announced continuting to work with ccp in regards to the features we want to see from citadels not jsut ones that are missing but to refine and tweak thoose that are already inthe age old sov needs to be changed a compelte overhaul is not required but a change to sov such as maybe scripting entosis links to a attack and defence mode could add a new dynamic especially with alliances being able to activly defend each others sov or subtly take it from under them changes to factional warfare whilst ima dmitatly not an expert on this feature i have used it before and have talked to people who take part in it many of whom are not happy with the current mechanic this would require further discussion with lwosecfw groups before i make any further comments on itany questions please feel free to add them blow or messages me in game arenthor dorancsmxii candidate
thanks help spread the word the most difficult issue nonblocindependent candidates face is to reach nonbloc players to let them know there are candidates that truly care about playstyles diversity in eve online

ive known erika for nearly 4 years now and shes always been a valuable member of our commandlogistics structure no matter where we have called home shes been a dedicated friend and colleague and it was a blast meeting her and getting to know her better this past october at eve vegas where she functioned a reporter of sorts livetweeting whatever panel she had chosen to sit in on1010 would vote for erika mizune
erika mizunedjyumene helping make eve great againi absolutely agree that the pi stuff does need an overhaul not an unbalance or overbalance just an overhaul the pi ui system sucks decommissioning sucks and there hasnt been anything new in years

csmi was frustrated when csm xi was announced and it was almost a mirror of the major participants of wwb i thought to myself that this will be another year that anything outside of direct null sec play will not be discussed or have any interest due to the nature of the candidates instead of complaining about it i decided to run for the following years csmfortunately this years csm was very productive the focus groups and roundtables gathered interest and was hopefully instrumental to ccp in improving the game some of those roundtables actually addressed my previous concerns most notably the war dec round tableall voices from all types of players do have value i feel that i can help highlight concerns from those groups by actively seeking input being available through more than one communication platform and articulating my own thoughts on the matterwhat is the role of the csm how do i promote thatthe csm is an active and dependable communication instrument between ccp and the player base i will promote this function by focusing my creative energy to work with fellow csm to produce roundtables focus groups and articles about the processwhat is my platformi will bring value to the csm as a communicator i will not be a candidate bound by the type of space that i play in i am a candidate suitable to interact with ccp based on my well rounded experience if youUFFFDre looking for a candidate that will be biased towards one area of space over another i may not be an attractive choice for you however i can offer the followingwhen solicited for suggestions by ccp i will follow these principlesconcerning mechanics or ship balancing be aware of the effects of scaleaddress motivation we must be able to articulate the individualUFFFDs perception of value derived from an activitywhatUFFFDs in it for me there must be a measurable improvement to the experience of the individual playerteamwork  i will encourage the csm to work together on ccp driven projects to have as much subject matter experts on hand to produce quality resultsobjectivity  i will offer experience based and data driven recommendations even if it is to the detriment of my gameplay styleccp  csm relationship  csm are not junior developers ccp takes the lead and seeks input from the csm ccp must own this  it is not appropriate to leave mechanics and ship balancing issues without timely periodic iterations how have i worked towards my platformi actively engaged my alliance the market and trading community null sec entities and faction warfare corporations to solicit recommendations and concerns regarding their respective space and gameplay style i will not hesitate to directly communicate with anyone or any group regarding feedback they may have about the csm process or ccp in

here hereroedyn and i first crossed paths in august he initially attracted my attention through his weekly publication of the trade recap i read his weekly findings often and tried to mimic them myself albeit with less success than he when i approached roedyn about his trades i became aware of his role as an investment manager of a fund he was running the amount he had secured and traded with was over 150 billion isk roedyn was extremely honest with me in saying that his earnings were modest and that he would be open in helping me find my own way as a trader to most of you this should come as a shock any trader worth his salt never gives up trade secrets the tactic roedyn used however was not a tactic he was legitimately trying to help me because that is what game play is all about to him to roedyn if you are not enjoying your aspect of the game he wants to know why he wants to figure that out for you and improve it whether its day trading for me highsec mechanics for the minority or sov mechanics for the masses roedyn goes out of his way to analyze the issue suggest solutions and make a difference in every players experience
good luck the wealth of knowledge this fine candidate carries should take him all the waydark rising stop playing eve start living it
1 id definitely vouch for this guy as a great potential csm candidate ive known roe for probably 23 years now most importantly he has no interest in advancing his own agenda  rather he genuinely cares about the community as a whole and does his 
i can safely say that roedyn is going to be the first choice on my ballots this voting cycle

i endorse this fashionistaloyal servent to mother amamake evetetsel
this well dressed individual has a very long history of good taste when it comes to cosmetics arams portrait always brings light to any room it graces and his tireless work and philanthropy reflect this radiancei endorse his campaign and offer my blessing best of luck
that campaign will turn a cold dour universe into a brilliant arena full of swagthat candidates impeccable taste will help bridge the yawning gap between ccp and the gaming community at large when it comes to all things swagrelated i assume it goes without saying that this particular alt should it be elected will swap his businesslike glasses for a monocleyou have my vote sir
aram for csm 12 
thanks to try to make new eden great  swaggy again
makeevegreatagainaramibelieveinyou
 best dressed confidence in the extreme sexinesswho wouldnt vote for this wonderful person its about time the csm received an injection of talent and style of this magnitudejewnior mcblazing may i say you have the full support of me and my alliance godspeed
when you say youll help ccp what exactly are you meaning bear in mind the artefacts like tshirts are handled by team muppet shop a very very small teamas for walking in stations thats not on the cards while id love ccp to do something meaningful with it its not going to happen they just dont have the development resource to work on it while also working on spaceships which is the major draw of eveproject nova has nothing to do with the csm ccp dont talk to us about it ditto with valkyrie or gunjackand kugu was nothing to do with ccp in the first placewhile im not saying youd be useless for the vast majority of the time what youve talked about here isnt the daily meat and veg of the csmoh and go read the announcement specifically
his monocle is probably of the same origin as the eye of the overworld that iucounu the laughing magician tasked cugel the clever to recover it impacts the mind and alters comprehension when worn aloneor may be he is himself the new edens version of cugel the clever
lol look at all those blind naysayersyou have to believe folks loyal servent to mother amamake evetetsel
is that a threat
no threat just rendered momentarily speechless
i would prefer it you be permanently speechless before seeing you slander such an upstanding citizen as jewnior mcblazing so unfairlyreturn to your coding abyss third party app demon
what a waste of a left monocle steve fix your portrait already
make eve great again jewnior mcblazing4csm 
o stevemuch as i admire your site and your csm work in general you have been very high on my ballot ever since you started running i feel bound to point out that the number of people who were ripped off by enjoyed a pleasurable trading experience from jewnior must be roughly equivalent to that of those whose business was handled by aram himselfyou do have a point that given his platform the character in question would have to at the very least upgrade his eyewearcheers



i reacently returned to eve and trying to move my carrier from otsasai going around tribute and to the branch i picked that route because of the safety and i takes for days jump range of the carrier is too small its onli 7 ly it should be brought back as it was before
thank you so much 3 it was of course great to meet you as well and hope you come to vegas again this year d
pi does need a major overhaul yes it really has been years since anything was really done with pithank you for the support 3
if you can get minmatar lp stores to start selling republic fleet missiles and for the 75 tracking bonus that the tempest currently has to be also applied to the tempest fleet issue youll have my vote
i too want a pony
i can safely say that you would be my last choice if you ran for csm
i can safely say that i will not be running for csm anytime soon i actually would like the things you suggested but thats not really what i think of when i think of what the csm does
fair enough asking a member of the csm to try to bring this up with ccp is like a shot in the dark
thank you very much for your response1 concerning adjusting the fw lp store rewards ive had discussions concerning this before but i failed to create enough traction for my arguments basically i failed to articulate what types of items should be added or made exclusive to the fw lp stores i appreciate your suggestion of adding republic light missiles the minmatar racial ship lines have developed over the years to encompass more missile bonuses it makes sense to add racial faction missiles to the lp store should it be exclusive2 i double checked the bonuses of the tempest and tempest fleet issue im sorry but i think what you meant was the 75 bonus to rate of fire of the tempest with that i will assume that what you want to happen is for the tempest fleet issue to have this bonus as well i dont have much experience in flying this ship but as a trader i can tell you that there isnt much demand for this faction ship if applying this buff will make this ship a more attractive choice to take to combat that is definitely worth exploring and forwarding the request to ccpthe suggestions i listed in my original post was a small sampling of the suggestions that i have collected from different players i will add your suggestion to the list and hopefully i will be able to submit these to ccp once elected i hope i was able to address your concerns
great response worthy of a vote thank you

what changes to the sov system would you propose if any moons arent really worth fighting over anymore any ideas for something new that would spark a conflict

hi hello my name is dancul1001 i am a pandemic legion fleet commander alliance tournament captain and i am here to announce that i am running for csm xiiabout mei began playing in 2006 and moved to lowsec on my first day and began pvping shortly thereafter after a few months i moved into 00 to learn the intricacies of pvp on the mean streets of syndicate and iUFFFDve never looked back two years later my corp joined an alliance called sons of tangra and moved to fountain from there i moved into pandemic legion and 8 years later here i am still pvping still having a blast highlights of my eve career have included participating in multiple alliance tournament teams for pandemic legion winning 5 gold medals and a silver medal in the process my positions how i would improve eve online  entosis mechanics i like the idea of multiple skirmishes over multiple nodes but thatUFFFDs not case at the moment  skins we need get our skin game on point there are some ships that have tons of skins some that have none and some that barely change the look we need skin updates for the overlooked ships like pirate ships and a lot of the gallente race and would someone please fix the rattlesnake victory skin tournaments i love tournaments and we all want to see more of them events like event is a great start but we need more wormholes i want to see more wormholes especially in 00 this a great feature in eve allowing all sorts of shipgangs to move around eve and create content wherever they end up server hardware the current state of rubberbanding and lag is not acceptable module tiericide letUFFFDs finish what ccp started i respect what they did with sensor boosters but there are tons of modules that havenUFFFDt had this treatment i would love to see scripts removed and replaced with a mode that can be toggled  ship maintenance bays my opinion is stuff like liquid ozone and drugs should be able to be loaded in the cargo of the ship that is inside a ship maintenance bay they are both used in combat just like ammo and scripts there is no reason why they are disallowed  sessionchange timer we need to lower if not remove this simple as that i will work with the ccp team to make sure they understand where our priorities are new player experience it has come a long way since its infancy but we need to keep expanding on this in order to keep the new players going free to play has gotten us all races on all alpha characters no new player should be penalized for choosing a random to them at the time race every new player should have the chance to contribute to every fleet improvements to npc null sec increasing the value of the space outside of just moon mining in order to increase the player activity please consider me when you vote for csm xii
some good ideas and hopefully these quality of life improvements will be implemented if we have someone to push for themon a side know i would say dancul knows almost everything there is to know about the game and i will put my faith in him representing the playerbase 
neg repping this guy very annoying voice do you want a guy with an annoying voice on the csm i think not
cutest little dutch boy ever
hi bobmonis there any reason why you are the only member of csm11 rerunning i ask this since you are the only person from csm11 who has posted a candidacyfurthermore going forward knowing what you know through the nda how to you feel about eve for the next year 5 years and 10 years do you feel that we will have a more vibrant people participating in contentnew content game and community or something else erlee
do you have any yknow positions that you might want to state you say your views are developed yourself what are they why do you consider not being eve famous a benefit it doesnt have to be a point against you but i think not being known for actually having done anything shouldnt be considered a qualification for representing hundreds of thousands of people 1 until you tell me what you actually want to do as it is you havent given one single specific detail
you make a good point therehigh level over view of my campaign is to promote further development of the npe the new tutorials are a great step in the right direction from ccp and the work of group such as hordekarmaeuni cant be ignored either however after the tutorial and unless you find one of theese groups and join many of them are still getting sucked into the age old highsec mining corp where they burn out after a month continuation of feature in citadels one point was to push for insrance in citadels however this has now been announced continuting to work with ccp in regards to the features we want to see from citadels not jsut ones that are missing but to refine and tweak thoose that are already inthe age old sov needs to be changed a compelte overhaul is not required but a change to sov such as maybe scripting entosis links to a attack and defence mode could add a new dynamic especially with alliances being able to activly defend each others sov or subtly take it from under them changes to factional warfare whilst ima dmitatly not an expert on this feature i have used it before and have talked to people who take part in it many of whom are not happy with the current mechanic this would require further discussion with lwosecfw groups before i make any further comments on it
i hate to keep ripping on you but the only specific thing you said in that whole wall of text is scriptable entosis links
moarr hats victorian era beaver skin hat please
thats quite arrogant and selfcentredunworthy csmsir smashalot i will develop my ideas about new hats  cybernetic arms soonalso project discovery should add more special edition items as faction pants and shirts
only if you promise to add cowboys to eve the real kind of cowboys not the hollywoodnashville ones but the living in the wilderness pooping yourself to death kinds i want to poop myself to death in space can you make this happen
greetings mkint thanks for your precious idea you are right and i would like to suggest ccp to add special character skins if i am elected csmlets take an example for 499 you could buy a cowboy skin for your character it will add  cowboy attitude  moves cowboy voices  cowboy logo on your ships for an extra 299 each you could also buy special edition moves even funny ones as the pooping himself special edition move you suggested furthermore we could imagine in the near future to be able to ride horses inside your headquarter for an extra 299eurosmonththanks everyone for your precious feedbacks
easily first
after reading all your points and mulling them over i have seen the great truth within and ive sworn my allegiance to your platform i call on all capsuleers possessing a sound mind in a able body to do the same
this is a great candidacy but i have a question  will you support the creation of more types of glasses  i know that the famed monocle is a great thing to own would you support the creation of an exclusive and expensive lorgnons cosmetic item 
bringbackmonocoles wearethe1
im still waiting for my monocle
i honestly cannot see you adding anything valuable
but enough about your alliance
 pleb corp pleb alliance pleb armor pleb portraitpleb everything go back to your abyss

erika is a class act thoughtful considerate and incredibly knowledgeable with regard to industry you have my support
1king in the north
vince draken is the best and most experienced player to run for csm in years everyone should have him somewhere near the top of their ballotill have him high on the test ballot for sure good luck brother
thanks for all the kind words hoping to serve you guys as csm and make new eden great again

if you vote for dancul1001 you are voting for a top 1 game player in eve onlineshamis orzoz once told me he wouldnt trust any one on earth with the pl team except for dancul he said dan has ice in his veins and he really does a vote for dancul is a vote for a dude who actually plays this game at the highest level all the time hes got my vote
ill keep this simple as i have played eve and many other online games with dancul for over 9 years nowdancul is a natural leader with an indepth game knowledge and expertise that very few people ever manage to develop as a person i have found him to be levelheaded and easy going but also with a competitive edge that allows him to interact successfully with poor personality types a skill that cannot be taughthe would serve us well in any endeavor and ill be voting for him
dancul is one of the most knowledgeable pilots on the tournament scene and an all round good man

most of the current csm has expressed an interest in rerunning but is waiting for the conclusion to the upcoming jan 30th  feb 3rd summit  and any corresponding whitepaper changes  before announcing our candidacy
thanks for the reply jintaan i would still like to hear bobmons reply furthermore bobmon why did you not wait for the conclusion of the summit any corresponding whitepaper changes before announcing your candidacy like the rest of the csm
when posting this thread i was not aware of the agreement that we would wait with posting our threads till after the summit dont know how i misesd it but yeah the judge poked me not even 10 minutes after posting the thread and then i slapped myself p if i would have known then i would have waited aswellalso me running for csm wont be impacted by white paper changes
so as a csm that is essentially campaigning on communication you have failed to listenunderstand the consensus of your 13 fellow csms and went ahead anyway and posted your thread furthermore by your own admission of the just poked me not even 10 minutes after posting the thread and then i slapped myself at this point you could have taken your thread down  edited it to say that you had jumped the gun and would be running after the summit you continued to campaign anyway why not just take your licks and take it down why are you campaigning when you should be focusing on the next csm summit this was the reason you were elected in the first place
i understand why my fellow csms decided to hold until after the summit and looking back i would have done the same if i would have known this at the time as a csm you have a lot of chat channels open at the time and it can be challenging at times to absorb everything that said everywhere sadly i didnt see this agreement otherwise i would have followed by fellow csm members ive thought about removing the post  editing it however ive learned from my time at evenews24 that once something is out there there is no point of deleting it this often creates more confusion and thats not something i want to have happen around me i much rather admit to jumping the gun and give people the honest reason why something happend im fully focused on the next summit and tbh the most time ive spent on this campaign is probably answering this question
what is your position on the ever infinitely expanding amount of citadels and ecUFFFDs in empire low and null sec systemswhat is your position on local building and empire trade hubs been so easy to access and buy stuff from vs how difficult it is to be able to support a small to medium alliance with everything they need in their home region without the need for places like jitaamarr ie do we need to force people to build everything they need in their local area would need a few tweeks from ccpUFFFDs end to make it work and nerf how easy it is for a small alliance to seed a whole fleets worth of ships in a matter of hours just using jita and jfUFFFDswhat is your position on having more group pve and less reliance solo people just been able to run anomalies solo 24h a daywhat is your position on citadelUFFFDs defensive capabilityUFFFDs and how you are forced to bring n1 type sub cap fleets to deal with them and do you think there should be a bigger risk of assets if the defenders are unable to defendwhat is your position on huge super cap blobs and the main counters been n1 no fights or one shot dread bombs which donUFFFDt really counter longterm proliferation of supercaps
1 personally i get kinda sad when i see a insane amount of the cheaper citadels in systems yes they should be accesable but i would have made them more expensive personally2 if it would properly work then i think it could be interesting and i would not be against it if it works properly3 im not a big fan of the safety window it stops gameplay and thats why i dislike it in terms of their defence i like that the biggest one is also very hard to kill however the other medium and large one might be a bit to strong 4 super cap blops are in a strange place in my hearth i kinda love them when you have a big battle however i also loved the old supprise dreadbomb counter i think it would be fun if there were more options in the super capital world overall i would say that just like i did within this term im not affraid to poke people who i see as experts on these topics their feedback is great to use when communicating with ccp its the best way to opperate as a csm member if you ask me
i had a dream where aram whispered to my ear stories about eternal bliss rivers of warm camel milk palaces of ruby and gold and 5th midslots on vagabondswhile my eye condition doesnt allow me to wear a monocle i still fully endorse this candidate and his platform
not less than any other currentfutur csm members tbh but at least we will have bettermore option for that tiny thumbnail picture on the forum instead of some random shity balacingnew mechanicsloyal servent to mother amamake evetetsel
aram is not a good manhe is the best mansimple as that you will never find a man more better or more good than aram

you have my vote sir o7
how can you help people that want to try pvp but cant understand what to do or when to engage
and there we go another solo kb warrior im on twitch so i think i know what im doin vote for meso fed up with those elect me im famous candidatesloyal servent to mother amamake evetetsel
suitonia has the best understanding of game mechanics of anyone ive ever seen and is an excellent pilot to boot hes got my vote this year
check out the positive changes ive made with my blogs content and being on the t3d focus group im not running for fame or to make myself feel more important im running to increase my capacity of helping the eve community and making eve into a better game for all of us that i have a proven track record of improving i think that is more a player content thing rather than something ccp can expressly help with if you want to get into pvp in nullsec id recommend giving my kestrel guide a once over from page 20 i have almost everything listed there that you would want to engage and how you should engage my youtube channel has a bunch of cool stuff that you might like the old kestrel video that i have has a lot of stuff i go over there are also many other great content creators on youtube and twitch that can help you out some people who are new player focused and are good at explaining their thought process that you might want to watch arefintarue  this guy does alpha clone pvp and pvp in lowsecchannel  zarvox  dungeon tier 310 pvper but easy to see him roam and his thought processthebloodraids merlin guide on youtubeiddoeve also has some great stuffi do believe ccp could help by signal boosting these content creators and putting out some kind of content themselves around solo pvp to generate more interest and support for players like you the kestrel is great and i cant wait to add the csm tag to a cringy pickup line di did not much recently thanks for the support everyone else contributer to eve is easy
could you link the guides youve written anything selfless at allive watched lots of his streams and read his kestrel guide enough to try it for myself and honestly no matter what sort of npe ccp comes up with the best quality npe is going to be players showing how they play by example and honestly suitonia is much much less of an attention hoe compared to others in the genre of twitchyoutuberswe need lots more of this guy and others to step up in eve online
well hopefully there will be a frigate focus group and he will be usefullgood luck to him for the election btwwell probably need a bs solo pvp expert too cant wait zarvox to applyloyal servent to mother amamake evetetsel
suitonia is probably the only popular twitch streamer without that attitude and should be an example to all future streamers that would like to be successful without the use of breasts
if you think suitonia has only contributed through videos youd be well and truly wronghe has helped both the community and the devs with his knowledge acknowledged by ccp fozzie here
thank you so much i really appreciate the support
vouch
1 his knowledge of the game and experiences will be a great thing to have on the csm
i know nothing about pvp i mostly do indy i know you said you are focused in pvp but will you also be able to represent people like me who are interested in pvp but have no idea where to start maybe like suggesting a career agent that actually teaches what transversal radial and other important parts of pvp isi tried doing pvp fleets but at one point it gets tiring to just press f1 and anchor i want to know the solo pvp stuffs cause when i try it i fail then i just go back to being an indy
absolutely people like you are exactly who i want to represent veterans dont need much of a representative as they are pretty loud as it is  its the new pilots that make eve grow and great and making sure there are plenty of avenues to teach new pilots is exactly what i will do my best to bring to the csm
additionaly i will try to push the issue on war dec mechanics i believe this mechanic is broken and should at minimum have a hard limit on length of declararation if not a compunding fees system where each week the price of war goes up
couldnt have said it better
what is your position of the garagedoor citadel chains and general lack of risk once associated with moving capitalsupercapital ships what suggestions would you present or suggest to alter this mechanic
dancul how easy to you find secret hitler also 1 for dancul being a worthwhile candidate for csm
laughable portrait and character name literally means  in asshole in french embarassing candidacy
i have been told what my name means in french i do not speak french nor did i know what it meant when i created my character i simply used the first three letters of my first name and the first three letters of my last name and added some numbers to look cool
bobmon is literally the worst1event website wwweventuk blog
hi bobmoni have one question given how different the circumstances are between you running now and you running this time last yearso last year lenny helped you out and subbed a ton of accounts using iwi money for the purpose of voting for you in first place to make sure you got on the council pretty clever actually and seems more or less within the election rules so well playedout of curiosity though do you mind disclosing exactly how many of these accounts were subbed and used to vote for you or alternatively what the total cost of that vote padding either in plex or isk was
over 9000no seriously this story is false yes i got support from lenny but this was only him telling people to vote for me as their csm caniddate nothing more nothing less
thanks everyone for the supportupdate 2401 fixing the eve online store
what is your position on shirtless avatar pictures and the possibility of having thug life tattooed on the belly 
aram is both the hero we deserve and the hero we need right now this is the definition of an easy cant miss choice my only concern is whether we truly need any other csmers for this cycle with aram on board as its possible they might just get in the way with their inferior contributions taking up valuable time that aram could be using to enact more changei think thats something that we could debate for a bit
hello fellow eve online playersmy name is thermal damage and this year i will be running for the csm i have been playing eve for almost 11 years so i feel that i have a fairly good knowledge in most aspects of the game i have lived in high low and nullsec doing everything from building capitals to working on diplomatic relations i feel my best attribute would be my ability to work with encourage and solve problems with people something i feel would be very useful as a member of the csm i am also a very active member of the tweetfleet community as you can see hereim a passionate advocate for the harsher side of eve online eve has become too focused on becoming safe and overly friendly over the last few years both in regards to game mechanics and within the community at large i know there are a large portion of you who dislike how eve is slowly becoming some kind of safe space and i would be there to fight your corner i am interested in working with the charity mentality within our community to find some sort of resolution so that we can phase them out they are too often used as a basis for corruption and self promotioni am also interested in working with ccp on how they manage their interactions with the community including their ticketing system recommendationscomplaints from players and their forums i mean whats the point of the forums if people rather go to reve the forums should be the central hub of out of game communication as an experienced community manager i feel i can bring a lot to the table in this regard ccp would also benefit from some education on how to keep real life and ingame issues separate i see many ccp employees posting about politics and some rather polarizing social issues on their work forum accounts and twitter handles its all rather embarrassing only grief and negativity can come from people bringing real life stuff with them past the login screen together we can come to a solution where all eve news is centralized with impartial support from ccpi am also interested in running a focus group to find out why 80 of eves playerbase refuses to leave highsec as i said in my first point it is nice and safe but i suspect there is more to it i am not so arrogant that i claim to have all the answers so i would like to work with alliance leaders and community figureheads from all areas of space to find ways in which we can pull people away from the newbie training ground that is high security space it could be with nerfs buffs or new ideas altogether i approach this with an open mindthe best way to contact me would be thermaldamage but you can post here or send me an eve mail thankyou for taking the time to read this and i hope i can count on your vote come election time

 im currently in goonswarm to learn more about the game from a sov holding perspectivegood man tho good at shooting spaceships
thecla asked what my thoughts on battleships are on twitteri think that there is a problem with the superfluous amounts of pirate battleships there are on the market from boosts to anomaly ratting escalation chance and burner missions driving down the value to the point where they are cheaper than the navy alternatives making navy bs unseen outside of eve tournaments or highsec missions this also strains t1 battleships somewhat too as for less than a 100m extra you gain a huge power increase which being 13rd of what your normally pay for a decent fit t1 bs is usually a no brainer starfleetcommander a voltatriumvirate fc mused with me on teamspeak about how 3 years ago triumvirate were running machariel fleets in the dr and they lost a 200 man mach fleet and then another a week after this cleaned out the entirety of jita of machariels and resupplying their machariel fleet became a huge issue he said he recently checked zkillboard and 4x the amount of machs they lost are being lost on a monthly basis with no effect on jitai think escalations are a good thing however since they encourage people who usually stay in one system ratting to venture out and run an escalation in another system mixing up gameplay for them and perhaps creating content for someone else who manages to catch them outside their usual safezone im not sure how to reduce pirate bs proliferation perhaps pirate ship bpcs could be removed from escalation sites i think navy battleships need to go through a balance pass notably here are some of my preliminary thoughts on the ones that most stand out to menavy dominix  it performs worse than the regular dominix in some situations due the lack of the tracking speed and range bonus it got the hybrid damage bonus as a harken back to the old dominix it exists to make eft generals who havent undocked in the past 2 years to salivate over 2k dps fits there are better vindicator fits for this for less isk personally id just add the dominix bonuses and keep the hybrid bonus navy armageddon  just like the ndominix it exists for people to remember the days of the old armageddon the navy apoc is a better laser damage platform because having trackingoptimal with way better fitting and secondary stats like speed and targeting is better than 15 dps utility high and a bigger drone bay id change this to the current armageddon with the extra stats from navy 1 low and slightly bigger drone bay navy megathron  the vindicator is cheaper does more dps has a 90 web with the same tracking bonus and the extra hp on the vindi almost makes up for the 8th low i think if the mega got a 50 large hybrid role bonus with 5 damage per level and 2 turrets it could be an interesting ship 2 utility highs on a gallente blaster battleship would be a nice niche that seperates it a bit more from the hyperion and vindicator typhoon fleet  the turret bonus should be swapped for something more usefultempest fleet  give it the same damage as normal tempest 5 rof to 75as for battleships in general i think they could use a lot better targeting stats sensor strength scan res targeting range i wrote this a long time ago

eve api devs were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they didnt stop to think whether they shouldwhile im not too fond of the fairly typical and banal grrr goonspanfamwhatever posting you seem to quite like i agree that the amount of free intel from the api as well as other sources needs to be looked at siphons were just the peak of the icebergthird party apps have gone much further than just improving convenience and quality of life things the free intel they provide has completely transformed the way a good player plays eve eve has always been quite metagamey and its all fine and good to a certain degree but theres such a thing as going too far
as ceo of r1fta we fully endorse thermal damage for emperor of csm
i whole heartedly endorse heatfleet get some
endorsing as well may long he reign
thermal damage is someone who should be on the csm he isnt a politician but a players player and that is something the community really needs he has a very good understanding of the community is very active in helping others and proposing new ideas and knows many aspects of the eve universe even those aspects that some may or may not agree with but are still part of what makes eve what it is he has already been active in proposing many new ideas to improve the gaming mechanics and would be a very good asset to the community especially as a voice for those of us who may have become discouraged watching lowsec slowly dissolve vote for thermal damage and make new eden great again 
i really prefer explosive damage it tends to be a weaker resist on pretty much anything people fly these days
yes well explosive damage isnt running for csm

i have not caught up yet with the entire thread here but i am responding to the op titlei believe the problem of retention is linked to the existence of anonymous alts allowing players to conduct griefing and hostile operations against other players without having any drawbacks or risks connected to their asset producing pilots this also applies to activity like cloaky camping spying stealing or scammingto that end i propose in my csm campaign to provide an economical benefit to those players willing to link their accounts publicly together so that the griefers and gankers spies scammers thieves and afk campers would suffer an economic loss from choosing to insulate their main accounts from their griefing accountsthe psychological thought that you can be griefed by someone more powerful than you without having any ways to get back at them or them not losing anything when undertaking this griefing is what imho drives retention down

i have some questions and suggestions1 can you please talk with ccp if we will see any other structure released this year other than drilling platforms if so what is it2 can you please talk with ccp to see if we can have some changes to faction warfare 3 it would be nice if we could get bonuses for owning regions and constellations like having sovereignty in a single system4 i believe it would be more engaging if there were different ways to bring a system contestable in fwfor examplehacking site that would decrease if the contestability if hack failed and intense it if hack was successfulentosis linking nodescombat sites that you would need to clear to increase contestability and defend to decrease it these sites would have many npcs rather than timers to run each of these would provide different percentage amounts towards contestability as well
the rapid regeneration of nodes has impacted the ability for small groups to challenge ownership of null sec space the initial design of nodes was that they did not regenerate thus forcing the defenders into action for each nodes and allowing the nodes to be used by griefing attackers just to trigger defenders actions with no intent from the attacker to take sovso the fundamentals of node regeneration came from a good place and are not in questionit has then been changed with csm blessing to a regeneration scheme that is independent of either how far the nodes are from the owning alliances capital or the adm of current systemwhat has not been considered at all is that the rapid regeneration has a cumulative effect impacting smaller groups of attackers willing to go after sov with a limited number of pilots for a small group of pilots say 3 entosis ships plus the same number of rapid response combat ships they start entosis on the nodes and spend the required time on the first onesm including the warm up during that time the other nodes continue to regenerate increasing the entosis time accordingly and making it more and more difficult for small groups to flip the required number of nodes even if they are unopposed this cumulative effect impacts small groups way more than larger groups is the design purposefully done to prevent small groups of pilots to go after sov in null sec and favor rental empires in null secif not can the regeneration of nodes be looked at again possible suggestions include stopping regeneration time for all nodes once a node is being attacked or tying regeneration time to local adm or distance from capital or allow for node attackers to win if no defenders had done any node action after the attacker flipped a certain number of nodes unopposed there are many options available if the design intent is to allow smaller groups to fight for sov in null sec
looking forward to any news of progress in the overhaul of the npc mission system planetary interaction is a description of game mechanics planetary industry is much better as a name for the feature ccp please consider adopting this alternate namepi needs love it is increasingly tied into production of all manner of items from ascendency implants to citadels all players could get started faster if the user interface helped them along with some suggested preset configurations imagine plopping down a group of prelinked and routed pins that you could drag around before clicking submit to set their positions edit addto help drive awareness of the csm a set of csm electee archive scripts listing the csm electees from 1 through 10 were given to all voters in 2015 players should get a new archive script every year even without the voting part just to remind players via the redemption queue the importance ccp places on the csm

my name is toxic yaken and iUFFFDm running for csm xii as a highsec candidateabout me i currently live with old friends in nullsec as a member of the dickwad squad part of legio de mortem and the larger phoenix federation in the south i also maintain my highsec funtimes with an alt in fly fearless trying to help newbros and learning how to fc against wardeccers as well as having a ganking alt for funding my activitiesiUFFFDve been playing eve online for about 3 years with the vast majority of my time spent in highsec as a scammer pirate ganker and wardeccer when i first heard of eve online i was enticed into the game by the prospect of UFFFDbeing the villainUFFFD though i somewhat ironically ended up mining ice in highsec i lived in a bubble for my first few months not really talking to anyone or learning anything until one day i was ganked by code for afk mining this became a major turning point for me to actually delve deeper into the game to get revenge after being part of several disappointing corporations that promised to teach me how to pvp i came across the belligerent undesirables blog and was taught the ways of highsec dickery i started awoxing corporations and ganking to feed my addiction to building an evergrowing pile of loot and friends that i made along the way also led to me joining wardec corporations to better learn how to hunt and pvp while i think ive softened a bit over the last few years i still see highsec as my home last year i ran for csm to represent the ganking and wardeccing communities i wanted to be honest to myself and represent the playstyles and lifestyles that i enjoy in eve online in spite of them being pretty small communities to draw support from knowing that i would run again this year i tried to use my spare time to experiment with different projects that i thought would provide players with opportunities to communicate their opinions during the summer i started doing interviews with highsec players to get a better grasp of what these players thought of different aspects of highsec gameplay and posting these conversations on a blog while these interviews were enjoyable and helped me gain a better perspective of what players thought about the game i didnUFFFDt really like the format as means of collecting information and many of the interviews that i started with players were never finished due to challenge of being online at the same time my schedule wasnUFFFDt amazing during the fall i organized a wardec roundtable for players and the csm to discuss several issues with wardecs which turned out great and was well received by those in the csm that attended as a follow up i also rebooted the wardec project originally conceived by jason quixos and tora bushido where players are free to participate in discussions on the subject of wardecs and ways to potentially improve them on our open discord channel and ideas are recorded for future referencing and discussion feel free to hop on and join the conversation communication over the course of the last few months there have been some complaints about visibility and communication of csm xi with the community a lot of work and discussions occur behind the scenes and seeing csm activity for oneself is a matter of knowing where to look if youUFFFDre not part someone actively following along on appropriate media or with the csm members themselves it can be kind of hard to find the csm website doesnUFFFDt even provide a good impression of the csmUFFFDs activity or thoughts UFFFD most of the postings are almost a year old on top of that every elected candidate is going to have a different opinion of what their role in the csm is supposed to be  we can look at jinUFFFDtaan and mr hyde as an example jinUFFFDtaan has been actively organizing townhalls slogging through chats and trying to be at the forefront of relations with the community while mr hydeUFFFDs stance has been that he was elected as a representative of his voters and when he needed other playerUFFFDs opinions he would search for those he believed had a strong understanding of the subject matter neither of these styles of representation is UFFFDbadUFFFD but they may not align with the expectations of some players if elected my plan would be to make the csm more visible to the community by focusing on pushing out more community based discussions including townhalls and open chats like i have for the wardec project and working to expand promotions of these discussions for a greater participation perspective while smaller changes may be easier to push for i want to try and follow the realistic expectation that the direction that ccp wants to development eve may not align with my own opinions my hope is that if elected i would be able to learn the path that ccp wants to follow and make suggestions that would benefit that vision i recognize that while the staff of ccp may be willing to hear my opinions and those of the community it is ultimately their game and their decisions as such the following opinions on highsec are my own and this platform shouldnUFFFDt be taken as promises but rather where my mind is for these subjects
new player experience with the ascension update we saw an influx of new and returning players and an update to the new player experience the new introductory arc for teaching players the basics was definitely a step in the right direction and iUFFFDm hopeful that the next iterations will build well off of what they have now what i would like to see made part of the npe is a better impression of the impact a player can have on their surroundings and universe choices and consequences have always been a big part of eve but the npe as is exists only to teach the fundamentals and basic ways to make isk with only a couple of hours on average to grab new players even having the tutorial give examples of the kind of impacts they can make on the game could be enough to keep playing iUFFFDve also had a few newbros tell me that they thought the tutorial could stand to be longer or alternatively offer advanced teachings that focused on educating players on more advanced mechanics like fleet ui or corporation mechanics i also love the initiative that csm members are making for basic suggested fittings of ships for newer players trying to figure out how to fit and the flight academy tutorial videos needing to be made more visible to new players who are already struggling hardcore with learning all the ui already corporations social groups i have seen tons of fledgling highsec corporations that more or less exist because corporations provide the social structure that guilds clans and clubs offer in other mmorpgs corporations are easy to setup and offer all the tools that the aforementioned social structures provide in other games but these tools will sometimes be underutilized by those who donUFFFDt plan to or understand how to use them as an alternative for those who are not interested in building up their space such as taking sovereignty or setting up structures i think that the introduction of social groups would better suit their interests social groups could offer all of the social benefits of a regular corporation such as private channel member list titles etc unlike corporations they wouldnUFFFDt have the ability to alter the rate of taxation anchor large structures take sovereignty or engage in wars allowing players to be able to join multiple social groups could give rise to more community based groups established in game rather than outside of it i know that this idea has been pitched before but for players whoo are just getting started donUFFFDt plan on having citadels or taking sovereignty or are trying to avoid the risks that come with being in a corporation creating a society could become the optimal choice over a corporation i like the idea of corporations of an investment of time and effort so another idea i have been toying with is the idea of corporation specializations when you start a new corporation you could be presented with a variety of options to develop your corporations benefits UFFFD so for example you could give industrial corporations choices like slightly higher mining yields improved industrial build timesmaterial efficiency faster producingbetter yields on planetary interaction etc increased rewards of loyalty points and isk could be handed out to those who specialize in empire protection operations such as missions incursions faction warfare and general ratting rather than just choosing which benefits your corporation would receive the best way to receive these benefits would come from the members banding together to work toward their specialization with multiple levels of proficiency goals corporations could either attempt to maximize their specialization in a small scope of skills or provide a more balanced approach across different bonuses services i would love to see the creation of an ingame services hub where players can advertise or look for services mercenary work industrial contracts hauling intelligence work etc besides giving these services more visibility to the average player it could also give newer players a better impression of the impact that they can make on the universe letUFFFDs say you and your newbro friends want to start a new industrial group that wants to create t1 frigates to cruisers UFFFD sure you could always just sell them on the market but letUFFFDs say you instead take a contract building ships for some players in faction warfare now there is more visibility to what your work is being used for youUFFFDre communicating with other players and getting a better understanding of their universe and youUFFFDre building relationshipswars regardless of where you might fly in space almost everyone has experienced a wardec for a lot of players these wars were likely underwhelming with no notable engagements aside from some careless players getting caught visiting a trade hub a lot of these wars are declared to ensure content for the wardeccerUFFFDs corporation or alliance rather than achieving a specific goal to that end wars can be lackluster as quality wars are those that are created with some sort of intent whether it be tearing down every public citadel in perimeter or simply getting revenge on someone who wronged you but again these quality wars are the exception in part because there really arenUFFFDt a lot of motivations to go to war over highsec space cont
if the aggressors have one advantage it is the ability to control the length of war over the last year iUFFFDve seen a lot of discussions regarding giving wars an objective for both sides to fulfill in order to end a war because for a lot of players a war is essentially just keeping them from playing the game they want to play the main idea has been focused around giving the attackers a structure or citadel module that can be destroyed for the war to end iUFFFDm personally not a huge fan of turning all wars into a kind of attack and defend like game partially because of the potential of throwing the whole wardeccing and mercenary culture into disarray iUFFFDve personally raised the suggestion of a system wherein players could shorten the overall length of the war by meeting preset activity thresholds tied to their corporationUFFFDs specialization as a way to fight the war without actually fighting all in all this is still a pretty big subject of discussion within the wardec project discord i donUFFFDt want to see every highsec corporation fold at the sight of a wardec notification the players that tend to live in highsec usually have little recourse when faced with experienced wardeccers intent on invading their space and even thought this is no different than being attacked in any other space there really arenUFFFDt a lot of clear options the greatest advantage for defenders is their ability to recruit allies to their defense but who do you hire and where do you find them again i would love to see the creation of an ingame services hub for players to find this support as well as providing links to it in both the wardec notification and on the war report so that any players that at least take the time to read can have some idea of what to do next iUFFFDd also like to see an improvement to diplomatic options for wars such as options to change the length of wardec protection from the aggressor or allow for an exchange of assetsstructures but for the most part being a defender means taking more precautions the removal of watchlists last year heralded in another big change for a lot of highsec wardeccers generally breaking down some of the smaller and more hunting focused groups in favour of larger blanket wardeccing groups to ensure consistent content lord razpataz of devilUFFFDs warrior alliance created a big thread about it on the eveo forums and has since been actively calling for the return of watchlists or a rework to locator agents which would at least tell if a player was offline or not for a fee though iUFFFDm generally under the impression that there is little chance that ccp would ever return watchlists in any capacity i would be happy to see locator agents have some sort of rework to better serve wardeccers
ganking ganking is true nonconsensual highsec pvp and i love it players gank for different reasons  i gank for profit i know groups that gank the neutral freighters of their enemies and some even gank out of ideological beliefs ccp clearly recognizes the need for ganking as a way to punish taking risks in highsec but the way that they rework ganking mechanics is very hands off it feels like they view the ganking community as wolves and the rest of the players as sheep and as if they think the wolves are getting too out of control they will make the sheep a bit harder to eat iUFFFDd like more clarity on what ccp thinks of ganking as a whole if elected but for now i want to focus on some of the common arguments against gankingthe main complaints that i hear related to the ganking are1 ganking has a negative impact on newer players2 ganking is a lowrisk activity for the ganker3 ganking offers little opportunity for interaction the first complaint is valid to an extent i know that my activities have made players quit and though i donUFFFDt target players by age i have definitely blown up newbros hauling everything they own my personal experience with being ganked proved to be a turning point for me in eve and even ccp has pointed out that retention is higher amongst players who are blown up in their initial time playingUFFFD but obviously not everyone is going to have the same reaction to losing their possessions the second point is also valid to an extent in classic eve tradition gankers have minmaxed the hell out of ganking to the point where code provides a spreadsheet for calculating the amount of damage needed to break the tank of any mining barge or exhumer based on fittings the complaint is similar to complaining that highsec incursion runners have too lowrisk for their reward  itUFFFDs generally safe because they have optimized their fits and operations to ensure optimal clearing of otherwise challenging sites killrights and a negative security statuses can be detrimental for some types of ganking or trying to enjoy other activities but otherwise donUFFFDt matter to those who live the 100 ganking lifestyle you can try to change the values of hull hp change criminal timers change concord response times and so on but gankers will inevitably adapt and mixmax their way back to relative prosperitythe final point is where i think there is the best opportunity for improvements to ganking while there is counterplay to some aspects of ganking such as counter bumping a bumper to try to free a freighter or trying to jam ships to ensure they canUFFFDt finish off their targets itUFFFDs usually not much fun trying to disrupt a gank doesnUFFFDt even feel like youUFFFDre doing more than whoring on a kill most times i would love to inevitably find a way that allows players to try and police gankers rather than the npcs to some capacity while not imposing on a gankers ability to kill someone but in all honesty i feel like the crimewatch system needs an overhaul before we can reach that pointedit iUFFFDve been toying with the idea of changing the way that concord works that instead of nuking a criminal after eventually arriving on scene that they would simply apply significant damage reduction to that criminal eventually faction police would arrive and slowly tear them apart but it could provide antiganking players with more ability to meaningfully interfere with ganks as it would take significantly longer to kill someone under the damage reduction it could also lead to more freedom for gankers to use different ships than just max dps gallente blaster boats or stealth bombers the biggest downside to this would be that i think it would make ganking more prevalent in general because well tanked larger hulls would be able to terrorize players outside of largely populated space my thoughts here are still a work in progress but iUFFFDve been reaching out to gankers and soon antigankers for their opinions on the subject to hopefully build up some better ideasmissionsi know that this had been talked to death  missions are repetitive and lack a lot of substance some people enjoy them but for a lot of players it is simply part of their grind to earn isk for other activities it would be nice to see more variety and challenge introduced to missions with the newer drifter ai for those that enjoy running them but what i would really like to see is challenging missions that require small groups to run restrict the number of players that can run the mission to a certain amount and give these players that like pve something more interesting to do than just running the same missions together on easymode thank you for taking the time to read my platform if you have any comments concerns questions etc feel free to post in this thread or contact meingame toxic yakentwitter toxicyakentweetfleet slack toxic yakenalso please consider checking out the wardec project discordinterviews

i am vic jefferson i have been playing this game for 4 years and have tried almost every aspect of this game extensively except for wormholes i believe myself to be a strong candidate for many reasons first no matter what particular aspect of this game captivates you the most there is a good chance i have been there and done that as a player and thus can both relate and understand the issues that affect you as a player many csm positions are filled by empty suits which do not play the same game you do and are given out by large power blocs effectively depriving you of a voice and giving it to power blocs over players when the csm itself is supposed to be representing players second i am not squeamish to criticism and have no issues fully listening to players and their concerns where playing the game as extensively as i do tends to put me in contact with many play styles and people third my professional career research scientist phd mandates that i am able to work collaboratively with world class experts of many disciplines and from many backgrounds UFFFD one is never graced with infinite time and resources so one must be able to communicate quickly and with minimal friction to accomplish anything where i would take a csm position with the same seriousness and professionalism as my real job i will touch on a few key points to try and persuade you that i am no different than you UFFFD a player hungry for content whether that is clawing my way closer to industrial supremacy or perpetually roaming in search of the mythical good fight i only want more opportunities and a better environment for those to happen in on every login and am willing to go one step further and try to voice our player concerns to those that author the world we play in a interaction is the only thing that really powers this gameb mechanics that deplete the available player content should be looked at first and foremostca few smaller tournaments would grow some newer competitors and enliven this aspect of the gamedrisk and reward should be at the heart of every mechanicea sample of ship balancea interaction is the only thing that really powers this game what makes you and i log in for some of us our content is meted out to us like a rat in a skinner box  turn off dota or overwatch when you get that ping and get in fleet to receive content in small killmail fortified granules for others we chase content look for the adrenaline rush try to increase our ever tenuous grasp of part of the economy or tend to our errands of individual concern however most of the persistent and good reasons to log in regardless of how you play eve are because players are allowed to plant and nurture the seeds of content UFFFD every new mechanic and revision of old mechanic should consider how much the change will enable players to interact more with other players or increase the strength and importance of existing interactions there have been great improvements to this area of the game recently citadels themselves are a great example UFFFD players may now own pseudostations in areas they previously could not and control their own markets and docking rights the industrial arrays likewise emphasize player control with added risk UFFFD with npcs out of the way these open up avenues for player interaction not requiring standings for jump clones and the security tag system are also recent examples where the former gutted one of the last legitimate uses of npc standings and the latter meant you could recover security status without having to shoot red things for hours while also adding a tiny economy around the tags the station advertising may seem trivial but in addition to providing much needed immersion it adds something that is vastly needed UFFFD a community reach out in game now surely experienced players know theres a hundred good ways to get roped into a particular corp or alliance or npsi group etc ie finding stuff to do in game as of late especially with the ghost fitting utility eve is becoming less reliant on having a small arsenal of third party programs to even attempt to progressing but what it could really use a revamp of its in game method of exposure to things like npsi public roams various activities and corp and alliance recruitment slowly but surely theres more to fight over and ccp seems to get the idea of giving the players control now you just have to find a way to get people excited and involved with things without excessively leaning on the community reliance on third party software is slowly being replaced when will community stuff follow suit
bmechanics that deplete the available player content should be looked at first and foremost take highsec incursions versus nullsec anomalies objectively you could say they are both anachronistic dinosaurs of a bygone age in video game design and you would be correct however nullsec anomalies let players plant the seeds of player content whereas highsec incursions just distort a delicate riskreward ecosystem while adding nothing to the total player content available for example if a player is out ratting in nullsec she or he is providing something to hunt for would be antagonists this in turn creates a need and a job for people to defend the ratters and this in turn can sprout into good set ups for small gang and fleet fights conversely a highsec incursion runner would be at considerably less risk spawn no chances for player interactions and be making comparable or more isk than the nullsec ratter this would be an example that needs addressing badly UFFFD riskier activities that add to the player content pool should be vastly more profitable than ones that do not UFFFD carrots not sticks need to motivate people to participate in new eden incursions should get groups on their feet an impetus to work together for a common goal in a more controlled environment not sustain them indefinitely and outshine all other options some of the latest changes have been going in this direction the new structures definitely let people take chances at things and put things at risk to seek bigger rewards UFFFD this is fantastic good game design for groups of all sizes rewarding risktaking and specialization to the point where it is worth doing is driving a lot of content faction warfare sort of gives and takes UFFFD the militias offer a ton of pick up and go content and nudge player hands toward a ton of destruction and creation however the reverse side of this is the sheer amount of farming that goes on via the missions and stabbed farmers coupled with the size of the warzone and number of plexes because the ways and means of farming lp are neither in short or in any way limited supply nor are they actually gated with a need to even be at risk from other player activity the optimal strategy is to avoid fighting in a warzone sovereignty in general right now is a mixed bag UFFFD by and large the same old players with the scale and organizational largess are still the big consumers of sov content despite aegissov mechanics letting anyone take systems quickly it still doesnt quite offer as much as it could to medium size groups either in terms of the content or income it can grant linemembers the entry barrier to sov is very low but there needs to be more compelling and obvious reasons to want sov in the first place standings are probably the most obvious thing in need of revision here UFFFD whether it is missions or faction warfare or who knows what the horrible penalties one incurs via these activities make no sense and have no place in the game currently but are absolutely characteristic of many of the artificial entry barriers the game was previously fraught with either that or add a tag system similar to the security status system for repairing faction standings quickly UFFFD take out the vintage mud era npc standings grind and let players be the freelancers they wish too many players end up victimized by standings which have ceased to offer many perks take away the penalties or offer ways around them ca few smaller tournaments would grow some newer competitors and enliven this aspect of the game now many people brush off the at i dont blame you when the same groups or derivatives of them keep winning time and time again and there arent actual good ways to gradually up your game and it is hard to build an interest as tournaments become fewer and further between this will only serve to prevent the sort of smooth inclines of interest and effort that could allow newer groups to to grow as competitors at is sort of a big ticket high entry barrier high impact event for everyone involved because it is the only real tournament around its a real simple idea UFFFD more frequent smaller tournaments would really do good stuff for the game
drisk and reward should be at the heart of every mechanic wardecs are probably one of the mechanics with the highest potential for generating engaging content but largely fail to do so because of the asymmetry of it all ie they could actually plant lots of great content seeds to get things rolling but do not currently most of the larger wardec alliances can just blanket wardec the entire game as there are no actual consequences to this other than token isk costs and no real risk to them due to high sec mechanics if the wardeccers had to actually play a game of how many alliances and entities they can safely dec at once say by actually having ante on the table things would be vastly more engaging right now theres nothing for defenders to actually attack to end the war and no actual liabilities for the attacker so the best strategy is just to dec everyone and take the easy pickings however numerous people have proposed structures or citadel modulesrigs that would be required to declare and wage war in highsec UFFFD these would be a great addition to the game because they would turn wardecs into an actual game how many and which things can i safely dec the rest of the game has a very interesting approach to content someone gets attacked somewhere for some reason suddenly they talk to their friends for help defendingUFFFDand suddenly the attackers also find allies thus the escalation begins before you know it eveUFFFDs twisted and byzantine alliances all work out whoUFFFDs side they are going to fight for over a given initially small conflict this right here is the essence of eve UFFFD there are social consequences beyond one episodic instance the game fosters these like no other and conflict is rich with many different concurrent dimensionspeople could actually get involved in the war once the attacker actually has some skin in the game now players could actually fight back UFFFD fantastic an actual risk and reward paradigm for wardeccers i have feeling that a lot of the forced mechanics and entry barriers in early eve design reached for this philosophically UFFFD opening one door comes at the cost of closing another door like standings etc but they failed in implementation because it punished players for just playing not for UFFFDbadUFFFD decisions there is no current way to be bad at wardeccing because there is nothing at riskea sample of ship balance blops are one of the last classes on the teircide agenda to infer what is on ccps mind with tii ships one merely has to follow what they say ie tii ships of all sorts represent specialization along with the work they have already done on some of the tii ship lines the tii cruiser line while there could be a good deal of smoothing to make some ships more viable does give a good philosophical paradigm you can get more tank and raw combat prowess with the aptly named heavy assault cruiser line or you could forgo these in favor of more finesse in the recon lines trading raw tank and such for utility and ewar this continues on to the tii battleships so far UFFFD you can get damage application and tank at the cost of mobility in the marauder line or you can trade the tank and some of the application for a very unique ability among subcapitals UFFFD a jump drive thats all well and good on paper but they really do leave something to be desired for the price both isk and sp currently there are few good ways to use them UFFFD looking for easy pickoffs with a few friends as tackle and damage supported by triage for ganking large targets or as an entire fleet supported by t3c logi if you have massive numbers there are those that think giving them tii resists would be a good idea UFFFD this would be a horrible idea for a few reasons first it violates the teiricide paradigm UFFFD they arent supposed to be progression from the t1 variant they are supposed to be a specialization UFFFD not simply just a better more expensive ship second this would give larger groups something that would come to be reviled UFFFD a jump fatigue reduced tii battleship fleet pushing us a little back to the prepheobe age where content and power is only in the hands of the few with a few triage prestaged these would come to asphyxiate any reasonable fights in very little time what they need is specialization if they are meant to be highly mobile platforms for quick strikes into heavily populated or defended systems they need the tools to do so right now the only appreciable reason to drop them in this particular context is to showboat honestly why would you jump in a minimum 2b ship that starts the drop at 30 capacitor requires at least one sensor booster to lock something in a reasonable time frame cannot align quickly and cannot warp while cloaked when you could use any of the other options that do comparable damage at a faction of the cost and risk granted i like blops a lot i have more isk invested in their fits than anything this doesnt change them being bad at ambush tactics when every second counts to make them specialists blops need a temporary bonus upon jumping that will make them show time ships highly capable for at most 60s such that they excel at their specialization without offering a simply better jump capable battleship it could be anything UFFFD 300 scan resolution heat damage reduction agility speed application etc furthermore a revised bridge mechanic preferably configurable on the module where you could jump your blops and its gang similar to the area effect of command destroyers would make them far less clunky and more like the specialists they were meant to be

ive listened to much of mr vince drakens voluble oratory but i admit im a little confused sure im just an average person and not some intellectual allknowing brainiac but it seems to me that vince and his fans are wolves in sheeps clothing who will destroy debauch devalue and dehumanize a wide assortment of innocent people by next weekend it is requisite even in this summary sketch to go back a few years to see how whenever i highlight the threat of highhanded terrorism in a letter such as this vince issues a standard response first he denies the threat itself then he condemns those who describe it as flagitious pigheaded shirkers this is basically vinces way of fragmenting the nation into politically disharmonious unitsif the past is any indication of the future vince will once again attempt to bring this battle to a fever pitch just because jealous cynicism exists and has for a long time there is no reason for us to accept it from him nobody wants him to effectuate the downfall of all that is decent and civilized but vince insists on doing it anyway i have reason to believe that he is about to transform our little community into a global crucible of terror and gore i pray that im wrong of course because the outcome could be devastating nevertheless the indications are there that we definitely cant afford to let vince expand augment and intensify the size and intrusiveness of his phalanx of satanic schmegeggies what im suggesting is that we convert retreat into advance thats the key to holding vince to account for bringing ugliness and nastiness into our lives and its the only way that most people will ever learn that vince has recently altered the tone of his codices theyre no longer a dirgelike recitation of perpetual victimization but rather a preview of new trends in UFFFDresistanceUFFFD propagandizing for example vince has been showcasing his latest techniques for obscuring unpleasant facts facts such as that we find among narrow and uneducated minds the belief that the majority of covinous hoddypeaks are heroes if not saints this belief is due to a basic confusion that can be cleared up simply by stating that its our responsibility to induce vince to perceive his errors of perception and judgment and make him realize that his helots do not accept the fact that mankind with all of its accumulated knowledge wonderful machines scientific methods and material power still has much to fear from baleful doofuses like him thats the first step in renewing those institutions of civil societyUFFFDlike families schools churches and civic groupsUFFFDthat advance a clear credible and effective vision for dealing with our present dilemma and its most virulent manifestations and its the only way to tend to the casualties of his war on sanityvince like all semiintelligible snollygosters is unsympathetic i do have to apologize for that not all of them are unsympathetic just kidding yes they are all such humor aside i overheard one of vinces backers say UFFFDthere wont be any blowback from vinces exploiting the feelings of charity and guilt that many people have over the plight of the homelessUFFFD this quotation demonstrates the power of language as it epitomizes the UFFFDusthemUFFFD dichotomy within hegemonic discourse as for me i prefer to use language to build a true community of spirit and purpose based on mutual respect and caring i have one final message for you before ending this letter any claim to the contrary is patently false

id like to take a moment to remind yall that a the nda exists so we cant just say this is coming this will be changed  b were not ccp we cant actually make changes directly our job is to convince ccp that they need toyou are far more likely to get an interesting discussion if you ask our thoughts regarding a subject or asking us to discuss it

the future of the eve ipaside from a few vr side projects for those lucky few with the headsets and the computers to play them does ccp intend to create new experiencesgames based in the eve universe for those who are not interested by eve online the mythical project nova opening a certain door even new books or something
how do you feel about the current state of the combat rorqual
1 is there any work being done about the completely obsolete standing system towards npcs any chance we see something done about it in relation to the new ai that is being implemented in the form of the mining operations and their defense fleets2 any chance we can finally get rid of atributes i know that implants are one of the main source of income from lp stores but cmon they can be used to something different3 is there some kind of roadmap regarding balancing issues
and to add myself and ccp logibro will also be there so some questions we might be able to grab and sort out on behalf of ccp but the focus of the discussion will be on the csm and their thoughtsccp guard  eve community developer  ccpguard
questions for the csm1 do you know you dont do anything worthwhile2 have you ever thought about doing something worthwhile3 did you know that liquid ozone is not considered a charge 4 if the csm has failed at impacting something as minor as 3 how can anyone expect you to have a positive impact on anything else in the gameregard
well id like to see you guys bring up1 alliance bookmarks  this just should be a thing 2 the horrendously broken wardec mechanic the evereddit page has a ton of great suggestions from tieing wardecs to structures to just increasing wardec costs to reflect the inflation that has hit the game its no longer 250300m for a plex it doesnt make sense that wardec fees havent increased as well nothing is safe in eve ever but if it actually cost isk that was more than a hs mission runner makes in an hour people might consider who they want to wardec before blanket wardeccing 100 corps for kickswho knows might make some of the station camping wardeccers actually go looking for content
how do you andor ccp view highsec in comparison to other regions of spacedo you think highsec could stand to benefit from more conflict drivers over the space itself
ccp announced their intention to get rid of the attribute system a year or two ago but it is still there likely because they still havent figured out what to do with learning implants and the lp marketif attributes dont get removed soon could you try to convince ccp to at least lower the remap cooldown to 3 months or so as an easy to implement stop gap measure in the meantime

probably the single most develop platform of anyone running for csm currently
what are some of the main changes you would propose
im not really going in with a wishlist of stuff i want ccp to do because like i said in my op that isnt how the csm works its a sounding board in terms of key points id like to see more rollbacks from phoebe and the entire entosis mechanic removed and replaced with something else
rolled back howwhat about the sov mechanics would you want changed
what a disaster of a portrait your opinion is irrelevant

what ideaschanges would you introduce into eve essentially what is your platform

since its well known that ccp doesnt want our money see the store as exemple this is the csm member we need to empty our wallet so ccp can spend more on vr fps and other succesfull project in the futurjewnior do you plan on telling ccp that they should licence the eve ip to some studios so we could have more spin off of eve everywhere wargamingnet eve world of spaceshipstelltale games tales from the eve universettgames lego eve onlinerovio angrybird  deklein to delve egg chasesupercell eve clash of egosetc etcloyal servent to mother amamake evetetsel
if there was one thing id like to hear the csm discuss it would be planetary interaction which is virtually unchanged since its initial deployment and certainly has scope for improvement and added features surely if space colonisation is the end goal then planetary interaction should be an important component
1 pi  more like simplanet planetary guns to defend ground instalation command center with fitting options orbital ammo to support ground troops all kind of commandos mercs etc finally would have use with fighting over planetary resources possible in the future2 procedurally generated pve content  possible or not 3 data sites  loot value missed opportunity with citadels introduction as shown with drones parts small change can boost loot value significantly data sites is content with little purpose to do any chances to look at it4 polarized weapons  what for i had a feeling they were introduced to fight with drifters very niche modules imo not worth fitting any ideas what to do with them or change them5 standings  from one of minutes i got the feeling it wont be possible to have good standings with all empire factions is this thing being developed further 6 tiercide and balance  while balance is more delicate tiercide is crucial what is the state of it7 revamps  remove8 state of boosters  are devs happy that narcotis are legal now i bet they do  what was the impatc of that change any twiks to it in the future9 implants made by players  as stated10 new space  jove  confilct driver11 faction warfare and standings  i want to do some faction pvp but i dont want to lose my standings so i enlist for 3 weeks fight for militia and be a target to others empires navies and after that period i choose to stay or be removed from the army without standing losess good bad idea12 new empire ships new faction etc
can we have a statement on why chinese eve servers have superior ship skins available and tq does not the ships are all ccps ip so i dont really think it is an ownership or copyright issue i am assured this qurstion will be answered in stream by thejudge but i would like other csms thoughts on the quality  quantity of dank killer skins that would make me part with my moneythat are actually not available on tqspace cadet online  a wee blog about my exploits mass of wrecks  public npsi events fleet  launching 28th august
1 why does the tempest have better bonuses than the tempest fleet issue2 why are there no missiles in minmatar lp storesthere are good missile ships in the minmatar t1 and t2 lineup breacher bellicose scythe fleet issue cyclone claymore typhoon this makes sense after all missiles are the minmatars secondary weapon systemsimilarly hybrid weapons are the caldaris secondary weapon systemwhy do the caldari get access to hybrid charges in their lp store but minmatar dont get access to missilesi mean even look at this theres both a republic fleet ballistic control unit and a caldari navy ballistic control unit so why no republic fleet missilesmain reason im griping is because my standings are bad with caldari but good with minmatar but i cant convert minmatar lp into good faction missiles if a caldari pilot has terrible standings with gallente its no big deal because they can still buy hybrid charges from their own lp store
any plans to make 30 day ship skins permanent does anyone actually buy a 30 day skin why not make them all permanent thanks csm and ccp
those look like fingers belonging to someone who sits in a basement waiting for mom to bring more hotpockets when was the last time you felled a tree with an axe 
im sorry but this is insulting for me consider i made a very public article discussing the changes to the mining command ships and a very large portion of which made it in the final product if you would like to bring up industry specifically i wasam in weekly and sometimes daily discussions with devs about numerous industry topics i would also like to point out this post which specifically mentioned the csm having an impact on the engineering complexs which are about as industry as you can get furthermore two members on the csm are literally the logistical leaders for the largest alliance in the game im sorry that industry isnt getting the amount of updates to it you would like to see but to say its no getting any love or lacking is insulting to the current csm and their efforts
i did that out of humor due to so many others doing it thought it was worth a laugh but i do see your point and thought it over and removed that part of the header
you quite obviously do very little research before you comment thanks for the bump to the top of the forums though yes we have been killing alot of poss and modules but if you knew anything of co2 then thats kinda expected at this time additionally not a f1 monkey due to the fact i am usually fc during my timezone which mean 34 characters logged in 1 anchor 1 cyno 1 capital alot more than f1 being pushed click that magical button on zkill that goes to the next page and be amazed
nah dude sir katchaturian is 100 correctif you wish to represent pvp start by representing your own way out of that pit of mediocrity you call a killboard
as long as you dont plan to lobby csm to have whatever fixed in eve gameplay im fine making new eden even greater than it already is easy  leave ccp alone just let it milk the cow make the rich kids pay the only people worth playing with will adapt and justice for the rest
do you have any opinion on the oppressive gender stereotypes in eve online  my gaming experience could be far more immersive should i be able to identity myself outside of the absolutely barbaric yet usual paradigm

i tend to keep away from campaign drama but in this case i think ill wade into the cesspit of bad candidature thermal you are promoting the embodiment of exactly what is wrong with public perception with the csm while i dont always agree with what certain eve personalities do your behaviour towards others within this community can only be viewed as reprehensible not only that but you are consistently making a mockery of the very idea of the csm be it a troll or not a group that you claim to want to be a part of and represent i strongly believe that people will vote with their feet and completely ignore your excuse of a candidacy but i still wanted to make my opinion on actions like this completely clear and transparentid rethink your platform and behavior if i was you
i have removed a post under the above rule

got my vote stay awesome and keep fighting the good fight
how do you want to fix ecmthe idea that an action that is essentially not considered offensive should have perhaps the hardest and most binary counter in the game is ridiculous there are many ways to make it much less game breakingmy vote is dependent on how big deal this is for you and how you want to change italso what is your view on the balance of logistics and how it affects small gangsolo
that is definitely not how i wanted it to come out was poorly worded on my part which i have went back to try to word it better sorry about that i really do appreciate you guys and what you have been doing  and everything from the current csm has been great which has been very refreshingwhat i am trying to say the most is that i would like to see more industry folks on the csm theres been a lot of industry updates changes additions and now we have upcoming drilling platforms  so i feel that it would be very beneficial to have a more strong industrial minded players to the table
i just have a few questions i wonder if you wouldnt mind answering1 in your time with black legion you mention you helped out with a lot of tasks could you give some examples so we know more about your experience in eve2 given that you are in both hard knocks and adversity which area of space do you think needs more attention from ccp null sec or wspace why3 looking at your posting history on reddit you seem to have some experience working with crest and the apis what do you think about ccpUFFFDs move to esi and their implementation so far4 recently you stated that eve is not a game for those looking for a good pve experience what in your opinion makes for a good pve experience5 you stated that most of your concerns over structures have been alleviated what concerns do you still havethank you

i just have a few question i wonder if you wouldnt mind answering1 without breaking the nda what were the issues you concentrated on the most during your time on csm 112 you state that one year is not enough time for a csm member to work at maximum efficiency why3 what do you see as the biggest issues csm xii will have to deal with this includes issues with the way the csm is run as well as any ingame issues4 at the first summit you brought up the issue of focus groups but the minutes didnUFFFDt record your position what is your position on the use of focus groups5 you were quite vocal in your displeasure in the changes to the eula that banned gambling organizations in eve according to the attendance spreadsheet jinUFFFDtaan maintains your live participation in meetings dropped from 74 before the changes down to 25 was your participation affected because ccp did something you disagreed withthank you
i just have a few questions i wonder if you wouldnt mind answering1 you stated that you are not one of the UFFFDeve famous clubUFFFD what advantages do you think you bring to the csm because you are not efamous 2 while in infensus you stated you were involved in black ops was that as an fc or just a regular fleet member did you maintain your interest in black ops until today3 you indicated you like exploration do you run combat sites or are you attracted more to hacking also do you think the rewards for exploration are in a good state4 you stated you do a bit of industry on the side as a member of goonswarm i assume you do this in null sec what type of industry do you do and do you use citadels5you started as a high sec miner and consider that occupation a rut that leads to burnout do you just consider mining bad or is it all of high secthank you

thanks for your answers  as difficult as it might seem with your generous help there may be a small chance to make eve online even more awesome than it already is ccp already got great ideas like naming after the nicest people in eve some modules like the faction entosis modules that precise idea might be extended to other modules and make ccp richer for example special namings for other existing factionmeta modules could be auctionned by ccp helping them to make a lot of money to buy more pizza for the devs  hamsters you could for example imagine somealliance even awesomer integrated warp core stabilizers or named faction snowballs launchers etc  you can even imagine alliances auctionning to have some modules like existing faction strip miners named after other alliances namesfor example wouldny you love to see aram kachaturianc realgood expanded cargohold instead of basic expanded cargohold sold on eve markets 
this is a brilliant idea with the only caveat that aram wouldnt want his name on expanded cargoholds strip miners maybein one of the recent podcasts i think it was last weeks talking in stations pgl was saying that the csm really was a focus group and that good csm members were the ones who actually knew their stuff when ccp devs would toss bright ideas at them out of the bluenow it is a fact that reluctant though they might be to admit it those who fancy themselves as the new eden trendsetters for everything swagrelated actually take their cue from aram with ccp spending so much time on nonspaceshiprelated stuff like skins and apparels it is high time someone like jewnior mcblazing got his rightful place at the csm table
izi tears from pleb
mike represents the lobbysts who made the mess that is eve today go back to your abyss demon
i can understand the problem but using an elected body like the csm for that just sounds really dumb i wouldnt expect to have my car fixed by voting for a mechanic as a sandbox eve is a society  in a society elections are a process by which a society which recognizes itself divided that is to say crossed by contradictions of interest and which is fixed as modality to associate in equal parts each citizen in the expression of these contradictions analysis of these contradictions and the deliberation of these contradictions with a view to arriving at an arbitrationmy solution seems far easier to my eyes  have ccp earn moor monnies hire testers get game fixed and buy pizza for hamsters  devs im sure juniors approach lets make money first then hire nice people could achieve such a result

if anyone wants to see some of his bright ideas to help against large groups her you go
you claim to be against the big guys and for the little guys yet you argue for proposals that have significant negative impacts on solosmall groups and dont address any of the concerns at all heresuggestion for csm inspired requirement to post on the forumcynos  its time to talk about itvalid points have been ignored in favour of entering into bickering debate and disregard for staying on topicwhy should we have any belief that you will be able to interact maturely with other csm members and with ccp staff if you cant even address issues in the forum
there will always be valid points brought up by all sides of a discussion and this is exactly the side i am coming from that i am defending unless ccp tells otherwise in the updated white papers soon to be released i see the csm as an elected lobbyists group this means differentiated view points coming from different experiences and playstyles from which ccp can decide of the best course of action i do not ignore valid points i disagree with the validity of your pointsi would not have put the idea of jumping bridging ship at the end of a bridge if i did not believe it served a valid purpose to clearly indicate to voters where i stand on these kind of issues i also welcome the new rule for csm candidate and wish it would apply on forums posters in the same way toonow you not liking my stance simply indicates that you are not going to vote for me this is fine i do not believe older players and members of larger groups see the issues the way i see them not being that old in the game myself and mostly playing solo
funnily you also seem to disagree with the validity of all other posts that raise concerns with the proposalstheres not a single concern raised by anyone in those threads that has been acknowledged and accepted as a valid reason to change the proposals to a different position go figure it seems based on the forum posts in those threads that anyone who has a different view or idea is just not validnot what we need in the csm for sure
just wanted to bring attention to thisimminently after the introduction of fozzi sov me and 10 friends decided we would see if the claims were true and if it meant small groups could take sov this was one of the changes we imminently supported as with only a handful of guys going around entosising nodes after every troll attempted was burning us out once we no longer had to worry about them unless there was some one actively trying to take them we were able to go back to enjoying the gameyou will see this in a lot of his other posts he seems to have little to no understanding what small groups actually have to deal with and sees everything that may help a large group as some illuminati conspiracy to keep the elite in power
to counter balance my last post i will try and be helpfulyou want to fix sov and do exactly what you are trying to hereremove sovput system upgrades into new structures independent from an ihub if you really want to make it hard to hold more systems then you are using make it fuel based and not bill basedand thats all you have to do you own space simply because you say you do and because you live there and support the infrastructure of the system ps also go with ccps idea that moon mining becomes spawned belts from the drill platform and players need to actively mine it
i just have a few questions i wonder if you wouldnt mind answering1 you state that we have no idea about the history of the player behind the alt yet you are running on an alt how do we know that all the things you are telling us about yourself are true2 you want to give incentives to players to automatically link accounts what type of incentives would you propose given the ability to create an alpha account to link to an omega account to get the benefit3 you want to have some sort of mission simulator so new players can practice missions what do you find lacking in inception aka the new new player experience that warrants taking such an approach4 you favor limiting api access what types of information would you allow the api to access5 players elected to the csm are expected to support changes that would improve the game even if the change hurts their particular playstyle you seem pretty set in your hatred of groups like goonswarm and pandemic legion would you support changes to the game even if they helped major alliances at the expense of solo playersthank you
i believe the ability to scam steal cloaky camp gank or spy in the game is an activity that is no risks and all rewards unlike other regular activities because the other pilots of the player undertaking these otherwise valid options do not suffer any risk to their main isk making assets for me it breaks the concept of risk vs rewards that eve is all about and that any miner hauler trader missioner or pvper have to facei started running under an alt to separate my assets at the time from the risk of backlash ingame from opinions that i would carry that i know are not popular among power players because my campaign is all about curtailing the influence they have on the game and look at features more from the little guy perspective solo players or microcorps power players do not want change that can trheaten their own assets like the siphonsat the time there was no reason for me to not use the means in the game to hide your alts that all other players benefited from and i had to protect my assetsccp has put a new requirement that i welcome i am not the target those power players that create fake decoy candidate alts to spread out the independent votes for the csm are my best known alt is borat and none of my other alts are well known to the community like i said before i am a little guy mostly playing soloas a matter of facts for those that were curious enough to follow my game blog i have started to communicate about my alts there for those that did not pick up on that already here is a reference link that will tell you more about my main and other alts
nobody likes a grass steve
if that was meant to be a secret do you think i would have posted it to my own twitter kek
glad to hear it  btw i am happy to answer any eve related questions regarding my ideas on any topic in eve as an alliance exec down to a pvp pve fc or industry go ahead and fire away
so did after all you learned did you get your revenge on code
no i came to terms with my loss as i grew to better understand the game eventually i even spent time learning to gank with lessons from a few code folks the option for revenge is definately there anyone familiar with zopiclones theft of code assets but thats not quite the revenge a lot of gank victims want
i noticed today your campaign item about cyno inhibitors as you may have seen i push a different idea but we may be sharing some common observations regarding the power of cynos a player has posted an op on cynos on the forum herei bleieve you have not seen it yet as i am sure that as a csm candidate with an item on the subject of cynos you would have already jumped in the discussion i would certainly be glad to read about your positions in that area over there
hi violentdesire i think that everyone in the game and ccp themselves especially since ccp rise has made jokes about when he joined ccp he was going to fix ecm knows that ecm is a terrible mechanic with horrible game design im not sure how to completely redesign and change ecm to a different mechanic it would take a lot of work words and probably be a jesus level feature from ccp since its deeply ingrained into the game and would require the rebalance of 8 caldari ships on top of everything else some ideas that i would like to push for ecm that dont fundamentally change the ways in which ecm works requiring a complete redesign are as followsecm drones  change them to lockbreaker drones i hate ecm drones i feel like they are by far the biggest offenders for the frustration offered up by getting jammed i would like them to be changed into lockbreaker drones instead of ecm drones so that way they can help you run away from a fight or an encounter but they wouldnt be lol i rolled a 6 i just won this fight that they are now for 1v1 and some small gang engagements they have such a huge randomness delta for such little cost although this would kill the griffin navy issue and ecm solo pvp lol i feel that making ecm non chance based and absolute would also go a long way to improving the gameplay surrounding ecm i really like this idea from a long time ago where instead of being jammed 50 of the time you would just lose 50 of your locks etc this would improve small gang fights involving ecm a lot
i feel like pvp use is of the most importance to me i personally feel like a lot of pve content should be rehashed and redesigned to be more engaging fun and pvp like i must admit that i often do not consider pve uses when i talk about ships mostly because i do not engage in much pve myself and my knowledge is much more limited on that front but if anyone has any concerns with pve usage of ships i definitely will consider those concerns into proposals and bring them up with ccp contributer to eve is easy
hey there folks id like to officially announce running for csm xii im an industrialist at heart and have experience in both nullsec and highsec currently a director in 00 massive dynamics in test alliancei have played eve for just under 2 years i started in highsec but soon found my calling in nullsec first out in tenerifisimmensia then out in drone space renting with a small group of like minded folks from there i ended up with 00 massive dynamics in fountain being evicted there we moved to vale of the silent with test and now we are headed south i run multiple toons almost entirely focused on mining building and pi i ran last year for csm xi on an industry platform im doing the same this year industry particularly mining is currently in a good place though it could use some tweaks in a couple areas however my primary focus this year is going to be on planetary interaction with a secondary of an additional types of battleships andor battlecruisersplanetary interaction well its a click fest i feel like it could definitely be better the ability to save setups would be amazing or to route multiple factories at once additionally the planets could use a balance pass so many planets are crap and then so many are great lets try to balance it out a bit the ui could definitely use some improvement as well all in all honestly the entire pi system could use an overhaul its needed and has been needed for some time nownow as far as a new type of battleship im thinking a t3 battleship in the last year we have seen a huge number of frigates added along with t3ds but yet nothing above that for subcaps battleships and battlecruisers have the fewest choices available why not add to that a multirole tech 3 battleship could be amazing perhaps you want a logistics battleship or perhaps a battleship with extreme long range 200k but sacrificing tank or even a brick 300k ehp but sacrificing damage or perhaps add another choice to miners with a mining subsystem and yes i know that we have the porpoise and orca for battlecruiserbattleship equivalent but those are still primarily boosters with the ability to mine that is still less then that of an exhumer but perhaps a mining battleshipsized ship that does 1015 higher yield then a hulk who knows honestly its a idea in progress but i do believe that battle cruisers and battleships could use a little fleshing out on the tech treeat the end of the day im not looking to only look out for the interests of any particular sec status group i want to represent industrialists all over space from hs ls ns and wh after all we are all doing the same activities the only difference is where and with whomthank you for reading and i hope to have your vote when the time comesterandria

im sorry did you say things like scams are no risk and all reward how many scams have you taken part in i dont even mean high end ones where you invest more than a year of your life even just the small ones that may involve days of sitting around in jita localremember isk you are not making is isk you are losing any scam you partake in risks all the isk you could be making in the time it is taking you to pull off the scam

happy to see wormholes getting some love itd be nice to see improvements to c56 space to make life in them more attractive id also like to see more love for wormholes through the npe it was frustrating to see people warning newbros to not enter wormhole space whatsoever and discouraging exploring them scanning ui getting some love too is great making it less obtrusive smoother and attractive to older players like myself who favor the old ui
que changeriezvous au sujet du npe
cest une bonne question thats a good questionexpand on the training specifcally advancing the ideas surrounding pvp ship fitting and war mechanicscest une bonne question dUFFFDveloppez la formation spUFFFDcifiquement en avanUFFFDant les idUFFFDes autour du pvp de larmement et de la mUFFFDcanique de guerreill admit had to translate a few of those so hope it works well
i was wondering if you could answer some questions1 when you announced your candidacy you sent out a tweet with a graphic that read UFFFDaims to bring real combat into warsUFFFD what did you mean by that 2 your alliance focuses on bringing alpha players into the game how well prepared does the inception tutorial make them for flying in your alliance what do you think ccp should add or subtract to make alphas better prepared for life after the new player experience3 you stated that one of your aims is to get alphas involved in wormhole combat what type of challenges does that present since alpha characters cannot fit a cloak4 it appears you have a lot of experience in public groups like incursion fleets and spectre fleet as a fleet commander what do you think ccp could do to make the life of someone who organizes and leads public groups easier5 you stated in your campaign post that you are also an industrialist who runs a modest amount of towers aside from pos what are the most painful parts of being an industrialist that you wish ccp would take a look atthank you

so i want to give defence a reason not only to play the game but to actually win the war for 3 years ive been in focus groups and conversations regarding the how so far the changes i would hope for is region based wars nuetral logi not suspect but criminal tagged and tie the wars to objectives offence says we will reinforce a structure within the next vulnerability timer if they fail war ends if they succeed war continues adding in a diplomatic window for negociating cease fire or war end  extortion possibility with various conditions like cant war deck again for x weeks new tutorial is a work in progress using polite terms it lacks any kind of fitting advice beyond fit a scanner things like resistances buffer vs active tanking a small tutorial about wars and their mechanics would go a long way didtch the auto pilot part of the training its a bad habit to estabilish early on we do alot of bait and switch bait people into a fight then pile on with peiple coming from our hole or nieghbor hole alphas of all ages can do this with ease though cough alliance bookmarks would helppublic groups need a better way to advertize their presence not sure what this will look like but something maybe simlar to corp adds interface with filters to find the content you wantpi  id rather cut myself than manage my pi sometimes expecially when the heat map lies or i have to rebuild the whole setup causs the deposits are no longer in range of my setup
so thee two are connected for instance allies cant rep each other not due to war mechs but due to crimewatch tgis is one of many issues between the two mechanicsganking balance is fine as is with the recent static hull resist bonus its been better for haulers and still plenty of 20b plus kills
you have my bow kind sir o7
on the face of it a balanced proposal with a good idea of the current balance however what do you mean exactly in terms of overhauling crimewatch where does the issue actually lie is it the safety bar which you have an issue with that is actually something that helps ag players in the very difficult task of antiganking which is not exactly fun as you quite rightly pointed outmost players see the mining barges and exhumers as reasonably well balanced because people have an option to take a yield hit to use a tanky ship such as the procurer and skiff so in affect those people getting blown up in mining ships made choices for yield which is finethe issue with the code  miniluv spreadsheet approach rests entirely with freighter ganking but the issue in that area is more to do with bumping because they can hold the freighter there indefinitely while assembling a gank fleet that part of it needs looking at because it is not a dash to see if they can slip through and results in stale uninteresting play that needs sortingwith the arrival of citadels perhaps now is the time for npc stations to have penalties for the criminal security statusthe war dec system is fine but the fee for very large alliances needs to be reduced and there has to be restrictions to prevent continuous war decs but on the other hand i would make the war dec follow a character if he joins any player corp within the week of the war dec applyingi am not in favour of something artificial to fight over but your suggestion of an impact in reducing the war dec time based on activity is a good suggestion the removal of the watch list is a good thing in terms of hisec wars as people can operate off the beaten path which improves things i would support the locator agents giving online status as people have suggested however with one proviso should i have very high standings with those agents corps they also tell me that i am being checked on everything has to have a riskit would be good to have a player who while a ganker actually sees the balance side of things though i would like to see a bit more meat on the bone in terms of proposals so far i am interested in what you have put up blocked teckos pech sonya corvinus baltec1 shae tadaruwa wander prian daichi yamato jonah gravenstein merin ryskin linus gorp
toxic has my votei believe he is going to represent my concerns welldracthe issues with crimewatch primarily revolve around logisticsi think we can all agree that neutral logi feels like getting bullshitted and no one likes itits directly impacted my and many others ability to get a fight because people assume 3 of local will appear in guardians as soon as they commitfor another example  you gain a suspect flag for providing logistics to someone whos war you are allied in which is extremely unintuitivein short its impeding warfare where it shouldnt and needs a good looking at
ralph i was never sure whether they fixed it so that you could rep alliance mates which wa something that got my goat when i realised you could not has that been fixed now i know ccp said they would but saying and doing is two totally different thingsthe neutral rr is better than it was previously in that now they go suspect it annoyed the hell out of me when you could not even touch them in the past which is why i never partaked of any hisec combat until that stupidity got removed i actually suggest to people to have an out of corp wing ready to come in on the neutral rr for when they go fy if people get off their butt and start dealing with them as they go fy then great all you have to do is follow certain people around and you can nail them if some people started doing that it would change the attitude a bit perhaps i should start doing that a target does come to mindi agree the suspect flag for helping someone you are allied with makes no sense what so ever that needs changing it would also create more interesting conflict in hisec in my opinion blocked teckos pech sonya corvinus baltec1 shae tadaruwa wander prian daichi yamato jonah gravenstein merin ryskin linus gorp
thanks for saving me from typing out those points about crimewatch and wars ralph iUFFFDm not quite sure what you mean by safety bar would you mind elaboratingi donUFFFDt have much an issue with codeminiluv having their math already figured out it was more just to point out how gankers have got their minmaxing down for ganking to reduce their costs and risk as for bumping my understanding is the ccp doesnUFFFDt like it in its current form but havenUFFFDt made any progress in their plans to limit the amount of time someone can be bumped while out of combat even with a change like this it would just mean gankers would need more disposable ships to hold down a freighter with a point to reset any progress made towards safely warping out so i dont know how ccp plan to make this workcould you elaborate on why you think this would be a good idea most popular ganking systems have multiple public citadels that gankers could safely use UFFFD iUFFFDm surprised you wouldnUFFFDt prefer gankers leaving npc stations where antiganking forces at least have some chance to intercept themthere has been a bit of discussion in the wardec project about costs for declaring wars and iUFFFDm inclined to agree with you on that point i still think there are other issues to explore such as some that ralph pointed out already i also worry that giving aggressors a structure that can be destroyed to end the war would have serious repercussions on the wardeccing community as a whole iUFFFDm sure that some readers might laugh at the concept of this so let me explain my concern smaller wardec corporations are generally better at getting defenders to participate in highsec wars than larger ones because they come across as defeatable when watchlists were removed last year there was a decline in smaller sized wardeccing entities because hunting for content became more difficult for them and forcing them to defend structures will only further push them into larger groups or out of wardeccing entirely at that point it becomes a question of what do the bigger highsec wardeccing and mercenary groups need to do to ensure that they can continue to maintain content for their members could it lead to them forming the biggest bluest donut possible could that in turn lead to these larger groups monopolizing highsec wardeccing by knocking over the smaller competitions citadels would there be fewer wars declared against larger entities and more of a shift towards targeting smaller less capable groups would this change be more helpful for the average highsec defender or is this change more for bigger groups i think these are just a few of the questions that need exploring on this idea aloneiUFFFDm also sure some wardeccers would love your suggestion of wars following players who attempt to evade them but no i disagree on that point iUFFFDd rather see reworks to corporations to incentivize players to stay and defend their corporation
to be honest i donUFFFDt have a lot of meat for the subject of ganking in part because iUFFFDm trying to balance what gankers think ganking should be what antigankers think it should be and what i think ccp wants it to be iUFFFDve been toying with the idea of changing the way that concord works that instead of nuking a criminal after eventually arriving on scene that they would simply apply significant damage reduction to that criminal eventually faction police would arrive and slowly tear them apart but it could provide antiganking players with more ability to meaningfully interfere with ganks as it would take significantly longer to kill someone under the damage reduction it could also lead to more freedom for gankers to use different ships than just max dps gallente blaster boats or stealth bombers the biggest downside to this would be that i think it would make ganking more prevalent in general because well tanked larger hulls would be able to terrorize players outside of largely populated space my thoughts here are still a work in progress but iUFFFDve been reaching out to gankers and soon antigankers for their opinions on the subject to hopefully build up some better ideasthanks for your points i will update the platform accordingly after work
safety bar is where you can set your engagement parameters green full safety you dont attack anyone unless they are suspect if you are repping someone and they go suspect you stop that rep suspect allows you to go suspect in such a situation and allows you to enage suspects and have a limited timer and so on it has made people a lot more sure to do stuff n hisecthe bumping mechanic gives them total strategic control over the situation and enables them to stackup victms instead of a rush to get on a juicy freighter to gank it it is just hold it in place and gank at their leisure without bumping people would take risks to sneak through and it would reward clever play like keeping an eye out for ganks before moving through choke points it would reward clever players who had their wits about themif you remove docking rights then it becomes a conflict point you can as a group start to threaten citadel owners who dont block them from entering and if they still let them then blow it up this will create conflict the gankers will of course put their own up and people will have additional reasons to blow them up i know of a couple of ganker owned citadels and if people saw this as a value thing to do to make their life more difficult then it would create a new conflict driverin reality catching gankers as they mass undock and warp to an instra undock is not easy as they use small fast ships it is like trying to catch them as they mass jump through a gate the lag can be an issue many of us wan to see more reasons to have war decs and citadels used by gankers would be a good onei disagree with a structure that you are forced to defend so we agree catch the flag type rubbish does not sit in what to me should be a strategy game i for one would not do it i have suggested an oa per constellation for a watch list type system of some sort as something to create conflict but the war dec mercs were mainly camping choke points and hubs anyway i think raitarus are too weak same is true of astrahus most hisec players have no chance against the mercs or the small corps that attack them perhaps this will force them to band together so having it as it is no is perhaps a chicken and egg situation for more meaningful hisec entities to form at the moment most of hisec are one man corps on full avoidance mode taht does not work going forward and will create changethe suggestion of the war dec following was to get around people closing corps and resetting up as before the reasons for defending their corp or even go into space require something to defend an abstract something ion space would not work for me as i would just go play witcher 3 or skyrim or jc to stain the ecs and citadels could do the business for this as being something to defend the blanket war decs while silly in one sense dont bother me because they dont hunt so as i avoid the pipes and hubs when i get a war dec by them it does not matter and the good thing is that more people are doing things in space since the watch lists went which will get to a balance as people will start hunting again the change to the loactor agents will push that changeyou concord suggestions are interesting because having larger ships to take benefit from this change would enable people to catch them add that to the reduction in bumping and we get some fun conflictthanks for the replies and thinking it through i often get accused of being against pvp in fact i think ganking adds to the game i want it to be more of a conflict driver as compared to a certain number of multiboxers having a massive isk making deal from it and such stale gameplay i will keep an eye on things but you are looking likely to get my votes blocked teckos pech sonya corvinus baltec1 shae tadaruwa wander prian daichi yamato jonah gravenstein merin ryskin linus gorp
awesome ill check it out right now
very happy to read thisi support you 100 learned lot from youo7
you will get my vote you on the csm can only be all good
as a long time listener and new member to the eve radio staff id like to say you have my complete support yumene your dedication to the community shows at eve radio and i believe the traits that make you a good leader at er will make you a fine representative of the eve community as a whole
i was wondering if you could answer some questions1 you have captained the pandemic legion alliance tournament team and tournaments are very important to you serving on the csm might take 2 or 3 hours of your time each day how would you make time to both serve on the csm and on the pl at team2 back in 2013 you were involved in the running of pandemic legionUFFFDs rental alliance brothers of tangra despite the changes introduced in aegis sov we still see groups form up rental alliances do you think rental alliances are a good idea today and do you think ccp needs to do anything to either help or hinder rental alliances3 you fly a rorqual a lot of people consider the ship overpowered what would you recommend changing about the rorqual4 you stated that ccp needs to expand the new player experience what do you think needs to be added in order to make new players more capable of flying alongside pandemic horde or pandemic legion5 i hear a lot of complaints about the spread out nature of sov fights in the aegis sov system you like the idea of multiple skirmishes over multiple nodes what do you think ccp can do to get more players to accept that type of fightthank you
1 finding time for things i am involved in has never been a problem for me if time was an issue i would put csm duties first2 i personally think rental alliance are great there are three factors behind this first being they provide isk income to the rental alliance that own them second they provide an area for people to move out to null sec in my rental days i have seen a lot of hisec  lowsec players look to renting space as a way to jump start their null sec experience whether it be mining ratting or pvping third it is also great for the pvpers who like to roam and hunt for miners and ratters 3 i love the the rorqual this is true due i consider this ship overpowered i would have to say yes and no the most overpowered part of the rorqual that needs changing is 100 what people call jump hictors i agree that being invulnerable and still tackling supers at the same time is broken4 i believe that alphas should be able to fly every race to me race locking them must be no fun for the alpha pilot if they every wanna fly a different race ship they have to create a new character5 this is a tricky one i dont really have a solution at the moment  that being said i do thing aegis sov is better than all the previous sov systems we have had before it just needs to be improved some how

this is a question of interpretation i joined in 2009 and i think hisec is a lot more dangerous then it was then also there are no safe spaces in eve hisec is not safe you fly a freighter with over 1bn of cargo you fly haulers and transport ships with cargo you fly covetors hulks macs and retreivers and ventures and you will find out just how unsafe hisec really isof course there is more to it i spent the majority of my time in 00 your suggestion of a focus group to discuss this is a good start but if you fill it with htfu players only then it is going to be a typical echo chamber of stupidity where all you want to do is reduce reasons and rewards to be in hisec which will force people from the game rather than force them out of hisec also you think that these players are monolithic well many of us base in hisec but also operate in wormholes and low sec and even npc null how do you know that they are always in hiseci went back to basing in hisec because afk cloaky camping allied to massive drops bores me to death i have proposed a fix in the features and ideas for this with an afk flag using an oa structure that applies after an hour of inactivity and that flag will go with any interaction on the client also a probe that will identify the grid of a cloaked ship so intelligent people can hunt them the watch list removal though a good idea removed vital intel from the prey while the arrival of skill injectors enabled players to create clean cyno alts which again does not help all the intel used by the prey got removed so the balance is out of kilter there are other steps that may need to be taken but trying something that adjusts the intel balance back would be a good startsmaller alliances get a taste of this negative 2424 77 area denial and get fed up and head back to hisec i have seen it happen yet many of them want to be in 00 you can bluster about safe spaces and carebears and all that but why should they be forced to engage in such goddam awful play by pushing them out of hisec i suspect you will just blame it on their attitude and suggest they go to wow when many of them would quite like to earn isk and fight roaming gangs and do sov war blocked teckos pech sonya corvinus baltec1 shae tadaruwa wander prian daichi yamato jonah gravenstein merin ryskin linus gorp
he has no idea about the community as a whole due to his inability to communicate past using expletives and racisthomophobic retorts to people looking at his twitter account will get you that far into seeing he has little care for ccp andor eve online past trolling and complaining this is not rumor milling it is verifiable there if you look and he has been banned from twitter for said thingsas to phasing out charities i can agree to that if they are not run by ccp like plex for good there is to much risk that they may be abused or misused highsec is another monster that in your own post you bring zero ideas forward as how to fix the problem past hoping to get with leaders to get ideas which if you dont have any of your own why should we vote for you if you are going to run for something on platform about working with people and yet alienating everyone around you with heatfleet is counter to everything your post is about you have not posted anything about your ideas or things you are going to push for in game past making it less safe and overly friendlyyou also attack the very people you will need to be working with in order to help change things in eve no matter your opinion you will have to work with them and your campaign thread attacks them making that much less likely they will look at any ideas you or people send to you for support
not sure how i would feel voting a guy into a community position that purposefully and actively trolls and pokes fun at other members of the community this is a guy who gladly and openly laughs at the idea of people attempting suicide stating that he wishes they had done the world a favor and just killed themselves hardly seems like the kind of person you would want representing the player basewhole heartily do no endorse this candidate
